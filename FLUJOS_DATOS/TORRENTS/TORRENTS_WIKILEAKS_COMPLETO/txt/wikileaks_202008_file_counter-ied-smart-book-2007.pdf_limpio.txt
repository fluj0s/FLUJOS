these groups are artillery projectiles or mortar rounds surface laid and hastily emplaced beside roadways emplacement activity may occur in stages whereby one insurgent delivers the munitio ns while another connects the firing pack at different time or in one session assessment it is assessed that the cell boundaries for insurgents often mirror that of tribal boundaries and that insurgent activity is often ssociated with power status or income with the family or community cell activity is decent ralized cf vehicles such as uparmored hmmwvs are reasonably adept in protecting vehicle occupants from this type of ied cf ttps in dealing with these types of devi ces are well developed and reasonably successful coordinated ied attacks describes more organized insurgents who carry out coordi nated complex attack complex attacks ca are defined as an ttack that involves more than one ied or an ied in conjunction with direct or indirect saf complex attack scenarios often involve significant antiiraqi forces ai f planning and are often planned in order to position cf within the kill zones of different weapons systems ca can often involve the use of secondary or tertiary ieds placed to target first responders to an ied attack assessment these attacks pose significant threat to cf however such attacks also provide cf with the opportunity to close with and kill the enemy counterambush drills ttps for the employment of qrf and the flexibility of is r assets are key elements in using ca to maximize cf advantage catastrophic ied attacks describes specialist ied cells which through the use of specific ttps have been able to inflict disproportionate casu alties amongst cf insur gents conducting these attacks operate as part of central ized structure with signifi cant increased range of operation which can span both bct and divisional boundaries the discipline and training demonstrated by these insurgen ts is significantly higher than that of the other attacks the weapon system employed by t hese cells include explo sively formed projectiles efps and deep buried ieds assessment cf can use the same cied techniques against insurgents att acks tier 1 hotspots

develop the situation in order to gain and maintain contact with the enemy and advance his unit by fire and maneu ver to ultimately kill or capture his adversaries maintain an offensive mindset be aware not target unclassified fouo 4 gta 9010046 sep 07 develop maintain situational awareness the hidden and fleeting nature of insurgent tac tics along with the cha llenge of conducting mili tary operations in urban terrain requires us ground forces to maintain continual heightened state of situational awareness sa good sa is key to seeing understanding and then acting on preattack indicators to deny the enemys advan tage of surprise counter ied principles be aware not target unclassified fouo 5 gta 9010046 sep 07 5 counter ied principles most ieds found before detonation are located by the naked eye every soldier should continuously scan their assigned sector in search of ied indica tors be deliberate speed greatly diminishes the likelihood of finding an ied before it finds you know wherewhen to use speed stay observant be aware not target unclassified fouo 6 gta 9010046 sep 07 counter ied principles avoid setting patterns watching and waiting the two tactical disciplines

line of site from the suspect area to cleared positions if cover cannot be obtained maximize distance from the device cordon the established danger area is to be cordoned off and an incident control point icp is to be established for follow on agencies the purpose of the cordon is to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the site for their own safety and the safety of the first respond ers to preserve the scene for further exploitation and to provide outward protection and security against comm andinitiated ieds when clearing personnel from the area random indi vidual checks should be

also be used to arm the ied time time ieds are designed to function after preset delay allowing the insurgent to make his escape or to target coalition forces which have created or are following set pattern there are various types including burning fuse mechanical and electronic command command initiated ieds allow the insurgent to choose the optimum moment of initiation they are normally used against tar gets that are in transit or where routine pat tern has been established the most common types include command wire cwied and radio controlled rcied victim operated victim operated ied voied is means of attacking an individual group of individuals or v ehicles an example is comeon scenario type of attack eg coali tion forces reacting to real or fabricated inci dent such as hoax ied

and short radio controlled lrct and mobilecell phone suicide devices command wire command wire ieds require insurgents to position trigger man i n rela tive proximity to the main charge be on the look out f or potential trigger men and other suspicious activity common enemy ttp is for in surgents to place secondary ied near the primary device buried unde r the com mand wire tracing out the command wire may lead you to kill zone where secondary device is initiated do not trace command wires leave it to specifically trained per sonnel proficient in the proper technique to do so do not cut command wires collapsing circuits may be incorpo rated resulting in detonation of the ied do not pull command wires pull type initiators may be incorpo rated resulting in detonation of the ied remember to

they may be initiated by command or mechanical time these include mortars rockets and improvised manpads underbelly these ieds are prepositioned below the sur face of the roadway with the intent to target the underbelly of the vehicle this is done by dig ging under the roadway or digging up the road surface and repairing it with the explosives emplaced this also allows the insurgent to

prior to em placement often place ieds in previously used ied sites ie potholes that are covered with dirt or sand position hoax or decoy ieds to draw and position cf into par ticular area or the kill box of real ied andor to observe cf reaction times and ttps regularly use secondary ieds to target convoy or cordon area as it regroups after an initial ied attack conceal ieds as damaged highway

the ied device phone in bogus reports of dead bodies in vehicles as means to lure cf ia isf into the kill zone of vbied use normal activity as cover to disguise their actions after an ied event in order to avoid being apprehended ie sheep h erd ing or fishing attack from overhead by suspending ieds from overpasses trees lighttelephone poles or overhead wires use multiple ieds daisychained together use dominating features to detonate ieds such as rooftops win dows dirt mounds vehicles mov ing or stationary vegetation canals alleyways etc use culverts to conceal large ieds use aiming
