to one or both houses of congress nd that expedite or put on fast track congressional consideration of certain measure or narrowly defined class of measures congress typically has enacted sets of ex pedited procedures into law when 1 the same law imposes deadline for congre ssional action on measure in one or both houses and 2 congress wants to ensure or at least increase the likelihood that the house and senate have an opportunity to vote on the measure before the deadline is reached most often these procedures have applied to action on joint resolutions by which congress can disapprove some action that the president or an executive branch official proposes to take in other cases congress has acted fasttrack procedures to expedite house and senate action on bill that is package proposal recommended by the president to address complex and multifaceted issue to achieve their purpose fasttrack procedures may 1 set time limit for the committee of jurisdiction to report the measure 2 prevent that committee from killing the measure by failing to act on it 3 make the measure privileged for floor consideration either immediat ely or after brief layove r period whether the measure was reported from the committee of jurisdiction or that committee was discharged 4 prohibit floor amendments including committee amendments and impose stringent time limits on debate during floor consideration of the measure and all questions relating to it and 5 provide for prompt floor consideration with little or debate of any identical companion b ill or resolution received from the other house not all sets of ex pedited procedures have in cluded all these provisions however failing to include any one of th em whether accidenta lly or deliberately can create significant opportunities for lay or inaction in one or both houses to greater or lesser degrees expedited procedures are inconsistent with at least five characteristics of the more conventional procedures of the house and senate fasttrack procedures 1 impinge on the ability of committees to control their agendas schedules and workloads 2 create exceptions to the general practice that the house and senate usually consider only measures th at have been approved by their committees 3 intrude on the power of voting majority on the house or senate to determine whether measure will be considered on the floor 4 reduce the authority of the majority party and its leaders to set the floor agenda and the daily floor schedule and 5 deny the house and senate the ability they usually have to set conditions for floor debate and amendment that are appropriate for each measure that is considered however the house to whic h set of expedited procedures applies is free to enforce amend waive suspend ignore or even repeal them as it sees fit just as if they were standing rules fasttrack procedures can be useful or necessary if congress is to reach certain legislative goals expedited procedures may be evaluated therefore by asking if orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98888when their utility justifies setting aside the congresss usual procedures and the principles and relationships these procedures

report was written by stanley bach formerly senior specialist in the legislative process at crs dr bach has since retired but the other listed author updated the report and is available to answer ques tions concerning its contents 2 the last section of this report is based on testimony presented by dr bach before the house rules committee during its 1984 hearings on the implications of and possible congressional responses to the supreme court decision in immigration and naturalization service v chadha in which the court held the legi slative veto to be unconstitutional house committee on rules legislative veto after chadha hearings 98th cong 2nd sess mar 22 1984fasttrack or expedited procedures their purposes elements and implications this report1 discusses certain provisions of law that commonly are known as fasttrack or expedited procedures they are so labeled because these statutory provisions contain special legi slative procedures that pply to one or both houses of congress and that expedite or put on fa st track congressional consideration of certain measure or narrowly defined class of measures this report first presents the nature purpose and elements of fasttr ack procedures then the report discusses some of the most important ways in which these procedures differ from the normal procedures of the house and senate nd therefore how the use of expedited procedures can affect the legislative process in congress2 most of the analysis that follows can be summarized by three basic points first fasttrack procedures are intended to achieve purpose that is not common to most other legislative procedures in c ongress second these expedited procedures differ from the more conventi onal procedures of the hous and senate in ways that affect the activities of congressional committees the relationship between committees and their parent chambers the prerogatives of the majority and the rights of the minority the locus of control over th floor schedule in the house and senate and the ability of individual representatives and senators to shape public policy through debate and amendmen ts third therefore fasttrack procedures may be evaluated by asking if or when their utility justifies setting aside the congresss usual procedures and the principles and re lationships these procedures embody purposes and elements of fasttrack procedures congress typically has enacted sets of ex pedited procedures into law when 1 the same law imposes deadline for congre ssional action on measure in one or both houses and 2 congress wants to ensure or at least increase the likelihood that the full membership of the hous and senate have an opport unity to vote on the measure before the deadline is reached most often these procedures have applied to congressional consideration of joint resolutions by which congress can disapprovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98888crs2 3 us house of representatives constitution jeffersons manual and rules of the house of representatives of the united states 108th congress 107th cong 2nd sess hdoc 107 284 2003 pp 10411042 hereafter cited as the house rules and manual 4 not all rulemaking provisions of law are sets of fasttrack procedures for example most of the requirements and prohibitions that govern the congressional budget process were enacted as parts of the congressional budget act of 1974 and the budget enforcement act of 1990and thereby nullify some action that the president or an executive branch official proposes to take in other cases congre ss has enacted fasttrack procedures to expedite house and senate action on bill that is package proposal recommended by the president to address complex and multifaceted issue examples of the latter are the expedited procedures for approvi ng or disapproving recommendations for military base closures and for enacting legislation to implement major international trade agreements fasttrack procedures can affect the pro cess of considering gislation in one or both houses in committee and on the floor this process normally is governed primarily by the standing rules of the house and senate ho wever congress does not adopt fasttrack procedures as additional parts of thes rules instead expedited procedures are written into law even though they affect only the internal organization and procedure of one or both houses of c ongress congress enacts them into law under the constitutional authority of each house to determine the rules of its proceedings these provisions of w which are known as rulemaking provisions have the same force and effect as any of the standing rules that the house or senate has adopt ed they are more binding on either house and more enforceable in court simply because they were enacted into law the house to which set of expedited pr ocedures applies is free to enforce amend waive suspend ignore or even repeal them as it sees fit just as if they were standing rules for example the house can modify or set aside any fasttrack procedures by adopting resolution that the house rules committee reports for that purpose in the senate the same procedures can be waived or superseded by unanimous consent agreement congress usually decides to enact rulemaking provisions into law rather than adopting them as rules because those provisions are inextricably related politically or procedur ally to other provisions of the same law that affect the actions of the pres ident or executive branch officials wellknown laws containing rulemakin g provisions include the war powers act of 1973 the trade act of 1974 the defe nse base closure and realignment act of 1990 and the congressional accountability act of 1995 the texts of these and other rulemaking provisions are reprinted in each edition of the house rules and manual3 some also appear in editions of the senate manual 4 expedited procedures are designed to sure or increase the likelihood that the house and senate will be able to act promptly on certa in bill or resolution or on certain kinds of measures for exampl congress may enact law giving department or agency the authority to make decision or issue regulation in the same law congress also ma give itself the opportunity to reject that decision orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98888crs3 regulation by enacting joint resolution of disapproval in such cases the law also is likely to contain deadline by wh ich congress should act on disapproval resolution as well as set of expedited procedures to make it more likely that congress will have th opportunity to vote on the resolution before the deadline is reached fasttrack procedures usually include pr ecise definitions of the measures for which those procedures can be used the statute creating the procedures may specify what kinds of provisions bill may or must include if it is to be eligible for consideration under the special legislative pr ocedures alternatively the expedited procedures may contain the exact text of what the measure usually joint resolution can provide if it is to qualify for expedite d consideration if the procedures can be used to consider various measures of the same kind the text of the bill creating those procedures may define the text of the meas ures and include one or more blanks that are to be filled in to identify for exam ple the specific regulation action or nation to which the measure applies for exam ple one provision of the trade act of 1974 as amended defines in the following terms the joint resolutions that congress can consider under certain fa sttrack procedures the term approval resolution means only joint resolution of the two houses of congress the matter after the re solving clause of which is as follows that the congress approves the extens ion of nondiscriminatory treatment with respect to the products of __________ transmitted by the president to the congress on __________ the first blank space being filled with the name of the country involved and the second blank space being filled with the appropriate date the purpose of expedited procedures is not to guarantee that one or more bills will become law but to help make it possible for the house and senate to vote on whether they should become law the normal legislative process in congress is timeconsuming process that most bills do not survive without fasttrack procedures there would be good reason to fear that the bills to which those procedures apply might not reach the stage at which the house and senate could vote on passing them or at least not by th deadline that statute imposes for congressional action to achieve their purpose therefore complete and effective sets of fasttrack procedures provide 1 that the bill or resolution to which they apply cannot be blocked or delayed unduly in co mmittee of either house 2 that the measure whether or not reported from committee can reach the house or senate floor promptly for considerati on 3 that the m easure cannot be amended in committee or on the floor and 4 that final fl oor vote within the time permitted cannot be prevented through delay in either house because measures s ubject to expedited procedures typically are not amendable there is less need to protect against possible delays that can occur in the process of resolving legislative differences between the house and the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98888crs4 translating these general requirements into specific procedural arrangements fasttrack procedures may 1 set time limit for the committee of jurisdiction to report the measure2 provide for automatic discharge of the committee from further consideration of the measure or for privileged motion to discharge the committee with debate or limited debate if the committee fails to report within the time limit 3 make the measure privileged for fl oor consideration ither immediately or after brief layover period whethe r the measure was reported from the committee of jurisdiction or that committee was discharged 4 prohibit floor amendments including committee amendments and impose stringent time limits on debate during floor consideration of the measure and all questions relating to it and 5 provide for prompt floor consider ation with little or debate of any identical companion bill or resolution from the other house not all sets of expedite d procedures have incl uded all these provisions however failing to include any one of th em whether accidenta lly or deliberately can create significant opportunities for lay or inaction in one or both houses as an example consider the provisions of s 2400 and hr 2621 of the 105 th congress reported respectively by the senate finance committee and the house ways and means committee primary purpose of these bills was to make available fasttrack procedures during house and nate consideration of bills to implement certain trade agreements for this purpose both bills proposed to apply to each trade implementing bill the expedited procedures previously enacted into law as section 151 of the trade act of 1974 as amended the procedures in section 151 include ll the five elements listed above and even contain the unusual requirement th at vote on final passage of trade implementing bill shall be ta ken in each house on or before the close of the 15th day of session after the committee or committees of jurisdiction either reported it or was discharged from considering it further this set of fasttrack procedures is complete and effective in that it probably would make it impossible for the opponents of trade implementing bill to prevent the house and senate from voting within the time permitted for cong ressional action on whether or not to pass it the expedited procedures do not guarantee that the hous or senate would pass the bill but they do guarantee that members of both houses would have the opportunity to do so s 2400 and hr 2621 also proposed to appl expedited procedures to two other kinds of measures resolutions affectin g for how long the president could make certain trade agreements and resolutions affecting whether particular trade implementing bill could be c onsidered under the fasttrack provisions of section 151 however the expedited procedures applicab to these resolutions were not quite as complete or effective as those governing consideration of trade implementing bills the fasttrack procedures for considering these resolutions did expedite house andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98888crs5 5 for review and discussion of the different fo rms of fasttrack procedures available in the house see crs report rl30599 expedited procedures in the house variations enacted into law senate action on themfor example by limiting debate on each such resolution and prohibiting amendments to it however these procedures did not require vote on final passage of the resolu tion and more important they did not ensure that the resolution would even reach the house or senate floor at all the fasttrack procedures applicable to one of these resolutions were to come into play only if and when the house or senate committee of jurisdiction chose to report it these procedures did not affect the authority of either committee to effectively kill the resolution by failing to act on it if the committee did fail to report the resolution the committee was not automati cally discharged nor did the expedited procedures provide for privileged motion to discharge thus the proposed fast track procedures did not increase the likelihood that the house or senate actually would vote on every resolution to which they applied the procedures only expedited house and senate action on resolutions that enjoyed committee support in this case it is very likely that the expedited procedures for considering the resolutions were left incomplete deliberately the committees that reported the two bills evidently wanted to retain veto power over the resolutions but they also wanted to expedite floor consideration of any such resolutions that the committees approved these fasttrack procedures were ineffective in the sense that they did not ensure or even make it more likely that qualifying resolution would reach the house or senate floor for debate and for final and timely vote however these procedures probably were effective in achieving the goal of expediting final floor votes on resolutions when the house or senate committee wanted those votes to take place as s 2400 and hr 2621 demonstrate fa sttrack provisions can take various forms it is not enough to know that th ere are special procedures for congress to follow in acting on certain bill or resoluti on instead it is necessary to examine the details of each set of fasttrack proce dures to understand how they supplant the conventional procedures of the house nd senate and precise ly what procedural effects they are likely to have5 expedited and conventional procedures some of the implications and consequences of enacting effective expedited procedures emerge from comparison of th procedures with more conventional house and senate procedures for acting on proposed legislation in some respects it is difficult to talk about conventional procedures first there are variations among the procedures that house and nate committees generally follow second the house has as many as five different ts of procedures for considering measures on the floor and the house regularly adopt s special rules that include procedural arrangements and restrictions that appl to individual measures and third the senate operates under special procedures when it invoke s cloture and the senate frequently sets aside many of its rules in favor of simple or complex procedural arrangements on which it agrees by unanimous consent httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98888crs6 nonetheless there are number of characteristics that typify the legislative processmore or less and more often than not in general expedited procedures are to greater or lesser degrees inconsistent with five of these characteristics 1 committees generally control their agendas schedules and workloads congress does not usually require its committees to act on certain measures or kinds of measures nor do the house nd senate usually impose deadlines for committee action there are exceptions to th is generalization just as there are exceptions to virtually every generaliza tion about how congress does its business for example secondary referrals of legisl ation in the house usually are accompanied by reporting deadlines and house committees are expected to act promptly on resolutions of inquiry however house and senate committees generally have the discretion to decide what measures within their jurisdictions they will consider when the committees will consider them and if and when they will report those measures back to the house or sena for floor consideration the appropriations and budget committees are exceptions in that they have responsibility for specific and limited sets of measures and they face time constraints imposed by congressional rules and the fiscal calendar however the timetable of the congressional budget process can be m odified waived or ignored as congress sees fit in general whether the measure at issue is public bill or whether it is simple resolution such as committee fundi ng resolution or house special rule the pressures on committees to act usually are grounded in political or governmental necessity not in pro cedural requirements consequently house and senate committees generally are able to set their own agendas establish their own priorities and control their own workloads committees make these decisions within fairly broad and generally accepted limits c ongressional rules should be followed whenever possi ble government activities should not be halted for lack of necessary legislative action and key presidential proposals and intense public concerns should receive h earing still these constraints leave committees with considerable latitude for ac tion and inaction and it is by inaction that committees make one of their most important contributions to the legislative process as they separate the relatively fe w measures that in their judgment should receive floor action from the many more that should not by contrast expedited procedures generally deprive committees of the control they normally enjoy over their agendas and schedules effective expedited procedures typically set time limit for committee action and provide for automatic discharge or privileged motion to discharge if the committee fails to act within the deadline thus expedited procedures confront committee with the choice between acting within an imposed deadline or having the measure taken away from it furthermore the timing of committee action is determined largely by when the executive branch acts or when meas ure is introduced the committee does not control when the clock begins to run on the limited time during which it is expected to act the effect of expedited procedures on committees workload also can be significant depending of course on how frequently th ey can be and are invokedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98888crs7 2 the house and senate generally consider only measures that have been approved by their committees the control that committees normally exercise over their own activities is crucial because committee inaction often is conclusive agai n as general rule bill is likely to be moribund unless it recei ves favorable committee action in this context however there is significant difference between the house and the senate although the two houses give their co mmittees much the same discretion the house is more likely to abide by committee inaction or the timing of committee action if house committee fails to act on bill or fails to act quickly enough to satisfy its proponents they have relatively little recourse the discharge procedure is so difficult as to be last resort nd the house has amended its rules to make it more difficult for members to propose po licy initiatives in the form of limitation amendments to appropriations bills the house rules committee has the authority to propose special rule for floor cons ideration of bill that the committee of jurisdiction has yet to report however the rules committee has been reluctant to use this authority sometimes called its power of extraction the rules committee also has been reluctant to propose waiving the houses germaneness rule so that the text of one bill can be offered as floor amendment to another measure on an entirely different subject by contrast the rules of the senate result in less deference to committee agenda and scheduling decisions if senate committee fails to report measure the text of that bill or resolution can be offere d as nongermane floor amendment to most other measures although the fact th at the committee of jurisdiction has not considered the amendment can be persuasive argument against it alternatively the text of bill that remains in committ ee may be reintroduced as new measure and placed directly on the senates calendar of legislative business with precisely the same procedural standing it would have had if it had been referred to committee and then reported however motion to call up the bill on the floor may well be opposed by some or all of the committee s members in short while committee inaction in the senate is significant imp ediment to legislative action it is not as difficult an obstacle to surmount or circumvent as it is in the house notwithstanding these differences betw een the house and senate the usual practice and expectation in both houses is that the measures considered on the floor are measures that have been selected or developed and then studied and approved by the committee or committees of jurisdicti on effective expediting procedures on the other hand alter the normal implications and consequences of committee inaction on measure instead of meaning the death of bill or resolution inaction means that committee may lose much of its cont rol over the measure which can reach the floor anyway the prospect of automa tic discharge or privileged motion to discharge is strong incentive for committee to act even if its action takes the form of an adverse report and recomme ndation that the measure not pass underlying the more usual procedures of the house and to lesser extent those of the senate is the fact that more measures are introduced than can possibly be considered on the floor from this fact follows the presumption that some considerable deference is due to the judgments of the standing committees as theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98888crs8 screen the measures referred to them effective expediting procedures are at odds with this presumption in that they permit certain measures to reach the floor because of the general class to which they bel ong not because of committee judgments about their individual merits 3 voting majority of representative s or senators generally can determine whether measure will be considered on the floor although the lack of committee action nor mally can determine which bills will not reach the house or senate floor the com mittees normally ca nnot compel floor consideration of the measures they have re ported favorably as general rule voting majorities of the house and senate retain ultimate control of their floor schedules at least as defined by the measures they consider in the house majority can prevent bill or resolution from being considered by means such as defeating special rule from the rules committee for considering the measure or in theory at least by other means such as defeating the motion to resolve into committee of the whole to consider privileged general appropriations bill or by raising the question of consideration and voting against considering the measure under the calendar wednesday rule for example motions to suspend the rules are an exception of sorts the house cannot decline to consider b ill that is brought to the floor under the suspension pro cedure however passing bill by this procedure requires twothirds vote so there usually is little point in considering bill under suspension if it does not clearly enjoy support by majority of members regarding the most complicated and controversial bills the rules committee is responsible for recommending an order of business through the special rules it reports yet it remains for the entire house by majority vote to accept or reject each such resolution the situation in the senate is complicated by the absence of devices to terminate debate by majority vote consequently the votes of 60 senators may be required to invoke cloture on motions to consider bills though most measures reach the senate floor by unanimous consent still even if simple voting majority in the senate cannot always call up the measures on which it wishes to act simple majority can prevent consideration of measuresbut not nongermane amendmentson which it prefers not to act given the rights of senato rs to debate and thereby delay action and natural desire of the majority party leadership to use limited floor time efficiently and productively the intense opposition of one senato r or small minority of senators may be sufficient to postpone floor consideration of bill temporarily or even indefinitely in this respect the differences betw een expedited and more conventional procedures lie not in the measures that the house and senate must consider but in the votes that members can be made to cast expedited procedures generally do not pr ovide for automatic or mandatory floor consideration of the measures to which they apply instead these procedures generally make in order privileged moti on to consider on which there can be only limited debate or deba at all either house still can vote not to consider the measure but vote for or against c onsideration has clear and obvious policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98888crs9 implications bill or resolution that is not considered cannot be passed unless as an amendment to another measure so decision by rollcall vote not to consider measure does not protect representatives or senators against the need to take public position on the issue the measure addresses the difference between these and more common procedures lies in the fact that the house or senate usually is not even presented with measure or motion to consider it unless there is reasonable presumption that majority is prepared to pass it under expedited procedures ther is greater likelihood that members will be presented with measures or at least vot relating to them that majority may prefer not to confront the reason for this difference lies in the implications of expedited procedures for majority party control over floor scheduling 4 setting the floor agenda and the daily schedule generally is prerogative of the majority party acting through its leadership by and large the majority party leadership of the house and senate enjoy at least negative control over the floor ag enda although any senator may move to consider any measure on the legislative calendar such motions or the equivalent unanimous consent requests act ually are made only by the ma jority leader or another senator acting at his behest or with his concurrence it is by this means that the majority leader can exercise some control over the daily floor schedule and the more longterm legislative agenda if other senators did not defer to the majority leader in this regard the conduct of business on the senate floor would become far less predictable to the detriment of all senators and the expedient tran saction of essential or important business in the house the rules committee is very unlikely to report special rule for bill or resolution when the majority part leadership actively opposes consideration of that measure also although va riety of matters are privileged for floor consideration it is the responsibility of th committee and party leaders to arrange specific dates and times for thei r consideration in the case of motions to suspend the rules the speaker has the discretionary pow er to decide if and when such motion can be made on the floor even when member wishes to call up privileged motion or measure on the floor the speaker often can retain considerable discretion over the daily floor schedule by deferring its consideration for one or more days or even by using his power of recognition to permit another member to call up different privileged matter instead the agenda control of the majority party leaders is more effective as negative than as an affirmative power as genera l matter these leaders in either house are better able to prevent consideration of measures they oppose than to secure consideration of measures they support and there are limits on their negative power in the senate the majority leader can prevent or delay senate floor consideration of measures but his control over the issues that reach the senate floor is severely limited by the right of senators to propos nongermane amendments in the house it is possible in theory at least for measures to reach the floor through the houses discharge or calendar we dnesday procedures even over the opposition of the speaker and the other majority party leaders httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98888crs10 to secure floor action on contentious b ills the leaders in each house require the support of at least majority vote on the floor in the senate this takes the form of majority vote on the debatable motion to proceed to consideration of bill when unanimous consent to consider it ca nnot be obtained should the motion be filibustered minimum of 60 votes is requi red to invoke cloture on the motion in the house scheduling most contentious b ills for floor action requires the support of majority on the rules committee to report special rules for considering them which in todays house rarely is pr oblem for the majority party leaders and majority votes on the floor to adopt th resolutions the speaker does have unilateral discretion to allow the house to consider specific bills under suspension of the rules however the house usua lly does not consider bills under suspension in the face of widespread minority part opposition because passage of bill under suspension requires enough minority party support to produce twothirds majority vote even within these limits the majority party leaders in each house exercise powerful influence if not control ove r the floor schedule and agenda it is noteworthy when they cannot arrange for consideration of bill they support or when they cannot block floor action on bill they oppose by contrast expedited procedures tend to undermine majority party leadership control over what business the house and senate transact on the floor in the house fasttrack procedures also bypass the rules committees responsibilities fo r the order of business on the floor expedited procedures often make the bills and resolutions to which they apply privileged business even if such measure has not been reported by the committee of jurisdiction unlike most other privile ged measures in the house precisely because expedited procedures are designed to ensure an opportunity for floor action within limited time period there is strong presumption that an expedited measure should be scheduled for consideration by th leadership if it is not some rule making statutes allow it to be called up by any member of either party whether or not at the direction of the committee of jurisdiction other expedited procedures make in order nondebatable motion to consider bill or resolution in the latter case the house or senate can vote agains t considering the measure in question but the majority party leaders cannot control whether or when this vote will take place furthermore the timing of floor action under fasttrack procedures is constrained by the date of the executive action that triggers those procedures and by the deadline imposed by statute for congressional action 5 the house and senate generally can set conditions for floor debate and amendment that are appropriate for each measure that they consider the standing rules and precedents of each house specify the procedures for debate and amendment that are to govern consideration of measures on the floor however each chamber has one or more ways in which it can modify these procedures in the senate cloture can be invoked if necessary more often the senate sets aside its genera l rules by unanimous consen t in favor of negotiated agreement concerning one amendment or even the entire process of considering measure in the house the rules committ ee reports special rules to supplement or supplant certain general rules of the hous efor example by specifying the length and control of general deba by restricting or expanding the range of floorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98888crs11 amendments that are in order and by expediting final action in the house after the committee of the whole rises and reports the house also has available the procedures under suspension of the rules as an alternative to considering measures in committee of the whole or in the house under the onehour rule by such means the house and senate can and often do adjust their floor procedures to suit the characteristics of the specific measures before them some bills require more time for debate and more opportunity for amendment than others and congresss procedures allow each house to take such differences into account expedited procedures on the ot her hand typically do not per mit this kind of flexibility though it bears repeating that th house can adopt special rule from the rules committee that supersedes or revises fasttrack procedures as they would apply to specific measure more often than not these procedures set limits on debate and prohibit all floor amendments these restrictions may be necessary given the deadlines for congressional action and the purpose of most measures considered under fasttrack proceduresnamely to appr ove or disapprove specific actions regulations or legislative proposals proposed by the execu tive branch however the same period for debate may not be appr opriate for all measures c onsidered under the expediting procedures of the same statute furthe rmore these restrictions usually permit congress only to approve or disapprove but not to modify by amendment the proposed executive policy except through new statute that does not enjoy the advantages of the expedited procedures when expedited procedures apply to m easures other than joint resolutions of approval or disapproval thei r constraints on floor consideration can be even more important for instance the procedures of the budget act governing senate floor action on reconciliation b ills impose both time limitations on debate and germaneness requirement on amendments that would not apply to such bill if the senate were to consider it under its normal rules on the one hand the debate limitations prevent senators from filibustering reconciliation bill on the other hand the germaneness requirement limits th floor amendments that senators can offer to such bill even relevant amen dments that propose to achieve comparable savings by somewhat differe nt though related means similarly the expedited procedures in the trade act of 1974 discussed above that provide for house and senate consideration of bills to implement major trade agreements prevent congress from adopting any amendments to certain bills the president proposes for this reason the st atute that makes the expedited procedures available also requires an elaborate pro cess of consultation and negotiation between executive branch officials and the appropriate congressional committees in an attempt to ensure that c ongressional preferences which cannot be expressed through floor amendments are taken into account wh such an implementation bill is being drafted it bears emphasizing that there are exceptions to each of the five generalizations discussed here yet these generalizations do identify typical characteristics of the legislative process in congress in significant ways effective sets of expedited procedures are inconsistent with thes characteristics they impose unusualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98888crs12 requirements on standing committees both as to what measures house and senate committees should consider and when committ ees should consider them fasttrack procedures also take from the standing committees especially in the house one of their most important powers the power to do nothing and thereby prevent measures from coming to the floor for debate and passage fasttrack procedures also create an additional and major class of privileged measuresmeasures that deal with wide array of subjects and that can vary considerably in importancethat enjoy pr iority access to the floor in both houses consideration of these measures can be brought to vote on the house and senate floor even over the opposition of the committees of jurisdiction furthermore any member of either party usually can propose that the house or senate consider one of these privileged measures if it is not sc heduled through the normal practices and prerogatives of the majority party and its leaders finally measures that the house and senate considers under expedited procedures gene rally are subject to limited debate and amendments the result is to prevent or severely limit representatives and senators in exercising two of thei r most valued rights as legislators conclusion congress has enacted fasttrack procedures in recognition of the fact that more conventional procedures in the house and senate generally are not welldesigned to ensure that certain measures move fro m introduction to conc lusive floor action within relatively short periods of time whether or when the house or senate votes on measure usually depends on 1 agenda decisions made by the committee of jurisdiction 2 the schedule that the committee sets in light of the preferences of its members and the competing demands on its time and attenti on 3 action in the house by the rules committee in reporting special rule to govern house floor consideration of the measure unless th house considers it instead under suspension of the rules and the prospects in the senate for limiting floor debate and amending activity by unanimous consent 4 floor scheduling decisions usually made by the majority party leadership in cooperation with the appr opriate committee leaders and 5 the interest of members in debating and amending the measure expediting procedures can reduce or avoid the uncertainties that so often result from these factors fasttrack procedures can protect against the usual consequences of committee inaction they can enable any member to force floor vote on considering measure and they assure prompt disposition of the measure if the house or senate does consider it because effective fa sttrack procedures limit floor debate and preclude amendments whether ge rmane or not these procedures probably have greater consequences for the senate than for the house given the historic importance to the senate and the strategi c importance to senators of the right to filibuster and to
