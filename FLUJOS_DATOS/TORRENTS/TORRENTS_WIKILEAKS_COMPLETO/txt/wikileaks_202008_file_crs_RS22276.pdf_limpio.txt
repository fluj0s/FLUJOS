both to construct ﬁve projects that would help restore speciﬁed sites in the coastal wetland ecosystem in louisiana and to continue planning several other related projects the state of louisiana and several federal agencies participated in the development of this pro gram this report introduces the program and more extensive restoration options that are being discussed in the wake of the hurricanes it also discusses whether this program if completed might have muted the impacts of the hurricanes congressional consideration are being informed by new information about the extent of

cong ressional consideration are being informed by new information about the extent of co astal wetland change that resulted from the hurricanes and further changes since the hurricanes struck this report will be updated introduction the widespread destruction caused by hurricanes katrina and rita altered the 109th congresss perspective on coastal louisiana restoration as it considered provisions in legislation eg s 728 and hr 2864 that w ould have authorized the us army corps of engineers corps to implement activities to slow the rate of coastal wetlands loss both bills developed before the hurricanes struck would have authorized funding to implement program that the corps d recommended in november 2004 feasibility report including 11 billion for activities to be initiated immedi ately and 09 billion for future work since the hurricanes more expansive options costing up to 14 billion and requiring up to three decades before they are fully implemented are also being considered as restoration gislation was enacted in the 109th congress the 110th congress is again addressing this issue in water resources development act wrda legislation that has passed bot h chambers hr 1495 and wa s sent to the white house on october 23 2007 the administration has indi cated that it intends to veto the bill of the initial 11 billion in the proposal congress was considering when the hurricanes struck 828 million was to complete planning and cons truct five projects called nearterm features the remainder of this initial authorization would have

monitoring program performance building small demonstration projects maximum cost of 25 million per project expl oring options to use dredged materials to create wetlands and continued pl anning of 10 additional proj ects that would have had to be authorized at future date finally additional funding would have been provided to study six less defined possible program elements for the future termed largescale long term coastal restoration cepts hr 2864 had been approved by the house on july 25 2005 while s 728 had been reported by th senate environmen t and public works committee on april 26 2005 after the hurricanes struck congre ss provided 96 million in fy2006 defense appropriations pl 106148 for activities to reduce threats to new orleans by improving coastal wetlands leaving open the potential for wide range of legislative actions in the future the projects and most other major elements of these proposals can be found in the cu rrent version of hr 1495 which s been sent to the white house for more information on the propose d corps program see crs report rs22110 coastal louisiana ecosystem restor ation the recommended corps plan by jeffrey zinn for information on authorizin g legislation see crs report rl33504 water resources development act wrda army corps of engineers authorization issues coordinated by cole t carter the national research counc il was asked to review th corps recommended plan it recognized that these hurricanes which st ruck after the report was largely completed will likely lead to reconsidera tion of some plan components it concluded that while most of the individual projects are sound they ar not comprehensive response to wetlands loss it calls for the development of detailed map showing th desired landscape of coastal louisiana that would serve as the basis for selecting future actions the lack of synergy among projects in this plan sts with another corps largescale ecosystem construction and restoration program in the south florida everglades where success depends on completing all the in terrelated prog ram components1 background the corps recommendations for projects to restore some wetlands and slow wetland losses in november 2004 is the most recent of many such proposals offered over the past four decades shortly after the rapid rate of coastal wetlands loss was first documented it is now estimated that more than 12 milli on acres of wetlands an area approximately the size of delaware has been converted to open water since the 1930s the remaining wetlands cover about 35 million acres an area slightly larger than connecticut the us geological survey estimated before the hurri canes that an additi onal 448000 acres could be lost by 2050 if additiona l restoration projects are initia ted if the corps program is implemented it timated that net wetla nd losses would be reduced to 170000 acres by 2050 these estimates do not appear to account for major but unpredictable hurricane events these losses have been caused by combination of human activities and natural factors that have been documented in many reports by the corps and others proposalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22276crs3 2 us army corps of engineers louisiana coastal area lca ecosystem restoration study final report new orleans november 2004 p mr 61to respond to these losses have centered on rebuilding the regions coastal wetlands in ways that could reduce the ecological economic and social costs one cost receiving far more attention today is the role that wetlands can play in absorbing storm surges and thereby decreasing flood elevations and muting the force of wave energy the corps current recommended program includes projects centered in the wetlands south and southwest of new orleans projects are in the western portion of state where rita struck and few are east of new orleans where katrinas damage to coastal development and the environmen t was most concentrated in the corps analysis of the selected set of options and the alternative proposals include d in the november 2004 final report there is almost mention of hurricanes nor an analysis comparing how these proposals might mitigate the effects of major hurricane the distri ct engineer for new orleans did not mention hurricanes when he made his recommendations stating i am convinced that the lca louisiana coastal ar ea plan would begin to reverse the current trend of degradation of louisianas coas tal ecosystem support nationally significant living resources provide sustainable and di verse array of fish and wildlife habitats reduce nitrogen delivery to offshore gulf wa ters provide infrastructure protection and make progress towards mo re sustainable ecosystem2 while congress has not yet authorized an restoration program two prototype restoration projects davi s pond and caernarvon divers ions opened in 2005 and 1991 respectively had been initiated under ex isting authorities the primary purpose of both diversions is to introduce fresh water bearing sediment into the wetland areas and thereby reduce the salinity both restorations are located in the greater new orleans area along the main channel of the mississippi ri ver river water is periodically introduced into these sites which are large receptacl areas bounded by low levees as the water sinks into the ground or evaporates it leaves sediments and raises land elevation which in turn provides an environment in which we tland habitat can be reestablished these two diversions are planned to add about 50000 acres of wetlands over 50 years effects of recent hurrican on restorat ion planning in the wake of the 2005 hurricane season so supporters of re storation especially from within the state are calling for more substantial program than in the current legislation supporters emphasize that th hurricanes caused nationally significant disruptions especially to energy supplie s and bulk transportati on and therefore the restoration would have signif icant national benefits they are seeking consideration of 14 billion restoration effort th at had been laid out in the coast 2050 plan released in 1998 this corpsled planning effort resu lted in recommendations for 77 restoration strategies to be completed over 50 years th strategies would be distributed along the entire length of the louisianas coastal area but concentrated in the central coast south and southwest of new orleans the anticipated result from fully implementing these strategies would be to protect or restore almost 450000 acres of wetlands congress has not considered legislation authorizing the coast 2050 plan instead in 2000 the corps and the state began to velop more modest set of proposals forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22276crs4 projects that could be initiate d over 10year time period draft completed in october 2003 included several options with estimated costs that ranged between 43 billion and 147 billion however the administrations ffice of management and budget directed the corps to come up with less costly package of proposals in late 2003 that package is what congress was considering when the hurricanes struck effects of recent hurricanes on coastal louisiana documenting the full effect of the 2005 hurricane season on coastal louisiana will be long process coastal louisiana is an extremely flat and dynamic physical environment where major storm events can gr eatly alter the surface features especially wetlands beaches and barrier islands some portion of the losses caused by both storms were only temporary as wetla nd vegetation was fla ttened by storm surge and strong wind and coastal beach sand and sedime nt was redistributed by thes same forces in addition in some locations where the storm deposited sediment wetlands and beaches may emerge or expand us geological survey summary of wetland changes released in october 2006 estimates that almost 140000 acres of we tlands were convert ed to open water throughout the states coastal areas losse s were most extensive in breton sound southeast of new orleans this summary so points out that this loss is about 42 of the total losses previously pr edicted to take place between 2000 and 2050 periodic storms were included in making the calculation the wetlands were partially protected from ocean storms in central and eastern portions of coastal louisiana by thin ri bbon of coastal sand barriers and beaches along the shoreline these barrier systems were heavily damaged these barrier systems already had been deteriorating for many of the same reasons human and natural as the wetlands stabilization and restor ation of them is critical to successfully restoring the wetlands that they protect it may be particularly challenging to reestablish wetlands landward of where barriers were overtopped fl attened or bisected by new inlets that allow an influx of salt water over time some of these barriers may stabilize or rebuild in new locations others will require extensive restoration what if the restoration pr ogram had been completed before the hurricanes made landfall if the entire first phase of the restoration program had been completed that is if congress had authorized and the corps d completed the five initial projects recommended in the november 2004 corps report it may be that these investments would have had little effect on the pa ttern or extent of flooding or other storm damage around the city of new orleans with the possible exception of modifications to the mississippi river gulf outlet mrgo these projects likely would have had some mitigating effects on flood elevations and water flow velocities close to the projects sites but the magnitude of the effect would decline quickly as one moved away the stability of the levees and floodwalls around the city would not have been directly enhanced by any component of the restoration program so none of these pr ojects would have reduced the flooding in the city where the most severe damage occurred to the east of the city from hurricane katrina and in the western portion of the state from hurricane rita the restoration program would have had little activity relationships between the hurricane impacts on new orleans and coastal communitie s and the proposed re storation may helphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22276crs5 decision makers identify future restoration priorities if they choose to follow the recommendations in the 2005 nrc report the potential damage from any storm event and the role the restoration would play in muting those damages depends on specific characteristics of the storm event eg the storms intensity track and speed of moving the compone nts of the restoration effort and the status of each component damage ge nerally is most extensive along the east side of hurricane storm track in the gulf of mexico where the wind blows from south to north and the storm surge is most pronounced in the case of katrina the storm track was just east of new orleans and the highest storm surge and greatest damage was documented to the east of that track by contrast within 100 mile s of new orleans west and northwest for example in the nearby baton rouge area the damage was far less extensive some scientists have offered generic support for the restoration effort by pointing out that coastal wetlands cause friction to dampen storm surge and estimate that for every 27 miles of marsh this surge passes over its elevation is reduced by foot they also estimate that storm surge is reduced by f oot in adjacent inland areas for every square mile 640 acres of wetlands that are restored other scientis ts caution that these general relationships mask wide variability based on sitespecific and storm characteristics possible conclusion is that some restoration projects could ve great beneficial effect in mitigating the damage to coastal louisiana from storm events with certain characteristics and these benefits would be greatest near the projects however for hurricanes with many combinations of characteristics this specific set of projects may have done little to reduce the storms impacts in much of the greater new orleans area possible effect of the hurri canes on restoration efforts katrina had greater adverse effects on the wetlands being created at the diversion at caernarvon than at davis p ond the caernarvon area is timated to have lost bout 25000 wetland acres as the diversion is curre ntly operated it woul d take many decades to offset the lost acres if the diversion was enlarged or its operation modified to increase the inflow of sediments th restoration period could be shortened some are talking about goal of restoring 1000 to 2000 acres year the impact from the hurricanes has greatly expanded the range of thinking about restoration options one aspect of that expansion is that while all past rest oration planning has been in response to wetland losses and co astal degradation within louisiana neither hurricane respected political boundaries katrina caused exte nsive damage in coastal mississippi and alabama and rita caused less extensive damage in eastern texas these distributions of impact may create interest in considering restorati on program that would provide benefits across the central gulf coas t second aspect is renewed discussion of projects that would result in larger changes across coastal louisiana the national research council report for example discu sses both the third delta and the abandonment of the current delta in the context of providi ng more sediment for restoration third aspect is renewed interest in determining which projects would be most effective january 2006 report by group of recognized ex perts primarily from academia states that project priorities should be based on storm damage reduction and ecosystem restorationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22276crs6 3 working group for posthurricane pl anning for the louisiana coast new framework for planning the future of coastal l ouisiana after the hurricanes of 2005 final draftto develop sustainable coastal landscape3 this report endorse s the development of detailed project map that had been recommended in the nrc report even if the 110th congress authorizes substantial restoration effort many of the physical changes on the ground will not be in place for decades cons truction of the five projects for which authorization is currently pending is not anticipated to be completed for about decade after it is fully funded fo r diversion projects actual reestablishment of wetlands requires many additional years after the divers ion starts to operate beyond the initial five projects most of the others are much earlier in the planning process and therefore completion would be even further into the future if it is decided to follow the recommendation of the nrc the time line for this effort could be further extended ecosystem restoration goals may be in competition with other demands for federal resources generally and corps resources sp ecifically in coastal louisiana these demands include flood protection navigation improvements nd housing it may be too expensive to fully support all these goals at the same time for example how will policy and program responses to the flooding in ne w orleans be viewed in relation to the restoration effort it appears that little that was proposed in the water resources legislation in the 109th congress would have had much effect on alleviating the causes behind the levee failures or moderating the rate or pattern at which the city was subsequently flooded nor would the many additional projects that were in the coast 2050 plan be likely to have had significant mitig ating effect on the flooding associated with hurricane katrina if congress makes the protec tion or fortification of new orleans its highest priority then some financial and agency resources may be drawn away from other projects such as those in the restoration fforts that would cont ribute only indirectly to protecting the city such decision could re duce restoration efforts that could have more significant moderating effect on hurricanerelated threats to communities and resources south of the city and closer to th gulf if congress wishes to address both goals at the same time then it may also want to consider setting priorities among the protection activities it authorizes and funds which pending legislation does not do at minimum congress might consider asking the corps to examine how each of the restoration projects might mute future storm damage and whether there are some modifications that could be ma to pending projects that would further protect the city or other south louisiana communities congress directed the corps to develop options for posthurricane rebuilding plan called the louisiana coastal pr otection and restora tion plan in this plan announced in the march 3 2006 federal register the corps identified four combinations of structural and nonstructural measures that would prot ect coastal louisiana against category 5 storm central issues include 1 what role s restoration projects would play in such plan 2 how restoration project s would be integrated with structural measures and 3 how projects to protect the new orleans urba n area and to restore coastal louisiana could be most effectively integrated both versi ons of the pending legislation would create federalstate task force to examine th types of questions
