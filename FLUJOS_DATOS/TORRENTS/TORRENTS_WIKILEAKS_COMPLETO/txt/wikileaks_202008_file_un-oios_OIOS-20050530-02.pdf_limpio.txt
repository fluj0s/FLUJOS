oios review however and our interviews with desk staff it appears that there was an overlap in the functi ons of the head of desk and the senior desk officer it was suggest ed on several occasions that these two functions be merged to avoid an additional layer of bureaucracy the inspe ctor general also recommended this type of merger i n 1999 checkbldoiosreview of the job descriptions of head of desk and senior desk officer noted that they have simil ar responsibilities apart from the coaching of staff and ensuring smooth communication flow within the desk checkbldin oiosopinion from the information received ther is need to review the staffing structure of the desk to determine whether it is optimal to have both head of desk and senior desk officer for larger and more complicated operations the senior desk officer cou ld be at the p5 level and for smaller and more st able operations the position would stay at the p4 level if it is determined that in most cases neither positions re required the merging of these functions would simplify the desk structure and possibly increase the reactivity and efficiency of the desksto respond to the field checkbldoios also noted

found some trends in the distribution of resou rces but also some exceptions checkbldthe relation between the staffing levels and the bu dget seemed to be based on the following allocation formula two staff members for budgets below us 10 million about 6 staff members for budgets between us 25 and us 3 5 million and 7 staff members for budgets over us 60 million ho wever we noted the following square4europe desks 4 two persons for budget of us 17 million and 5 three persons for budget of us 3 3 million square4the southern africa operations desk with budget of us 34 million has 7 staff

outhern africa operations and more persons of conce rn yet their staffing consists of respectively 3 and 7 staff mem bers checkbldoios found that within the bureaux the total cost f staff per desk was correlated to the total budget most desks had staffing costs representing about 15 to 3 per cent of their budget there are notable exceptions as desks 1 and 2 of the europe bureau amounted to 6 per cent checkbldwhen comparing these ratios to the nature of the ac tivities and the type of support provided it appea rs that regions involving protection and lobbying tend to have high er ratios as they require more policy monitoring an d guidance at the headquarters level checkbldoperational desks focus more on the provision of go ods and services to the field thus require more fi nancial than

which reached us 425 million in 2002 without dedicated supply office r positioned in the desk square4oios appreciates the significant difference between the operations but the differences between the ty pes of staff required was not very clear checkbldthe afghanistan desk has senior resource manager p osition the functional overlap withthe senior desk officer was mentioned to oios as most of the resources der ive initiallyfrom special budget sb the monitori ng and reporting workload it induced may have justified th position inthe desk however the position was ext ended well after the operation was fully funded under the annu budget ab which probably increased the overla p of the remaining functions of the senior resource manager and the senior desk officer unhcr stated that

although it had us 74 mil lion special budget in 2004 did not have senior resource manager but instead financeproject control offi cer whether the decision to modify the administrat ive support from senior resource manager to project control of ficer withinthe iraq support unit resulted from ssons learned from the afghanistan desk was not clear checkbldthe bureau of caswaname did not agree that the iraq and afghan desks should be assessed using the same parameters in regard to the creation of project coordinator post instead of an senior resource mana ger since the iraq and afghan operations

checkbldoios noted that special unitdesk structures have b een created for operations in south eastern europe iraq and the sudan situation checkbldwhile oios appreciates the need for unhcr to be abl to react quickly to new situations and be flexibl to change it was stated to oios that the decision to create n ew desksstructures and take the responsibilities ut of the traditionaldesk were not

should have been done to determine the r easons why and to draw lessons learned for future s ituations checkbldin some cases in the past it appears that availab resources and donorsinterests have influenced t he size of special unit more than objective workload patterns in its reply to the draft report unhcr concurred t hat the donordrivenness of some special budgets applies to emergency desks as well checkbldoios noted that while the handbook for emergencies provides useful guidance on variety of activities such as procurement staffing levels supervision etc cl ear standardscriteria still

division of financial and support management the emergency and security service the division of human resources m anagement andthe msrp implementation teamin februa ry 2005 there was consensus that
