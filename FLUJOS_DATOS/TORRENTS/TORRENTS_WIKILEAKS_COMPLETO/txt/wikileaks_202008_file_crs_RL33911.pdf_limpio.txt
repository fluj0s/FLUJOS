security conditions continue to deteriorate in southcentral somalia despite some political progress and recent peace agreement between the somali transitional federal government tfg and the alliance for the relib eration of somalia ars group formed by former members of the islamic courts union i cu and somalis from different backgrounds the ouster from power of the icu by ethiopian forces in december 2006 created security vacuum that was soon occupied by the more radical elements of the icus military factions the moderate leadership of the icu became marginalized splintered and weakened over the past year us tfg and ethiopian officials labeled the entire leadership of the icu as extremist and terrorist in 2006 eighteen months later however the same officials supported the inclusion of some former icu members in unled peace process in mayjune 2008 tfg and ars officials met in djibouti under the auspices of the united nations officials from the united states europe the african union the arab league the organization of islamic conference and regional governments took part as observers during the talks in djibouti the parties agreed on wide range of issues including cessation of hostilities and commitment to find durable peace agreement 1 the parties agreed to support the deployment of united nations peacekeeping fo rce and the phased withdrawal of ethiopian forces from somalia the agreement however links the withdrawal of ethiopian forces with the deployment of peacekeeping force alt hough ethiopian forces have already withdrawn from some areas in addition in november 2008 the ethiopian government announced that its forces would pull out of somalia by the end of 2008 the parties also agreed to provide unhindered humanitarian access to civilians in need and to establish joint security committee to ensure implementation of security arrangements and create an interim joint security force 2 the parties established high level committee chaired by the united nations to deal with political justice and governance issues the djibouti agreement is complicated and has repeatedly been undermined by infighting within the tfg insecurity growing influence of insurgent groups and limited support by the international community the tfg forces are weak ineffective and seriously debilitated by defections over the past year an estimated 40 of the police force trained by the united nations left the force due to lack of payment some donor governments have withheld funds pledged to the tfg due to lack of transparency and human rights abuses infighting within the tfg especially between prime minister nur adde and president usuf also has weakened the tfg in november 2007 prime minister nur adde replaced ali m ghedi man seen by many somalis as ineffective and highly partisan prime minister nur adde who is seen by many somalis and somali observers as key actor to bridge the gap between the tfg and the opposition often clashed with president usuf in july 2008 the prime minister dismissed the mayor of mogadishu and governor of benadir region mohamed dheere because of mismanagement of funds in protest ten proyusuf ministers resigned triggering crisis

survive while many others have made these kinds of criminal activities lifetime profession since the collapse of the siad barre government in 1991 somalis have been principal victims of criminals

november to free crew members and ships still under the control of the pirates somali community leaders and regional analysts argue that the groups most capable and best positioned to handle the piracy problem are the islamic insurgents and the clan elders the islamic courts dealt with this problem effectively when they were in power according to senior leaders of the islamic courts and independent observers the islamic insurgents claim that they are opposed to these kinds of criminal activities for religious reasons the islamic leadership sees the piracy problem as source of concern because they fear that they could erroneously or deliberately linked to the piracy phenomenon and become targets of punitive action by the international community another option is to provide quick

the international community may consider engagement with the islamic insurgents and clan elders to deal with the political and security problems facing somalia according to some observers it is pivotal to strengthen the moderate elements of the islamic movements discretely most observers believe that the alshabaab can only be contained by another islamic movement supported by clan elders some of the most influential leaders in the alshabaab are on the and us terrorism list some observers argue that removing some of these individuals from the terrorism list in exchange for some concessions including an end to the insurgency and acceptance of negotiated settlement should be considered as an option one of the key players in facilitating the djibouti talks was somali man on united nations terrorism list according to officials that man is longer on the terrorism list some of the leaders in the alshabaab are determin ed to continue their military campaign and not inclined to participate in negotiations according to some experts targeted measures including sanctions and assassination of the most extreme elements of the alshabaab could pave the way for other moderate leaders to emerge however others believe that this option is likely to backfire in the short term and increase antiwestern violence another option is to refer some of these individuals to the international criminal court icc for war crimes the most effective way of containing the extremists most observers contend is to look for somaliled solution both political and military the tfg islamic courts somaliland puntland and other moderate somali forces could form coalition to contain the advances of the most extreme elements of the shabaab politically and militarily such coalition is likely to get the support of the somali population rather than peacekeeping force the coalition can be assisted by neighboring countries somaliled initiative would take away one of the most powerful justifications used by the alshabaab to wage war the presence of foreign forces unified regional approach is pivotal however most believe that eritrea has leverage over some of the influential islamic leaders some of whom are in eritrea the ars was founded in eritrea and some of its leaders are now engaged in the unled negotiation in djibouti

government bypassed the tfg and provided support to the warlords the same warlords who obstructed peace in somalia member of the tfg parliament told us congressional delegation in august 2006 that you cannot fight terrorism by supporting warlords19 in early june 2006 the forces of the islamic courts captured mogadishu forcing arpct militia to flee the capital the chairman of the islamic courts sharif shaykh ahmed stated that his group would negotiate with the tfg in response to accusations that the islamic courts union was associated with or had harbored international terrorist elements shaykh ahmed stated that we are not terrorists and we will not allow anyone to hijack the capital we have said hundreds of times that americas talk of terrorism in somalia is fabricated and serves suspicious political purposes 20 the forces of the islamic courts union strengthened and expanded areas under their control after the defeat of the warlords in mogadishu the isla mic courts forces captured the towns of jowhar and beledweyne in midjune 2006 moreover for the first time in years mogadishu became relatively peaceful and the islamic courts received support from the population in areas it controlled the level of support enjoyed by the islamic courts is difficult to measure although the group had constituencies from multiple subclans and had broad support among somali women according to somali sources in mogadis hu and islamic courts officials the people provided crucial support by feeding their forces and working with islamic courts officials in bringing peace and stability during the mogadishu fighting women supporters of icu played important roles since the islamic courts largely functioned as providers of social services the courts did not maintain large fighting force the warlords maintained robust force in different parts of mogadishu with heavy weapons and technicals machineguns mounted on pickup trucks the islamic courts group had only four technicals when the fighting erupted with qanyare and other warlords according to senior courts official the icu success in mogadishu effectively led to the collapse of the arpct and forced the warlords to flee negotiations between the transitional federal government and the islamic courts in sudan did not lead to major breakthrough although the talks ended speculation that the islamic courts rejected negotiations the islamic courts leaders stated that they would work with the baidoa based transitional government although disagreement on key issues remained in june 2006 the transitional parliament voted in favor of foreign peacekeeping force but this move was rejected by some islamic courts leaders as being unnecessary and counterproductive earlier in 2005 the african union had approved proposal for uganda and sudan to deploy peacekeeping force to somalia under the auspices of the igad the deployment did not take place in large part because of the refusal of the united nations security council to remove united nations arms embargo on somalia the bush administration did not support the lifting of the arms embargo although the united nations security council did provide the necessary exemption in december 2006 in midjune an international somalia contact group consisting of the united states norway united kingdom sweden italy tanzania and the european union was formed and met to discuss the unfolding somalia crisis the united nations the african union the arab league and igad were also invited as observers the contact group did not invite somalias

concern that these countries are engaged in activities in support of or against some groups in somalia in press release after its first meeting the contact group stated that the goal of the international contact group will be to encourage positive political developments and engagement with actors inside somali to support the implementation of the transitional federal charter and institutions the contact group will seek to support efforts within the framework of the transitional federal institutions to address the humanitarian needs of the somali people establish effective governance and stability and address the international communitys concern regarding terrorism meanwhile in early january 2007 the international contact group on somalia issued another communique strongly urging that it is essential that an inclusive process of political dialogue and reconciliation embracing representative clan religious business civil society womens and other political groups who reject violence and extremism be launched without delay the islamic courts while well received by the people in the areas the courts controlled received bad press coverage especially in the west the courts activities were often characterized as extremist and jihadist the icu was accused of shutting down cinemas and prohibiting women from working some of these measures were taken by the courts although for different reasons and not because of the courts alleged jihadist and extremist ideology for example movies were banned in the morning in response to requests from parents because somali children were going to movies in the morning instead of school 21 the ban on television did not take place except for restrictions on watching soccer games late at night according to islamic courts officials and somali residents in mogadishu this measure was reportedly taken because of disturbances and fighting late at night there is evidence to support the allegation that women were prohibited from working islamic courts officials point out th at in the short time they were in power they did more than restore law and order properties taken by warlords were returned to the rightful owners for example the family of president yusuf reportedly returned to mogadishu after almost sixteen years when the courts restored orde r in the capital according to an islamic courts official most important they argue they gave hope to the people of somalia that after over decade of violence they can live in peace

courts sharif sheik ahmed was never replaced by aweys some observers argued that referring to aweys as the leader of the courts was deliberately designed by some groups and governments to give the courts bad image the leadership of the islamic courts remained largely under the control of religious scholars and academics see below the focus by some observers and officials on three individuals aweys hassan alturki and aden ayro may have been to show the islamic courts as group controlled and influenced by these individuals alturki man born in the ethnically somali ogaden region of ethiopia was listed by the bush administration as terrorist because of his membership in ittihad according to courts officials alturki did not even hold leadership position within the organization both aweys and alturki were placed on the list because of their membership in alittihad there is public record to support that these individuals were engaged in terrorist activities against us or western interests ayros role within the courts was highly exaggerated since he did not have leadership position in the organization ayro was often referred to as the leader of the shibaab the youth although there is evidence to support that he was the leader of that group ayro was suspected of killing four aid workers in the breakaway region of somaliland as well as somali scholar in mogadishu named abdulqadir yahya in may 2008 ayro was killed in us air strike since the killing of ayro the insurgency has intensified its attacks and is now in control of many parts of southcentral somalia

onlf leaders cracked down on the organization and moved the ethiopian somali region capital from gode to jijiga central government stronghold members of the onlf fled to somalia and were embraced by

approved peace plan proposed by the government of djibouti in may 2000 the somali reconciliation conference opened in arta djibouti in which 400 delegates took part for several months of deliberation the arta process was boycotted by several powerful warlords as well as the governments of somaliland and puntland on august 13 2000 participants agreed to the creation of transitional national government tng and transitional national assembly tna on august 26 2000 participants nominated abdulqassim salad hassan as president of the tng in october 2002 the intergovernmental authority for development launched another peace process led by the government of kenya an estimated 350 delegates from different regions of somalia participated in the opening session of the conference in the kenyan town of eldoret the government of somaliland boycotted the conference in the first phase of the conference the parties signed temporary ceasefire and agreed to respect and honor the outcome of the conference the parties further agreed to establish federal system of government and committed themselves to fight terrorism in september 2003 the parties agreed on transitional national charter paving the way for national unity government in august 2004 new transitional somali parliament was inaugurated in kenya the 275 member parliament consists of the major political factions and seems to represent all the major clans of somalia the transitional charter allocated 61 seats for the major four clans and 31 seats for the small clans the charter also allocated 12 of the seats to women the charter accepted islam as the national religion and agreed that sharia law would be the basis of national legislation in fact previous somali constitutions had similar provisions in october 2004 the somali transitional parliament elected abdullahi yusuf ahmed as the new president of somalia the swearing in ceremony was attended by 11 heads of government from african countries and representatives from regional organizations and the united nations in november 2004 president abdullahi yusuf ahmed appointed professor ali mohamed gedi as prime minister the transitional government however was not able to function effectively or move to mogadishu in large part due to opposition from the warlords in mogadishu even though some of these warlords signed the agreement and were ministers in the government the inability of the transitional government to establish effective control allowed warlords and clan factions to dominate many parts of somalia until late december 2006 some observers contend that the defeat of the warlords by the islamic courts paved the way for the establishment of central authority in mogadishu

and some somali groups have expressed concern over the years about the spread of islamic fundamentalism in somalia in the mid1990s islamic courts began to emerge in parts of the country especially in the capital of mogadishu these courts functioned as local governments and often enforced decisions by using their own islamic militia members of the alittihad militia see background below reportedly provided the bulk of the security forces for these courts in the areas aiai had presence the absence of central authority in somalia created an environment conducive to the proliferation of armed factions throughout the country ethiopian security forces invaded somalia on number of occasions to disrupt the activities of alittihad and its allies or in support of certain armed factions somali factions including the socalled islamic groups often go through realignments or simply disappear from the scene very little is known about the leadership or organizational structure of these groups including alittihad there have been three known islamic groups in somalia whose prominence has alternately waxed and waned alittihad alislamiya mentioned below alislah reform and altabligh conveyers of gods work in 1995 group called jihad islam led by sheikh abbas bin omar emerged in mogadishu and gave the two main warlords general mohamed farah aideed and ali mahdi an ultimatum to end their factional fighting the group claimed at that time that it maintained offices in several countries including yemen pakistan kenya and sudan not much was heard subsequently from jihad alislam although group of somalis later formed the sharia islamic law implementation club sic in 1996 sics principal objective was to establish sharia courts throughout the country some members of the mogadishubased former transitional national government tng reportedly were key players in the establishment of these courts very little is known about alislah although it is perceived as group dominated by hawiye clan businessmen according to the state departments 2006 country reports on terrorism while numerous islamist groups engaged in broad range of activities operate inside somalia few of these organizations have any known links to terrorist activities movements such as harakat alislah alislah ahlu sunna wal jamaa aswj and majma ulimadda islaamka ee soomaaliya majma sought power by political rather than violent means and pursued political action via missionary or charity work missionary islamists such as followers of the tablighi sect and the new salafis generally renounce explicit political activism other islamist organizations became providers of basic health education and commercial services and were perceived by some as pursuing strategy to take political power us officials have long expressed concern about the presence of known terrorist individuals in east africa some observers contend that somalia is being used as transit and hiding place by some of these individuals including haroon fa zul the leader of the 1998 and 2002 bombings saleh nabhan and talha alsudani but somali group has been directly linked to any terrorist attacks against the us or its allies

most active and at one point most successful of all the islamic groups alittihad is an islamic group whose principal ideology was to establish an islamic state and to bring law and order by utilizing the islamic court system founded in the late 1980s and early 1990s alittihad unsuccessfully sought to replace clan and warlord politics with an islamic state in the early 1990s alittihad had modest successes for example it administered territories under its control in the south but alittihad never emerged as major military or political force in somalia the clanbased groups and factions led by warlords in mogadishu are secular and have been at odds with alittihad even though some of these groups maintained tactical alliances from time to time with alittihad alittihads failure to maintain control over territories and spread its ideology led to shift in strategy in the mid1990s alittihad abandoned its ambition to spread its ideology through military means and began to concentrate on providing social services to communities through islamic schools and health care centers alittihads social activities and religious objectives in somalia seemed inconsistent with its activities in support of armed groups in the somaliinhabited region of ethiopia in ethiopia ittihad was reportedly engaged in military activities in support of ethnic somalis several anti ethiopian groups are active in the somali region and alittihad cooperated with these groups in carrying out attacks against ethiopian target s in 1999 the ogaden islamic union under the leadership of muhammad muallem omar abdi the somali peoples liberation front under the leadership of ahmed ali ismail and the western somali liberation front under the leadership of muhammad haji ibrahim hussein formed coalition called the united front for the liberation of western somalia their term for the somaliinhabited region of ethiopia 22 the ogaden national liberation front was engaged in military activities in the region and in the past formed alliances with other ethiopian opposition groups many somali watchers believe that alittihads strength was highly exaggerated and that information about its alleged links with international terrorist organizations is unreliable the state departments country reports on terrorism stated in 2006 that in recent years the existence of coherent entity operating as aiai alittihad has become difficult to prove there is reliable information or pattern of behavior to suggest that alittihad had an international agenda as was the case with the national islamic front nif government of sudan some observers note that if alittihad had clear internationallyoriented agenda its obvious ally in the region would be the nif regime in sudan or the sudanesebacked eritrean islamic jihad the sudanese regime did back regional extremist groups and international terrorist organizations but there was apparent relationship between the nif and alittihad many somalis often refer to alittihads social services and the peace and stability that prevailed in the areas it controlled in late september 2001 the bush administration added alittihad to list of terrorismrelated entities whose assets were frozen by an executive order bush administration officials accused alittihad of links with qaeda the administration did not publicly offer evidence supporting its allegations but some officials asserted that links between aiai and qaeda date back to the us presence in somalia during operation re store hope 19921994 this assertion however seems inconsistent with the reality on the ground at that time according to some observers then the dominant players in mogadishu were the warlords and not alittihad in early november 22 foreign broadcast information services fbis islamists regroup

businesses in the united states operated by albarakaat companies the bush administration ordered the assets of albarakaat frozen because of its alleged links to qaeda us officials however later seemed to back off from their earlier assertion that barakaat and individuals associated with the mone transfer business sector are directly linked to qaeda in september 2002 us officials cleared three somalis and three albarakaat branches accused of ties with qaeda the three individuals and businesses were removed from the us treasury department list of terrorist supporters and their assets were also unfrozen nonetheless the bush administration remains concerned about terrorist activities in somalia although attacks against us interests have been carried out by any known somali groups the
