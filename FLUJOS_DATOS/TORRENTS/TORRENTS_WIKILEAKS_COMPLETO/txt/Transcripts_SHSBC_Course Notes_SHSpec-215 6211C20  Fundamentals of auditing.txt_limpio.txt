6211c20 shspec215 fundamentals of auditing there are probably thousands of rules you could go by in auditing but the way to audit has only few fundamental basic rules without which auditing does not occur these are the senior data of auditing 1 auditing is third dynamic activity 2 the basis of it is communication 3 audit the pc in front of you violate those and you have had it matter how many other rules you are following never neglect those few little fundamentals an auditor can forget about communication and sit there as an individuated island in this case matter what is right about what he does he wont be auditing the pc dont be first dynamic using communication to audit book or nothing if the auditor and the pc are group and if they are in communication and the auditor is auditing the pc in front of him then auditing will occur and results will be obtained one day all of sudden long blue spark hits you and you say to yourself maybe if i ask the pc i can find out and communication starts to occur what st hill graduate misses when he gets back into the field is any feeling that auditing can happen people dont know that there is right way to audit also st hill graduates have gotten over being nervous or selfconscious about auditing if you overlook these few little fundamentals of auditing you then need thousands of rules to handle whatever comes up there is right way to audit described above relatively muzzled auditing uniformity of sessions these are desirable if an auditor is going to add bunch of nonsense into the lineup but muzzled auditing is just curative measure to prevent people who dont know the above basics from adding nonsense that has nothing to do with auditing the other part of the situation is that the human race knows nothing of third dynamic activities or communication what passes for communication in the wog world is unduplicatable there are completed cycles of communication and communication consists exclusively of dispersed mishmash of invalidation and evaluation the rules about q and tr4 and host of others are to keep these aberrated habits out of the session if you didnt have tr4 the green auditor would slip right into thinkthink figurefigure evaluation invalidation etc none of these have anything to do with the communication cycle compute should not be part of the doingness of the auditor cf the old definition of an auditor one who listens and computes in hcob 26may59 man who invented scientology the answer to the pcs origination that black is white is thank you it is not oh it isnt or thats neat thought or whatever every time the pc asks you to do something it is because you have done instead of acknowledged when the pc originated the pc has begun to control you you have driven him out of session and into thoughts about the pt environment by not letting communication cycle occur to the degree that you break down the communication cycle you break down the third dynamic activity you individuate the pc and after that he starts running the session he has gone on selfaudit you will have trouble with the pc in direct ratio to the number of times you have not permitted the pc to originate because the pc is aberrated it is very easy to individuate him it is quite trick to keep the pc from individuating and going on selfaudit as the pc gets better he is less susceptible to individuation his thinkingness should get more under the auditors control as he goes along if the pc gets interrupted by the auditor such that his communication cycle keeps getting messed up his thinkingness will get less and less under auditor control the number of times that you have to get the midruds in is direct index of the amount of thinkingness that pc individuated from the session has been engaging in that is how the auditing third dynamic gets broken down into two first dynamics two first dynamics do not make third dynamic they make games condition an auditors perception is not the perception of an individual looking at another individual it is third dynamic perception there is knowingness about whether the pc is in session or not that an auditor will have when he is genuinely perceptive or intuitive an auditors perceptivity is bad to the degree that he departs from the third dynamic back to the first dynamic thetans communicate on the same wavelengths used in space opera you can spot an arc break before the pc knows he has it if you are attuned to this form of communication you used to know and recognize other thetans by their feeling or wavelength and not by their bodies dolls know each other despite not having names as rule it is done by direct perception you can forge passport but try to forge wavelength this is not mest communication and it doesnt require or use mest or even wavelengths as via esp investigators like rhine err by testing esp against mest and by entering proof into the computations proof is one of the most aberrative buttons on the track if you walk through forest with gun concealed in your pocket you will not see bird or squirrel why because you are emanating menace as long as you have the gun and the game gets the communication even if the scientist doesnt the animals dont have to see the gun some thetans evidently emanate more than other thetans this is also true of pcs you apparently get more of relay from some than from others this is fascinating subject as long as you dont pull it down into mest through the button called proof we tried to process people along this line the biggest indication we have that it exists is the effect of auditing on unaudited third parties say pc is having trouble with person b we process he doesnt have any communication with b yet the problem with b evaporates furthermore frequently b often then tries to communicate with this is so true that you could legitimately chew out as auditor for not having solved bs problem with similarly an ri will always produce trouble for you if you are deathly afraid of oil companies rest assured that you will get bum stock short changed etc process the pc and the oil company will stop giving the pc hard time there is then perception factor but when the individual is in games condition on the third or fourth dynamic say with women he cant perceive perception cant bridge across games gap so the auditor makes mess of it every time he audits women ones perception in such case inverts and one reads good wave as bad one or vice versa the auditor cant perceive what is happening so he dubs it in he writes script in session he thinks and figures etc the pc is an enemy and therefore the auditor doesnt dare to confront or read him the more the auditor is in this state the less reliable perception there is and the more substitute perception you will find taking the form of think think substitute perception look dont think direct perception only gets invalidated by those who are to some degree in games condition with what they are trying to audit or perceive they cant confront so they cant perceive so they do think instead of look they figure it all out you have to figure out the way the gpm goes it is complicated and aberration doesnt emanate so you need the meter as an aid but as far as the pc is concerned you should be able to read him pretty directly but if you cant confront him if you dont want to if you dont want anything to do with him you are going to get substitute in there and that substitute is think and youre going to go into consideration of what is going on and you get script writing at its worst the auditor sees an arc break when there isnt one he doesnt see one when it is present etc tension and complicatedness in session divides the auditors attention and cuts down auditor perception thereby impairing his performance if the auditor takes some weird action you know that his perception dropped out the session will be as clumsy as with the sort of limitation of perception that occurs when one gives demonstration session and has ones attention split up lrh has experienced that he flubs in tv demonstrations more often than normally so that gives him some reality on what less perceptive auditor lives with when you dont acknowledge the pcs origination he will cut down his transmission power which will make it that much harder for you to perceive him he will also go off on selfaudit so you get two individuals conducting disrelated activity one fellow is busy nulling the list and the other fellow is trying to keep his rudiments in the pc tends to individuate to the degree that you q and with him and prevent him from blowing something by not just letting him get it off and acknowledging lot of auditors think that if the pc mentions something it means that you have to do something about it so that the pc can blow it the fact that you say or do something in response to pcs origination or anybodys origination tells him that he hasnt gotten it off he hasnt blown it it is all communication activity when something is fully communicated and the communication cycle is complete it is blown the degree that pc cant blow things is the degree that he has been q and ad with after you have and ad three or four times in the session what is the use of trying to patch it up now you have to have rules to cure the arc break what the hell were you doing getting an arc break in the first place the rules for getting out of swamps are lrhs and with auditors who got into them through not knowing fundamentals an arc break occurs fifteen to ninety minutes before most auditors perceive it and then they try to clean up the arc break that has just happened which is the wrong one to be cleaning up it is inexcusable for the pc to find out that he has an arc break before the auditor does where is the auditor what is wrong with the auditors perception when the pc mired as he is in the bank can perceive better than the alert auditor the pc never forgives this because it proves to him conclusively that the auditor has individuated and that he is not in third dynamic situation and doesnt have an auditor it is unforgivable because the pc doesnt forgive it if that is what your auditing is like you wont have sessions you will have dogs breakfasts but if you are alert you will find out ages before the pc does that something is wrong dont harass the pc when there is nothing wrong but if your own perception is up and the pc doesnt feel right to you just get in 2wc with him to find out how it is going and persist enough to be sure without badgering him there is nothing wrong with making mistake in session the only thing that is unforgivable is for the pc to catch it before you do perception then comes above technical perfection because you can always handle mistake if you find out about it before the pc does eg the auditor says is something going on there just light 2wc the pc says auditor well did you have thought of some kind there pc i well actually yes you used the wrong command that is ok because you spotted it first before it turned into an arc break that the pc incidently would have attributed to something later in the session if you hadnt spotted it at its inception if the pc could be relied on to spot the correct source of an arc break by himself he wouldnt need an auditor at all because he would just blow his arc breaks by inspection if he has got one he has misassigned it qed the degree of the apparent arc break is related to the number of unobserved arc breaks that have preceded it the first arc break in session is always quite previous to where the pc thinks it is this is true of lists where the pain turns on before the pc notices it the pc is always late because the bank is instantaneous and he isnt he wrongly attributes what is happening to ask him to think anything at all is miraculous if he knew what was going on he wouldnt need an auditor the communication cycle of homo sapiens consists of 1 i originate 2 you invalidate 3 i notis an auditing session is based on far simpler communication cycle than homo sapiens imagines you have to audit the pc in front of you not the meter the final step of matching up the items must be done by the pc not the meter if you go on the basis of if the pc said it it isnt true you are again being homo sap there are some things on which the pc isnt right he is never right on misemotional point but on what the score is and on whether it is the right item yes he can tell you that correctly you could assess list without the meter if you did it very carefully asking the pc where the pain was there is substitute for putting the pc in session and auditing him if you get tangled up in all the rules it is just that many rules between you and the pc that are forbidding auditing if those rules are used to prevent third dynamic to interrupt or upset communication cycle or to get out of auditing the pc in front of you then those rules are not for that session there are many styles of auditing but there is substitute for auditing what is auditing to the pc it is alleviation of his upsets and reaching his basic purposes and doing down the gpm he wont let you near his bank and he wont forgive you if you dont run it out nevertheless if he is making gains and getting someplace the pc will take anything off of you on the other hand your auditing could be the last word in technical perfection but if you are not using it to get somewhere with the pc he will be arc broken all the way there is right way to audit it is directly straightforwardly the good auditor uses the tools that he has to get something done the bad auditor doesnt know that there is right way but thinks that there are thousands of right ways and that he has to dream up new one in session that is just another way to figurefigure your way out of giving session the more you add to the basics of auditing the less it will work the auditor who audits smoothly by pattern gets the most done rules are valid but should never interferes with the three basics discussed in this lecture 1 auditing is third dynamic activity 2 the basis of it is communication 3 audit the pc in front of you
