on december 19 the house approved the appropriations c onference agreement by vote of 308106 and the authorization conference agreem ent by vote of 37141 on december 21 the senate approved the conference agreement on the defense authorization bill and it approved the appropriations conferen ce agreement by 930 though only after removing from the bill provision to allow oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge the senate also approved by vote of 4845 an enrolling resolution sconres 74 instructing the clerk of the house to enroll the bill without the anwr provisions the hous approved the enrolling resolution on december 22 clearing the bill for the presid ent the appropriations bill not only provides funding for the depar tment of defense but it is also vehicle for other

headlines highlights of congressional action brief overview of major i ssues in the defense bills headline issues that have emerged in action on the defense bills include oil dr illing in the arct ic national wildlife refuge the conference agreement on the appropriations bill included provision to allow oil drilling in anwr measure that had been attached to the budget reconciliation bill but that was rejected in the house the provision allocated projected revenue s to alaska katrina relief and the liheap energy program opponents of anwr drilling resisted the measure in the senate and in key test vote on december 21 the senate refused to invoke cloture on the appropriations conference report by vote of 56 44 with 60 votes required the senate then passed th appropriations confer ence report minus the anwr provison and approved by vote of 4845 an enrolling resolution to instruct the clerk of the house to remove the anwrhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs2 provision from the defense bill the house approved the resolution on december 22 thus clearing the appropriations bill without anwr drilling for the president other measures added to the defense appropriations bill along with anwr drilling the defens appropriations bill became vehicle for several pending cong ressional measures including 29 billion reallocation of funds for ka trina relief and reconstruction 38 b illion measure for avian flu preparedness and 1 across theboard cut in fy2006 appropria tions totaling 85 billion all of these measures are included in the enacted bill cuts in defense spending in the defense appropriations bill the housepassed defense appropria tions bill trimmed 3 billion from the administration request and the defense appropriations bill as passed by the senate trimmed 7 billion leaving those amounts available for nondefense appropria tions the cuts did not include significant reductions in major w eapons programs but instead came mainly from eliminating funds that the committees found unnecessary to carry out request ed programs in personnel and operating accounts the largest re ductions in the military personnel accounts were for programs that were underexecuted in fy2005 congress has made similar cuts for the past couple of years in part it appears that expenses have b een financed through supplemental funds the largest reductions in the operation nd maintenance accounts were for depot maintenan ce workloads that are not needed because equipment is being used for the war and repair costs are being covered with supplementa l appropriations so though indirectly large emergency supplem ental funding has offset regular defense appropriations freeing up nonemergenc funds for non defense programs the white house statement of administration policy on the senate appropriations bill issued on september 30 objected to the senate reduction and warned of veto if the final appropriations bill significantly underfunds defense to avoid reduction in nonsecurity spe nding house and senate appropriators finally agreed to trim 44 billion from the request and they added 01 billion to the milita ry construction bill in measure attached to the defense appropriations bill congress also approved an acrosstheboard cut in all appropriations which trims an additional 41 billion from depar tment of defense funds so in all congress provided 84 billion less for dod than the administration had requested see table 2b prisoner abuse treatment of detainees became major issue in senate consideration of the defense authorization bill and

defense to establish uniform standards for detention and interro gation and senators mccain and graham proposed an amendment to provide statutory authority for the defense department to use milita ry tribunals to determine the status of detainees the formal white house statement of administration policy on the authorization bill warned of veto if the bill includes any measure that would establish commission on detainees or regulate t he detention treatment or trial of terrorists1 with action on the authorization bill delayed senator mccain offered an amendment to the defense appropriations bill that combined two of his authorization proposals on october 5 by vote of 909 the senate approved an amendment 1 to require the defense department to adhere to regulations in the army field manual on interrogations in stioning detainees under dod control or on dod facilities and 2 to prohibit any federal agency from engaging in cruel inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees subsequently when th senate resumed consideration of the defense authorization senator mccain offered the same measure as an amendment and it was accepted by voice vote on november 4 later senator graham withdrew his original proposal to provide statutory authority for tribunals to review the status of prisoners at guantanamo and offered revise d amendment that would require the secretary of defense to estab lish regulations for the tribunals require that the senior civilian in charge of tribunals be confirmed by the senate and allow only limite d court appeals of tribunal decisions this led to an extens ive debate about court oversight of the tribunal the senate rej ected an amendment by senator bingaman to allow court review of habeas corpus petitions senators graham and levin then agreed on and the senate approved compromise version of the graham amendment that expanded the range of potential cour t appeals of tribunals decisions the conference agreements on the authorization and appropriations

by vote of 128300 an amendment to th defense authorization bill by representative woolsey expressing the sense of congress that the president should develop plan to withdraw us forces from iraq in floor debate on the defense appropriations bill representative pelosi offered an amendment to require an administration report on measures of progress in iraq th at would permit withdrawal in effect an exit strategy the rules committee did not agree to protect the proposal from point of order however and it was subsequently ruled out of order as legislation on an appropriations bill on july 20 the house approved by vote of 291 137 an amendment to the foreign affair s authorization bill hr 2601 by representative roslehtinen stating that calls for an early withdrawal from iraq are counterproductive and that it is us policy to withdraw only when it is clear that united states national security and foreign policy goals relating to free and stable iraq have been or are about to be ach ieved the senate debated us iraq policy extensively when it resumed action on the authorization bill in november on november 15 the senate rejected levin amendment that would in effect have required the administration to establish schedule that w ould tie withdrawals of troops to progress in iraq but the senate ag reed to very modestly revised version of the levin amendment without the final provision on troop withdrawals as agreed to th amendment states that 2006 should be transition year in which iraqi security forces take on increasing responsibility for security and that this s hould lead to us troop withdrawals and it requires adminis tration reports on schedule for improved conditions in iraq that would permit the redeployment of us forces two days later on november 17 representative murtha the ranking democrat on the defense appropriations subcommittee opened new phase of the national debate about iraq policy when he called for redeploying us military forces out of iraq as soon as possible arguing that the us presence was making the security situation worse on november 18 following tumultuous debate the house rejected by vote of 4036 resolution hres 571 proposed by representative hunter calling for immediate withdrawal of troops from iraq the authorization conference agreement includes provision that makes minor changes in the senate statement of iraq policy the measure requires quarterly reports on progress in iraq and establishes policy that 2006 should be turning point in transferring responsibility to iraqi security forces the c onference provision removes senate reference to schedule for achieving specified measures of progress in iraq and substitutes requirement for plan the appropriations conference report so requires quarterly reports on progress in iraqhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs5 bridge fund for iraq and afghanistan operations t h housepassed authorization r ecommended 491 billion the senate authorization recommended 50 billi

appropriations can be provided ne xt year last year congress provided 25 billion one issue in h ouse action on the authorization was whether to strengthen reportin g requirements on the use of the money on equipment repair requi rements on troop levels and on the costs of operations in iraq the house agreed to modified amendment that requires reports on the allocation of funds on equipment and on military construction projects the appropriations conference agr eement provides 50 billion as bridge fund including 8 billion for weapons procurement the house had provided 29 billion and the senate 86 billion for procurement women in combat as part of an bloc amendment to the defense authorization bill the house approved measure proposed by armed services committee chairman duncan hunter that would require dod to notify congress 60 da ys in advance of implementing any changes in policy for assigning women to operational ground units the measure was substitute for provision in the committee reported version of the bill that would have 1 codified into law the pentagons 1994 policy that prohibits assigning women to units that engage in ground combat operations and 2 prohibited any changes in current assignments the full committee measure was in turn substitute for more restrictive subcommittee measure that would have prohibited assign ing women to some support units including units in which women currently serve that might accompany combat units into battle the authorization conference agreement reduces the requirement for advan ce notification to 30 days army and marine corps endstrength both the house authorization and the senate armed services committee added to statutory endstrength the house authorization added 10000 in endstrength to the army and 1000

issues for congress paramount issue in the fy2005 defens debate was whether congress should provide funding for operations in iraq and afghanistan before early in calendar year 2005 when the bush administration said it planned to request supplemental appropriations ultima tely congress provided 25 billi on for ongoing operations as bridge until it could act on fy2005 supplementa l funding after the turn of the year subsequently in may 2005 congress approved an additional 76 billion in supplemental appropriations to cover the remainder of fy20054 with action barely completed on fy2005 funding advance funding for operations in iraq and afghanistan again became an issue as congress took up the fy2006 budget in the fy2006 congressional budget resolution hconres 95 congress specifically exempted 50 bill ion in emergency spending for military contingency operations from potential point of order in the senate note this didhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs12 not in fact limit the amount congress coul d provide for iraq and afghanistan in fy2006 while the budget resolution specifically set aside 50 billion it also exempted any amount for military contingenc operations from spending limits in the house and any amount for any defense purpose in the senate under these provisions congress could ve provided more than 50 billion without triggering point of order either in the house of in the senate see below for detailed discussion as congress considered the fy2006 aut horization and appr opriations bills one issue was whether to provide another br idge fund for operations in fy2006 and if so how much or whether perhaps to provide the full estimated costs the appropriations conference agreem ent ultimately provided 50 billion number of other issues were also on the agenda in congress this year including whether congress should while not directly setting date for withdrawing from iraq require the administration to establish strategy and measures of progress that will lead to withdrawal whether the appropriations committ ees should trim defense funding in order to limit cuts in nonde fense discretionary programs whether congress should provide additional military personnel benefits including 1 greater access to dodprovided health insurance for nondeployed military reservists and their dependents and 2 permanently increased death gratuities and insurance whether congress should require substantial increase in active duty endstrength partic ularly in the army to ease pressures on the force caused by operations abroad whether congress should increase f unding for navy shipbuilding or should approve advance appropr iations or ot her novel funding mechanisms whether congress should accept or reject administration plans to retire an aircraft carrier and reduce the number of deployable carriers from 12 to 11 whether congress should approve the proposed termination of c 130j cargo aircraft procurement proposal the administration subsequently withdrew whether congress should approve the proposed termination after fy2008 of fa22 fighter procurement how congress should exercise oversight over number of majorweapons programs in which cost have grown or development has been delayed including the army future combat system missile defense the multiservice f35 joint strike fighter and number of spacelaunch and sa tellite systems whether congress should rest ructure priorities in the administrations missile fense development program how congress should oversee and fi nance army plans for far reaching reorganization of its combat forces to increase the number of deployable combat brigades and to turn brigades rather than divisions into the major unit of action in future operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs13 whether congress should take st eps to regulate the defense departments restructuring its civilian personnel system following congresss approval in the fy2004 national defense authorization act of the pentagons request for broad authority to reform civil service pay and performance rules whether congress should approve the defense departments requestfor changes in environmental ws and regulations governing military training in addition to changes congress approved in the fy2004 defense authorization whether congress should approve partment of energy plans to study new nuclear weapons incl uding the robust nuclear earth penetrator and whether congress should establish guidelines for the reliable replacement warhead program whether congress should require ch anges in dod policies affecting number of social issues incl uding the deployment of women in combat support units abortions at military facilities abroad and handling of sexual abuse cases whether congress should take any action to restrict military base closures even as the formal ba closure process was proceeding and whether congress should take an action on number of other issues including treatment of military detainees acquisition of tanker aircraft and strengthenin g of defense buy american requirements the following discussion provides backgr ound information on each of these issues and discusses congressi onal action to date iraq policy and troop withdrawals in 2005 congress began to debate meas ures aimed at establishing the conditions that would ultimately permit withdrawal of troops from iraq the administration and supporters of its iraq po licy insist that military operations in iraq are making progress and that political cond itions are improving but critics complain that it is difficult to see progress on key indicators of success including the number of attacks against us soldiers or elements of the new iraqi regime the number quality and reliability of trained iraqi secur ity forces the overall level of security in iraq and the state of iraqs economic infrast ructure one in congress so far has proposed measure would directly establ ish date for withdrawal from iraq administration supporters argue that it woul d be mistake to do so because it would allow regime opponents to plan for us exit and might dishearten regime supporters some critics of the us invasion nonetheless oppose withdrawal on different grounds having destroyed the previous regime some say the united states has an obligation to ensure that postoccupation iraq not descend into civil war but this year for the first time there have been efforts in congress to put pressure on the administration first to fine measurable indicators of progress or deterioration and second to define when progress might lead to us troop withdrawalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs14 5 yochi j dreazen us opens door for big pullback in iraq next year wall street journal july 28 2005 p 1congressional action on may 25 the house rejected by vote of 128300 an amendment to the defense authorization bill by representative woolsey stating the sense of congress that the president s hould develop plan as soon as practicable to provide for the withdrawal of united st ates armed forces from iraq and transmit the plan to congress later in debate on the defense appr opriations bill on june 20 house minority leader nancy pelosi proposed an amendmen t requiring that the president submit report to congress on strategy for success in iraq that identifies criteria to be used by the government of the united states to determine when it is appropriate to begin the withdrawal of united states armed forces from iraq the amendment required the report to include criteria for assessing iraqi security forces and for achieving required capabilities an estimate of the number of iraqi forces required to perform functions us and allied forces now perform the number of advisors needed to support the iraqi government and measur of political stability in iraq with milestones for progress the amendmen t did not require setting date for withdrawal the rules committee did not agree to exempt the amendment from house rule prohibiting legislation on an appropriations bill and the amendment was subsequently ruled out of order later on july 20 by vote of 291137 the house approved an amendment to the foreign affairs authorization bill hr 2601 by representative roslehtinen stating that calls for an early withdraw from iraq are counterproductive and that it is us policy to withdraw only when it is clear that united states national security and foreign policy goals relating to free nd stable iraq have been or are about to be achieved meanwhile on july 27 general george casey the commander of us forces in iraq commented that substantial withdraw als may begin as early as next spring or summer if progress continues5 subsequently genera l casey became less willing to project troop reductions the senate debated us iraq policy extensively when it resumed action on the authorization bill in november on n ovember 15 the senate rejected levin amendment that would in effect have re quired the administration to establish schedule that would tie withdrawals of tr oops to progress in iraq but the senate agreed to very modestly revised versi on of the levin amendment without the final provision on troop withdrawals as agr eed to the amendment states that 2006 should be trans ition year in which iraqi security forces take on increasing responsibility for security and that this s hould lead to us troop withdrawals and it requires administration repo rts on schedule for improved conditions in iraq that would permit the redeployment of us forces the authorization conference agreement includes the senate amendment with some changes the one substantive change is to remove any reference to schedule and replace it with planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs15 6 senator john

committee february 16 2005on november 17 representative john mu rtha the ranking democrat on the defense appropriations subco mmittee recast the national bate about iraq when he called for redeploying us forces out of ir aq as soon as practical his key argument was that the presence of us forces was ma king the security situation worse and that iraqi forces must take on the burden of co mbating the insurgency on november 18 in an effort to force vote against th murtha proposal house republicans brought up resolution by representative hunter h res 571 expressing the sense of the house calling for an immediate withdrawal from iraq house democrats including representative murtha generally denounced the measure as partisan ploy and it was rejected by vote of 4036 funding for iraq and afghanistan the fy2006 defense budget request di d not include funding for ongoing military operations in iraq and afghan istan the adminis tration bmitted supplemental fy2005 budget request to c ongress on february 14 2005 week after it submitted its regular fy2006 budget and in may congress agreed to provide 76 billion for military operations in iraq and afghanistan in fy 2005 the fy2006 regular request however covered only dods normal peacetime funding requirements administration officials said they again pl anned to request funding for iraq and afghanistan in fy2006 in s upplemental appropriations measure to be submitted early in 2006 should ongoing war costs be funded in regular or in supplemental appropriations key issue in congress was whether congress should continue to fund litary operations in iraq and afghanistan with supplemental appropriations or move these costs into the regular defense budget critics of using supplementals argue that th monthly costs of operations in iraq and afghanistan have long since become predic table and therefore belong in the regular defense budget they have also expressed concern about what appears to some to be an increasing number of programs being fi nanced in the supplemental but that do not fall within what is directly related to co sts of ongoing operations including costs of reorganizing the army and some weapons acquisition6 critics complain finally that because supplemental legislation tends to move through congress quickly there is little time for congress to exercise oversig ht and supplementals are not subject to review by the authorizing committees the administration continues to favor the use of supplementals to fund military operations in iraq and afghanistan for number of reasons secretary of defense rumsfeld has argued that supplemental ppropriations are prepared much closer to the time the funds are needed this allo ws for somewhat more accurate estimates of costs than in the regular budget cycl and more importantly quicker access to the needed funds7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs16 8 office of management and budget director joshua bolten testifying before the senate budget committee

operations ceased on february 9 2005 office of ma nagement and budget omb director joshua bolten told the senate budget committee that as budgeting matter it is very important that we not let war costs float into the base because then i think we will have been fiscally irresponsible in not preventing those costs from being permanently in the defense base8 one element of the debate is what precedents earlier operations provide in 2003 crs memo reported that the initial f unding for most conflicts from world war ii to korea to vietnam to the 1991 persian gulf war was generally provided through supplem ental appropriations9 that memo did not however address funding for wars afte r the initial phases on that question the precedents are mixed while the korean c onflict was financed mainly with supplementals world war ii and vietnam were funded both w ith supplementals and with regular appropriations in vietnam the admin istration first asked for 700 million supplemental for fy 1965 in may of 1965 then for 17 billion addition to the regular fy1966 defense appr opriations bill which was requested as budget amendment in the summer of 1965 and the n in january of 1966 as troop levels in southeast asia were climbing s upplemental of 123 billion for fy1966 and regular appropriations of 103 billion for fy1967 both requested when the fy1967 budget was submitted so in the case of vietnam the johns on administration asked for emergency supplementals when necessary but also requested funds in regular appropriations bills as soon as those bills were on th congressional agenda even though troop levels were in flux and the duration of the conflict could not be foreseen most recently crs reviewed precedents for f unding of ong oing military contingency operations in the 1990s crs reported that in action on the fy1996 defense appropriations bill congress on its own initiative decided to include funding for ongoing operations in southw est asia in regula r appropriations bills rather than in supplementals and it dir ected the administration to request funding for ongoing military operations in regular bills in the future subsequently in the fy1997 defense budget and in later requests the clint on administration included funding for ongoing operations including ope rations in southwest asia bosnia and kosovo in the regular defense budget10 congressional action in

the chairman of the defense appropriations subcommittee and senator warner the chairman of the armed services committee both supported the amendment the appropriations conference agreement includes the byrd amendment as statement of the sense of the senate if senator warner and senator steven s had subsequently chosen to propose funding for iraq and afghanistan in the regular fy2006 defense bills there were procedural hurdles in the way f unding caps in the fy2006 congressional budget resolution hconres 95 do not appear to be barrier to be permissible in view of caps on overall discretiona ry spending established by the budget resolution the appropriations bills would have to designate funding for operations abroad as either as defense emergency appropriations in th senate or as funding for contingency operations in support of the global war on terrorism in the house and for up to 50 billion in the senate see the box below for further explanation provisions of the fy2006 concurrent budget resolution hconres 95 permitting additional funding for overseas military contingency operations the budget resolution allows point of order to be made against provision in an appropriations bill that designates f unds as an emergency unless the funding meets certain restrictive criteri to constitute an emergency under 402c funding must be necessary essential or vital not merely useful or beneficial b sudden quickly coming into being and not building up over time c an urgent pressing and compelling need requiring immediate action d unforeseen unpredictabl and unanticipated and not permanent temporary in nature presumably point of order could apply against funding for iraq and afghanistan under that provision but other sections of the budget resolution essentially void that possibility under 402a in the house if funding is designated as being for contingency operations related to th global war on terrorism then caps on spending do not apply under 402b11 in the nate up to 50 billion for contingency operations in support of the global war on terrorism is specifi cally exempted from spending caps that would appears to limit additional funding for iraq and afghanistan to 50 billion but under 402b10 any discretionary appropriations for defense designated as emergency appropriations are exempted from point of order which ma kes the 50 billion figure moot so the budget resolution provides sp ecific restriction on the amounts that may be appropriated for military operations abroad the spending limits that the resolution establishes do not apply to additional funds for that purposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs18 that said in its markup of the fy2006 defense authorizati on bill the senate armed services committee provided 50 billi on

did not feature facetoface showdown over defense spending like the one last year but again as last year and as in the fy2004 budget in the end overa ll deficit pressures appear to have led the

progressively more severe over the next few years12 congressional action under section 302a of the congressional budget act the annual congressiona l budget resolution must specify the total amount of discretionary funds available to the ppropriations committees the committees are then required by section 302b to repor t back how those funds will be allocated among the various subcommittees these reports thus are known as the 302b allocations budget limits are enforced by establishing point of order against reported bill or an amendmen t to bill that would ex ceed each subcommittees 302b allocation though the full appropr iations committees may and often do revise the allocations over th course of the year so the 302b allocations are critical part of the appropriations process that

the defense to tal the allocation to the defense subcommittee assumed that the defense appropriations bill would include 5 billion of rescissions of prior year defense funds which can be applied to offset increases in fy2006 programs in the defens appropriations bill if so the 328 billion cut from the request would be more than offset by rescissions and there would be room for 172 billion increase in actual programs some may quibble with this argument one quibble is that there are often rescissions of prior year funds in all appropriations bills and they are normally applied as offsets to increases in new f unds elsewhere in each bill in effect the initial house 302b allocations require that defense resc issions be available partlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs22 to offset increases in total nondefe nse appropriations compared to the administrations request different quibbl is that defense rescissions may later be backfilled by increased emergency supplemental appropria tions later in the process the fy2004 omnibus appropriati ons bill for example rescinded 18 billion in prior year defense funds to offset nondefense amounts the iraqafghanistan emergency funding provisions of the fy2005 defense appropriations bill however repealed th rescission so in effect emergency defense appropriations were used to offset increased fy2004 nondefense funding the version of the defense appropriati ons bill that the house appropriations committee marked up on june 7 and the amended version passed on june 20 provided 3637 billion of which 3634 billion was for discretionary rather than mandatory programs equal to the initia l house 302b allocation and 328 billion below the request on june 9 the senate appropriations committee formally approved and released its initial 302b allocations th senate allocations trimmed 7 billion from the administration request for the fense bill and added 797 million for the military constructionveterans affairs subcommittee so in all the allocation provided 62 billion more for nondefense discretionary programs than the administration request by any standa rds dramatic shift of funds in later action on the defense appropriations bills both the house and the senate complied with the initial 302 b allocations the hous epassed appropr iations bill was 30 billion below the administration request and the senatepassed bill was 70 billion less neither bill however made deep cuts in overall funding for major weapons though both selectively trimmed so programs rather the cuts came mainly in military personnel in operation and maintenance nd in revolving fund accounts see table 2b above the difference between the house and senate on overall fense funding was key issue to be resolved in conferen ce negotiations on the defense appropriations bill for its part in its statement of administration policy on the senate bill the white house warned of veto if defense was cut substantially to pay for increased nondefense appropriations in the run up to the conference house and senate appropriators resolved the difference by agreeing on total closer to the house level on november 2 the house approved revi sed 302b estimates that reflect the compromise with the senate the senate reported its revised allocations on november 10 the revisions trim defens by 44 billion below the administration request this amount was reflected in the conference on the defense appropriations bill meanwhile the conference agreement on the military constructionva appropriations bill dded 01 billion for department of defense programs division b of the defense appropriati ons bill included an acrossth eboard cut of 1 or 85 billion in total nonemergency fy2006 appropr iations of that 41 billion is cut from the department of defense so in all congress cut 84 bi llion from the administrations original request for the department of defense dramatic reflection of the budget constraints being imposed by budget deficits and

defense authorization cong ress approved program to provide federal health insurance for specified periods of time to families of deactivated reservists who reenlist but congress rejected proposals to guarantee access to health insurance for all reservists this issue came up ag ain in the fy2006 authorization debate congressional action in the fy2005 supplemental appropriations bill hr 1268 congress approved 1 perm anent increase to 100000 in the death gratuity for service members killed the line of duty made retroactive to october 7 2001 2 payment of 150000 to survivors of service members killed in combat zones since october 7 2001 and 3 an increase in the maximum amount of insurance for service members from 250000 to 400000 these provisions apply only through september 30 2005 however in action on the supplemental the senate also approved measure to make up any loss in pay for federal employees who are called to active duty as members of the military reserves the house however di d not include such provision and the conference agreement rejected the senate measure this issue came up again in action on the fy2006 defense appropriations bill in the senate see belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs24 in their versions of the fy2006 defens authorization both the house and the senate armed services committee provided permanent increase in the death gratuity to 100000 and in the max imum life insurance benefit to 400000 the house armed services committee also approved an amendment in the full committee markup that would have made tricare gene rally available to military reservists the proposal was subject of extensive debate opponents complained about the cost and also argued that empl oyers might game the system in an effort to reduce their costs by reducing their in surance plans or otherwise encouraging employees to sign onto to tricare oppone nts also warned that federal employees who serve in the reserves would have an incentive to abandon the federal employee health benefit program fehbp and sign up for the cheaper tricare system which would drive up fehbp costs for othe rs proponents argued that reservists have earned the right to guaranteed health insurance in the committee the amendment was approved by vote of 3230 subsequently the committee approved routine measure that allows the chairman of the committee to delete provisions of the bill that would be subject to point of order for increasing mandatory spending above limits provided in the budget resolution when the congressional budget office provided an estimate that the provision would require an increase in mandatory expenditures committee chairman duncan hunter then deleted th tricare for reservists provision on the grounds that it would be subject of poi nt of order on the floor the rules committee did not agree to make in order an amendment to restore revised version of the plan on the floor representativ taylor subsequently proposed motion to recommit the bill to committee with instructions to restore the tricare for reservists provision with change that would have eliminated the mandatory spending impact of the measure that motion was defeated by vote of 211218 the senate however added provision provi ding tricare to reservists to the defense authorization bill on july 21 the senate approved grahamclinton amendment to allow all nondeployed re servists to enroll in tricare later in action on the defense appropr iations bill on september 29 the senate approved an amendment by senator durbin to make up any loss in pay for federal employees who are called to active duty as members of the military reserves and on november 9 the senate pproved an amendment to th defense authorization by senators bayh and durbin to replace income losses by reservists mobilized for more than 180 days or mobilized for more than 24 months out of 60 or mobilized within six months of previous activation in action on the authorization the senate also approved an amendment by nator reid to define vete rans unable to work as 100 disabled for purposes of eligibility for conc urrent receipt of military retired pay and veterans disability benefits the conference agreement on the defense authorization bill resolves all of this issues specifically the authorization permits reservist which includes members of the national guard

for mobilized federal employees increases in active duty endstrength for the past two years there has been vigorous debate both within congress and between the congress and the defense department about the size of the army and the marine corps many legislators have argued that the army especially is being stretched very thin by the need to rotate troops into iraq and that the number of ground troops should be increased subs tantially in last years defense authorization bill hr 4200 pl 108375 congress increased statutory army end strength by 20000 and marine corps endstrength by 3000 in fy2005 and importantly it established the increased totals as legal minimums the final bill also authorized but did not mandate additi onal increases of 10000 in the army and 6000 in the marine corps over the next four years it did not set them as minimums although the administration opposed the congressionally mandated end strength increases in substance the provisi on did not have much effect ever since the iraq war began the defense department has used standing authority to waive earlier endstrength limits and officials have said that they intend to keep an additional 30000 active duty troops in the fo rce through fy2006 in part to fill out units rotating to iraq and in part as buffer while the army carries out reorganization that will increase the number of deployable combat units so the defense department was alread planning to keep more additional troops in service than congress mandated moreover cong ress has not objected to funding the additional troops with supplemental appr opriations as the administration has requestedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs26 14 edward epstein support grows for beefing up us forces san francisco chronicle april 4 2005 p 1the underlying issue however is quite s ubstantive and it has very large long term budget implications rule of thum b is that an increase of 10000 troops adds at least 1 billion year in personnel co sts not including costs of equipping additional units the defe nse department sees the added 30000 troops as temporary measure many legislators however believe that the size of the army and marine corps and even of the navy and air force should increase even more and that the increases should be permanent in congress so far this year senators reed hagel mccain kerry and ot hers have proposed measur s 530 that would add 30000 troops to the army and 5000 to the marine corps in fy2006 in addition to the troops added in fy2005 in the house representatives tauscher skelton and others have proposed measure hr 1666 to add 30000 to the army 12000 to the marine corps 2000 to the navy and 1000 to the air force in fy2006 also in addition to the fy2005 increases some outside groups have proposed dding as many as 25000 troops per year to the force for the next several years14 since the proposed increases in fy2006 go far beyond the 30000 added troops the pentagon currently has in the force th issues is longer moot and the debate is about in effect permanent substantial and costly increases in the overall size of the force this the administration strongly resists secretary of defense rumsfeld in particular has opposed permanent increas arguing that much can be done and is already underway to restru cture forces to make up for the number of troops needed to fill out deployable combat units among other things rumsfeld wants to restructure the army to reduce noncombat positions and shift personnel into the combat arms moreover the pentagon has been attempting to transfer substantial numbers of jobs from military to civilian positions the administration argues that these measures should be fully implemented before coming to any conclusions about permanently adding to military endstrength congressional action in subcommittee markup of the defense authorization bill the house armed services committees personnel subcommittee added 10000 in endstrength to the army and 1000 to the marine corps in fy2006 the full committee and the full house subsequently approved that measure in its markup the senate armed services committee added 20000 to army endstrength in fy2006 see table 5 compared to the enacted fy2004 endstrength authorization as baseline the sena provision would add 40000 troops to the army and 3000 to the marine corps 13000 more than th 30000 dditional

to the lower end of that range if that much projected production rates grow over the next few years but only because the navy plans to ramp up production of the rela tively small littoral combat ship to five per year by fy2009 retiring chief of na val operations admir vernon clark has pointed to longterm rising shipbuilding costs as the main reason for the navys difficulties16 many members of congre ss particularly from shipbuilding states have expressed alarm about the low rate of navy shipbuilding particular issue has been navy proposal which was deferred by the under secretary of defense for acquisition to hold winnertakeall competition between the two surface combatant construction shipyards for the right to build all ddx destroyers rather than to divide the ships between two yard s as for ddg51 destroyers legislators fear that one shipyard would be fo rced to close under such strategy17 one possible response is for congre ss to increase the fy2006 shipbuilding budget by shifting funds from other programs navy officials and some legislators have also discussed using lternative funding mechanisms for navy ships as means of allowing more new ship construction to start within limited budget defense acquisition guidelines genera lly require full funding of weapons procurement appropriations are required to be suffici ent to finance the number of complete useable end items of syst ems congress has approved18 there are alternatives to the full funding policy however and these ar now being discussed actively for navy shipbuilding one possibility which congress has used for some ships in the past is incremental or split funding in whic h congress appropriate s only part of the money needed to complete ship and plans to appropriate the remainder in future years another is advan ce appropriations in which c ongress appropriates funds for the full cost of ship but delays the availa bility of part of all of the funds until the start of the next fiscal year while thes alternative funding mechanisms may smooth out annual navy shipbuilding numbers they will not allow significantly more shipshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs29 19 for full discussion see crs

146 to increase the resolu tions limit on the total amount of advance appropriations by 14 billion nd to allow advance appropr iations to be used for navy shipbuilding the amendment was never brought up on the floor however the conference report on the budget reso lution hconres 95 does not provide an increase in the original limit on advance appropriations though it does include navy shipbuilding in list of accounts for whic h advance appropriati ons may be provided in the senate congress may still provide advance appropriations for ships but only if other advance appropriations are reduced or if there is objection in the senate or if 60 senators vote to waive the limit later in the version of supplemental appropriations bill hr 1268 that the senate appropriations committee reported to the floor the committee included provision that prohibits funds made available in the supplem ental or in any prior acts to be used to implement winnertakeall strategy to acquire the ddx the conference agreement included the senate measure this did not however apply to future appropriations so the matter re mains at issue in action on fy2006 bills in subcommittee markup of the fy2006 defe nse authorization bill the house armed services committee subcommittee on projection forces took number of dramatic steps to restructure navy shi pbuilding the subcommittee added funds for three additional ships including 25 billion for 2 ddg51 destroyers and 384 million for an additional take dry cargo ship the subcommittee also provided 418 million an increase of 268 million to be gin construction of new lhar amphibious assault ship the subcommittee also took steps to rein in the costs of new ships most significantly it imposed cost ceiling of 17 billion on what it calls the next generation surface combatant since this applies to the ddx the navy will have to design less costly substitute destroyer the subcommittee also put cost cap on the logistics combat sh ip virginiaclass submarines and lhar and it required the navy to develop nextgeneration submarine that presumably will cost less than virginiaclass boats20 later in full committee markup the house armed services committee took steps to restore cvn21 procurement to the fy2007 plan rather than delay it to fy2008 as the navy proposed the committ ee approved an amendment to add 867 million for advanced procurement of the c nv21 but with requirement that the pentagon must certify that the extra money would allow the navy to begin production of the carrier in fy2007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs30 in stark contrast to the house the senate armed services committee did not radically restructure navy shipbuilding in its markup of the fy2006 authorization the committee added 175 million in partial funding for the lhar ship but otherwise did not increase the number of ships being built in fy2006 the committee also authorized cvn21 construc tion to begin in fy2007 the plan last year rather than in fy2008 as the navy now plans and provided an additional 867 million for the program on the ddx the committee indicated continuing support for the program by adding 50 million for dvance procurement of second ship and it provided that the funds are only availabl for production at second shipyard the committee specifically prohibited winnertakeall acquisition strategy for the ddx the house appropriations committ ee generally followed the house authorization though with some adjustment s as in the authorization the committee cut funds for the ddx and it added m oney for one take it added only one rather than two ddg51s however and it dded funds for two littoral combat ships instead so in all the committee added 4 ships to the request the committee added 50 million to the lhar request less than the authorization and urged the navy to request full funding for the cost of the ship in the future rather than spreading funding across several years the senate appropriations committee mainly followed the senate authorization it added 50 million for ddx for second ship added 867 million for cvn21 but eliminated 380 million for take construction due to cost increases and construction delays the appropriations conference agreement adds 62 million to accelerate the start of the cvn21 aircraft carrier to fy2007 provides f unding as requested for the ddx destroyer and adds 50 million for dvance procurement for second ship does not add funds for dditional ddg 51 destroyers cuts 100 million from the lha r amphibious ship program and as in the house adds 384 million for an additional take cargo ship funded in the national defense sealift fund account so in the end c ongress rejected the house ffort to terminate the ddx and build more ddg51s instead the aut horization conference agreement includes provision prohibiting acquisition of the ddx through single shipyard congress nonetheless remains concerne d about weapons cost growth the authorization conference agreement sets

controversial in congress one ement of the debate is whether it is wise to retire conventionally powered ship si nce the united states has long deployed one carrier in japan and japan has objected to visits by nuclearpowered ships in the past the navys other c onventionallypowered carrier the kitty hawk is scheduled for retirement in fy2008 congressional action in floor action on the fy2005 supplemental appropriations bill hr 1268 the sena approved by 5838 on april 20 2005 an amendment by senator warner sa 498 requi ring that funds provided to the navy in the supplemental be available for repair and maintenance to extend the service life of the kennedy and that prohibits funds in the s upplemental to be used to reduce the number of aircraft carriers below 12 until the quadrennial defense review qdr is submitted to congress the qdr is required later than february of next year the conference agreement approved the measure with minor changes an amendment that would have applied these re strictions to funding provided in prior acts was ruled out of order and the i ssue may well come up again in action on fy2006 bills in its markup of the fy2006 defense au thorization bill the senate armed services committee directed the navy to retain 12 carriers til 180 days after the completion of the quadrennial defense review and also directed the navy to perform maintenance nd repair of the uss john f kennedy to extend the life of the ship see crs report rl32731 navy aircraft carriers proposed retirement of uss john f kennedy issues and options for congress by ronald orourke the house armed services committee did not take any steps to keep the kennedy in service instead it barred furt her reductions in the carrier force by requiring the navy to maintain minimum of 11 deployable carriers the house appropriations committee did not address the issue the authorization conference agreement includes provision amending title 10 of the us code which governs the defe nse department to require that the navy keep 12 operational aircraft carriers in the combat force c130j aircraft termination pbd753 proposed some other cuts in ma jor weapons programs one decision though

which has had significant problems in meeting operationa l requirements both the dod inspector general and the dod director of operational testing ve issued reports that are quite critical of current safety and mission performance of the aircraft and it is now being used in only restricted roles the decision to terminate c130j procur ement was controve rsial in congress the c130 has historically had support not only from georgia where it is produced but from advocates of air national guard its all over the country where the aircraft is deployed for its part the defense partment from the start appeared somewhat less firm in its determin ation to terminate the c130j than on other pbd753 decisions shortly after the budget request was formally released in february senior pentagon officials said that the department planned to review its c130j decision in the course of examining overall air lift requirements21 finally just as the house armed services committee was beginni ng subcommittee markup of the fy2006 defense authorization secretary of defe nse rumsfeld sent letter to congress reversing the decision to terminate the production congressional action in floor action on the fy2005 supplemental hr 1268 the senate approved an amendment by senator chambliss to prohibit any funds provided in the act from being used to terminate the ckc130j contract the pentagons decision not to terminate c 130j production however left unresolved how to divide up fy2006 funding between the marine corps kc130j variant and the air force c130j it its markup of the fy2006 defense aut horization the sena armed services committee reduced marine kc130j procur ement from the 12 requested to 4 and shifted 735 million to the air force to buy 9 c130j airlift aircraft the house armed services committee also approved 4 kc130js and 9 c130js as did the house appropriations committee the sena appropriations pr ovides funds for 6 kc130js and 7 c130js the conference agreement on the defe nse

fighte r aircraft in the world in th future air force officials have continued to argue against the cuts insisting that the whole issue should be reviewed in the qdr but officials outside the air force have so far provided little encouragement congressional action while there has been some opposition to the fa22 cuts in congress there were related gislative proposals the planned cuts in funding for the program however do not begin until the fy2008 budget and production ceases only in fy2009 so ther remains some time to consider the programs fate none of the congressional defense committees significantly changed the program in fy2006 other programs with cost increases and schedule delays perennial issue for congress is wh at to do about programs that have consistently and

asked for funding both for tsat and for the renamed space radar congressional action the senate armed services committee airland subcommittee chaired by senator mccain has held number of hearings on the army future combat system fcs recently the army announced that it was planning to revise the type of contr act under which the fcs was being developed it will use more traditional contract to which standard acquisition regulations will apply in initial house armed services co mmittee subcommittee markup the fcs in particular was cut significantly in eff ect the fcs and some other programs that congress considers to be suffering from problems may end up being bill payers for increases in navy shipbuilding and some ot her accounts in contrast in its markup of the fy2006 defense authorization the senate armed services committee approved the full 34 billion requested for fcs in its full committee markup of the aut horization the house armed services committee trimmed fcs funding by 400 milli on and shifted some parts of the program from the fcs funding line to rd lines for more basic research the committee also reduced funds for the tr ansformational comm unications satellite tsat by 400 from 8385 million to 4358 million and for the spacebased radar by 1258 million from 2258 million to 1000 million finally the house armed services committee made some significant changes in acquisition laws in an effort to c ontrol weapons cost growth the committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs37 established conditions before development program may be approved for full scale system development and dem onstration sdd it also required closer monitoring of changes from original program base line cost estimates and perhaps most notably it mandated formal analysis of alternatives for any system that exceeds 15 cost growth the house appropriations committee generally followed the authorization bills recommendations it trimmed funding for the future combat system by about 400 million cut the tsat by 400 million and cut the spacebased radar by 126 milli on the committee also terminated the joint air to surf ace standoff missile jassm program the senate appropria

budget of more than 60 billion over the fy2006fy2011 period the administration is requesting 87 billion for missile defense development and pr ocurement in fy2006 pbd753 directed the missile defense agency to reduce planned funding by 5 billion over the sixyear period with cut of 1 billion in fy2006 and 800 million per year each year thereafter as result there have been some significant changes in the longterm development plan in fy2006 the biggest reduction is in funding for program known as the ballistic missile defense system interceptor program to develop highacceleration booster and warhead known as the kinetic energy interceptor kei congress trimmed funding for the kei last year and some have questioned whet her program aimed in large part at allowing interceptors to destroy enemy missiles in the boost phase is practical at all kei funding rema ins in future budget plans however missile defense is often matter of debate in congress key issue recently has been whether the testing program is ade quate in december 2002 the white house announced decision to accel erate deployment of an initial limitedcapability groundbased interceptor system to be ope rational by the fall of 2004 the missile defense agency is currently in the process of deploying 20 interceptor missiles in alaska and for test purposes in california but the defe nse department has not yet declared the system operational recent tests of the deployed missile and warhead have failed and the boosterwarhead combina tion that is being deployed has yet to tested successfully another recurrent issu in congress is whether funding for more longterm and uncertain technologies ch as spacebased interceptors should be reduced in favor of increased funding for more immediately deployable systems such as

the house rule on the authorization bill did not permit any additional amendments on missile defense funding or testing the committee b ill requires report comparing the airborne laser program and the

macgregor has proposed brigades of 5000 to 6000 troops which would be 30 continuedarmy modularization the army is undertaking wholesale reor ganization of its combat forces the reorganization is designed to create more flexible and more readily deployable force based primarily on separa modular brigades that can be deployed individually or in combination rather than on divisions composed of three combat brigades and associated support elements by the end of fy2007 the army plans to increase the number of deployable brigades in the ac tive duty force from 33 to at least 43 and possibly as many as 48 brigade units of action the army national guard will also be reorganized from force with 15 parate brigades and 19 divisional brigades into one with 33 deployable brigade units of action25 the army now projects that its modular ization plan will cost 48 billion over the sevenyear fy2005fy2011 period up from about 28 billion when the plan was originally decided on26 in fy2005 and fy2006 the army has not included funds to cover the costs in its regular or base line budget instead it has asked for 5 billion in the fy2005 supplemental to cover costs and plans to request supplemental funds for fy2006 as well pbd753 see discu ssion of administra tion request below directed the defense department to dd 5 billion annually beginning in fy2007 to the armys regular budget to cove r modularization costs thereafter congress has generally supported th army reorganization though some questions have been raised about it the big issue has been whether to include funding in supplementals or in regular ppropriations but his ppears to have been resolved funds will be in supplementa ls in fy2005 and fy2006 and in the regular budget thereafter key nswered question is whether the army will be able to fill out the deployable brigade structure w ithout permanent increase in endstrength through fy2006 the defense department is keeping 30000 troops in the force above earlier endstrength levels in part as rotation base for iraq and in part to provide buffer as the army reorganizes costs are being covered in supplemental appropriations the defense department leadership expects the army to fill out units after fy2006 without dditional endstrength by reassigning personnel within the force and by shifting military jobs to ci vilians many in congress doubt that the army will be able to fill out the new brigades in the future simply by reassigning personnel another key issue is whether in the l ong run the new army force design will meet strategic requirements among others retired army colonel douglas macgregor who was one of the original ch ampions of brigadecentered force has argued that the new brigades are not sufficiently wellequipped to have the necessary flexibility and that the army is still preserving too many layers of command27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs50 27 continued 60 larger than 3800 troop brigades the army plans see elaine m grossman

consideration of annual fense bills in the past congress has addressed matters as diverse as gays in the military women in combat housing of male and fe male recruits during basic tr aining and sale of potentially offensive magazines on military bases congress perennially debates proposals to repeal prohibition on privately funded bortions in military hospitals overseas for personnel or dependents who otherwise might not have access to abortions at all recently in view of reports that cases of sexual abuse within the military are nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs53 uncommon there has been an extensive di scussion in congress of the adequacy of the defense departments polic on sexual abuse and its handling of abuse cases key social issue in congress this year has been whether women should continue to serve in units that direc tly support combat operations and that are deployed along with combat units in military operations currently women are not permitted to serve in combat roles in the army but are often assigned to s upport units that are physically collocated with combat units as result women have sometimes been involved in fighting and have suffered some casualties in iraq 35 women have died which is about 22 of the total numbe r of us military personnel killed congressional action in house armed services committee subcommittee markup of the fy2006 defense authoriz ation bill the pe rsonnel subcommittee approved by 97 vote measure that w ould bar women from some combat support units in the full committee markup the subco mmittee chair representative john mchugh offered an amendment that instead would codify into statute the existing dod policy that prohibits assignment of women to ground combat units and that would prohibit any changes in assignments opponents of the measure however argued that it went beyond that and could re strict assignment of women to some units in which they now serve in floor action on the authorizati on armed services committee chairman duncan hunter proposed m easure that would require th at the defense department notify congress 60 days in advance of any changes in policies on the assignment of women to deployable ground units this proposal was approved as part of an bloc amendment the conference agreement on the defense authorization bill includes the house provision but with requirement for 30 days advance notification in floor action on the defense appropriations bill debate over measure regarding religious tolerance at the air force academy turned bitter and halted action on the measure for 45 minutes when repres entative obey objected to statements by representative hostettler as reported by the committee the bill included provision stating the sense of congress that coercive and abusive religious proselytizing at the air force academy as has been reported is inconsistent with the professionalism and standa rds required of those who serve at the academy the measure required the air force to develop and report on plan to maintain climate free from coercive religious intimidation and inappropriate proselytizing representative hunter objected to the provision and proposed substitute that voices support for religious tolerance and re quired the secretary of the air force to develop and report on recommendations to maintain positive climate of religious freedom and tolerance at the united states air force academy representative obey offered substitute to the hunter pr oposal that restored much of the original language in response to statements by representative hostettler representative obey moved that the gentlemans words be taken down which if upheld by the chair would have allowed further statements for the day by the speaker representative hostettler subsequently withdrew his remarks and the debate resumed in the end the house rejected the obey amendment by vote of 198210httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs54 and the hunter amendment prevailed the conference agreement on the appropriations bill deleted the housepassed language another issue arose shortly before th senate began action on the defense authorization when federal court rule d that the defense department could not provide support for periodic boy scout ja mboree because the organization excludes some children on religious grounds on july 26 by vote of 980 the senate approved an amendment to the authorization bill by senator frist saying that federal law may be construe d to limit federal agency suppor t to youth organizations the authorization conference agreement includes an amended provision requiring that federal law may re strict military support for several iden tified youth organizations including the girl scout s and boy scouts and for other youth organizations that the president may designate in the future base closures in the fy2003 defense authorization bill congress approved new round of military base closures to be carried out in calendar year 2005 and both last year and the year before congress in some cases qu ite narrowly rejected proposals to repeal or limit the base closure law the congressionally approved closure process was underway throug hout the curre nt legislative session even so there was some discussion in congress about lastminute m easures to delay or derail the process congressional action in its markup of the fy2006 defense authorization the house armed services committee re jected an amendment proposed by representative bradley to lay the base closure round later on the floor the full house rejected the same proposal by vote of 112316 meanwhile in the senate senator thune with severa l cosponsors proposed freestanding bill s 1075 to postpone closures until among other things all major combat forces have returned from iraq subsequently senator t hune proposed similar measure as an amendment to the defense authorization bill that amendment is still technically pending the base closure commission sent its final report with recommendations to close 22 major military facilities and realign 33 others to the white house on september 8 president bush approved the report and sent

defense authorization and appropriations bills cover32 congress provides funding for national defense programs in several annual appropriations measures the largest of which is the defense appropriations bill congress also acts every year on national defense authorization bill which authorizes programs funded in severa l regular appropriations measures the authorization bill addresses defense programs in almost precisely the same level of detail as the defens erelated appropriations and c ongressional debate about major defense policy and funding issues often occu rs mainly in action on the authorization the annual defense appropr iations bill provides funds for military activities of the department of defense dod includi ng pay and benefits of military personnel operation and maintenance of weapons and facilities w eapons procurement and research and development as well as for other purposes most of the funding in the bill is for programs administered by the partment of defense though the bill also provides 1 relatively small unclassifi ed amounts for the central intelligence agency retirement fund and intelligence community management 2 classified amounts for national intelligence activities ad ministered by the national intelligence director by the cia and by other agenci as well as by dod and 3 very small amounts for some other agencies at the beginning of the 109th congress the house appropriations committee undertook substantial reorganization that removed the defense health program environmental restorati on programs and military f acilities maintenance accounts from the jurisdiction of the defense ppropriations subcommittee and placed them under the jurisdiction of the newlynamed military quality of life and veterans affairs subcommittee the senate appr opriations co mmittee s ubsequently adopted reorganization plan that kept the same accounts within the defense appropriations bill though it assigned military construction and veterans affairs programs to renamed subcommittee on military construction and veterans affairs this report will continue to track funding levels of the programs moved out of the defense appropriations bill by the house as they still fall within both the department of defense and overall national defense budget functions several other appropriations bills also provide funds for national defense activities of dod and other agencies this report does not generally track congressional action on defenserelated programs in these other appropriations bills except for discussion of action on some department of energy nuclear weapons programs in the energy and water appropriations billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl3292433 see crs report rl32783 fy2005 supplemental appropriations for iraq and afghanistan tsunami

calculations based on office of management and budget data and deflators from the department of defense note includes supplemental appropriations for fy2000 thro ugh fy 2004 but does not include supplemental appropriations for fy2005 and beyond key features of the administration request within the defense budget three aspects of the administrations fy2006 request stand out continued growth in military personnel and in operation and maintenance costs slowdown in growth of funding for rdte and procurement and some substantial lastminute change s in projected funding for major weapons programs when in december 2004 the office of management and budget instructed the defense department to trim net of 30 billion from the to tal defense department fy2006 fy2011 sixyear plan continued growth in military personnel and in operation and maintenance costs as table a1 shows the fy2006 request for the department of defense is 191 billion higher than the fy2005 baseline budget ie excluding supplemental appropriations of that increase 57 billion is for military personnel and 100 billion is for operation and mainte nance om so over 80 of the requested dod increase between fy2005 nd fy2006 is for military personnel and om the growth in personnel and ope rating accounts reflects an ongoing trend between fy2000 and fy2005 increases in military pers onnel and operation andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs62 34 for full discussion see crs report rl32877 defense budget longterm challenges for fy2006 and beyond by stephen daggett 35 it is important to note however that the fy2004 and fy2005 supplemental appropriations bills include large amounts for procurement especially for the army only small part of which is to replace combat losses the fy2004 supplemental provides 55 billion for procurement the fy2004fy2005 b ridge fund in the fy2005 appropriations bill provides 14 billion and the fy2005 supplemental provides 174 billionmaintenance funding accounted for 60 of the overall relatively larger increase in the department of defense budget this still left substantial amounts to boost weapons acquisition but as budgets level ff continuing increases in personnel and operations may limit the new funding available for weapons programs34 slower growth in procurement and rdte in the fy2006 request the administration proposes 780 billion for procurement decrease of 300 million compared to the fy2005 baseline level and 694 billion for rdte an increase of 600 million after adjusting for infla tion both represent real reductions in funding see table a3 35 over the next few years the administration plan calls for only very modest growth in weapons acqui sition in the regular defense budget an increase in procurement funding is offset by decline in rdte in all procurement plus rdte spending increases by 73 after adjusting for inflation over the next six years about 12 per year real growth one additional point is important to note the administration plan also projects only modest real growth in operation and maintenance of about 18 per year over the next six years substantially below the historical growth rate of 26 if as in the past projections of om savings pr ove to be too optimis tic then funds may migrate from acquisition programs into om to protect readiness table a3 department of defense budget authority by title

753 pbd 753 the implications of constraints on weapons funding became rath er dramatically pparent in december 2004 when the defense department made number of significant changes in its longterm acquisition plans to meet budget targets established by the white house in the last few weeks before the pres idents fy2006 budget was to be submitted to congress the office of management and budget omb instructed the defense department to cut 55 billion from its fy2006fy2011 future years defense plan fydp at the same time omb told the pentagon to add 25 billion to the fy2007fy2011 army budget to cover costs of an ongoing reorganization plan known as army modularization see below fo r further discussion the net result was reduction of 30 billion in the dod budget over the next six years to effect these reductions dod issued program budget decision 753 pbd 753 which prescribed adjustments to be incorporated into the fy2006 budget submission in order to meet the omb mandate table a4 lists

addshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32924crs64 as table a4 shows the proposed reductions are heavily weighted towards the outyears especially fy2009 and fy2010 and minimized in fy2007 several of these cuts have been controversial in congress particularly the navy shipbuilding reductions and termina tion of the c130j the fate of these and other programs may be major focus of congressional attention in action on this years defense bills as the house armed services committee was beginning to mark up the defense authorization bills the fense department announced that it had decided not to terminate c130j production longterm defense budget challenges over the next several years the fense budget will be under considerable amount of pressure due to several longterm tr ends these include relatively moderate rates of gr owth in defense spending in administration budget projections and continued downward pressure on the budget due to efforts to constrain budget deficits recent large increases in military personnel costs that have made uniformed personnel more than 30 more expensive than in 1999 continued growth in opera tion and maintenance costs cost growth in number of majo r weapons programs and recent cuts in major weapons due to budget constraints and new perceptions of threats to us security that may lead the pentagon to alter its budget priorities substantially taken together these trends pose so potentially daunting though by means unprecedented challenges for cong ress and the defens department in shaping the defense budget these issu are reviewed in crs report rl32877 defense budget longterm challenges for fy2006 and beyond by stephen daggett though congress seldom addre sses these matters directly longterm budget pressure s underlie ma ny of the issues that congress will grapple with this year
