many different investment strategies but the largest and bestknown funds engage in highrisk speculation in markets around the world wherever there is financial volatility the hedge funds will probably

assets including foreign currencies precious metals commodities and derivatives some funds follow narrowlydefined investment strategies eg investing only in mortgage bonds or east asian st ock markets while others the socalled macro funds invest their capital in any market in the world where the fund managers see opportunities for profit hedge funds are structured to avoid sec regu lation to avoid becoming public issuers of securities subject to extensive disclosure requirements they accept funds only from accredited investors defined by sec regulations as persons with assets of 1 million or more mutual funds subject to the investment company act of 1940 must comply with comprehensive set of regulations designed to protect small unsophisticated investors these regulations include limits on the use of borrowed money strict record keeping and reporting rules capital structure requirements mandated adherence to specified investment goals and strategies bonding requirements and requirement that shareholder approval be obtained through proxy solicitation for certain fund business an investment company becomes subject to this regulation only if it has 100 or more shareholders hedge funds therefore generally limit themselves to 99 investors the national securities market improvement act of 1996 pl 104290 broadened this exemption by permitting hedge funds to have an unlimited number of partners provided that each is qualified purchaser with at least 5 million in total invested assets most hedge funds are structured as limited partnerships with few general partners who also serve as investment managers hedge fund managers are often exemployees of large securities firms who strike out on their own in search perhaps of greater entrepreneurial freedom and certainly in search of greater financial rewards those rewards even by wall street standards can be extremely high in addition to the return on his or her own capital the typical hedge fund manager takes 1525 of all profits earned by the fund plus an annual management fee of 1 2 of total fund assets data on hedge funds are available from several private sources but estimates as to the size of the hedge fund universe vary considerably current estimates are in the range of 80009000 funds with over 1 trillion in assets under management starting hedge fund is relatively simple and with few quarters of good results new hedge fund managers can attract capital and thrive on performance and management fees because many of them make risky investments in search of high returns hedge funds also have high mortality rate studies find that the rate of attrition for funds is about 20 per year and that the average life span is about three years 1 there have been some spectacular hedge fund failures but to date these have not discouraged investors 1 many hedge funds bill themselves as lowrisk or marketneutral but these appear less likely to fail stephen j brown william n goetzmann and

average annual return earned by hedge funds differ some studies find that they generally outperform common benchmarks such as the standard poors 500 but others conclude that they have lagged the short life span of many funds creates obvious difficulties for measurement including strong survivorship bias the many funds that shut down each year are not included in return calculations annual return figures of course conceal wide variation from year to year and from fund to fund in any period th law of averages dictates that at least few funds will do extremely well these success stories may explain the continued popularity of hedge funds with investors despite the high fees that they charge and the high risk of loss

operations where investors must be prepared for losses investors who accept the risks are seeking high returns or means to diversify their portfolio risk as long as these investors are sophisticated and wealthy as current law requires hedge fund losses or even failures should not be public policy concern however 1998 case provided an exception to this rule longterm capital management ltcm fund headquartered in connecticut and chartered in the cayman islands opened in 1994 and produced annual returns of over 40 through 1996 it was billed as marketneutral fund that is its positions were based not on predictions of the direction of interest rates or other variables but on the persistence of historical price relationships or spreads among different types of bonds in 1998 however turmoil in world markets stemming from financial crises in asia and russia proved to be too much for its computer models during the month of august 1 998 alone the fund lost almost 2 billion or about half its capital by late september ltcm was on the verge of collapse whereupon the new york fed stepped in and facilitated rescue package of 36 billion cash contributed by 13 private financial institutions who became 90 owners of the funds portfolio why was government intervention needed the fed cited concerns about systemic risk to the worlds financial marketswhile ltcms capital was relatively modest 34 billion during the first half of 1998 it had borrowed extensively from broad range of financial institutions domestic and foreign so that the total value of its securities holdings was estimated to be about 80100 billion in addition the fund supplement ed its holdings of stocks and bonds with complex and extensive derivatives positions magnifying the total exposure of the funds creditors and counterparties and making the effect of general collapse and default difficult to gauge if the fund or its creditors had tried to liquidate its assets and unwind its derivative positions in the troubled market conditions that prevailed the result might have been extreme price drops and high volatility with negative impact on firms not directly involved with ltcm critics of the feds action expressed concerns about moral hazardif market participants believe they will be rescued from their mistakes because they are too big to fail they may take imprudent risks to the fed however the immediate dangers of systemwide damage to financial markets and possibly to the real economy as well clearly outweighed the risks of creating perceptions of an expanded federal safety net

wake of the longterm capital management episode systemic risk emerged as the major policy issue raised by hedge funds the funds had demonstrated an ability to raise large sums of money from wealthy individuals and institutions and to leverage those sums by borrowing and through the use of derivatives until they become so large that even us financial markets may be at risk if they fail not all hedge funds borrow heavily and not all follow highrisk strategies but many do and there is reason to think that other hedge funds will not amass positions as large and complex as ltcms in time some of them can be expected to suffer equally spectacular losses the systemic risk concerns may be summarized as follows failing funds may sell billions of dollars of securities at time when the liquidity to absorb them is not present causing markets to seize up lenders to hedge funds including federally insured banks may suffer serious losses when funds defaultltcm raised questions about their ability to evaluate the risks lending to hedge funds default on derivatives contracts may disrupt markets and may threaten hedge fund counterparties in ways that are hard to predict given the lack of comprehensive regulatory supervision over derivative instruments and since little information about hedge fund portfolios and trading strategies is publicly available uncertainty regarding the solvency of hedge funds or their lenders and trading partners may exacerbate panic in the markets ltcm illustrates the dangers of hedge fund failure however the funds successes can also worry policymakers and regulators particularly in foreign exchange markets manipulation by hedge funds has been blamed as cause of instability eg the european currency crises in the early 1990s and the asian devaluations of 19971998 hedge funds and other speculators can borrow currency and sell it hoping to profit if the curr ency is devalued allowing them to repay with cheaper money if the size of these sales or short positions is significant in relation to the target countrys foreign currency reserves pressure to devalue can become intense to defend the currencys value may call for painful steps such as sharp increases in domestic interest rates which have negative effects on the stock market and economic growth in the united states which has not been the target of such speculative raids many argue that blaming hedge funds for crises is like shooting the messenger who brings bad news and that speculators profit opportunities are often created by bad economic policies the effect of speculation on price volatility is an unresolved qu estion in finance while there has never been conclusive demonstration that speculation causes volatility the two are frequently observed together hedge funds as the most visible agents of speculation in todays global markets are looked upon by some regulators and market participants with fair amount of suspicion

includes the fed the sec the cftc and treasury issued report on hedge funds2 the report cites the ltcm case as demonstrating that single excessivelyleveraged in stitution can pose threat to other institutions and to the financial system and found that the proprietary trading operations of commercial and investment banks follow the same strategies in the same markets as the hedge funds and they are much larger and often more highlyleveraged the general issue then is how to constrain excessive leverage the working group concluded that more disclosure of financial information by hedge funds was desirable the report recommended that large funds be required to publish annual disclosure statements containing snapshot of their portfolios and comprehensive estimate of the riskiness of the funds position and that public companies and financial institutions should include in their quarterly and annual reports statement of their financial exposure to hedge funds and other highlyleveraged entities in 2003 in response to continued rapid growth in hedge fund investment an sec staff report recommended that hedge funds be required to register as investment advisers 3 the staff set out several benefits to mandatory registration funds registered as investment advisers would become subject to regular examinations permitting early detection and deterrence of fraud the sec would gain basic information about hedge fund investments and strategies in markets where they may have significant impact and the sec could require registered hedge funds to adopt uniform standards and improve disclosures they make to their investors on october 26 2004 the sec adopted by 32 vote rule to require hedge funds to register under the investment advisers act4 the rule was controversial opponents argued that hedge fund investors are sophisticated and know the risks that the sec already has authority to pursue hedge fund fraud that systemic risk concerns are overstated and that instead of trying to circumscribe hedge funds the sec ought to be encouraging registered mutual funds to adopt hedge fund investment techniques the regulation fell short of what some critics of hedge fund behavior would have liked to see the sec would still not be able to monitor hedge fund trading in real time and the possibility of another ltcm remains however the sec explic itly decided against this coursethe 2003 staff report found justification for direct regulation and the adopted rule had interest in impeding the manner in which hedge fund invests or placing restrictions on hedge funds 2

into derivatives transactions5 the rule took effect on february 1 2006 and some basic information on registering hedge funds appeared on the sec website however on june 23 2006 an appeals court found that the rule was arbitrary and not compatible with the plain nguage of the investment advisers act vacated it and returned it to the sec for reconsideration sec chairman cox instructed the secs professional staff to provide the commission with set of alternatives for consideration another issue involves the retailization of hedge funds 6 as noted above all fund investors must meet an accredited investor standard they must have incomes of at least 200000 and assets of 1 million this threshold was established in the 1980s and much larger fraction of the population now meets the test particularly since the 1 million includes the value of the investors residence the sec has been concerned that relatively unsophisticated households may be putting their money in hedge funds encouraged by market developments such as the introduction of fundsofhedge funds which accept smaller investments than traditional funds related investor protection issue arises from the fact that pension funds and other institutional investors are placing more of their money with hedge funds meaning that unsophisticated beneficiaries may be unwittingly at risk of significant hedge fundrelated losses if the plan fiduciaries are not prudent and cautious on december 13 2006 the sec proposed regulation that would raise the accredited investor threshold from 1 million to 25 million in assets excluding the value of the investors home if adopted the rule would significantly reduce the pool of potential hedge fund investors but would not be expected to have strong impact on the largest funds which do not depend on mere millionaires the sec received many unfavorable comments from investors who meet the current standard but would be excluded under the new limits these investors do not wish to be protected from risks that the sec might view as excessive in february 2007 the presidents working group issued an agreement among pwg and us agency principals on principles and guidelines regarding private pools of capital 7 the document expresses the view that policies that support market discipline participant awareness of risk and prudent risk management are the best means of protecting investors and limiting systemic risk the agreement does not call for legislation to give regulators new powers or authorities to regulate hedge funds
