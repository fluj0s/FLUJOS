ng rules and practices of the house of representatives and the senate legislation affecting the revenues of the federal government usually i s conside red separately from legislation providing annual appropriations to federa l agencie s coordination of revenue and spending decisions occurs under th congressional budget process in which the appropriate aggregate levels of revenue and spending for multiyear period are set forth in concurrent resolution on th budget the revenue and spending legislation necessary to implement budge t resolution policies however usually is developed under separate and distinc t procedures n otwithstanding this general feature of the legislative process revenue provisions are included in annual appro priations acts from time to time the purpose of this report is to briefly assess the extent of this practice in recent years definition of terms revenues of the federa l government also called receipts are income derived principally from the governments exercise of its sovereig n powers they consist mainly of individual and corporate income taxes and socia l insurance taxes such as the social securit payroll tax in addition revenues include excise taxes customs duties and tariffs certain fines fees and user charges gifts and donations and certain other income budget authority is the first ste p in the spending process it represents the legal authority for agencies to create financial commitments by incurring obligations annual appropriations are one f the most widely known forms of budget authority outlays which complete the spending process occur when obligations are paid off for budget enforcement purposes all federal spending is divided into tw categories discretionary spending which is spending controlled through the annual appropriations process and direct spending which is spending controlled outside of the annual appropriations process all discretionary spending and some direc t spending eg medicaid is funded in annual appropriations acts the remainder of direct spending is funded through devices such as permanent appropriations eg social security and medicare borrowing authority and contract authority some funds r eceived by accounts in the federal budget are treated as offsetting collections which are deducted from budget authority and outlays instead of being counted as revenue offsetting collections involve businesslike or marketoriented activities or payments from one federal account to another committee jurisdiction both the house and senate split jurisdiction ove r revenues and annual appropriations between two d ifferent committees in the househttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98846crs2 jurisdiction over revenue matters generally and other specific revenue matters i s vested in the ways and means committee by clause 1s of rule x th appropriations committee is assigned jurisdiction over appropriations of th revenue for the support of the government under clause 1b of rule x while the house appropriations committee exercises sole jurisdiction over l discretionary spending most of the ther house committees including the ways and means committee have jurisdiction over some direct spending similarly in the senat paragraph 1i of rule xxv assigns jurisdiction over revenue matters generally and other specific revenue matters to the financ committee the appropriations committee is given jurisdiction under paragrap h 1b of rule xxv over appropriations of the revenue for the support of th govern ment as is the case in the house the senate appropriations committe exercises sole jurisdiction over all discretionary spending but most of the othe r senate committees including the finance committee have jurisdiction over som direct spending legislative procedures under th regular legislative procedures of the house and senat revenue measures are considered separately from annual appropriations acts revenue measures often are constrained in their scope solely to revenu matters suc h measures may range from the imposition or waiver of single tariff to extensive changes in the internal revenue code sometimes omnibus measure s dealing with d irect spending programs may include one or more revenue titles along with titles containing direct spending and other legislative provisions for example legislation pertaining to social security or medicare may contain provisions dealing with payroll taxes and other revenue features pertinent to the program as well s provisions dealing with the programs eligibility criteria and benefit payments i n some instances such as for highway and aviation spending the ways and mean s committee and finance committee develop the revenue portion ie excise taxes of the legislation while other house and senate committees develop the spendin g portion during the 1980s and 1990s the ways and means committee and th finance committee also have developed revenue reconciliation bills in response t reconciliation directives in the annual budget resolution the house and senate appropriations committees typically report thre different types of annual appropriations acts each year each of the 13 differen t house and senate appropriations subco mmittees develop one regular appropriations act which provides budget authority to federal agencies for the next fiscal year supplemental appropriations acts provide additional budget authority during th current fiscal year when the regular appropriation is insufficient or to financ activities not provided for in the regular appropriation continuing appropriation s acts also called continuing resolutions or crs provide stopgap funding fo r agencies that have not received regular appropriation any of these three types of annual appropriations acts may become an omnibus appropriations act if it i s expanded to encompass agencies and accounts normally covered in two or more of the regular appropriations acts or in the case of continuing resolution if it goe s beyond formulafunding for multiple bills to include the full text of the regula r appropriationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98846crs3 when house action on appropriations bills is delayed the senate sometime s1 expedites its actions by considering senatenumbered bill up to the stage of final passage upon receipt f the housepassed bill in the senate it is amended with the text that th senate already has agreed to as single amendment and then passed by the senate in this manner the senate c ontinues to adhere to the custom of house origination of appropriations acts see the consideration in the congressional record of march 16 1995 of n2 amendment offered by senator kay bailey hutchison to hr 889 supplementa l appropriations and rescission act for information on this practice see legislative provisions riders in omnibus3 appropri ations acts recent examples by robert keith crs report 98834 gov updated october 28 1998 6 pagesthe constitution in article i section 7 requires that revenue measure s originate in the house by custom the annual appropriations acts originate in th house as well1 in the house the jurisdictions of the appropriations committee and the ways and means committee are protected by rule xxi in orde r to keep the consideration of annual appropriations acts separate from the consideration of substantiv legislation clauses 2b and 2c of the rule prohibit the inclusion of legislativ provisions ie provisions changing existing law in general appropriations bills while clause 5a prohibits the inclusion of appropriations in legislation reported by any committee other than the appropriations committee similarly clause 5b of the rule bars the inclusion of any tax r tariff measure in legislation reported by any committee other than the ways and means committee revenue provisions inasmuch as they involve changing existing or creating new substantive law normally would be regarded as type of legislative provision in an appropriations act the hou does not regard continuing resolutions to be general appropriations bills in the senate rule xvi had served for many year s to separate the consideration of legislat ive and appropriations matters in fashion similar to that employed by the house in 1995 however during the senates consideration of supplementa l appropriations bill the chairs ruling that particular amendment offered by senator was out of order as legislation was overturned by the full senate the2 senate has not enforced the prohibition against legislative provisions in annua l appropriations acts since that time during the 1980s and 1990s various factors contributed to the greater use f omnibus appropriations acts particularly escalating disagreements between th president and congress over general budgetary policy and policies in key progra m areas at first the omnibus appropriations acts took the form of continuin g resolutions but on two occasions in recent year s several of the regular appropriations bills simply have been merged into an omnibus consolidated appropriations act in most instances considerable portion of these omnibus appropriations acts has consisted of legislative provisions the two main reasons for this practice ar e3 that 1 legislation stalled at the end of session that otherwise might not advancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98846crs4 budget enforcement procedures as well as other aspects of the budget process ar e4 explained in manual on the federal budget process by robert keith and allen schick crs report 98720 gov august 28 1998 184 pagescan be carried through to enactment on the funding bill which is considered to b mustpass legislation and 2 legislation without strong support especiall legislation that faces veto threat may have greater chance of prevailing when it is mixed in with highpriority funding matters the practice of including maj or legislative provisions in omnibus appropriations acts sometimes generates considerable controversy some members decry th practice as unde rmining the deliberative process they assert that in many instances the inclusion of riders in lengthy and complex appropriations bills may requir members to vote on matters with which they are largely unfamiliar may give the m too little time to debate these matters may usurp the prerogatives of the relevan t authorizing committees and may shield from proper scrutiny legislation that would not prevail on its own merits advocate s of the practice however argue that it provides needed flexibility to the legislative process allowing congress to process its business more efficiently in the waning d ays of session many such provisions they maintain already hav been given thoro ugh review under regular procedures and their inclusion in annual appropriations bills often is at the behest of authorizing committee members budget enforcement procedures revenue measures and annua l appropriations bills as well as other typ of budgetary legislation are subject to two different sets of budget enforcement procedures first under the congressiona l4 budget proc ess such legislation must adhere to constraints established by the yearly budget resolution potential violations of the appropriate budget resolution level s may be blocked by points of order established under the congressional budget act of 1974 in the case of revenue bills section 311 of the act prohibits any measur that would cause estimated reve nues to fall below the revenue floor set in the budget resolution the senate but not the house supplements this requirement with special payasyougo rule that requires revenue and direct spending legislation to be deficit neut ral over oneyear 5year and 10year period this special senate rule also is enforced by point of order in the case of annual appropriations section 311 of the act generally bars annual appropriations acts fr om breaching the aggregate levels of new budget authority and outlays set in the budget resolution further section 30 2 of the act requires that such bills conform to the spending allocations made to the appropriations committee s under the budget r esolution and to the subdivisions of spending allocations made to each of the subcommittees the second set of enforcement procedur stems from the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended by the budget enforcement act of 1990 the budget enforcement act of 1997 and other laws under the act l revenue and direct spending legislation enacted during session must b deficitneutral under payasyougo paygo requirement also lhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98846crs5 discretionary spendin g is subject to annual statutory limits on both budget authority and outlays these procedures apply to legislation enacted through fy2002 violations are enforced by means of sequestration procedure under which largely acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs are made automaticall shortly after the end of congressional session recent practices during the 1980s and 1990s revenue provisions have been included in regular appropriations acts on several occasions for the most part these provisions hav been relatively minor in scope with modest budgetary impact however s discussed below two measures enacted in the late 1990s involved 5year revenu losses in excess of 150 million nearly all legislative changes affecting revenue s during this period have occurred in revenue bills and reconciliation measure s considered under re gular legislative procedures with multiyear revenue impact of hundreds of billions of dollars in some cases provisions involving offsettin g collections with substantial budgetary impact have been included in annua l appropriations acts but such transactions are not counted as revenues in the house and senate revenue provisions as type of legislativ provision may be included in annual appropriations acts in several ways first the rules that enforce the boundaries between legislation and appropriations are t selfenforcing in order for potential violation to be stopped member mus t successf ully raise point of order and it must be sustained if challenged second like any other rules of the house and senate these rules may be waived in variou s ways in the house it is not uncommon to waive rule xxi under special rule governing consideration of the annual appropriations act finally the rules are not fully comprehensive in their coverage and application both house rule xxi an d senate rule xvi afford some exc eptions particularly in the senate in recent years as previously mentioned the senate has ch osen not to enforce this portion of the rule at all pursuant to the 1995 precedent further because the house does not regard continuing resolutions to be general appropriations bills rule xxi does not apply to their consideration the infre quent occurrence of revenue provisions in annual appropriations acts and their typically limited scope make it difficult to identify such provisions in systematic fashion perusal of the text of selected annual appropriations acts of the 1980s reveals several examples section 139 95 stat 967 of contin uing resolution for

discretionary spending limits and the paygo process under the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 allows such provisions to be identified in more thorough fashion each year th congressional budget office cbo prepares advisory sequester reports at the end of session that include information on all discretionary spending and payg legislation enacted additionally cbo provides an advisory cost estimate following the enactment of each discretionary spending or paygo measure the cbo reports are provided to the office of management and budget omb which has th responsibility of termining whether discretionary spending or paygo sequester must occur discretionary spending in annual appro priations acts is scored by both cbo and omb under the discretionary spending limits revenue and direct spendin g generally is scored under the paygo scorecard special procedures come int play when revenue or direct spending provisions are included in annua l appropriations acts pursuant to scorekeeping rule 3 any provision in an annua l appropr iations act that makes substantive change in direct spending effectively i s accounted for by both cbo and omb under the discretionary spending limits the5 two agencies follow different practices however regarding the treatment of revenue provisions in annual appropriations acts cbo scores their revenue effect under the paygo scorecard but omb accounts for them under the discretionary spendin g limits all budgetary transactions in annual appropriations acts therefore are scored by both cbo and omb under the discretionary spending limits except that cb scores revenue p rovisions in such acts under the paygo scorecard consequently any annual appropriations act listed under the paygo scorecard by cbo include s revenue provisions the
