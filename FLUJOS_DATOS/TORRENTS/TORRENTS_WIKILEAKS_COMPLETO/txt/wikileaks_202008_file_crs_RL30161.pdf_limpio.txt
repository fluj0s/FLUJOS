russias devaluation of the ruble and default on its debts in august 1998 put it in its most serious crisis to date if trends that created the crisis continue russia is faced with vicious downward cycle toward dire economic straitshyperinflation steep reduction in output and income default on debts precluding the ability t borrow political weaknessdisintegration of central government power wit

and investors agree that this is t he likely outcome without radical change the primakov government and the donors international monetary fund the major industrial economiesthe g7 led by the united states ar negotiating on an action program that might if effectively implemented provide basis for managing economic revival effectively dealing with debt management bank restructuring and reform budget balancing and inve stment generation might keep the major donors and some investors engaged with the russians and justify domesti c support of reform adjusting now before the parliame ntary and presidential elections of december 1999 and june 2000 might open the option of proceeding towar d comprehensive reform in the manner of poland and other successfully reformin g states the choices between the vicious cycle and managed economy are stark an d understandable to russians and donors alike however the shortfalls in reform that created the crisis also established the wealth and power of the financial industria l groups the oligarchs who must change from rent seekers living off politicall determine d allocations from the state budget and monopoly profits to profi t seeking competitive groups able to contribute to economic growth reduction f poverty and payment of taxes this change is crucial to the success of managed economy scenario the united states has different policy options if either the vicious cycle r managed economy scenario develops without concrete fundamental measures by the russians the united states and all major donors are committe d to limiting support to humanitarian aid and some military reduction programs the united states may in this negative scenario face hostile russia still armed with nuclear weapons that is viewed by our defense authorities as the number one threat to our security with successful russian economic adjustment strategy the united states may play major role in responding to russian concrete reform actions leading all donors t provide targeted assistance keyed to russian actions and therefore likely to stimulate foreign direct investment from the united states and elsewhere especially in th energy sector if

projection of past trends that gave rise to the current financial crisis when yevge primakov took the reins of government in september 1998 he found russia in its most serious eco nomic crisis in its sevenyear existence with the default on debts and devaluation of the ruble by the previous government on august 17 1998 primakov stated that his government needed to take urgent measures t avoid defaulting on sovereign debt internat ional donors and some investors adopted policy of continue d engagement wit h russia under which concrete measures must be taken by russia to receive further assistancemeasures such as debt settlement setting up workabl monetary system adopting and implement ing sound budget and most importantly establishing rule of law for businesses to encoura ge investment the new approach2 of requiring both russian commitments and concrete measures as preconditions for assistance resulted from donor perceptions that previous reformoriented russia n governments consistently made commitmen ts that were not honored by performance thus successful negotiations between the primakov government and the donors are premised on implementation of urgent concrete measures that would redress th critical problems that caused the financial crisis and keep open the option for future transition to comprehensive reform after parliamentary elections in december 1999 or the presidential elections in june 2000 the rus sian reform record from september 1998 through march 1999 did not change the views of many primakov skeptics because concrete radical

effective banking reform process might then result in foreign banks accepting primakovs invitation to operate i n russia another critical indicator of tr ust in banking reform would be the willingness

an engagement policy with specific attention to concrete measures prepared to respond to shortterm results in the months ahead28 the broader conditionality in current negotiations on the russian

resolving its financial crisis in the short run then proceed as other countries have toward democratic market system under rule of law this aspect of change makes adopting necessary changes seem to be miracle or as the germans noted wirtshaftwunder as machiavelli earlier noted in the renaissance p eriod this kind of radical change may be most difficult but crucial and it ought to be remembered that t here is nothing more difficult to take in hand more perilous to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in th introduction of new order of things because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new this coolness arises partly f rom fear of the opponents who have the laws on their side and partly from the in credulity of men who do not readily believe in new things until they have had long experience of them thus it happens that whenever those wh are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans whilst the others defend lukewarmly 29 this broader politicalcultural rationale for incrementally dealing with russias current cr isis has been gaining more adherents among professional russia watchers while noting t hat the current government has survived the immediate crisis better in the short term than expected some still view an incremental ap proach as too little too late to hold sway with russian voters later this ye ar at the same time others argue30 that furtherance at this time of the managedeconomy reform plan acceptable t foreign donors and investors is necessary over sustained period to decreas economic inefficiencies revive economic growth and enhance internal an d international political support what does appear clear is that russia cannot continue to muddl through or just survive its economic crisis should he follow this path primakov risks losing both internal as well as international support primakov s dilemma may thus be that neither action nor inaction are riskless while continuing to push forward on his action plan
