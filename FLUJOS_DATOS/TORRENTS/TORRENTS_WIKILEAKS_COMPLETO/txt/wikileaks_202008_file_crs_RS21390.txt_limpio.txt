the government of washington dc 4 these three organizations have washington dc mailing addresses however mailing address does not necessarily reflect the geographical location or jurisdiction of the

commission some of whose responsibilities were subsequently vested in the nrc to acquire suitable site in or near the district of columbia and to provide for the construction on such site of modern
