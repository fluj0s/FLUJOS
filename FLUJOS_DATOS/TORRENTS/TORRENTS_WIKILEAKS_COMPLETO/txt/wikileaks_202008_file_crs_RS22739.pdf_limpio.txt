schip expenditures provided in november 2007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22739crs4 1 prior versions of this report showed states projected fy2008 shortfalls at approximately 16 billion this was based on states quarterly timates from august 2007 besides using states november projections the estimates in this report also reflect states final reported fy2007 schip spending these estimates are based on expenditure projections provided by the states to the centers for medicare and medicaid serv ices cms in late november 20071 states submit these projections on quarterly basis and they are likely to change additional description of schip provisi ons in pl 110173 schip allotments title xxi of the social security act as established by the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 specified na tional appropriation amounts from fy1998 to fy2007 for schip pl 110173 set the fy2008 and fy2009 allotments at the same level as in fy2007 50 billion for the states and territories plus an additional 40 million for the territories the allotment of these funds to states in fy2008 and fy2009 will continue to be base d on the statutory formula using the estimated number of lowincome children and lowincome uninsured children in each state adjusted slightly by geographic cost factor generally allotments ar available for three years af ter which any unspent funds are redistributed to other stat however the fy2008 and fy2009 allotments are available only through march 31 2009 or the date of actment of legisla tion to reauthorize schip whichever comes first redistribution allotments unspent after three years are redistributed to other states under pl 110173 fy2005 allotments unspent at the end of fy2007 are to be redistributed to states proj ected to exhaust all of their schip funds in fy2008 the redistributed fy2005 funds would be provided until exhausted to states in the order in which their shortfalls occur in add ition fy2006 allotments unspent at the end of fy2008 will be redistributed to states project ed to exhaust all of their schip funds in fy2009 before march 31 2009 the redistri buted fy2006 funds will be provided until exhausted to states in the order in which those shortfalls occur additional appropriations for stat shortfalls of federal schip funds in early fy2006 several states were pr ojected to exhaust their federal schip funds during the year with shortfall pr ojected at 283 million congress appropriated 283 million in the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 for the purpose of eliminating states shortfalls in fy2006 with 105 of the appropria tion provided to the territories to eliminate shortfalls of some states federal schip funds in fy2007 congress appropriated such sums as necessary not to exceed 650 million in the us troop readiness veterans care katrina recovery and iraq accountability appropriations act 2007 pl 11028 th territories received portion of this appropriation under pl 110173 such sums as necessary not to exceed 16 billion are appropriated in fy2008 to 1 eliminate states shortfalls of federa l schip funds and 2 provide 105 of states project ed shortfall amounts to the territories these funds are

the enhanced schip match ranges from 650 to 834 for each state the enhanced fmap is calculated so that its share of expenditures under schip is 30 lower than under the regular medicaid matching rate16 billion appropr iation is insufficient to cover states shortfalls and the associated payments to the territories then the payments to the states and territories would be reduced proportionally based on states late st projections the total fy2008 shortfalls are projected at less than 12 billion under pl 110173 such sums as n ecessary not to exceed 275 million are appropriated in fy2009 to 1 eliminate states shortfalls of federa l schip funds in the first two quarters of fy2009 and 2 provide 105 of states project ed shortfall amounts to the territories these funds are availabl only for the first two quarters of fy2009 and unspent funds are not available for redi stribution if the 275 million appropriation is insufficient to cover states shortfalls and the associated payments to the territories then the payments to the states and territories would be reduced proportionally based on states latest projections the total fy 2009 s hortfalls through march 31 2009 are projected at

capture most states that had expanded their upperincome eligibility levels for childre n in their medicaid programs to 185 of poverty prior to the enactment of schip under pl 110173 the ability of
