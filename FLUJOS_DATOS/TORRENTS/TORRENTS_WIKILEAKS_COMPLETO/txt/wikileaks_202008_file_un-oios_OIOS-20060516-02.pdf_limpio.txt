helck united nations nations unies office of internal oversight services unhcr audit service audit of medical evacuations in the unhcr ar20051 6204 executive summary in october 2005 oios conducted an audit of medical evacuations medevac the purpose of which is to allow staff members and eligible depend ents to secure essential medical care or treatment for illness or injury requiring medical intervention that is locally unavailable or inadequate the audit focused on the related policy administrative and financial issues draft of the report was shared with the division of human re sources management dhrm in december 2005 the comments received in may 2006 are reflect ed as appropriate in this final report oios was denied access to administrative informatio n relating to medevac cases with the unhcr medical service invoking medical confidential ity this resulted in an audit scope limitation and the inability for oios to make an as sessment of the reliability of administrative processes in order to seek clarification on audit access the unhcr legal affairs section referred the issue to the office of legal affair s ola olas legal opinion confirmed oios position and stated that only medical inform ation can be considered confidential and administrative data should have been made available this opinion came after the audit work had been completed audit findings and recommendations from january 2002 to december 2005 there were 151 7 medical evacuations at cost of us 535 million oios noted marked upward trend in t his period with the number increasing by 56 per cent and at the same time the associated t ravel and dsa costs rose 124 per cent to us 167 million in 2005 on average 32 per cent of med evacs relates to international staff and 68 per cent to national staff oios analysis showed that 50 per cent of the evacu ations were from 6 countries namely afghanistan guinea uganda drc tanzania and zamb ia evacuations from guinea alone cost nearly us 1 million and accounted for 19 per cent of the total costs in the period reviewed the medical service explained that higher health zards and medical needs are associated with major refugee situations where medi cal infrastructure is inadequate oios review of medevac procedures at the field lev found that crucial documents were either not filed correctly or were not completed an d available for example control sheets listing vital details of medical evacuations were n ot maintained in several offices important documents were either not submitted to headquarters or were submitted with considerable delay although required all field offices had not develo ped medical evacuation plan this is necessary to ensure all participating units are pro perly organized trained and ready to perform medical evacuation in an effective and coordinate d manner this issue was already raised in unhcr evaluation report epau but action was t aken to ensure appropriate plans were established oios noted that the recognised places locations wh ere persons go on medevac differed in some cases from those of the for example fo r west africa unhcr included london and paris whereas the suggested four countries in the region oios recommended considering the costs involved in travel to and the medical expenses incurred in certain locations that efforts be made to bring unhcr in li ne with those locations recommended by the the fundamental principles of medical evacuation we re not always applied resulting in unnecessary costs to unhcr oios noted one case whe re an office recorded that staff member was planning to evacuate in november 2005 planned medical evacuation does not fall under the criteria established also staff members dependent was medically evacuated eleven times from 1993 to 2004 to the us for what ppeared to be periodic medical examinations the staff member apparently did not c laim mip reimbursements for medical treatment but received considerable amounts for tr avel and dsa moreover oios observed that medevacs were authorised for dental treatment eye conditions skin disorders and tests the restricts payment of dsa on medevac to 45 da ys oios noted however that unhcr did not comply with this and there were 179 cases exceeding the normal permissible threshold in once instance medevac to london t ook place one month before the first appointment with the doctor and the patient remain ed in london almost one month after being signed as medically fit to travel oios recommende d that the overpayments of us 11700 relating to dsa payments be recovered dhrm modified the mip reimbursement guidelines rem oving the fundamental principle of reasonable and customary cost in cases of authori sed medical evacuations and clarified that the reimbursement will be made according to the pre vailing patterns of charges at the place where the services were rendered oios raised conce rns regarding lack of clarity in the terms recognised place and authorised place in oios opinion unhcr could obtain some cost savi ngs by reviewing the entitlements paid and harmonizing entitlements with the unhcr sta ff members receive dsa and solar for the first 15 nights whereas in peacekeeping missions only the accommodation portion of the msa is paid together with dsa moreover the in itial duration of medevac is usually set at 15 days thus maximizing staff members enti tlements the rules and procedures governing the payment of d sa on medevac are complex and oios has identified number of overpayments the errors found result mainly from the incorrect interpretations of the rules oios recomm ended they be simplified may 2006 table of contents chapter paragraphs i introduction 15 ii audit objectives 6 iii audit scope and methodology 78 iv audit

the policies and procedures relating to medical evacuations in unhcr and their implementation in various country operations the audit was conducted in accordance w ith the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 for staff safety and welfare an issue of paramo unt importance is medical evacuation facilities it is essential therefore that unhcr st aff requiring medical intervention in emergency medical conditions have access to an easy and responsive mechanism for medical evacuation the unhcr medical service under the division of human resources management dhrm is responsible for managing and processing medical evacuation medevac requests from field locations the purpos of medevac is to allow staff members and eligible dependents essential medical c are or treatment for illness or injury requiring medical intervention that is locally not available or is inadequate the medevac scheme constitutes official travel for which unhcr pays for the ticket expenses and subsistence costs it does not constitute any commi tment to meet medical expenses which is separately governed by the medical insurance scheme s of mip for local staff members and unsmis or other schemes for international staff 3 issues relating to medical evacuation have been considered and commented on in several previous oios reports however this is the first time it has been comprehensively reviewed by oios 4 essential administrative information relating to medevac cases was not available to oios as the medical service denied access invoking medical confidentiality this resulted in an audit scope limitation as oios was unable to ex amine administrative and procedural information relating to medevacs in order to assess and verify these procedures as well as the financial transactions on the request of the m edical service unhcr legal affairs section referred the issue of oios access to nonmedical administrative and procedural information to the office of legal affairs ola ola in their legal opinion dated 2 december 2005 confirmed oios position and stated that only medical information can be considered confidential and that generic informatio n such as the names of those evacuated place of evacuation cost of evacuation should be m ade available to oios for audit purposes this opinion however was received after oios had co mpleted the field work 5 the findings and recommendations contained in th is report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activitie s and during the exit conference held on 28 october 2005 draft of this report was shared wit h the director division of human resources management in december 2005 and the direc tor unhcr medical service the formal comments which were received in may 2006 are reflected where appropriate in the report 2 ii audit objectives 6 the main objectives of the audit were to assess unhcrs medical evacuations policies and procedures and more specifically to evaluate the adequacy effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls evaluate whether adequate guidance and procedures w ere in place and consistently applied assess compliance with unhcr rules and procedures iii audit scope and methodology 7 oios review covered the period from 1 january 2 002 to december 2005 as medevacs have financial administrative policy and medical aspects the planned scope of the audit was to include the first three areas name ly financial administrative and policy this would include an examination of authorization and pproval procedures by the unhcr medical service and policy issues at personnel admi nistration sectiondhrm as well as the implementation of medevac instructions in the field however as noted above due to the lack of access to certain important records the re view of administrative issues at the medical service in geneva was not possible this restricted the scope of the audit 8 in general the audit activities included intervi ews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of available documents and other relev ant records iv audit findings and recommendations general aspects relating to medical evacuations eligibility for medical evacuations 9 unhcrs policy on medevac for international staf f is outlined in iom852001 fom832001 dated 12 november 2001 it provides fo r internationally recruited staff members recognized spouses and dependent children residing at the duty station to be evacuated in case of an acute illness or injury for the purposes of securing essential medical care or treatment that cannot be secured locally be cause of inadequate medical facilities locally recruited staff members their spouses and dependent children for whom the organisation has not assumed responsibility for r elocation to or from the duty station will normally be expected to avail themselves of the fac ilities available locally nonetheless in case of an acute lifethreatening medical emergency medevac will be considered when local medical facilities do not offer an adequate r esponse 10 the unhcr instructions of november 2001 broadly reflect the guidance contained in stai200010 dated 21 september 2000 entitled ad ministrative instruction medical evacuation which establishes the conditions and procedures for the authorisation of travel expenses on medical grounds 3 b medical evacuation an enforceable right 11 the medical service was of the view that staff members both international and local have right or claim to be medically evacuated i n certain circumstances it was added that unhcr is operating in unstable situations such as deep field operations and in situations of civil conflicts and when it sends its staff to thes areas there is an attendant responsibility to extricate its staff should there be any unforeseen accidents injury or illness that threaten the health or well being of staff members 12 oios referred to unat judgement1 where the tribunal observed that the applicant had reason to expect that the organisation for wh ich he had volunteered to serve in dangerous location had duty to make extreme emergency medical decisions in m anner so as to provide him greatest opportunity to recover f ully from an injury to his physical or mental health that resulted from that service in this reg ard the respondent has failed while this judgement was rendered in the context of service incurred injury it nonetheless indicates that the organisation has certain degree of responsibi lity in ensuring its staff obtains medical intervention when required oios would add that the medevac scheme is form of official travel for securing medical treatment and instructi ons state that internationally recruited staff may be evacuated or medevac will be considered for locally recruited staff members which makes it clear that medical evacuation is enf orceable only subject to the fulfilment of certain essential conditions 13 whether or not staff member should or should not be medically evacuated is in essence medical question it is important nonethe less that the fundamental rationale for medevacs acute illness or injury for international staff and life threatening illness of injury for local staff is not forgotten while recommendin g and authorising evacuations given that medevac is not automatically justified in every ill ness or injury it is thus important that the correct decision making processes are in place bas ed upon clinical and logistical criteria to ensure that when the illness or injury is such that evacuation is required to take place it will be carried out effectively b analysis of data obtained regarding medevacs number of medevacs and costs incurred 14 oios obtained from the medical service and from the division of financial and supply management data on the number of medevacs an d expenditure incurred thereon from 2002 to 2005 table i shows that 1517 medical evacuations took place during the period reviewed at cost of some us 535

3171998 4 15 table ii presents the breakdown of the medical evacuations by status of staff and shows the overall increase in the medical evacuations oi identified that the steady increase is mainly due to rise in the evacuations of local st aff members who accounted for some 68 per cent of all evacuations table ii number of medevacs 2002 2003 2004 2005 international staff 104 37 121 31 129 31

cent of the evacuations were from 6 countries namely afghanistan guinea ugand drc tanzania and zambia the first three countries alone accounted for over 32 per cen t of all evacuations the medical service attributed this to the increase in unhcrs presence and involvement in major refugee programmes in remote locations where adequate medic facilities were not available 17 oios noted however that even though there are modern and sophisticated facilities in geneva there were 42 evacuations from staff based at headquarters during the period reviewed the rationale and justification for medev ac from geneva was not clear particularly as unogs medical service generally do not authorize such evacuations the medical service explained that the evacuations from geneva are in the context of staff member returning to the location of home leave or p roceeding to place where medical experts have previously cared for that condition or in the rare cases where expertise was not available oios would reiterate that the fundamental purpose of medevac is to allow eligible beneficiaries essential medical care or tr eatment for illness or injury that is locally unavailable or inadequate table iii

hardship of unhcr field locations in guinea nonetheless the number of medical evacuations and in particular the associated cost was high and more indepth review may be warranted during 20022005 medevacs from guinea exceeded us 986000 about 19 per cent of the glob unhcr cost for medical evacuations oios 2005 audit of guinea showed that 25 per cent of the staff had been medically evacuated at different points in time and more than 80 per c ent of the medevacs were attributed to local staff members when oios interviewed the d octor in conakry he confirmed that unhcr had by far the highest number of evacuations among all agencies in guinea oios further observed that 20 staff members resorte d to multiple evacuations in 2003 and 2004 with several having three or more medevacs alerted by the significant rise in the evacuations the medical service had undertaken m ission to guinea in 2004 that resulted in number of recommendations regarding the procedures to be followed and the destinations to which the evacuations could be undertaken c trends of medevacs major destinations for med evacs 19 data regarding major destinations table iv fo r medical evacuations showed that 776 or nearly 51 per cent of the evacuations were under taken to five countries namely south africa kenya uganda pakistan and switzerland mo st of the evacuations that took place to uganda and tanzania

procedures and record managem ent 20 the authority to approve medevac to the recogn ised place within the region or to the country of home leave on the recommendation of the designated physician is delegated to the heads of offices in consultation with the medical service medevac to any other place requires the prior approval of the medi cal service oios observed that even where prior approval was not required most field offices preferred to wait for approval by the medical service before authorising the evacuation in practice therefore the decision to grant medical evacuation or not is taken by the medical service the medical service agreed with 6 oios comments and stated that they encouraged heads of offices to assume responsibility for acting in accordance with guidelines 21 in view of the limitation in audit scope oios could not assess whether the medical service had completed the required administrative nd procedural formalities prior to authorising the evacuation and whether the approval s were consistent with guidelines essential documents pertinent to medevacs 22 prior to medevac number of procedures shoul d be followed instructions require specified forms to be part of the records relating to medical evacuations these include annex medevac form annex f information required fo r medevacs from field offices annex g jms authorisation for medevac annex h final report on medevac from field offices to the jms and annex j medevac che cklist the medical service stated that in the absence of essential documents from field of fices such as annex h administrative recommendations could not be made in timely manne r including the period required for the payment of dsa during oios discussions with the medical service i t emerged that documents medical and nonmedical have not been f iled in systematic and segregated manner consolidated information or statistics w ere available regarding medical evacuation to enable management to identify and subsequently f ollowup on unusual trends 23 oios audits of field operations assessed that m any field offices did not adequately comply with the required procedures the filing sys tems were found to be less than satisfactory and relevant documents were not properly filed the following highlights procedures which needed to be improved approvals from the medical service were not always available nor were approvals for extensions of medevac annex f that should be completed by the head of off ice recommending medevac was not consistently available the required certification from the designated p hysician or approval from the medical service of the exact number of sick leave days reco mmended number of days of hospitalisation and days the patient was required t reside at the place of evacuation was not attached to travel claims for medevac several offices did not maintain and update the med evac control sheet for compiling information on medical evacuations including the na mes of staff evacuated place of evacuation duration and costs of the evacuation also as part of the audit oios requested eleven country operations to provide the control sh eet only seven responded afghanistan burundi pakistan zambia drc somalia and guinea and in the absence of any communication from the others tanzania uganda dan and ethiopia it was assumed that these operations did not maintain these essent ial documents one office filed confidential medical information i n the staff members file although this is contrary to medevac instructions concerns were als raised that the medical condition of staff evacuated was not kept confidential 24 the medical service shared oios concerns about the nonavailability of required documentation and would follow up on these issues the medical service added that since they became independent of the joint medical service ac tion has been launched in consultation 7 with dhrm to evaluate existing forms and procedures with view to refine and improve operational arrangements the medical service also agreed that medical information should never be kept in the staff members file recommendations head2right the unhcr division of human resources management sh ould instruct field offices to ensure that all the docum ents and annexes mentioned in the medevac instructions annexes f g h and i are routinely prepared and appropriately filed rec 01 head2right the unhcr medical service should maintain medical vacuation files in manner to ensure medical and nonmedical infor mation is segregated furthermore the medical service shoul d provide on yearly basis the division of human resources manag ement with statistics pertaining to medical evacuations rec 02 25 dhrm agreed with the recommendations and stated tha t the existing system of record keeping would be scrutinised to identify the most p ractical and efficient arrangement for separate record keeping in this context dhrm wou ld pursue through the medical service and the personnel administration section the devel opment of system to ensure that all relevant documents are filed in an easily retrievab manner b medical evacuation plans 26 in accordance with paragraph 18 chapter 23 of the unhcr handbook for emergencies field offices should have medical vacuation plan to evacuate staff members 2004 evaluation of the medical service found that 55 per cent of the offices included in survey indicated that they did not have medical vacuation plan the epau evaluation observed that to make the process of medical evacu ations more efficient it is recommended that the unhcr medical service and the emergency rvice develop one standard medevac checklist for each type of situation regul ar and emergency with an action sequence and spelling out of the designated respons ibilities and contact numbers heads of offices should become formally responsible for upda ting the duty stations medical evacuation plan the medical service informed oios that epaus recom mendation has not been implemented 27 in oios opinion existing arrangements in the field should be reviewed to ensure that when there is medical evacuation all participati ng units administration human resources physician logistics are properly organized tr ained and ready to perform in an effective and coordinated manner oios discussions with the u non joint medical service also highlighted that the absence of clear protocols and procedures was the main obstacle faced in organising medevacs in an emergency staff members were unsure of what steps to take oios review established that as result of lack of clear roadmaps on what to do and whom to approach there is significant gap in medical evacuation services and field offices are not in position to take informed decisions in crisis situations 8 28 oios requested 11 country operations to submit their medical evacuation plans these were the countries from where the highest number of evacuations had taken place only 4 pakistan burundi somalia and sudan submitted th em none were received from those countries where the maximum evacuations took place such as guinea afghanistan uganda tanzania and drc unhcr afghanistan stated that the used united nations humanitarian air services for evacuations other details wer provided this indicates that the level of compliance with the requirement to have medical eva cuation plans as prescribed in the unhcr handbook for emergencies is still not satis factory recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management an d the unhcr medical service should ensure field offices p repare medical evacuation plans detailing the action sequence and the designated responsibilities of personnel for organizing an eva cuation the plans should include specifics of the logistical arrangem ents planned for evacuations rec 03 29 dhrm and the medical service agreed with the recomm endation and appreciated the usefulness of having advance planning and designate d responsibilities dhrm will further examine the existing procedures within the context of the ongoing evaluation of processes and procedures pertaining to the medical service d policy issues relating to medical evacuations 30 policy aspects relating to medevacs are dealt w ith by dhrm the unhcr policy for medevacs is generally in conformity with the ited nations instructions stai200010 dated 21 september 2000 oios howev er identified certain areas where there was lack of clarity in the guidelines leading to inconsistent interpretations these are detailed in the following paragraphs recognised places for medical evacuations 31 the medevac instructions contain the list of re cognised places designated as regional medevac centres these are destinations to where evacuations can take place from different countries oios compared unhcrs list of recognised places with those of the as mentioned in stic200070 dated 21 september 2 000 and the following differences were noted as outlined in table v table v countriesregions recognised centres per stic r ecognised centres per unhcr instructions west central africa cameroon ivory coast gabon senegal south africa johannesburg london paris arab statescentral asia caswaname jordan lebanon egypt tunisia saudi arabia turkey istanbul london 9 32 the difference is more marked for west and cent ral africa and the only common countryplace is south africa johannesburg the list does not include london and paris as recognised centres and designates four other locat ions in the region oios was of the opinion that unhcrs recognised centres should be more in l ine with the uns and did not see any justification for the difference oios audit noted also that there was tendency to authorise medical evacuation to european and other costly des tinations rather than those geographically closer which according to the list have adequat medical facilities for example in guinea from 2002 to 2005 there were 45 medical evac uations to london paris canada and geneva 33 in oios view the inclusion of high cost europe an locations london and paris for locations in west and central africa may not be jus tified considering that closer locations with adequate medical facilities are available oios mus t assume that the new york list would not have included cameroon ivory coast gabon and senegal unless these places were deemed suitable for medical evacuations the inclus ion of distant high cost locations has three fold financial implications for unhcr namely h igher dsa costs b higher travel costs and most significantly c markedly higher medical treatment reimbursement costs 34 dhrm stated that while the medical service wishes t reconcile its list of medical centres with new york this list was often not u pdated as often as unhcrs which was based on more current information oios concurs that the list of recognised medical ce ntres needs to be revised and updated in tandem with the growth and development of medical infrastructure round the world nonetheless the re asons for deviations from the list of recognized places should be explicitly justified an d their financial implications properly assessed 35 the medevac instructions require that medevac t ravel to any place other than the recognised place be documented for audit purposes this requirement was generally not complied with in field offices and proper justifica tion was not correctly filed when travel was undertaken for example to the place of choice at the medical service in headquarters oios could not evidence fulfilment of this requirement d ue to the denial of access to relevant documentation recommendations head2right the unhcr division of human resources management an d the unhcr medical service should review and update the list of recognised regional medical evacuation centres to b ring it in line with the locations designated in the united nations info rmation circular stic200070 dated 21 september 2000 on medical evacuations there is need to take into account the medical fa cilities currently available in different regions as well as the fina ncial implications for unhcr of establishing additional often more expens ive locations rec 04 head2right the unhcr division of human resources management an d the unhcr medical service should ensure that travel on medical evacuation to any place other than the recognised p lace is fully documented for audit purposes both at headquarters and by field 10 offices rec 05 36 dhrm agreed with oios recommendation that travel on medical evacuation to any place other than the recognised place should be ful ly documented for audit purposes dhrm will examine the existing procedures jointly with t he medical service with view to fill any gaps or inadequacies in the present system b conditions justifying medevacs 37 from some of the information reviewed as part f the audit oios evidenced that one office had recorded in its summary information on m edevacs that staff member was planning to evacuate in november 2005 planned medical evacuation would not fall unde r the criteria established oios highlighted that eve ry travel outside the place of duty for medical reasons cannot be treated as medevac for stable nonemergency cases the staff member should take sick leave or annual leave to obtain dical treatment or care required it is evident in this case that the staff member could ve deferred the medical attention and it should not have qualified for an evacuation the ex isting instructions are already clear on this matter whereby all elective surgical medical or d ental procedures should be planned in conjunction with home leave or family visit trave l routine medical checkups of an existing condition and planned with the doctors in advance should also not fall under the category of medical evacuation 38 oios observed instances of repeated evacuations for the same staff member or dependents and noted case where staff members dependent was medically evacuated with accompanying parent eleven times from 1993 to 2004 to their place of choice united states of america whereas the recognised place was nairob i for the second medevac the physician had recommended jordan but the staff mem ber preferred the united states it appeared that the repeated evacuations were more in the nature of periodical medical examinations in this case the staff member apparen tly did not claim mip reimbursements for any medical treatment 39 oios would highlight that noncompliance with t he medevac guidelines results in unnecessary and avoidable costs oios appreciates t hat medevac decisions are taken by trained medical staff but would nevertheless urge in view of the rapidly escalating numbers of evacuations that the fundamental principles of med ical evacuations are applied c appendix d of the medevac instructions 40 appendix d contains guidelines for physicians dvising on evacuations these comprise list of chronic conditions with potentia l for lifethreatening outcomes or complications conditions that are generally not co nsidered for evacuation as well as conditions that do not qualify from the data provi ded by the medical service oios observed that several evacuations were authorised for dental treatments eye conditions skin disorders tests and other illnesses which appeared not to qu alify for medevac the absence of adequate facilities though sine qua non for medical evacuations does not by itself justif an evacuation the other essential prerequisites are acute illnessinjury for international staff and life threatening medical emergency for local staf f d improvements to standard authorisation letter f rom the medical service 11 41 the standard email approval issued by the medic service requires more clarity in certain aspects sometimes the medevac authorisatio n was unclear about whether the place of the evacuation was the recognised place place f choice or another place approved by the medical service it is also important that where ac companiment is justified this should be made apparent in the approval letter these issues are important to determine dsa eligibility oios suggested that template be developed for com mon use medical evacuations and implications for mip re imbursement 42 outlined in memorandum ref pas1200401372 d ated 6 september 2004 dhrm had stipulated that where local staff member is n authorized medical evacuation at the authorized place for medical evacuations the reimb ursement will be made according to the prevailing patterns of charges at the place where t he services were rendered this implies that the reasonable and customary cost principle which is fundamental to the mip rules longer applies in case of medical evacuations since the n umber of medevacs has been increasing for local staff this change could have significant cost implications for the unhcr 43 moreover the september 2004 circular refers to the authorised place for medevacs and it was not clear to oios how this will be treat ed in relation to the recognised place mentioned in the medevac instructions the medevac instructions acknowledge only three possible destinations for evacuations the r ecognised place and the place of home leavecountry of recruitment for local staff and p lace of staff members choice the use of the phrase authorised place in the mip statutes and s eptember 2004 memorandum is therefore unclear and should be reexamined by dhrm 44 dhrm stated that the changes made to the mip rules were to harmonise them with those of undp and unicef and the modifications mad have not adversely affected the financial viability of the scheme dhrm added that the authorized place of medical evacuation is the particular place the medical ser vice approves the evacuation to the location where special treatment is available the desig nated place is the place that has been designated by the medical service for evacuations for mip reimbursement purposes what is essential is the authorized place only since thi s is the place where the medical service considered that the patient would receive adequate medical care 45 in oios opinion the instructions still lack s ome clarity for instance this would imply that even if medevac were undertaken to the place of staff members choice as opposed to the recognised place the reimbursement would be done on the basis of costs prevalent at the place chosen by the staff member to cite hypothe tical example local staff member whose recognised place for medevac is nairobi chooses to be medically evacuated to london and the medical service approves this stipulating that the medevac is up to the cost to nairobi this limits the dsa and travel costs to that of nai robi but as the medical service had approved the medical evacuation the mip reimbursem ent would be done on the reasonable customary charge at uk rates this oios assumes wo uld be significantly higher than those of nairobi oios suggests in such cases the reimbursem ent should be limited to reasonable and customary charges at the recognised place recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management sh ould in 12 view of the changes introduced by its 6 september 2 004 memorandum and to avoid ambiguity clearly define t he meanings associated with the terms recognised place and uthorised place where mip reimbursement is made for treatment obtai ned at the staff members place of choice as opposed to the r ecognised place dhrm should consider limiting reimbursement to reas onable and customary charges at the recognised place rec 0 6 f duration for medical evacuations 46 oios observed that the initial duration of mede vacs was always approved at 15 days the maximum number of days for which staff c an retain solar or other benefits while in receipt of dsa for medevac oios pointed out tha t the duration should be limited to the period certified by the referring physician dhrm xplained that the duration of 15 days was fixed taking into account the movement from field l ocations medical attention required and the return journey back to the duty station dhrm felt that in view of the remoteness of some of the field locations such period is the minimum r equired oios appreciates that benchmark may have to be established but notes that in the ears reviewed more than 40 per cent of persons were evacuated for less than 15 days this benchmark therefore should be reviewed downwards 47 table vi presents the data regarding the durati on of medical evacuations during the review period table vi duration of medevacs 2002 2003 2004 2005 up to aug ust 2005 15 days 134 140 161 93 15 45 days 103 147 149 85 45 days 41 55 56 27 totals 278 342 366 205 48 from the data provided by the medical service oios observed that there were 179 cases of medevacs in unhcr exceeding the limit of 4 5 days mentioned in the instructions oios observed that at unon the maximum period for w hich dsa could be paid was fixed at 45 days and beyond this period the staff member wa s required to be on sick leave and dsa was paid the undp instructions relating to medevac also stipulate that payment of dsa is permitted for maximum of 45 days also the i nstruction stai dated 21 september 2000 states in paragraph 85 that dsa can be paid normally only for up to 45 days as there are several such cases in unhcr beyond 45 days whi ch resulted in significant costs oios is of the opinion that practices should be harmonized 49 oios does not question the need for long durati on medevacs when medically and clinically justified nonetheless in some cases re viewed the reason for the extended period was not apparent in guinea for instance oios note d staff members was medically differences with table i due to inconsistent data provided by the medical service according to the medical service with the impending installation of medigate software such inconsistencies are expected to be sorted out 13 evacuated to london with an accompanying parent f rom 12 august to 10 december 2003 the first appointment with the doctor however only took place on 8 september 2003 almost month later the patient was signed as fit to trave l as of 13 november 2003 yet the evacuee returned only on 10 december 2003 the staff member received dsa amounting to us 47000 paragraph 52 of the medevac instructions pr ovides that in nonemergency cases travel should not commence until the appointment wi th the pertinent specialist has been made oios considered the payment of dsa from 13 august t hrough 7 september and from 13 november to 10 december estimated at some us 117 00 as inappropriate and recommended recovery the representation agreed to recover the overpaid mounts recommendation head2right the unhcr medical service when authorising evacuati ons should ensure that in accordance with unhcrs instruct ions travel does not commence in nonemergency cases until medi cal appointments have been properly scheduled to avoid unnecessary stay at the place of evacuation and b prolonged vacuations are properly evaluated prior to granting further approv als rec 07 50 dhrm accepted that in nonemergency cases advance travel should not be permitted and lapses if any in the implementation would be ad dressed through the medical service g medevac official mission and solar payments 51 oios observed variances between agencies in the instructions regulating solarmsa on medevac and official missions outside the special operations area soa or mission area in unhcr both for official missio ns and medevac solar continues to be paid in addition to dsa for the first 15 nights from the 16 th night only dsa would be paid oios noted that in accordance with the united natio ns instruction stai20025 dated 7 june 2002 on mission subsistence allowance during offic ial business outside the mission area including when staff member is on authorised medi cal evacuations only the accommodation portion of the msa is paid 52 as already mentioned per the current instructi ons both solar and dsa can be paid for the first 15 days of the medevac and from the 1 6 th day solar ceases if the medevac is expected to last for more than 15 days f rom the outset then solar is discontinued from the date of departure under thes procedures it is unlikely that staff member would state the medical evacuation will be f or more than 15 days if the solar is forfeited moreover as the initial authorization g iven by the medical service is normally 15 days it is unlikely that it will be expected to t for more than 15 days from the outset oios does not question the medical assessment in individ ual cases but is concerned about pattern that stretches entitlements to the maximum at siderable cost to unhcr 53 in oios opinion there was need for greater c larity on instructions regarding payment of dsa and solar to staff member who accompanies spouse or dependent on medevac oios observed the case of staff member posted to an soa who accompanied his spouse on two medevacs to johannesburg lasting 15 days and 22 days respectively in terms of paragraph 40 of the medevac instructions the absence of the staff member was charged to annual leave the staff member accompany ing the spouse was entitled to dsa at 14 the applicable rates additionally as the staff mem ber was on annual leave he was entitled to solar for the entire duration even though the abse nce from the soa was more than 15 days in the second instance thus oios observed situa tion where the staff member was on annual leave while at the same time receiving dsa and sol ar payments given the circumstances in oios view only one entitlement ie dsa or sol ar should be paid 54 moreover other arguments can be adduced for qu estioning the granting of solar to those who have been medically evacuated the januar 2004 solar instructions state that solar will be paid during absences on sick leave i n the soa and since by definition medevac is undertaken to place outside the soa n solar should be paid to staff on medical evacuation since the absence of the staff member is charged to sick leave dhrm did not agree and stated that medevac was equivalent to official travel and if solar was paid for the first 15 days of mission the same should pply to absence on medevac oios would refer to the instructions applicable to peacekeepin g operations where during official mission outside the mission area only the accommodation po rtion of the msa is payable recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management sh ould review the justification for paying solar during of ficial missions and medevac with the aim to harmonize it with the u nited nations where only the accommodation portion of msa is paid when staff member is on official travel or medica l evacuation rec 08 55 dhrm have noted the recommendation and would examin the policy in relation to solar payments during medevacs financial aspects in the field 56 the rate of dsa payable to staff proceeding on medical evacuations depends upon whether the evacuation is to the recognised place the place of choice or to the place of home leave for international staff or within country for local staff the rate also changes if the evacuee was hospitalised during the course of the vacuation in all cases the payment of subsistence allowance is further subject to the pro duction of hotelaccommodation receipts to determine the appropriate rate the subsistence all owance payable to the escort also varies depending upon the circumstances the medevac instr uctions governing subsistence allowance are complicated and field offices often m ake mistakes in its computation the inconsistent interpretations of the rules often res ulted in overpayments and subsequent recoveries for instance when local staff are medi cally evacuated within the country of recruitment only actual hotel expenses can be reim bursed up to 50 per cent of the standard applicable dsa without hotel receipts subsisten ce allowance payments can be made oios identified mistakes in kenya chad and ugandan resu lting in overpayments that had to be recovered 57 the failure to submit hotelaccommodation recei pts with medevac travel claims has been frequently noted the amounts involved for dsa can be significant and oios noted that field offices proceeded with payment without the ap propriate documents in sudan uganda guinea greece and yemen in one county five medic evacuations were undertaken from 15 2002 to 2004 and dsa of some us 50000 was paid t he hotel receipts were subsequently found to be forged highlighting the importance of scrutinizing supporting documents prior to determining eligibility of payment of entitlements 58 oios also noted errors in the calculation when the medevac destination is other than the recognised place the amount reimbursed should be the travel costs only to the recognised place in yemen oios found two cases where travel costs were reimbursed without limiting these to the cost up to the recognised place oios also noted that medevac costs were not charged to the correct accounting codes making it difficult to obtain an accurate assessment of the expenditures incurred recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management sh ould in view of the numerous errors identified by oios sim plify instructions regarding medevac travel claims includ ing payment of subsistence allowance to assist field offices in complying with the guidelines rec 09 head2right the unhcr division of human resources management sh ould consider limiting the reimbursement of accommodatio n for medevac to the actual accommodation cost up to 50 p ercent of the applicable dsa rate rec 10 59 dhrm have noted the observations and will review th existing procedures with the aim to improve them f staffing at the medical service 60 the medical and administrative procedures assoc iated with evaluating and approving evacuations are detailed and complex the medical s ervice informed oios that they do not possess adequate manpower resources to cope with th constantly increasing numbers of evacuations an epau study also observed in their 2 004 evaluation that to carry out the functions required from the unhcr medical service nd to manage the service itself the current number of medical staff is insufficient th is leads to more reactive approach to the work than considered desirable in the interest of s taff health and containing health costs the current complement of two doctors two nurses thre laboratory technicians three medical secretaries and one administrative secretary was co nsidered by the epau as case of severe understaffing of this staff complement only fe w staff members not full time were actually involved in administering medical evacuations and i t is evident that additional staffing will improve record keeping and other processes 61 as result of the existing heavy workload hig her level planning and coordination of medical evacuations activities by the medical servi ce have been minimal with management generally focused on the daytoday operations mean ing that issues are only dealt with as they arise oios recommended that dhrm conduct an assess ment of the additional workload generated by medical evacuations at the unhcr medic service and consider if additional resources are required dhrm informed oios that under the going process f reforms and 16 restructuring of unhcr the concerns expressed by ios would factor in to the processes v acknowledgement 62 i wish to express my appreciation for the assis tance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of the
