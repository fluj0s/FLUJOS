to transmission lines that are congeste d in several regions of united states several factors have contri buted to the lack of new transmission capacity first there is general consensus that siting new lines is difficult having needed approval of all states in which the transmissi on line will be located second some have argued that the pricing mechanism for transmission has been deterrent for

utility industry is inherently capital intensive at the same time the industry must operate under changing and sometimes unpred ictable regulatory system at both the federal and state level inconsistent rules and authorities can result in inefficient operation of the interstate transmission system the electric transmission system has been affected by combination of factors that has resulted in insufficient investment in the physical infrastructure the transmission system was developed to fit the regulatory framework established in the 1920 federal power act1 utilities served local customers in monopoly service territory the transmission system was not designed to handle large power transfers between utilities and regions enactment of the energy policy act of 1992 epact922 created tension between the regulatory environment and existing transmission system epact92 effectively deregulated wholesale generation by creating class of generators that were able to locate beyond typical service territory with open access to the existing transmission system the resulting competitive market encouraged wholesale interstate power transfers across system that was designed to protect local reliability not bulk power transfers the blackout of august 2003 in the northeast midwest and canada highlighted the need for infrastructure and operating improvement s however conflict exists between the apparent goal of increasing competition in the generation sector and assuring adequa transmission capacity and management of the system to move the power additions to generatin g capacity are occurring at more rapid pace than transmission additions the trad itional vertically integrated utility longer dominates the industry structure3 in addition demand for electric power continues to increase unresolved regula tory issues that have emerged after 1992 have resulted in considerable uncertainty in the financial community as result of all of these factors investment in the transmission system has not kept pace with demand for transmission capacityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32075crs2 4 pl 10958 5 order certifying north american electric reliability corporation as the

are charged separately for generati on transmission and dist ribution nine states led by new york filed suit arguing that the federal power act gives ferc jurisdiction over wholesale sales and interstate transmission and leaves all retail issues up to the state utility commissions enron in an amicus brief argued that ferc clearly has jurisdiction over all transmission and ferc is obligated to prev ent transmission owners from discriminating against those wishing to use the transmi ssion lines on march 4 2002 the us supreme court ruled in favor of ferc and held th at ferc has jurisdiction over transmission including unbundled retail transactions 9 transmission lines generally carry bulkpower transfers between utilities and move power to load centers distribution lines move power to ultimate customers subtransmission is sometimes considered transmission and other times considered distribution for regulatory purposes 10 exempt wholesale generators may sell elect ricity only at wholesale ewgs may be located anywhere including foreign countries before enactment of epact05 utility generators were limited by the public u tility holding company act of 1935 puhca to operate within one statepower act with retail consumers paying one price that includes transmission distribution and generation this is referre d to as bundled transaction in states that have restructured consumers are b illed for separate tran smission distribution and generation charges this is referred to as unbundled electricity service ferc regulates all transmission includi ng unbundled retail transactions8 generators of electricity need to move their power to their ultimate customers through the transmission system the current system allows for power transfers within but not between three major regions of the united states the area west of the rockies western interconnection xas and the eastern interconnection transmission lines and distribution lines are categorized by their voltage rating in general transmission lines are typically rated 230 kilovolts kv and higher 765 kv is the highest installed subtrans mission systems are 69 kv to 138 kv and distribution systems are rated less than 69 kv9 existing transmission infrastructure was designed to accommodate the old syst em of central station power plants with nearby customers since enactment of th energy policy act of 1992 there has been an increase in interstate bulk power transfers purpose for which the existing system was not designed the energy policy act of 1992 epact92 created new categ ory of

its openaccess transmission tariff policy with orders 888 and 889 making it easier fo r merchant generators to gain access to the transmission grid nd requiring utilities to functionally unbundle their operations in practice this means that utilitys generation and transmission operations must be conducte d separately without shar ing of resources books and records some states that have opened their retail markets to competition including california have required utilities to divest of either transmission and distribution or of generation in these states most u tilities have divested ge neration assets and maintained their transmission and distribu tion business by july 9 1996 all utilities that own or control transmission had filed single openaccess tariff with ferc that provides transmission service to eligible wholesale customers at comparable terms to the service that the utilities provide themselves some merchant generators asserted that they continued to be discriminated against by incumbent transmission utilities and were denied access to the system orders 888 and 889 established pro fo rma openaccess transmission tariff pro forma oatt many argued that this pro forma

institute eei survey of transmission investment historical and planned capital expenditures 19992008 washington dc may 2005 p 3physical limitations three types of constraints limit the tran sfer capability within the transmission system thermal constraints voltage constraints and system operating constraints thermal constraints limit the capability of transmission line or transformer to carry power because the resistance created by the movement of electrons causes heat to be produced overheating can lead to two possible problems the transmission line loses strength which can reduce the expected life of the line and the transmission line expands and sags between the supporting towers this presents safety issues as the lines approach the ground as well as reliab ility concerns if transmission line comes in contact with the ground trees or other objects the transmission line will go off line and not be able to carry power voltage can be likened to the pressure inside the transmission system constraints on the maximum voltage levels are set by the design of the transmission line if voltage levels exceed the maximum shortcircuits radio interference and noise may occur low voltages are also problem and can cause customers equipment to malfunction and can damage motors system operating constraints refer to reliability and security maintaining synchronization among generators on the sy stem as well as preventing the collapse of voltages are major aspects of the role for transmission operators15 north american electric reliability council guidelin require utilities to be able to handle any single outage through redundancy in the system when practical nerc recommends the ability to handle multiple outages within system reducing the constraints on the system through technol ogy improvements is one way to increase the transfer capability over existing lines16 current issues the regulatory regime has shifted the operations of the electric utility industry creating larger and more fre quent bulk power transfers across transmission system largely designed for local intrastate service however investment and infrastructure has not kept up with increases in the bul k power transfers and electricity demand through 1998 electricity demand had been growing at 2 to 3 per year and additions to the transmission system had b een averaging about 07 per year actual annual transmission investme nt had declined from 5 trillion in 1975 to about 225 trillion in 199817 reversing this trend between 1999 and 2003 transmission investment increased at 12

investorowned utilities increased by 28 annually in comparison sales of electricity from investorowned electric utilities and their affiliates to enduse customers increased by 07 annually between 1999 and 200318 so in addition to generation capacity shortages in certain re gions of the country this long period of insufficient transmission investment has led to transmission lines that are congested in several regions of united states as is shown in figures 1 and 2 many lines in the eastern interconnection and western interconnection are congested th is problem is not new in 1987 crs noted that bulk power transmission lines in many parts of the country were already operating at or near capacity and the chief capacityrelated barrier to bulkpower transfers wheeling was that the transmission system was not built for bulkpower transfers19 according to nerc the number of requests to use the transmission system that were denied because of congestion tlrs rose from 305 in 1998 to 1494 in 2002 by 2005 there were 2397 tlrs20 over the next 10 years the line miles of highvoltage transmission are expected to increase 6 in contrast to 20 expected increase in generation demand and capacity21 if this projection is accurate further pressure on reliability could occur in several regions22 siting one reason transmission lines have not been built in recent years is the difficulty in siting them even t hough the transmission of electricity is considered interstate commerce the siting of transmission lines has been the responsibility of the states in addition veral federal agencies play various roles in the siting process primarily with rega rd to environmental impacts siting and building transmission lines have been ve ry difficult because of citizen opposition as well as inconsistent siting requirements among states while controversial since the blackout of 2003 ferc commissioners supported federal siting backstop authority23 in addition the elect ric industry is in

of the existing transmission system can be increased without siting ne w lines in addition new generation can be sited closer to demand reducing the need to use the transmission system additional transmission lines could be added to existing rightsofway or in some cases existing towers could be restrung with higher capacity lines however in some cases reliability levels would increase with the redundancy of new tran smission lines sited on new rightsofway storms and other ev ents that may cause physical damage to one area may not affect transmission lines in another part of state or region many transmission systems could increase the capacity of the transmission system with technology improvements while many new tec hnologies would require significant capital investment one study by the new york independent system operator concluded that relatively inexpensive equipment upgrades could significantly increase the line ratings and could reduce congestion27 the study indicated that significant number of transmission lines operate below their thermal limits due to equipment limitations at substations by remediating those limitations with relatively inexpensive equipment g disconnect switches bus connectors relays etc according to the new york study operation at th ermal capacities could be reached with little or ri sk of service interruption other technological improvements to in crease transmission capacity and allow the transmission system to be operated more efficiently include upgrading transformers retrofitting electromechanical devices with digital devices to allow operation of the system closer to thermal limits and restringing existing towers with aluminum conductor composite core cable these would require significant capital investment

lines often carry electricity that has been contracted to move on different path as more bulk power transfers are occurring on the transmission system tran smission owners not belonging to rtos regional transmission organizations are not always being compensated for use of their lines because contract path rarely follows the actual flow this creates disincentive for transmission owners to increase capacity30 under order 200031 ferc stated its interest in incentive ratemaking and in particular performancebased ratemaking those in fa vor of incentive ratemaking argue that incentives are needed 1 to encourage participation in regional transmission organizations rtos32 2 to compensate for perceived increases in financial risk because of pa rticipation in regional tran smission

electricity anywhere within the regional transmission organization postage stamp rates eliminate socalled rate pancaking or series of accumulated transmission charges as the electricity passes through adjacent transmission systems and increases the pool of available generation on the other hand by moving to postage stamp rates customers in lowcost transmission areas may see rate increase and highcost transmission providers in the same area may not recover embedded costs because cost s are determined on regional basis in early 2003 ferc began to consider ra ising the rate of return as way

report rl32728 electric utility regulatory reform issues for the 109th congress however in 2000 the cost of transmission accounted for less than 10 of the final delivered cost of electricity34 while the industry is in favor of increasing the return on equity as way of providing an incen tive to invest consumer groups are opposed to such proposals because of the pot ential to increase consumer rates35 as required by 1241 of epact 05 ferc i ssued its final rule on transmission pricing on july 20 200636 although the order identifies specific incentives that ferc will allow the burden remains on an applicant to justify the incentives by showing that the new transmission capacity will reduce the cost of delivered power by reducing transmission congestion or will ensure reliability the applicant will also have to show that the rate is ju st reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential37 regulatory uncertainty for many years transmission owners and investors expressed concern that the regulatory uncertainty for electric utilities is inhibiting new investment in and construction of transmission facilities for example repeal of the public utility holding company act of 1935 puhca had been debated since 1996 without clarifi cation on whether puhca w ould be repealed utilities stated that they were reluctant to invest in infrastructure it was argued that repeal of puhca could significantly expand the ability of utilities to diversify their investment options38 epact05 repealed puhca and ferc and state regulatory bodies are given access to utility books and reco rds removing this uncertainty could encourage additional investment in the transmission system in addition ferc has been moving towa rd requiring partic ipation in regional transmission organizations

power sector has begun to experience an upward tr end in bond ratings during the first half of 2006 the us power sector showed positive ratings gains with company bond ratings being upgraded more often than downgraded43 conclusion for the transmission system to operate efficiently and reliably many observers argue that the tensions between economic regulatory and technology issues must be balanced currently the transmission industr is widely viewed as being in state of disequilibrium with significant regula tory and economic uncertainty in addition regional differences complicate regulato ry solutions large component of regulatory uncertainty originates with piecemeal appro ach to electric utility restructuring on both the federal and st ate level in 1991 crs stated that comprehensive regulatory reform of the electric power industry is neither desirable nor practical without clearer vision of what form the industry should take too many uncertainties leave the future nature of the electric power industry such that major overhaul of regulation would involve significant risks to the present stability of available and reliable electric power with little guarantee of improved service or lower costs44 the energy policy act of 1992 introduced competition to wholesale electric transactions without provisions for comprehensive plan to address reliability issues and the development of effici ent wholesale markets in addition many states have passed legislation or issued regulatory orders to introduce retail competition each with its own set of rules for utilities to follow provisions in epact05 are intended to address many issues left outstanding by epact02 although regulatory certainty may improve as result of epact05 clear er vision of the role of competition in the electric power industry and additional investment in transmission infrastructure and technology continues to be necessary to support an adequate and reliable transmission system
