library network in 1971 year after the agencys creation these libraries house wide range of scientific technical and legal information epa staff use this information in multiple ways to carry out the agencys mission such as the setting and enforcement of pollution control standards epas libraries also serve the public over time epa had expanded its network into 26 libraries operated by different agency offices depending on the specialized nature of the collections epa began restructuring it s libraries in fy2007 in an effort to transition from walkin services to electronic dissemination of its collections as part of this restructuring epa closed five of its libraries at the beginning of fy2007 including its headquarters library in washington dc epa also has altered access at some of its libraries that have remained open table 1 indicates the operating status of each library in epas network as of august 2007 epa reports that walkin services remain available to the public at most of the libraries that remain open but that an appointment is required or preferred at some libraries certain libraries also have restricted access to epa staff and only offer reference services to the public via telephone fax or email epa is refining its plan to restructure its library network and reports that it will not make any further changes to its library services until the plan is completed

this study concluded that epas libraries provide substantial value to the agency and the public with benefittocost ratio ranging between 21 and 571 these benefits are based on time saved in finding information with the assistance of librarian the calculated benefittocost ratio varied depending on the dollar value ascribed to time savings and the type of service provided the oei study also noted

provided to respond to technological changes in how users obtain information as well as future budget uncertainties affecting the agencys ability to continue services in their present form in august 2006 epa released an initial plan to restructure its libraries with implementation starting in fy20072 epa determined that the utility of some of its libraries had declined as the agency made more information available through the internet and as heightened security at its facilities led to fewer public visitors because of these factors the plan recommended the closing of epa s library at its headquarters office in washington dc and its libraries in regions 5 6 and 7 epa closed these four libraries at the beginning of fy2007 as indicated in table 1 epa also has closed its chemical library and has altered access at several other libraries that remain open these latter changes were not identified specifically in epas original fy2007 restructuring plan although walkin services are longer available at the libraries that have closed epa reports that the public will have access to these collections through the internet and will continue to be able to request items by telephone fax and email epa also reports that its staff will continue to have access to its collections via the agencys intranet and internal agency exchanges although many items in epa s collections are available through the internet not all items are in electronic format epa is in the process of digitizing its collections and selecting paper collections for archiving in agency repositories and possibly other libraries including the library of congress epas initial restructuring plan also indicated that some dated materials may be discarded the plan provided guidelines for epa staff to determine how the collections are to be managed but did not identify which specific materials would be retained disbursed or discarded nor the time frame within which that process would be completed members and committees of congress library professional associations public interest groups and individuals expressed numerous concerns about the restructuring of epa s library network as the agency proceeded with the implementation of its plan and closed the abovementioned libraries in october 2006 prior to the closings employee unions representing epa staff also had written to the house and senate appropriations committees in june 2006 expressing their concerns about the availability of information needed to carry out the agencys mission 3 in response to this array of concerns the epa administrator announced temporary moratorium in january 2007 prohibiting the agency from making further changes to its library services for 90 days4 epa has extended the moratorium and indicates that it is reviewing its methods of delivering library services to make its collections available to epa staff and the public epa reports that further changes will be made to its library services until the agency has refined its restructuring plan and the final plan has been reviewed and communicated among affected stakeholders the agency has issued draft outline for the next version of its

agencys objectives and the procedures that it intends to develop to continue its transition to the electronic dissemination of its collections while continuing to provide an appropriate level of access to physical libraries and professional library staff what the agency would consider appropriate access is unclear g13g142g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 questions about the implementation of epas initial plan to restructure its libraries have been rooted in concerns about continued access to critical information needed to understand the effects of pollutants and contaminants on human health and the environment although epa states that the restructuring of its libraries is necessary element in its continued transition to the electronic dissemination of information opponents have raised numerous issues in regard to how this transition would occur and how certain collections would be affected among the primary concerns are which materials would be selected for retention dispersal to other libraries or disposal whereas epas initial restructuring plan provided guidelines for these decisions it did not include mechanisms to oversee how they are applied or means through which the public could comment on collections decisions questions were raised as to whether some materials that may be deemed of value to certain users could be permanently discarded of the collections that are retained it is uncertain which materials would be converted to electronic format and made available through the internet or physically archived epa also has noted that it will not be able to digitize copyrighted materials in its collections raising questions about continued access to these materials increased use of the internet for access to epa s collections also raises questions as to whether agency staff and the public may need to rely more heavily on themselves to find information epa more recently has confirmed on its website cited in table 1 that its remaining libraries will continue to offer reference services to the public via telephone fax or email there also have been questions about access to epa s collections while physical documents are being converted into electronic format epa reports that documents selected for electronic conversion will be catalogued and tracked while awaiting conversion and that agency staff and the public will be able to request these documents there is some uncertainty as to whether the time required to retrieve documents from storage may delay the availability of information converting the agencys physical collections to electronic format also could present technical challenges in terms of the quality of digitized it ems and in ensuring that the information remains in usable electronic format over the long term as data storage technologies change over time how these and other issues will be addressed in epas forthcoming library strategic plan is unclear

has closed or consolidated although the committee expressed its support for epa s efforts to make data and information available electronically it opposed further closures or consolidation of the remaining libraries without evidence of how the public would be served by those changes6 the committee directed epa to submit plan by december 31 2007 explaining how it would use the 2 million increase to reopen the libraries that the agency has closed and to maintain its collections in each region the house did not alter the presidents request for epas library network nor otherwise address this issue in passing its version of the bill hr 2643 hrept 110187 on june 27 2007 the senate appropriations committees recommendation would raise the funding level for epas library network to total of 8 million in fy2008 as indicated in table 2 the president had requested 6 million which would continue downward trend in funding each year since fy2005 this decline is largely because of reduced costs resulting from the closure of the agencys headquarters library chemical library and the libraries in regions 5 6 and 7 the decline also is due to reduced costs from changes in services at other libraries that have remained open even though five of the libraries have closed the presidents fy2008 budget request did include funding to manage their collections and to continue digitizing agency publications funding also would increase or remain constant for certain libraries in the network despite the overall downward trend the senate appropriations committees recommendation did not appear to alter these aspects of the presidents budget request but increased the total amount of the request to restore the libraries that were closed or consolidated in 2006 t able 2 appr opriations for ep
