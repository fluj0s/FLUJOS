military survivor benefit plan sbp was created in 1972 since its creation it has been subjected to number of substantial legislative changes this report describes the basic provisions of the military survivor benefit plan and all relevant changes or modifications that have occurred specifically the military survivor benefit plan is described and explained in terms of its eligibility provisions costs benefits and its integration with other federal programs including social security and veterans administration dependency and indemnity compensation for members and retirees of active duty military service and the reserve components both the reserves and national guard in addition tables and work sheets are provided to assist the reader in computing the costs and benefits available under this program nearly every congress since 1972 has in some way modified the provisions of the military survivor benefit plan these modifications have had significant effect on current and prospective participants and beneficiaries in nearly every instance these changes have made the sbp more generous furthermore these modifications involve complex issues and processes and are therefore

outlines the purpose and legislative background of providing benefits to the surviving dependents of deceased memberretiree of the uniformed services in certain cases individuals other than dependents can be designated recipients of survivor benefits this report describes the categories of beneficiaries eligible for survivor benefits under the military survivor benefit plan sbp the formulas used in computing the in come level including the integration of sbp benefits with other federal benefits and the costs of sbp participation incurred by the retiree andor the beneficiary1 under the sbp military retiree can have portion of his or her monthly retired pay withheld in order to provide after his or her death monthly survivor benefit 55 of base2 amount of military retired pay at the time of the retirees death to surviving spouse or other eligible recipients the cost of this protection is shared by the retiree in the form of reductions from monthly military retired pay after retirement the government and possibly the beneficiary under certain types of coverage the original intended purpose of the sbp and its antecedents is to insure that the surviving dependents of military personnel who die in retirement or after becoming eligible for retirement will continue to have reasonable level of income 3 coverage was later expanded to active duty personnel as well the survivor benefit plan was created by legislation enacted on september 21 19724 and has been modified by later legislation the sbp replaced the retired servicemans family protection plan rsfpp5 the rsfpp was replaced because it had number of unpopular features that made it unattractive the rsfpp could be expensive for the retiree the cost was approximately 023 of deducted retired pay per dollar of survivor benefits for retired member age 45 who elected to provide coverage for spouse who was 5 full years younger the rsfpp was intended to be actuarially neutral in terms of costsin other words the cost of this program was fully paid for by its participants the decision to elect rsfpp coverage had to be made by the prospective military retiree before his or her 18 th year of military service furthermore the methods used in computing the rsfpps cost and benefit could change between the time at which the servicemember elected to provide coverage and the time at which the member actually retired thus the costs and benefits remained an unknown quantity limiting the ability of the retiree to make future financial plans during its 19year history participation in the rsfpp never exceeded more than 15 of eligible military retirees it was expectedand has largely been proventhat the sbp would be significant improvement over the rsfpp in terms of 1 retirees of the uniformed services army navy marine corps air force and coast guard as well as retirees of the public health service phs and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa are eligible to participate in the survivor benefit plan this report emphasizes the provisions of the sbp as they relate to members or retirees of the armed forces 2 base retired pay is that amount of retired pay that the retiree selects to be used in determining the sbp benefit and cost this amount may not be greater than total monthly retired pay and may not be less than 1 635 monthly as of january 1 2006 or 2 total retired pay if smaller than 635 monthly this 55 maximum may include amounts received from other federal sources 3 us department of defense office of the secretary of defense military compensation background

the beneficiary or beneficiaries to the military retiree6 spouse only spouse and children children only persons with an insurable interest former spouse former spouse and children the type of coverage and the amount of coverage provided are factors used in determining the cost to the military retiree generally retiree is automatically enrolled in the sbp upon retirement at the maximum level of coverage to his or her respective surviving spouse and surviving dependent children unless the retiree elects not to participate to participate at lesser level of coverage elects other than spouse coverage or is ordered by court to provide such benefits to former spouse to participate at reduced level of coverage the retiree elects to have his or her base amount of retired paythat amount of monthly retired pay the retiree selects to be used in determining the sbp benefit and costbe less than his or her total retired pay subject to 635 minimum the maximum sbp benefit is 55 of base amount of military retired pay when the base amount and total retired pay are the same reduced coverage consists of 55 of the base amount of retired pay when the retiree elects base amount that is less than total retired pay 7 if retiree elects not to participate or to participate at reduced level of coverage the retirees spouse must be notified and in the case of such an election made on or after march 1 1986 the spouse must concur with the election for it to be effective 8 any decision not to participate or to participate at reduced level is usually irrevocable however under certain circumstances

coverage the intended sbp beneficiary must be widow or widower who was 1 married to the retiree at the time of retirement 2 married to the deceased retiree for at least one year prior to the retirees death or 3 the parent of child born of postretirement marriage the benefit considering income from all federal sources including social security and veterans benefitsattributable to military service was intended to be at least 55 of the base amount of retired pay the retiree was receiving at the time of deathwhich for maximum coverage is the same as total retired pay

entered the service andor the type of retirement the service member is entitled to receive the formulas are discussed below as the original computational formula and the flatrate formula military personnel who entered the service on or after march 1 1990 and who are not entitled to retired pay under either chapter 61 of title 10 us code retirement or separation for physical disability or chapter 67 retired pay for nonregular service ie disability retired pay or reserve retired pay will have their withholdings computed under the flatrate method those military personnel who first became member before march 1 1990 or those who have their retired pay computed under either chapter 61 or 67 regardless of the date of retirement will have their sbp withholdings computed under whichever alternative original or flatrate is more financially advantageous 9 the reduction in retired pay does not apply during any month in which there is eligible spouse or former spouse beneficiary reductions to retired pay are not considered taxable income g17g155g146g144g146g151g138g149g561g5g152g150g153g158g157g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g8g152g155g150g158g149g138g561 under this method the retirees contribution to th total cost of providing the sbp benefit is computed as 25 of the first 635 of the base amount of retired pay plus 10 of the remaining base amount of retired pay this contribution is withheld from the retirees total monthly retired pay10 for example hypothetical retiree e5 with 20 years of service in 2006 receives monthly base amount of military retired pay of 1263 see table 1 the cost of providing 9 members with base amounts of 1275 or more who retire on or after january 1 2004 will have their contributions determined using the flatrate method 10 if total retired pay is less than 635 per monthie 7620 per yearthe base amount must be equal to total retired pay as of september 30 2003 only 65 of military retirees received less than 7000 gross yearly

deducted from this hypothetical retirees base amount of monthly retired pay of 1263 to insure that upon the retirees death his or her surviving spouse will receive monthly survivor benefit of 55 of his or her base amount of retired pay or 694 per month if the retiree dies while receiving the 1263 amount if the retiree received more than 1263 per month in total military retired pay say as an e8 with 20 years of service or 2035but elected to provide less than the maximum coverage by using 1183 rather than total retired pay as the base amount the computation of costs and benefits would remain the same if an individuals retired pay increases as the result of costofliving adjustments colas the amount deducted from his or her retired pay and the potential sbp benefit to his or her designated survivor in this case his or her spouse usually will increase proportionately as well the costs of sbp protection and benefits are computed on the basis of retired pay rates at the time of retirement

april 1 1994 the obra did not delay the increase in sbp costs to each nondisability retiree enrolled in the sbp therefore sbp premiums were increased for the three months of retired pay payable on january 1 february 1 and march 1 1994 because dod could not reprogram its retired pay computers to accommodate the new law by january 1 1994 the three months of increased sbp premiums were taken out of the retired pay received on april 1 1994 12 this legislation also provided for the recomputation of rvivor annuities in the case of member who dies on active duty while qualified to apply for retired pay or who serves at least 20 years but is not eligible to receive retired pay as commissioned officer because heshe has not served at least 10 years as commissioned officer under this

benefits are first paid to the surviving spouse if the surviving spouse predeceases the retiree dies after becoming eligible to receive sbp benefits or becomes ineligible to receive sbp benefits through remarriage for example the sbp benefits will then be paid directly to the designated child or children if there is more than one child the sbp benefits are paid in equal shares to each child for as long as he or she remains eligible the cost of this coverage is additive to that of spouse only coverage and is determined on an actuarial 18 basis taking into account the age of the retiree the spouse and the youngest child for example retiree who is 45 years old with spouse who is 40 years old ie 5 full years younger than the retiree and child age 10 would have to pay an additional 010 of the base amount of retired pay in order to cover child or children in addition to the amount paid for spouse only coverage the hypothetical retiree mentioned above under spouse only coverage who has 8255 per month withheld from his or her retired pay see flatrate formula p 5 to provide an sbp benefit for his or her spouse would thus have an additional 126 1263 x 010 withheld per month in order to provide spouse and children coverage 19 the reduction in retired pay that represents the cost of child protection continues only for as long as there is at least one eligible child child becomes ineligible for an sbp benefit upon reaching age 18 or 22 if fulltime student20 child who marries becomes ineligible to receive sbp benefits regardless of age21 an eligible child who becomes incapacitated either physically or mentally may continue to receive sbp benefits for the duration of the incapacitation if the condition existed prior to the childs 18th birthday

military retiree regardless of whether or not there is surviving spouse eligibility under this coverage is subject to the same restrictions as child is or children are under spouse and children coverage under certain circumstances spouse coverage can be restored if spouse later becomes eligible the cost of this coverage is also computed on an actuarial basis and therefore subject to modification for example military retiree who is 45 years old has child age 10 and elects maximum coverage would have approximately 25 of his or her base amount 17 the term child includes an adopted child stepchild foster child or recognized natural child who lived with the participant in regular parentchild relationship it may be necessary for the child to prove dependency in order to be eligible to receive an sbp annuity 18 costs that are actuarially determined are based on probabilities of known life expectancy rates as well as interest and inflation assumptions 19 since the cost of coverage is computed on an actuarial basis the cost used in this example is subject to change actuarial figures provided by l giesecke office of the actuary defense manpower data center mar 31 1992 20 child who becomes ineligible because he or she reaches age 18 and then later becomes fulltime student prior to reaching age 22 may become eligible to receive sbp benefits while fulltime student 21

neither spouse nor dependent child at the time of retirement under this coverage beneficiary is defined as natural person with an insurable interest 22 in the retiree included in this category are relatives of the retiree such as parent sibling or child who may not qualify for sbp beneficiary status under spouse only spouse and children or children only provisions nonrelatives such as business partner may also be covered unlike other sbp options insurable interest must be elected at the maximum level the cost of insurable interest coverage is 1 10 of the base amount of military retired pay plus 2 5 of total base amount of retired pay for each full 5 years that the named beneficiary is younger than the retiree insurable interest coverage is thus more expensive than other types of coverage however the total cost to the retiree of this coverage cannot exceed 40 of total military retired pay in other words retiree who wishes to provide insurable interest coverage to person 30 or more years younger would have the maximum of 40 of the base amount of military retired pay withheld for example retiree who is 50 years old and receives 1263 per month as the base amount of military retired pay elects to provide protection to person 10 full years younger this retiree would have the cost of this protection computed as follows 10 of the base amount of retired pay or 126 plus 5 for each full 5 years the beneficiary is younger in this case the beneficiary is age 40 than the retiree the sbp costs would thus be 252 see table 2 according to language contained in the national defense

g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g156g561 the sbp was and for certain beneficiaries is integrated with social security sbp benefits are reduced or offset when the survivor reaches age 62 the rationale for this integration was 1 the sbp was intended to provide specific portion of deceased military retirees retired pay to the retirees surviving spouse or former spouse and 2 to recognize the governments employer contribution under both social security and sbp it was therefore considered appropriate by the congress that all sources of survivor benefits attributable to military servicedod and non dodbe considered in the computation of this specific portion of deceased retirees retired pay the cost of the sbp as well as the benefit rece ived by the survivors therefore reflect this offset 41 the offset occurs at age 62 regardless of when the survivor actually begins to draw social security benefits42 the 1972 legislation which established the sbp provided that those social security survivor benefits which surviving spouse or former spouse of deceased retiree is eligible to receive based solely on the military service of the retiree are subtracted from the survivors sbp payment the legislative history of the sbp statute indicates that the sum of 1 the reduced sbp payments plus 2 social security benefits earned as result of the retirees military service computed assuming the retiree lived to age 65 and the surviving spouse begins to draw social security survivor benefits at age 62 and other sources as well would provide the desired 55 of the base amount of retired pay the aggregate of these integrated benefits are used in determining the 55 in other words this plan was designed to provide coverage at rate less than what the survivor was entitled to on the basis of social security survivor benefits earned as result of military service however the eligible survivor may be too young to receive social security survivor benefits at the time the member or retiree dies therefore the sbp provides larger 41 in the legislative history of pl 92425 srept 921089 it was noted that adding survivor benefit plan similar to the one available to civil service retirees on top of the survivor benefits available from social security would provide plan superior to plans available to other government employees the proposed benefit program is designed to build upon the incomemaintenance foundation of the social security system 42 surviving spouse or former spouse who is the parent of child of the d eceased may also receive social security mothers or fathers benefits at any age as long as the child is under age 16 the sbp offset also applies to these mothers or fathers benefits if there is only one such child but does not apply if there are two or more children under age 16

recognition of eligibility for social security benefits regardless of the age when survivor begins to draw such benefits the comptroller general has noted that it was the intention of congress that the combined total of the offset sbp benefit and the social security survivor benefit would not be less than the pre offset sbp benefit the comptroller general noting congressional intention stated that the method of computing the offset was intended to be most generous formula to assure that widow will receive at least 55 percent of the mans military retired pay hrept 92481 92d cong 1 st sess

to authorize an offset which would amount to more than the comparable social security benefit we do not find that the statutory language of the survivor benefit plan requires or permits that result 43 thus it was the intent of congress that 1 the sbp benefit alone or 2 the offset sbp benefit and social security survivor benefit combined would be at least equal to 55 of the base amount of retired pay however the amount of social security survivor benefits can vary based on variety of factors these include 1 the survivors age when he or she begins to receive benefits 2 the age of the military retiree at the time of death and 3 whether or not the retiree had begun to receive social security benefits before death the actual social security benefit due to some or all of these factors may therefore be less than the hypothetical benefit computed under the assumptions of the sbp statute and on which the sbp offset is based as an example of the integration of the sbp and social security assume survivor is receiving an sbp income of 600 per month the survivor is also entitled to social security survivor benefits of 100 based on the military service of his or her deceased spouse or former spouse because of the survivors own employment this same survivor is eligible to receive social security retirement benefits of 150 per month see table 3 because the social security survivor benefit is less than the social security retirement benefit and therefore not payable the survivor only receives his or her own earned social security retirement benefit of 150 however because the survivor was entitled to social security survivor benefit of 100 based on the military service of the deceased spouse the sbp payment is reduced or offset by 100 when the survivor reaches age 62 thus

the members military service of 300 per month the social security survivor benefit is therefore 50 of the sbp income however because the offset can be more than 40 of the sbp income the sbp benefit will be offset or reduced at age 62 by the maximum of 40 600 x 40 240 and not by the entire 300 from social security the total amount the survivor will receive is 660 or 1 300 of social security

dod authorization act pl 99145 november 8 198545 congress modified the survivor benefit plan so that retirees and their prospective spouse survivors would know the exact amount of the sbp benefit that would be paid upon the retirees death congress did this by eliminating the integration with social security the house armed services committee report on the legislation stated the rationale for such change regarding the social security offset the principal problems associated with the social security offsets are twofold 1 the offset is not calculated until the time of death hence military members cannot predict the impact of the offset at the time of retiremen t when the decision to participate in the plan is made 2 the provision is difficult to explain and to understand hence many perceive that an earned benefit is unfairly taken away46 the new plan was labeled the twotier sbp under the twotier sbp surviving spouse of deceased military retiree will receive 55 of the base amount of military retired pay as survivor benefit as was the case under the original plan upon reaching age 62 the sbp benefit will be reduced automatically to 35 of the base amount of military retired pay for any surviving spouse or former spouse covered under the twotier sbp since it is expected that benefits for those eligible for the twotier plan would have been subjec ted to the full 40 social security offset ie reduction from 55 to 33 in sbp benefits at age 62 35 was considered an appropriate approximation under the twotier sbp spous or former spouse who becomes widow or widower after age 62 will receive an sbp payment equal to 35 of the base amount of military retired pay for example assume military retiree receives 1183 per month in military retired pay at the time of his or her death and has elected to provide the maximum sbp coverage of 55 of totaland baseretired pay see table 1 the retirees surviving spouse or former spouse will receive 650 per month sbp payment if under age 62 at the time the retiree dies as was the case before enactment of the twotier system when the surviving spouse or former spouse reaches age 62 the sbp payment will be reduced to 414 per month or 35 of the original base amount military retired pay of 1183 per month this reduction from 55 to 35 occurs at age 44 pl 96402 oct 9 1980 see us congress senate uniformed services survivor benefits amendment of

the complicated nature of the social security offset was not fully understood by many servicemembers retirees or widowers thus when the twotier sbp was introduced with its straight forward reduction of benefits at age 62 many felt that the twotier sbp represented reduction in their benefits or potential benefit over what was available under the social security offset sbp table 4 provides comparison of both plans computed for an active duty service member e7 who retires from the military at age 42 with 20 years of service upon retirement from the military the retiree is enrolled in th sbp and selects coverage for base pay amount equal 1670 this retiree then accepts civilian employment including social security deductions for another 15 years in this case the hypothetical retiree has sbp withholdings computed under the flatrate formula 1670 x 6510855 for th purposes of this example cost of living adjustments are not used all numbers represent reasonable approximations at age 59 the retiree dies the surviving spouse begins receiving military survivor benefit equal to 55 of base military retired pay or 1670 x 55918 per month in addition the retirees spouse was employed and earned social security benefits of 500 per month from this employment since the military retiree made social security payments both in the 47 under the social security offset the benefit of spouse or former spouse in this example could be reduced from 650 per month to 690 per month at age 62 ie 40 offset 48 retirement qualified includes those members of the reserve components who are qualified to

surviving spouse is eligible to receive social security survivor benefits of 631 per month based on the retirees entire career for the sake of this example 378 of the 631 are attributed to the social security contributions made during military service it is this 378 per month that will be taken into account under the offset plan as described above person in this case the surviving spouse receives hisher own earned social security benefits first thus this spouse will receive 500 per month in social security benefits in addition since the social security survivor benefit is greater 631 than the spouses earned benefit 500 the spouse will also receive the difference 631 500131 added to hisher own earned benefit 131 500 for total social security benefit of 631 per month in this example the

this offset occurs regardless of whether or not the spouse is actually receiving these benefits since the 378 of social security benefits based on the service members career is greater than 40 of the sbp 40 of 918 is rounded to 367 the sbp is offset by 40 or 367 rather than by entire social security benefit attributable to the members military service ie 918 367 551 thus at age 62 the surviving spouses sbp benefit is reduced from 918 to 551 per month when the total social security benefit is added in the surviving spouses total income is 551 631 for total of 1182 per month in other words prior to age 62 spouse receives the same sbp benefit under either the twotier or original offset formula sbp 918 however as this example shows at age 62 monthly benefits from both sbp and social security are greater under the twotier method 1215 than under the offset formula 1182 this example can only allude to some of the possible effects and interactions of the sbp and social security the amount of sbp benefits and the final income of the surviving spouse are dependent upon number of factors including but not limited to the retirees years of service rank at retirement year in which the retirement occurred social security payments made by the retiree the work history of the surviving spouse and the eligibility for v benefits as described below

plan provides sbp participants an opportunity to avoid or limit any reductions in sbp benefits that would occur at age 62 for spouse or former spouse this legislation also created an open season that would allow certain retirees to enroll in the sbp increase sbp coverage and opt to participate in the new supplemental sbp participation in the supplemental sbp is voluntary and not automatic in order to be eligible retirees must be participants in the twotier sbp those eligible to have their benefits computed under either the social security offset method or the twotier method had an opportunity to make an irrevocable switch to the twotier method in order to participate in the supplemental sbp such shift may not be wise change for all retireesparticularly for those who retired before or around 1957 or who may also be civil service retirees in certain instances the social security offset would be less than that which would occur under the twotier plan such limited reduction may negate the need for purchasing supplemental benefits members who are retirementeligible may elect to participate in the supplemental sbp prior to actually retiring should the member die while retirementeligible but before actually retiring that members designated spouse or former spouse would be provided benefits under sbp without the supplemental actual eligibility for supplemental benefits begins only after retired pay is withheld should retirementeligible member elec t to participate in the supplemental before retiring and later refuse sbp participation at retirement the supplemental sbp would be voided those members who are participants without an eligible spouse and who remarry may elect to participate in the supplemental sbp such an elec tion is irrevocable and

substantial change in the computation of the sbp benefit for those age 62 and over simply stated this law phased out the twotier and social security offset formulas discussed above the actual mechanics of this process depend on various scenarios generally speaking this language raised the minimum sbp benefit for those age 62 and over as follows on october 1 2005 the minimum sbp benefit for those survivors age 62 and older was increased to 40 this amount will increase to 45 on april 1 2006 50 on april 1 2007 and 55 on april 1 2008 in other words survivor who is age 62 or over and receiving 35 of base retired pay under the twotier method will see the benefit increase over the next few years to 55 this increase occurs without any additional cost to the retiree or the survivor

widow receiving say 48 of base retired pay as computed under the social security offset method will see change in benefits until april 1 2007 when the benefit will increase in 50 and again to 55 on

will make 2 or more years worth of supplemental payments in order to effectuate 6month or less benefit furthermore retiree who waited until april 1 2006 of the open season or later to sign up for supplemental coverage or one whose survivor will not turn 62 until after april 1 2008 will see benefit in electing the supplemental coverage during the open season for these reasons it has been suggested that retirees consider the limited benefits and additional costs of such an election before deciding to participate in the supplemental sbp during the open season and for the same reasons dod may elect not to offer supplemental coverage during this period

an issue concerning the payment of military retired pay to retirees who qualify for disability compensation from the department of veterans affairs v in 1891 congress passed language prohibiting what it regarded as dual compensation for either past or current service and disability pension57 as modified in 1941 the law prevented the concurrent receipt of both military nondisability retired pay and v disability compensation for those eligible for both military retired pay was offset or reduced dollar for dollar by v disability benefits numerous attempts to address this issue over the past few years or so resulted initially in the creation of combat related special compensation for certain disabled military retirees whose disability was direct result of military combat operations or training and whose disability is rated at 10 or more later in fy2004 congress authorized concurrent receipt for all retirees with at least 50 disability regardless of the cause of the disability 58 however 100 disabled retirees were entitled to immediate concurrent receipt effective january 1 200559 although such changes do not affect the receipt of an sbp annuity some have claimed that if concurrent receipt or special pays for military retirees is allowed such should also be afforded their survivors under this reasoning if military retiree is allowed to receive both military retired pay and v disability payments or other special pay it is only fair that the surviving spouse also receive both the sbp annuity and dic benefits critics contend that concurrent receipt was originally barred because congress viewed it as double dipping or paying someone twice for the same period of service these critics reason that allowing concurrent receipt to the retiree or the retirees survivor are forms of double dipping that are inherently unfair to the taxpayer in order to avoid this sbpdic offset surviving spouses of active duty personnel are allowed to designate their children if any as the recipient of the sbp benefit unlike retirees active duty 57 see crs report 95469 military retirement and veterans comp ensation concurrent receipt issues by robert l goldich and carolyn l merck 58

sbp is shared by the government and the retirees the amount paid by particular retiree varies depending on level of coverage years of payments years the survivor receives an annuity etc for active duty personnel who make contributions the benefit is essentially free certain retirees and organizations representing their interests have claimed that as originally structured withholdings from retired pay for sbp were expected on average 40 of the cost of this benefit further it is claimed that since retirees are living longer and since the government has manipulated the withholdings formula the retirees share has increased to more than 73 63 these claims are made in an effort to increase government payments into the sbp in hopes of increasing bene fits particularly with regard to the apparently successful effort of eliminating the reduction in benefits that occurs when the surviving spouse reaches age 62 in reviewing these claims number of points may be considered first as noted there is legal mandate for any ratio of retiree to government contributions second such claims of shift in the retireegovernment share appear to be based on selective use of retiree data third the claim that retirees are living longer and paying more ignores the obvious point that survivors too are living longer and collecting more fourth the abov history of this benefit shows that congress has expanded eligibility including free benefits to forgotten widows and active duty survivors increased benefits reduced costs will eliminate withholdings under the paidup provision afforded supplemental coverage etc at time did congress reduce the benefit as such the claims that the governments contribution to sbp have been reduced are unreliable nor do such claims rationalize the increase of benefits at age 62 for surviving spouses change that arguably creates superior benefit relative to those available to the survivors of other federal employees it is noteworthy that after the sbp was intr oduced the fy1973 cost to retirees was 36145000 with fiscal year payment to families of only 5700000 this is due to the relatively small number of participants who died shortly after signing up ten years later as more retirees signed 60 pl 108136 sec 645 november 24 2003 61 us congress conference committee national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 hrept 109360 109th

with taxpayers assuming an increasing cost of the program the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 directed comptroller general to report on the actuarial soundness of the survivor benefit plan65 on july 26 2006 the government accountability office issued its report66 the following is verbatim from that report results in brief the significant statutory sbp program changes implemented within the past 7 fiscal years that we reviewed have resulted in increased dod normal cost payments and annual treasury amortization payments to the fund in order to maintain the actuarial soundness of the fund when changes are made to sbp coverage or benefits the dod ooa office of the actuary calculates the necessary dod and treasury contributions to ensure that sufficient moneys are available to make all benefit payments to ligible recipients each year and that sufficient fund assets will be available in the future to liquidate all current unfunded liabilities according to the dod ooa estimates the significant sbp program changes 67 we reviewed have resulted in the following eliminating the reduction in surviving spouses sbp benefits when such spouses are also eligible for social security benefits at age 62 and thereafter increased the sbp liability by an estimated 252 billion as of september 30 2004 of this amount treasury and dod will be responsible for an estimated 237 billio n and 15 billion respec tively dods 15 billion liability includes 13 billion in normal costs for current active duty and fulltime reservists fulltime employees and 02 billion in normal costs for current parttime reservists part time employees periodically congress has allowed an open season for sbp enrollment the most current one being during fiscal year 2006 although the total effects of the sbp open season cannot be fully estimable for at least 2 years the estimated increase in the sbp liability will likely range from 31 million to 86 million 64 2006 retired military

dod will be responsible for 01 billion in normal costs related to current fulltime employees extending sbp surviving spouse or child benefits for all personnel who are killed in the line of duty and are not eligible for retirement at the time of their deaths increased the sbp liability by an estimated 72 million as of september 30 2001 of this amount treasury will be responsible for an estimated 28 million and dod will be responsible for 44 million in normal costs related to current fulltime employees the two potential changes to sbp benefits mentioned in section 666 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 would likely also result in increases to the dod normal cost payments and the annual treasury amortization payments to the fund as follows currently an unmarried dod retiree without dependent children may elect to have another person with an insurable interest as the sbp beneficiary however if that beneficiary dies designation of another insurable interest is not allowed using conservative assumptions the dod ooa calculated that the sbp liability would increase by an estimated 22 million if retirees were allowed the option of choosing second insurable interest of this increase treasury would be responsi ble for 2 million and dod fo r 231000 of dods 231000 211000 would be for normal costs related to current fulltime employees and 20000 for normal costs related to current parttime employees the survivors of veterans who die because of complications resulting from service connected disease or injury are entitled to dic benefits from the department of veterans affairs va 69 under current law sbp benefits for survivors of retired veterans are offset by any dic payments received the dod ooa calculated that eliminating the current offset requirement would increase the sbp liability by an estimated 129 billion of this amount treasury and dod would be res ponsible for 12 3 billion and 645 million respectively of dods 645 million 617 million would be for normal costs related to current fulltime employees and 28 million for normal costs related to current parttime employees enactment of these legislative changes would require the board of actuaries and the dod ooa to adjust dod and treasury payments subject to future appropriations by amounts necessary to offset any increased costs related to expanded benefits for this reason
