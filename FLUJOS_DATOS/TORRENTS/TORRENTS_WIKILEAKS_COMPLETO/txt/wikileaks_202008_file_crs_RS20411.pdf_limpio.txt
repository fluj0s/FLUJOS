security issues and implications for us interests crs report 98106 afghanistan current issues and us policy concerns and crs issue brief 94041 pakistanus relations introduction number of recent events have triggered concern in the united states about the degree of threat to us interests posed by islamic fundamentalist movements in the northern caucasus region of russia and in central and south asia us concern is heightened by credible open source information that some of these movements have connections to the islamic regime of the taliban movement in afghanistan and to the talibans guest as the movement refers to the exiled saudi dissident usama bin ladin in testimony before the senate foreign relations committee on november 2 1999 state department coordinator for counterterrorism michael sheehan stated that afghanistan has become new safehaven fora number of militant organizations from central asia including terrorists from uzbekistan and tajikistan on the other hand some believe that each islamic movement in the region operates within its own context and that any connections to the taliban are inconsequential for us policy the events discussed below have prompted debate over the talibans role in promoting regional instability these events began on february 16 1999 when thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20411crs2 1 rashid ahmed the taliban exporting extremism foreign affairs

uneasy peace with russia by launching an incursion into the province of dagestan in late august 1999 uzbek islamist rebels seized several villages in neighboring kyrgyzstan taking several foreigners hostage in the process on october 12 1999 pakistans army under general pervez musharraf deposed prime minister nawaz sharif in bloodless coup although all the factors contributing to the coup are beyond the scope of this paper many experts believe that pakistans islamic factions which have close links to the taliban contributed to the civilmilitary tensions that led to the coup 1 the chechnyadagestan conflict islamist forces have been fighting russian control of the northern caucasus periodically since the 18th century an earlier chechen war against russia began in 1994 full two years before the taliban movement took over control in kabul september 1996 in the current round of fighting in chechnya any assistance provided to the rebels by bin ladin or the taliban leadership could provide the rebels with greater capabilities to fight russia and in turn provoke more intense and indiscriminate tactics on the part of the russian military afghan assistance could also contribute to an expansion of the war to other parts of the caucasus where islamic extremists might join with others to take up arms against established governments including in georgia azerbaijan and elsewhere in the russian federation many of the allegations of afghan assistance to chechen rebels come from russian officials us government statements and documents appear to support at least some of the russian assertions although us officials have not publicly assessed the degree to which this afghanbased assistance is facilitating the chechen war effort the state departments review of international terrorism for 1998 states that insurgents led by chechen guerrilla commander of jordanian origin who goes by the name k hattab is receiving equipment and training assistance from islamic guerrillas from throughout the middle east and south asia 2 khattab has links to usama bin ladin according to the report which also asserts that bin ladins alqaida military base organization has sent trainers to chechnya3 presumably to terrorist training camps reportedly operated by khattab the taliban regime itself has given credence to russian and us assertions by issuing statement in november 1999 that it is the obligation of the worlds moslems to support chechnya and by offering the talibans internal opponents truce to jointly aid the chechen rebels httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20411crs3 4

kabul to push talks reuters september 29 1999 by openly inviting support from afghanbased elements khattabs own statements appear to corroborate us assertions he has publicly acknowledged participating in the afghan war against the soviet union 19791989 and in the failed 19921997 rebellion by islamists and other oppositionists against communist leadership in tajikistan in an early october 1999 interview with reuters khattab denied links with bin ladin but in an interview with qatari television station later in october he called the chechen conflict an issue for all moslems including bin ladin who has made great efforts in previous moslem issues4 khattab has publicly admitted knowing bin ladin during khattabs volunteer service in the afghan war where bin ladin helped recruit arab volunteers for the antisoviet war5 in other interviews khattab has equated the war against russian forces to the afghan war calling the new conflict an islamic jihad holy war against nonmuslim oppressors he has called for arab and other islamic fighters to join the chechen fight against russia as happened in the afghan case to help the chechens form an islamic state that would reach the oilrich caspian sea in the chechen conflict khattab is cooperating with another commander shamil basayev who places less emphasis than does khattab on transforming the chechen conflict into an islamic antirussian jihad press reports differ about whether or not basayev fought in the afghan war but basayev acknowledges having led an islamic contingent in abkhazia where oppositionists battled the government of georgia during 199293 basayev was key commander in the 199496 chechen conflict with russia uzbekistankyrgyzstan as noted above the february 1999 bombings in tashkent shattered the relative calm that had prevailed since uzbekistans independence in 1991 many experts believed that it was only matter of time before underground radical islamic movements would surface there with or without outside help the government immediately termed the bombings an assassination plot by islamic rebels and has since arrested numerous alleged conspirators and sentenced at least six to death in the bombings uzbekistan says that some of the ringleaders of the plot fled to neighboring countries including tajikistan and afghanistan among the alleged plotters according to uzbek officials were islamist guerrilla leaders tahir yuldashev and juma namagani who are coleader s of group called the islamic movement of uzbekistan imu independent confirmation of these allegations is lacking but press reports indicate that yuldashev has been in afghanistan since the bombings6 these reports if true would appear to confirm that the taliban regime is willing to host uzbek islamic dissidents although this would not necessarily mean that the taliban or bin ladin supported the tashkent bomb plot another interpretation is that the taliban is acting defensively responding to uzbekistans support for antitaliban uzbek militias in northern afghanistan httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20411crs4 7 davis anthony tensions in central asia janes defence weekly september 1 1999 p 20 8

and afghans in crossborder raid from bases in tajikistan to kyrgyzstan the insurgents seized several villages near the uzbek border and took seven hostages including four japanese geologists most press reporting suggests the insurgents were trying to establish base in kyrgyzstan from which to launch attacks into neighboring uzbekistan according to at least one press report bin ladin helped fund the insurgents8 in resolving the conflict kyrgyz lawmakers visited kabul to negotiate with yuldashev for the release of the hostages and kyrgyz and uzbek troops jointly drove the guerrillas back into tajikistan in early november tajikistan allowed the antiuzbek islamist forces including namangani to move peacefully into talibancontrolled afghanistan9 the move into afghanistan which occurred despite uzbekistans demands for the guerrillas extradition would certainly have required approval from the taliban leadership pakistan some experts believe that the talibans radical islamic ideology is increasingly influencing pakistani politics and policy the government of pakistan by all accounts was the chief backer of the talibans rise to power in neighboring afghanistan and it was the first to recognize the taliban as the legitimate government of afghanistan when the movement took kabul in september 1996 pakistani islamist group called the harakat ulmujahedin hum was placed on the state departments list of foreign terrorist organizations in october 1997 according to the departments terrorism report for 1998 the hum operates terrorist training camps in eastern afghanistan and its leader fazlur rehman khalil has been linked to bin ladin khalil signed bin ladins february 1998 pronouncement calling for attacks on us and western interests the state department report adds that some hum fighters were killed in the august 20 1998 us missile strikes on terrorist training camps in afghanistan the strikes were in retaliation for the alleged involvement of bin ladins organization in the august 7 1998 bombings of the us embassies in kenya and tanzania several other islamist groups in pakistan appear to be closely allied with the taliban regime in afghanistan according to the state departments terrorism report the leader of the islamist group called lashkaretaiba has declared jihadagainst the united states and the leader of similar group the lashkarejhangvi vowed to kill us citizens and offered his support to bin ladin the policy significance of these groups is that in conjunction with the hum they have conducted operations to challenge indian control of the disputed territory of kashmir divided between india and pakistan most recently during the summer of 1999 in doing so the islamist groups apparently enlisted thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20411crs5 10 us envoy sees good sign in pakistan over afghan policy reuters october 18 1999 11 us sanctions included ban on us trade with talibancontrolled afghanistan and froze us based taliban assets the sanctions include ban on international operations of the national airline ariana and freeze on taliban assets abroad these sanctions distinguish the taliban from afghanistan because the taliban do not hold afghanistans seat and the united states does not recognize the taliban as the legitimate government of afghanistan support of the pakistani military which wants to challenge india primarily on nationalist grounds the islamist groups blamed sharif for abandoning the struggle for kashmir when following request from president clinton on july 4 1999 he ordered pakistani military elements to cease their efforts in the indian portion of kashmir the military for its part considered the withdrawal national humiliation the pakistani islamist groups hailed the october 1999 military coup against sharif as did many other pakistani factions the coup came five days after sharif called on the taliban to close training camps in afghanistan which were hosting pakistani islamic militants this move which came amid clear tensions between sharif and the military suggests that he saw the islamists as allied with the military against him pakistans new leader general pervez musharraf is not considered an islamist and is believed not to want further confrontation with india over kashmir the us ambassador to pakistan said on october 18 1999 that there were positive signs that musharraf might work with the united states to pressure the taliban to yield bin ladin to justice and to stop hosting pakistani and central asian radical islamic groups10 musharrafs government was strongly critical of november 12 1999 rocket attacks on the us embassy in islamabad which some alleged were conducted by protaliban and pro bin ladin elements on the eve of the imposition of sanctions on the taliban regime on november 25 1999 pakistani police arrested eight lashkarejhangvi members who had allegedly received training in afghanistan some are concerned however that in order to maintain the support of more proislamic military officers under his command musharraf might continue pakistans generally protaliban policies implications for us policy depending on the scale and effectiveness of taliban assistance to these various movements us policy toward the taliban regime could continue to harden the united states established political dialogue with the taliban in 1994 shortly after it organized as an afghan political force and well before it took kabul although the administration initially viewed the taliban as force that could end two decades of civil war in afghanistan it has become progressively more critical of the movement especially over its refusal to yield bin ladin to justice for the august 1998 bombings of the us embassies in kenya and tanzania because of this refusal the administration by executive order 13129 of july 4 1999 imposed sanctions on the taliban and led the effort to sanction the taliban resolution 1267 of october 15 199911 the administration has kept up some contact with the taliban apparently believing that engagement coupled with sanctions could persuade the taliban to turn over bin ladin turkmenistan where islamist movements have not been strong also has chosen engagement with the taliban to facilitate regional trade and economic developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20411crs6 irancaspian seablack sea georgia armenia azerbaijan

in kabul regional radical islamic movements will find safe haven and the islamist threat will not automatically recede some who subscribe to this view maintain that united states should move toward policy of overthrowing the taliban by assisting the antitaliban factions in afghanistan that policy they argue although potentially difficult to implement offers the hope that successor government in kabul would end support for regional islamist movements new regime if it achieves power with us help would presumably also help the united states bring bin ladin to justice others criticize this approach maintaining that additional arms flows into afghanista n will prolong civil war there and cause additional human suffering they also worry that us role in the afghan conflict might tend to rally domestic and regional support for the taliban some believe that the united states could work with the new government in pakistan to pressure the taliban to end its support for regional islamic movements others believe that pakistan always looking for potential allies against neighboring india would be unwilling to curb the talibans foreign policy behavior
