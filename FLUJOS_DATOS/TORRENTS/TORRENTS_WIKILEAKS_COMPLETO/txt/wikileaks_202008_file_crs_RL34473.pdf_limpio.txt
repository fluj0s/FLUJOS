billion for the socalled base budget that is the cost of routine defense activities excluding us operations in iraq and afghanistan and an additional 70 billion allowance for warrelated costs controversies over various issues including provision that would incorporate into the legislation hundreds of earmarks listed in the committees report on the bill and an unrelated dispute over

from dods survivor benefit plan be reduced by the amount of any benefits received under the dependency and indemnity co mpensation program of the department of veterans affairs adopted 942 as result of the continuing contr oversy over the bills earmark provision other amendments were considered before the senate passed the bill september 17 by vote of 888 another result of the ear mark dispute was that the senate did not request conference with the house to reconcile the two versions of the defense bill instead members of the house and senate armed services committees negotiated informally compromise version of the natepassed bill s 3001 that authorized 6111 billion reduction of 14 billion fro m the administrations request all but very small amount of the au thorization bills reduction 14 billion was taken from the 70 billion requested for military operations in iraq and afghanistan this was the compromise ve rsion of s 3001 passed september 24 by the house and september 27 by the

fy2009 defense appropriations bill neither committee issued report on the bill and neither chamber considered bill on the floor and debated amendments instead what is in effect conference agr eement on fy2009 defense appropriations along with agreements on military constructionva and homeland security appropriations was considered as division c of h r 2638 the fy2009 continuing resolution in all the fy2009 defense ppropriations bill provides 4877 b illion in new discretionary appropria tions for the department of defense and related agencies2 which is 40 billion below the administrati on request and which in turn reflects the house and senate appr opriations committees allocations of funds to the each chambers defense subc ommittees under section 302b of the congressional budget act see below for discussion of the annual budget resolution and section 302 allocations for most programs the defense appropriations bill ultimately determines the level of funding congress provides the defense au thorization bill recommends amounts to be appropriated but with few exceptions the final amount of new budget authority actually made available is determined in appropriations bills appropriations bills may provi more or less than amount s in the authorization may eliminate funds for programs approved in the authorization nd may provide funds for new start programs not approved in an authorization bill the main exception is that defense authorization bills generally include statutory language that 1 establishes endstrength levels for uniformed personnel in each of the military services and reserve components and 2 sets amounts for pay and benefits of uniformed personnel the appropriations b ills therefore do not usually determine the amount of military pay raise thoug h they normally include funds for military personnel accounts based on pay rates bonuses bene fits and endstrength established in the annua l defense authorizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34473crs4 on military personnel matters the h ousesenate agreement on the fy2009 defense appropriations bill provides funds for 39 increase in base pay for uniformed personnel reduces funding to re flect lowerthan pla nned strength levels in some of the services and establishe s new health prof essionals scholarship program the bill also includes gene ral provision section 8116 that provides 72 million in fy 2009 for program to provide up to 500 per month in additional compensation to personnel kept on activ duty beyond the end of their normal enlistment periods under stop loss or der the provision does not however require that speci fic amount be paid on major weapon programs the agreement provides 25 b illion as requested for navy ddg 1000 destroyer procurement but splits the funding between two ships with 1 billion for second vessel and requires the navy to complete financing of the split buy in the fy2010 budget the agreement also requires the dod joint requirements oversight council comprised of deputy chie fs of the military services to review the navys decision to reduce ddg1000 acquisition and resume production of smaller ddg51 destroyers the measure eliminates 59 million in advan ce procurement for the ddg1000 program and adds 200 million in dvance procurement to preserve the option to build additional ddg51s in effect the bill keeps both the ddg1000 and ddg51 production lines open for now on other shipbuilding issues the bill adds 830 million as the first half of split funding to procure an additional 10th of the class lpd 17 amphibious ship provides 102 billion 100 million more than requested for the littoral combat ship lcs program rescinds 337 million in earlier lcs funding and directs that funding be allocated to two ships with contract awards as soon as possible cuts 170 million from the 348 million requested for replacement for lha class amphibious ships and shifts funds from the national defense sealift fund ndsf to the navy shipbuilding account where the ability to rea llocate funds is more constrained and adds 79 million to the 13 billion requested in advance procurement for virginiaclass attack submarines in order to fac ilitate production of two boats per year beginning in fy2010 the agreement provides 63 billion the amount requested to the navy and the air force for the f35 joint strike fighter program but trims procurement from 16 to 14 aircraft and allocates 430 million for alternate engine development perennial congressional addition to th administration request the bill provides 29 billion as reque sted to purchase 20 air force f22 fighters and adds 523 million for advance procurement of an additional 20 aircraft in future years the additional am ount is to keep the production line open and llow the next administration to decide whether to purchase more than the 181 aircraft now plannedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34473crs5 the bill shifts 62 million request ed in procurement and 832 million requested in rd for the kcx tanker replacement program into an already established ta nker replacement fund which is noyear transfer account which ts limit on the number of years for which funds remain availa ble and from which funds can be shifted as needed to other account s the bill also rescinds 72 million in previously appropriated f unds for the tanker program from air force rd and 2398 million from the tanker replacement fund the bill provides 36 billion for the armys future combat system adding 26 million to accelerate unm anned air and ground vehicle acquisition and moving funds betw een programs to reflect recent army adjustments to the program to accelerate near term elements on satellite and other space programs many of which have suffered long delays and large cost growth in recent years the bill adds 150 million for fourth currentgeneration advanced ehf communications satellite cuts 75 million from the 843 million requested for the transformational communications satellite t sat program transfers 152 milli on into the evolved expendable launch vehicle program nd cuts 1635 million from launch vehicle for second navy muos fleet communications satellite program to reflect delays these are fewer changes than in past years when sbirs and the space radar as well tsat were often cut substantially perhaps reflecting efforts by the services to be less technically ambitious in pursuing new space systems the bill adds 750 million for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr programs including 360 million for 24 c21 aircraft equipped with sensor suites 20 million for mq9 uavs for special operations forces and 13 million for additional medium uavs secretary of defense gate s has acknowledged disputes with the air force in particular in allocating sufficient isr resources to operations in iraq and afghanistan on other matters the agreement provides 350 million 150 million less than requested for the global train and equip program originally established by section 1206 of the fy2006 national defense authorization act and still comm only referred to as section 1206 authority the secretary of defense with the concurrence of the secretary of state may use s ection 1206global train and equip funding to provide wide range of security and other assistance to foreign nations the joint explanatory statement accompanying the bill asserts bluntly that the state department rather than the department of defense should be responsible for training and equipping foreign military forces nd that the administration shouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34473crs6 request future funds in the stat department budget the bill also trims 123 million from the 389 million requested in military personnel and operation and maintenance accounts for the newly established africa command africom the cut in africom funding reflects the same sentiment as the reduction in global train and equip funding while the africom reduction is not as steep as in the house defense appropriations subcommittee version of the bill and the joint explanator statement expresses support for africom the statement also insists that the state department and the us agency for international development usaid should play more important role in this new organization supported with the appropriate manpower and funding required the joint explanatory statement includes critique of air force management of major acquisition programs citing in particular recent numerous breaches of limits on cost growth under the nunn mccurdy amendment the statement requires the secretary of defense to report by march 31 2009 on steps to reform air force practices the joint explanatory statement also cites inaccurate cost estimates in many other major programs and requires the defense department to report on which programs since 2004 did not use cost estimates by the independent dod cost analysis improvement group caig and to explain why the bill also directs the defense department to provi funding for the acquisition workforce development fund that was blished by the fy2008 defense authorization act in the re gular appropriations process highlights of the final ve rsion of the fy2009 defense authorization bill s 3001 although the house and senate both pa ssed versions of the fy2009 defense authorization bill through the usual procedures the senates final action on its version s 3001 was delayed until september by various controversies one issue contributing to the delay was provisi on of the defense bill section 1002 that would incorporate into the legislation hundreds of earmarks listed in the committees report on the measure another issue was an unrelated dispute over offshore oil drilling the senate passed the bill september 17 the senate did not request conferen ce with the house to reconcile s 3001 with the housepassed hr 5658 instead mbers of the house and senate armed services committees negotiated informally the compromise version of s 3001 that was cleared for the president although the administration objected to th provision that incorporated into the senatepassed bill the earmarks listed in the senate armed services committees report on the bill substantially identi cal provision section 1005 was included in the compromise version of s 3001 that inco rporated into that measure the hundreds of earmarks listed in summary tables in the explanatory statement that was for allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34473crs7 practical purposes equivalent to the explanatory statement in formal conference report veto threats avoided the compromise version of s 3001 did not include any of the several provisions in either the house and senate versions of the authorization bill that had been singled out by administration officials as grounds for veto if they had been included in the version of the bill sent to president bush following is summary of provisions of the house or senate versions of the authorization bill that deputy defense secretary gordon england had cited as grounds for veto in september 19 letter to leaders of the house and senate armed services committees ban on the governments use of private security contractors in combat zones section 832 of the compromise bill expresses sense of congress that security missions in combat zones should be performed by us military personnel ban on the use of contractor em ployees to interrogate detainees section 1057 of the compromise expr esses sense of congress that contractors should not conduct interrogations requirement that detainee in terrogations be videotaped section1058 of the compromise expr esses sense of congress that such interrogations be videotap ed or otherwise electronically recorded requirement that congress appr ove either as treaty or by legislation and agreement governing the legal status of us forces in iraq the compromise included such requirement but retained in section 1212 requirement in the house bill that dod provide congress with detaile d report on such an agreement should it be reached requirement that the davisbac on act requiring the payment of locally prevailing wages on federa l construction projects apply to military construction projects on guam to which marine corps units currently stationed on okinawa ar being moved the provision was dropped provisions that would bar or inhibit dod from outsourcing on the basis of publicprivate competition jobs currently performed by military or federal civilian pers onnel such provisions were included in the compromise bill provisions that would halt the cons truction of facilities to replace walter reed army medical center in washington dc pending review and would prohibit the us of an independent commission to draw up recommendations for an future rounds of military base closures such provisions were included in the final billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34473crs8 several provisions in the senate bill relating to the management of intelligence activities in dod all such provisions were dropped four provisions in the house bill instigated by the air forces nowcancelled selection of eur opeandesigned midair refueling tanker three of which the admin istration said would require dod to discriminate against foreign manufacturers and one of which it said would require disclosure of contractors proprietary information the provisions were dr opped or greatly diluted in their impact funding cuts below acceptable levels to the 657 million requested for research and development and facilities construction associated with deployment of an antimissile system in poland and the czech republic while the administration did not specify an acceptable level the compromise bill cut 208 million compared with the 421 million that had been cut by the house version weapons program issues the bill requires the secretary of defense to submit annually an aircraft procurement plan for the na vy marine corps and air force that would project procurements re tirements and losses over the following 30 years for all types of combat and support aircraft section 141 the services have warned congress in recent years of coming shortfalls in combat planes as planned retirements outstrip the acquisition of replacement craft the amounts authorized for particular pr ograms were genera lly consistent with and largely superseded by the amounts actually appropriated by the companion defense appropriations bill but the authorization measure included significant policy provisions bearing on some high profile programs littoral combat ship the bill would defer until fy2010 application to the navys littoral combat ship lcs program of cost cap set by congress in the fy2007 john warner national defense au thorization bill section 122 the cap limits the cost of each lcs to 460 million with the proviso that the cost would be allowed to exceed that cap by up to 10 million because of inflation f22 fighter to buy long leadtime components that would allow the procurement of additional f22 fighters in fy2009 the bill authorizes 523 million not requested by the administration funds th

gdp debate over the past few months number of senior military officers as well as research groups and advocacy organizations have been arguing that defense spending needs to be substantially higher in the next few years to avoid drastic cuts in major weapons programs or in the size of the force many have called for baseline defense budget not including warrelated costs pegged to about 4 of gross domestic product an amount that woul d be anywhere from 70 to 180 billion per year higher over the next few years than the current administration plan5 senior leaders of the military services have been particularly vocal in arguing for substantial increases in the defense budget the chairman of the joint chiefs admiral michael mullen has for some time urged 4 of gdp for defense for the past two years the chief of staff and secretary of the air force have argued that the air force needs an average of 20 billion mo re each year for the next several years in weapons acquisition accounts in the past few months senior army officials have pointed out that the army budget incl uding war costs has grown to over 230 billion though it may come down some they say if forces in iraq and elsewhere are brought home several more years of spending at near that level will be needed to repair replace and upgrade equipm ent consumed by the wartime pace of operations for their part navy leaders now calculate that the longterm shipbuilding plan they have proposed for the past few ears will in the future cost an average of 20 billion year in fy2007 prices an in crease of about 40 over earlier estimates6 these arguments for substantial incr ease in the defense budget however come at time when by historical standards military spending appear s to be very robust between fy1998 when the

response to the 911 attacks to 63 billion in fy2003 the year of the iraq invasion to an estimated 189 billion in fy2008 while large portions of the supplementals have been consumed by warrelated operating costs substantial amounts have also been devoted to buying new equipment particularly for the army and the marine corps although the bulk of this acquisition has been for force pr otection communications and transportation the effect has been to modernize much of the basic equipment stock of both services in effect augmenting their baseline budgets the fact that so large level of

analysts expect at best flat baseline defense budget for the foreseeable future8 increased costs in part of the budget therefore will necessa rily come at the expense of resources available in other areas supplemental appropriations are expected to decline as well although plans to withdraw from iraq are uncertain the military services expect that supplemen tal appropriations will come down within few years costs for tr aining and equipm ent maintenance that have been covered in suppl ementals then will migrate back into the baseline budget at the expense of other programs and money to further upgrade ground forces will have to be found elsewhere costs of military personne l have grown dramatically in recent years since the end of the 1990s cong ress has approved substantial

for everything from personnel training to weapons repairs to facility operations to health care have increased relative to the size of the force by about 25 per year above inflation these increases are not as large as in some areas of the civilian economy such as health care but they do not reflect gains in productivity that are common in other sectors of the economy continued growth in operating costs which is now widely seen as fact of life in defense planning erodes the availability of resources for weapons modernization and other priorities increasing generational cost growth in major weapons programs it is generally expected that new ge nerations of weapons will be more expensive than the systems they replace as weapons technology advances the rate of genera tional cost growth however is becoming matter of increasing concern within the defense department new stealthy aircra ft multimission ships advanced space systems and networked missile s guns and vehicles appear to be getting more expensive than th eir predecessors at greater rate than in the past unless budgets increase more rapidly than costs tradeoffs between the costs of new weapons and the size of the force may be required poor cost estimates the diffi culties engendered by accelerating intergenerational weapons cost gr owth are exacerbated by poor cost estimation the government acc ountability office has documented frequent substantial increases in costs of major defense systems compared to original development estimates sideeffect of inaccurate cost projections is to exacerbate instability in the overall defense budget which entails ine fficient production rates for major weapons programs and increased costs due to changing production plans11 new requirements based on the lessons of iraq and afghanistan the wars in iraq and afghanistan have led to very large increases in equipment requirements for ground fo rces particularly for force protection communications and tr ansportation national guard combat units that earlier were equipped with older systems cascaded from active units are now seen as part of the rotation base that require equally modern equipmen t and full sets of current equipment are also expected to be available not only for nexttohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34473crs18 deploy units but also for units as they begin to reset from overseas rotations key lesson of the war is that what used to be called minor procurement for ground forces was substantially under capitalized broader range of national security challenges common presumption before 911 was that forces trained and equipped for traditional conflicts between national armies would be able to cope with what were seen as less demanding other challenges such as stability operations now the view is that forces must be designed not only for traditional conflicts but for insurgencies and other irregular wars support of allies threats of catastrophic attacks by nonstate actors with weapons of mass destruction and entirely new kinds of disruptive attacks on specific us and allied vulnerabilities the effect has been to broaden requirements without necessarily an attendant offsetting reduction in older force goals when these factors are taken as whole it is not so surprising that military planners discover some shortf alls but for congress it may not be so obvious that the principle answer is simply to provide more money for defense as practical matter the arguments for more money that senior military leaders have begun to lay out appear most likely to become matters of debate in congress once the next administration takes office the next secretary of defense and the 111th congress may very early on face contentious debate about defense resources more money is one alternative other alternatives may include backing away from plans to add 92000 active duty troops to the army and marine corps shifting resources among the military services to reflect new challenges rather than allocating them roughly the same proportions every ear reviewing requirements for expensive new technologies in view of the presence or absence of technologically peer or near peer competitors and

iraq nd afghanistan funding currently funding for iraq and afghanistan is provided in standard appropriation acc ounts which mix funds for the two operations and the funds for dod s baseline and war appropriations while the authorization conference bill does not specify separate amounts for iraq and afghanistan in fy2009 as the senate b ill did it requires dod to present separate budget displays for each operation at the ppropriation level and by program project or activity level in the next submission sec 1502 in addition the conference version re quires that dod provide detailed description

congress to see the relative cost of the two operati ons dod is likely to object to designating funds by operation in order to preserve its flexibility ccording to the senate report separate funding displays would help prevent confusi on between the two missions concern of both secretary of defense gates and the committee caps on transfers finally the authorization conference bill sets 4 billion cap on transfer authority for fy2009 funds which limits the overall amount that dod can transfer between accounts as requested by dod and adopted by the appropriations act sec 1507 s 300153 the level

request would buy one sub in fy2009 and long leadtime components including nuclear powerplant to be used in another sub slated for purchase in fy2010 the bills addition would let the navy buy enough long leadtime components in fy2009 to allow the purchase of two subs in fy2010 thus accelerating by one year th time when the navy could begin buying subs at the rate of two per year reflecting sascs concern that the administrations shipbuilding plan shows little progress toward meeting its avowed goal of increasing the size of the fleet to 313 ships the bill did not grant the adminis trations request th at congress waive provision of law 10 usc 5062 that re quires the navy to maintain 11 aircraft carriers in service to avoid the cost of refueling the nuclearpowered carrier enterprise the navy wants to retire that ship in 2013 which would cause the carrier force to drop to 10 ships for four years or more until the carrier george h w bush which was funded in fy2005 enters service

up for the loss of anticipated revenue from the proposed fee increases unlike the house bill however and pursuant to an administration request the sasc bill repeals provision of the fy2008 fense authorization act section 721 of pl 110181 that prohibits replacing milita ry medical personnel with civilians as the administration has proposed shipbuilding unlike the house bill s 3001 authorizes 25 billion requested for third ddg1000 class destroyer howe ver the senate bill also would expand the administrations shipbuilding plan re jecting the request for 103 million to shut down production of lpd17 class amphibious nding transports and adding to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34473crs46 bill 273 million for long leadtime components that would allow the navy to budget for an additional lpd17 in fy 2010 it also adds 79 million to the 13 billion requested for long leadtime components to allow the navy to begin budgeting for two submarines per year starting in fy2011 noting delays in the construction of helicopter carriers at the northrop grumman shipyard in pascagoula ms that was damaged by hurricane katrina sasc concluded that the contractor was likely to proceed as quickly as the budget assumed to assemble long leadtime components for an lhar class helicopter carrier slated to be part of the pla nned maritime pr epositioning force future accordingly the bill authorizes 178 million of the 348 million requested for that purpose it also includes provision sec tion 1432 requiring the navy to fund that ship and others slated for the mpff that are basically amphibious landing ships through its ship construction account in stead of through revolving fund for sealift ships which gives the servi ce more leeway to reallocate funds the bill adds 25 million to the 165 million requested to begin 10 billion longterm program to modernize the 61 ar leigh burkeclass destroyers its most numerous class of warships so they can operate for 40 years rather than the 20 years that the committee cited as the norm for vessels of that size but the committee also directed the navy to provide detailed justification of its decision to have the ships upgraded in several stages by shipya rds near their homeports instead of having each one get full upgrade from either the northrop grumman yard in pascagoula or the general dynamicsowne d bath iron works in bath the two yards where all the ships were built citing delays in finalizing the design of new class of cruisers designated cgx that would replace the 22 aegis cruisers in the antiaircraft and missile defense mission the bill cut 121 million fro m the 313 million requested to prepare to begin building the first cgx in fy2011 fighter aircraft in addition to authorizin g 31 billion as requested to buy 20 f22 fighters the bill authorizes 497 million to be used either to shut down the f22 production line or to buy long lead time components that would allow the air force to buy 20 additional planes in fy2010 the bill also authorizes as requeste d 31 billion to continue development of the f35 joint strike fighter 33 billion to buy 16 of the planes and 396 million for long leadtime components to support futu re purchases but it also adds to the budget request 500 million to continue c ongressional effort to make dod fund development of general electric engine that could replace the pratt whitney engine currently used in the f35 th added funds include 430 million to continue developing the alternate engine 35 million to develop improveme nts in the pratt whitney powerplant to level the playing field in the words of the sasc report and an additional 35 million to buy long leadtime components that would be needed in future production of the alternate engine citing warnings by the navy marine corps and air force that the retirement of older fighter planes combined with lays in fielding the f22 and f35 could leave the services short of planes to equip their squadrons the committee includedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34473crs47 in the bill provision section 171 requi ring dod to give congress annually 30year plan detailing projected changes in its inventory of all major types of aircraft the committee also urged the navy to prepare to sign multiyear contract for more fa18ef strike fighters than it currently plans to buy as hedge against delays in the acquisition of f35s uavs and surveillance planes the bill authorizes 13 billion requested to buy 52 global hawk and predator unm anned aerial vehicles uavs some of which would be armed but all of which are equipped for surveillance missions it trims 48 million from the 480 million requested to develop longrange uav for maritime surveillance but it authorizes 371 m illion requested for shorte rrange army and navy uavs the bill adds to the budget request 98 milli on to develop an improved groundsurveillance radar designated r tip which the committee urged the air force to consider backfitting on the existin g e8 jstars planes it authorizes 111 million requested for long leadtime com ponents that would be used to begin production of modified boeing 737 designa ted p8 that the navy will use as longrange subhunter and reconnaissance plane and it authorizes 160 million not requested to repair aging p3 patrol planes that the p8 is intended to replace helicopters because the losing contractors have filed an official protest of the air forces selection of the boeing chinook as its new search and rescue helicopter designated csarx intended to retrieve downed pilots from enemy territory the bill authorizes 265 million of the 305 million requested to develop the aircraft and none of the 15 million reque sted to buy long leadtime components in preparation for manufacture the b ill authorizes the 10 billion requested to continue development of the vh71 inte nded to replace the aging helicopters that serve the white house but in its report the committee cited rash of problems besetting the program which it said might experience of 70 cost overrun the report directs the navy to submit to congress detailed report on the status of the program antimissile defenses following the same general approach as the companion house bill s 3001 would au thorize less for antiballistic missile defenses than the administration request ed of the 109 million requested the house bill would authorize 99 billion nd the senate bill 102 billion moreover within those overall totals both bills authorize more than was requested for systems that are ready or nearly ready for deployment to deal with existing shortrange and mediumrange missiles on the other hand both bills authorize less than requested for programs that would not enter production that soon many of which are intended to deal with intercontinentalrange missiles in its report sasc places great emphasis on an analysis by the joint staff the body of officers that provide technical expertise to the joint chiefs of staff which concludes that to meet the need s of combatant commanders around the globe dod needs about twice as many of the ar mys thaad interceptors and the navys sm3 interceptors missiles than it currently plans to buy both systems are designed to knock down mediumrange missiles which fly much slower than intercontinentalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34473crs48 ballistic missiles icbms s 3001 would add to the budget request 135 million to field additional thaad and sm3 missiles and thaad radars and an additional 80 million to improve the antimissile capability of the navys aegis system which uses the sm3 missile among the reductions the bill would make in antimissile programs are cuts of 269 million undistributed from th missile defense agency 10 million the entire amount requested for the space test bed and 50 million of 354 million requested for the multiple kill vehicleintended to let one interceptor knoc k out several attacking warheads s 3001 authorizes the funds requested to begin deploying in europe variant of the defense against intercontinentalrange missiles currently deployed in alaska and california however the bill include s provision section 232 that would bar use of the funds to buy interceptor miss iles for that deployment or to begin construction onsite until 1 poland and the czech republic have formally ratified agreements to allow the american sites on their territory and 2 the secretary of defense certifies to congress that the interceptor slated for deployment at the european site which is considerably modified variant of the version already deployed
