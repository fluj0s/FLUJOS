macroeconomic analysis summary with uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook support has been mounting for an additional tax cut this year to stimulate the economy regardless of the implications of tax levels and structure fo r equity fairness in tergenerational debt burden and the role and size of government any tax reduction will affect the macroeconomy this report is limited to an alyzing these macroeconomic effects tax cuts have distinct short run and long run effects oftentimes they are at odds with each other in the short run tax cuts that lead to larger budget deficit increase aggregate demand and influence the business cycle if they are spent if the economy has unused resources then the tax cu ts will likely raise growth in the short run if the economy is operating at full capacity most of the boost in aggregate demand would quickly be dissi pated through higher intere st rates inflation and larger trade deficit if tax cut is meant to prevent recession by providing short term stimulus its efficacy should be judged by how much spending or dissaving it generates the efficacy of tax cut that is meant to boost longrun growth should be judged by how much additional work ne t saving and inves tment it generates empirical estimates as to how much of behavioral response can be expected when taxes are cut are inconclusive these effects are likely to be negligible in the short run if the economy is in r ecession if the tax cuts lead to larger budget deficit ie less government saving this would have negativ effect on national saving reducing long run growth the extent that national saving falls is determined by how much new private saving offsets the fall in government saving since saving is the opposite of spending it is difficult to craft tax cut which can boost growth in both the short run and long run if tax cuts to individuals eg payroll or income tax reducti ons are crafted to be spent to end recession then long run growth would suffer because of the reduc tion in national saving tax cuts aimed towards higher saving eg reduction in the tax on dividends are unlikely to help counter recession because th ey will generate little add itional shortrun spending furthermore if higher national saving rate is the aim of policy the most straightforward way to accomplish it is to take steps to reduce the budget deficit by raising taxes or cutting government spending theory suggests and the past two decades arguably demonstrate that monetary policy is superior tool for ironing out the ebb and flow of the business cycle because of exchange rate effects and because it can be implemented more quickly most recessions have ended w ithout the use of fiscal po licy at present political concerns about the size of the budget defi cit may prevent tax cut from being large enough to significantly boost aggr egate demand in 10 trillion economy moreover with the expansionary po licies already in place and the economy recovering

the business cycle and economic growth macroeconomic analysis with uncertainty surrounding the econo mic outlook s upport has been mounting for an additional tax cut this year to stimulate the economy while the level of taxation is perennial issue because it bear s ultimately on the size of the government relative to the private sector three major arguments for tax reductions have emerged in the current dialogue the first is the need to stimulate more rapid rate of growth while individuals making this argument di sagree about what the governments fiscal position should be and ought to be in the l ong run they are most concerned about the very near term they argue that good dose of fiscal stimulus is needed now to return the us economy to full employment second it is argued that in the long run tax cuts will boost the sustainable rate of gr owth by creating incentives to work save and invest third it is argued that th presence of surpluses would encourage congress to undertake wasteful spending and therefore tax cut would help reduce government spending1 regardless of which arguments propel the tax cut debate all will have to face the fact that tax cut would affect the macroeconomy this report explores what these effects could be it ddresses only the first two of the arguments above it does not address the questions of how the size of the budget deficit aff ects fiscal decisions the discussion to follow breaks the analysis of the macroeconomic effects of tax reduction into two parts the first centrates on the short run while the second discusses the longer run consequences th short run effects concern how tax cut would affect the business cycle the long run effects concern how tax cut would affect the longterm sustainable rate of growth the analysis in this report will focus on the macroeconomic effects of tax reduc tion and reduction in income taxes will be used for illustrative purposes thus the discussion relates directly to one portion of the administrations tax cut proposal the acceleration of income tax reductions set out in egtrra pl107162 while this analysis focuses on tax reductions because of topical interest and for analytical simplicity the thrust of the analysis alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs2 3 for comparison of tax cuts and go vernment spending see crs report rs21136 tax reduction or government spending which ght add more stimulus to the economy by marc labonte 4 economists define full employment as the ra of unemployment consistent with stable rate of inflation current estimates of this rate tend to cluster around 5 by this measure the current unemployment rate places the curre nt level of gross domestic product below full employment see us li brary of congress congressional research service inflation and unemployment what is the connection by brian cashell crs report rl30391 and why has the unemployment rate fallen when inflation is stable by marc labonte crs report rl30738 5 by contrast reduction in the capital gains tax or the dividends tax is likely to lead to little expansion in aggregate spending because it enc ourages higher saving through certain types of assets eg equities 6 similarly an increase in government spending that was led to larger budget deficit would directly and indirectly stimulate aggregat demand with the only difference being that individuals would save some portion of the tax cut diluting its stimul ative effect while the government would spend the entire increase in the deficit 7 to see how increasing the deficit lowers nati onal saving consider the similarity between households and the government the saving of the household sector is equal to its after tax income less the portion of that income that it uses to buy goods and services analogously the saving of the government or its budget surplus is equal to its revenue less its outlays when the revenue is reduced by tax cut but government spending remains the same the increase in the budget deficit must be financed by borrowing from the private sectors saving thus national saving will decline unless households save the entire tax cut and do continuedapplies to virtually any increase in governme nt spending that is financed through larger budget deficit3 the short run effects of tax reduction the analysis of the short run effects of tax cut will begin by assuming that the economy is characterized by full employment this is done to focus on the variables that are thought to be important in gauging the ability of fiscal stimulus to work in the short run later this assumption will be modified and tax cuts will be analyzed in an economy characterized by unemployed resources fully employed economy4 the effects of tax reduction in the mainstream macroeconomic model the mundellfleming model are straightforward for most tax cuts to individuals the cut in taxes would increase the disposable income of households hous eholds are assumed to follow historical patterns and spend much of this increase5 this increase in household spending will directly and indirectly stimulate aggregate demand6 the reaction of the economy to this stimulus will be felt in the markets for money credit and goods and services in fully employed economy these markets must adjust to ration the available supply of output over the now enlarged and competing demands for it in the market for credit expansionary fi scal policy is equivalent to decrease in the national saving rate7 since less saving is availa ble for private investment realhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs3 7 continued not use it for greater consumption this is likely to happen but if it did the tax cut would not have stimulative effect on the economy since aggregate demand would be unchangedor inflation adjusted interest rates must rise to keep the credit market in equilibrium in the market for money the increase in spending increases the demand for money assuming for analytical purposes that the supply of money does not increase ie the posture of monetary policy is unchanged interest rates must rise to restore equilibrium between money demand and money supply interest sensitive spending would fall as consequence this wouldinclude spending on investme nt and consumer durables the increase in aggregate demand or spending would cause the price level to rise or the ongoing inflation rate to rise to bring the markets for goods and services back into equilibrium this in turn would reduce the real value of the existing moneyholdings of the public fall in the real value of money holdings would also tend to reduce spending and put additional upwar d pressure on interest rates to restore balance between aggregat demand and the full employment level of supply to recap unless households sa ved all of their increase in disposable income the net effect of tax cut to individuals is that larger budget deficit would reduce the national savings rate and courage additional consumpti on spending as result interest sensitive spending which is largely spending by businesses on capital goods would be reduced or crowded out thus at full employment conventional macroeconomic theory suggests that the net effect of tax cut would be small or nil because the economy does not have unused re sources labor and capital that can be brought into employment the increase in aggregate demand is dissipated through higher interest rates andor inflation reallocating output among sectors of the economy but leaving aggregate output unchanged globalization complicates fiscal policy however in an open economy or one in which foreign trade and capital flows are important the adjustment to additional fiscal stimulus can be quite different the upward pressure on interest rates can have significant international effect to the extent that international capital flows are highly sensitive to interest rate differentials as they appear to be for the united states foreigners will respond to ri sing us interest rates by flocking to buy american assets stocks bonds and real estate before they can buy american assets they must first buy dollars this action would increase the demand for dollars and the dollar would appreciate dollar appr eciation would in turn increase the price of american goods in foreign countries and decrease the price of foreign goods in the united states this price decrease would help offset some of the inflationary pressures caused by the tax cut as result americans would tend to spend more on foreign goods and foreigners less on amer ican goods enlarging the trade deficit as with the closed economy the tax cut w ould not affect the growth of real output because the fully employed economy does not have unused resources to employ the difference in the open economy is th at the increase in aggregate demand ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs4 8 the kennedy tax cuts proposed in 1961 are of ten cited as successful example of using fiscal stimulus to avoid recession but the economy of that era was vastly different from todays economy which features high unimpeded capital mobility and freely floating exchange rate under todays regime fiscal stimulus is much more likely to be dissipated through lower net exports thus the closed economy analysis may be more useful for evaluating the kennedy tax cuts while the open economy analysis may be more useful today 9 it is important to note that in the analysis to follow economic conditions in the rest of the world notably foreign interest rates are assumed to be unchanged for analytical ease 10 in situation where crowding out did not exist because investment was insensitive to higher interest rates it is doubtful whether re ductions in corporate taxes would offer short run stimulus since they also affect the rate of return on investment 11 it is interesting to note that the although the tax cuts of the early 1980s took place during severe recession there was still strong currency appreciation and expansion of the current account deficit in the following yearsinstead dissipated through the exchange ra and the current account of the balance of payments reallocating output away from exports and import substitutes rather than through investment spending8 because the united states is linked to its trading partners with flexible exchange rates and the international mobility of capital to the united states appears to be both high and rising over time it is not unc ommon for many american economists analyzing tax cuts in terms of the conventi onal model to concl ude that the potential demand stimulus from such cuts will be dissipated or offset by an enlarged trade deficit would the tax cut crowd out with unemployed resources the analysis above is based on the assumption that the economy is at full employment if this were not the case would the additional household spending from the individual tax cuts increase aggregate spending and help bring the economy back to full employment the answer to this question depends on whether the increased demand would raise interest rates and whether the increase in rates would draw capital from abroad9 theory can provide single answer to this question since situation of unemployed resources is compatible with variety of different circumstances in dire recession investment would be expected to be highly unresponsive to changes in interest rates nd the stimulative effects of tax cuts would not be significantly crowded out10 the closer the economy is to full employment when the effects of the fiscal stimulus ar felt the more likely it is to track the predictions that come from the analysis of fully employed economy spelled out above11 supply side effects in the short run the discussion above has concentrated on the demandside effects of tax cut but cuts in tax rates can also have supply side effects they can affect the incentives to work save and invest in the short run these changes are likel to be small because peoples behavior changes gradually furthermore greater wo rk effort and investment in response to tax cuts are unlikely to occur at all in the short run if the economy is in recession that is because people are unlikely to s upply more labor and capital when existing labor and capital are already underutilized in the long run however these changeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs5 12 for

august 2002 crs report rl31414 baseline budget projections discussion of issues by marc labontemay be important as explained below thus tax cuts may help end recession or assist recovery through their effects on aggregate demand but not through their effects on aggregate supply criticisms of the use of fiscal policy five major macroeconomics concerns ve emerged about using fiscal policy at this time never good time for fiscal policy first there are group of economists who feel that the use of fiscal policy as shortrun stabilization tool has had poor results in the postwar period12 to be an effective stabilization tool fiscal policy should be changed frequently quickly and in both directi ons as circumstances require in other words taxes cannot be merely cut during recession they must be raised during an expansion the empirical record does not demonstrate that fiscal policy has been successful on the basis of any of the three criteria the tax cut proposed by president kennedy to head off recession in 1961 was not implemented until 1964 and most economists were highly cr itical of the fact th at the use of fiscal policy in practice led to budget deficits in all but one year from 1961 to 1997 in the minds of these economists fiscal policy should be used only as last resort when all else has failed they point to the fact that most economic sl owdowns have ended without any change in fiscal policy th ey are likely to have firm belief that monetary policy can solve all but the worst economic slowdowns too small to matter any tax cut that is considered will be influenced by the reduction in the projected fiscal position of the government since the beginning of 2001 the budget is pr ojected to be in deficit until 2006 under current policy and could be in deficit for the entire 10 year budget window under alternative assumptions13 these factors suggest that tax cut would need to be quite modest in size probably less than 1 of gross domestic product gdp to avoid further deterioration in the governments fiscal position yet any tax cut that sought to minimize the effect on the budget deficit woul d be too small to offer significant boost to gdp recovery already underway has the economy reached these sort of dire straits it is difficult to paint this picture with the data available at this time while economic growth was weak in the second quarter of 2002 13 it was very strong in the first 50 and third 40 quarters this growth has not been sufficient to put much of dent in the unemployment rate thus far these data suggest that the recovery is already underway furthermore there are group of econo mists who believe th at some type of slowdown was necessary while the slow down was undoubtedly sharper than thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs6 economists would have desired they believe the economy was incapable of continuing at the pace of early 2000 lthough many economists now believe that the economy is capable of growing more rapidly than it did over the early 1990s they do not believe that sust ained rates of growth in th 4 range are possible over the longer run if growth had not slowed to more sustainable pace they believe that higher inflation would have occurred nd those who believe that the stock market was being driven by bubble in 2000 would argue that downward adjustment in prices although damaging to shortrun growth was inevitable and irreversable stimulus already in place whether or not one favors the use of fiscal policy as stabilization tool the economy will be receiving stimulus from both monetary and fiscal policy in the short term there has been loosening of monetary policy throughout 20012002 overnight interest rates were reduced by 3 percentage points in the first eight months of 2001 and further 225 percentage points since september 11 these reductions brought nomin shortterm interest rates to their lowest level in 40 years because of the lags in polic effectiveness the economic effects of some of these cuts have yet to be felt fiscal policy has also been stimulativ based on the policies already in place cbo estimates that the standardized fu ll employment budget has moved from surplus of 07 of gdp in 2001 to defic it of 17 of gdp in 2002 this is the result of both changes in spending such as the emergency appropriations worth 40 billion pl10738 in the wake of septem ber 11 and the major tax cuts passed in 2001 pl10716 and 2002 pl107147 and new provisions of egtrra pl10716 were phasedin on january 1 2003 these phaseins will result in an additional estimated stimulu s of 53 billion in 2003 beyond the stimulus provided in 2001 and 2002 in this light the ques tion does not revolve around whether or not the economy requires expansionary policy but whether it requires further stimulus beyond the policies already in place high longterm interest rates prevent recovery there are also concerns that the long run effects of tax cut will trump its expected stimulative effects in the short run tax cut woul d embody shift in the american fiscal regime from one that emphasizes private capital formation to one that emphasizes consumption this issue is explained below in greater detail from that perspective it may have an adverse effect in the short run on business expectations and private investment spe nding although the net stimula tive effect of tax cut should still be positive the model presented above suggests that the stimulative effect of tax cut would be trumped if it was rgely crowded out by higher interest rates and lower investment spending since the current slowdown has been concentrated in the investment sector the model would suggest that very little stimulus would be crowded out at present yet an important characteristic of this slowdown is the fact that longterm interest rates which are more important in the determination of investment spending than the shortterm ra tes that the fed influences have not fallen nearly as much as shortterm rates many economists fear that investment spending will be sluggish as long as longterm rates remain high one theory for why this has occurred is that investors now believe th at the future path of government budget deficits will be less favorable than previously expected raising future interest rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs7 14 income and payroll tax rate reductions can immediately increase the wage portion of income through reductions in withholding but mo st of the profit portion or earnings of self employed individuals of income will not be ffected by rate change until tax returns are annually or quarterly filed of course disposable income will be increased only when the tax rates go into effect which depends on the legislation ie in the next fiscal year or retroactive to previous period most othe r individual tax changes would have an impact on spending only when tax returns are filedthe expectations hypothesis of the term stru cture of interest rates states that long term interest rates today are the sum of expected shortterm interest rates from now into the future if lenders expect high in terest rates in the future then the opportunity cost of longterm borrowing rises today and longterm interest rates will remain high today monetary policy provides better stabilization tool economists have long debated the merits of fiscal vs monetary policy as tool for ironing out short run fluctuations in gdp growth the experience of the last two decades has led to growing consensus among economists that monetary policy has several advantages over fiscal policy first the board of governors of the federal reserve may have an advantage over other policymakers in recognizing the onset of an economic contraction the 12 regional federal reserve banks employ large specialized staff who play an active role in gathering information bout local economic conditions that they provide to the board of governors this centralization of information gathering and assessment is likely to give the board of governors major recognition advantage over others including congress second it is far less time consuming to deliver monetary stimulus than it is to deliver comparable fiscal stimulus monetary policy changes can be executed daily whereas changes in tax rates or expenditures often re quire considerable deliberations and procedural maneuvers by congress the fed reduced its target for the federal funds rates 11 time s in 2001 in some cases between scheduled meetings whereas legislation to cut taxes takes mont hs to formulate negotiate and pass into law once implemented however fiscal po licy may have an advantage over monetary policy in an environment of unde rutilized resources of labor and capital in the length of time it takes to affect gdp growth certain tax changes can immediately affect the takehome pay and spending of considerable number of households14 monetary policy shifts only aff ect the economy after households and businesses respond to changes in interest ra tes and the internati onal exchange rate of the dollar this process is likely to be more time consuming than changes in the spending behavior of households following changes in tax rates third theory suggests that monetary policy can be more powerful than fiscal policy under flexible exchange rate regime like the one the us has adopted this conclusion is based on belief that as discussed above fi scal expansion can lead to higher interest rates all else equal these higher interest rates attract foreign capital which causes the exchange rate to appreciat when the exchange rate appreciateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs8 15 john taylor op cit p 35net exports fall dissipating part or all of the fiscal stimulus expansionary monetary policy or lowering interest rates has the opposite effect lower interest rates can lead to more interestsensitive spending and depreciated currency all else being equal the depreciated currency makes exports more competitive increasing net exports thus expansionary monetary polic is reinforced rather than dissipated by the export sector under system of flexible exchange rates fourth over the longer run the mix nd interaction of fiscal and monetary policies can be of great importance fiscal policy of budget surpluses makes possible an easier monetary policy in the sense of making lower interest rate compatible with stable inflation although crafted for its shortrun effects an easier monetary policy has the longrun effect of fostering capital formation and more rapid rate of growth of sustainable output by contrast longrun fiscal policy of financing tax reduction throug h government borrowing is policy that is expected to yield higher consumption and higher in terest rates as the federal reserve must offset the expansion of demand with tighter monetary policy higher interest rates tend to encourage less capital formation andor larger trade deficit for these reasons many economists shar the view of professor john taylor wellknown macroeconomist and now an unde rsecretary of the treasury who said us monetary policy has been doing good job in recent decades at keeping aggregate demand close to potential gdp it seems hard to improve on this performance with more active discretionary fiscal policy and an active discretionary fiscal policy might even make the job of monetary authorities more difficult empirical evidence suggests that monetary policy has become more responsive to the real economy suggesting that fiscal policy could afford to become less responsive15 another way to think about the role of fi scal policy is to consider that monetary policy has been delegated the task of maintaining high employment and stable inflation by congress to argue that expansionary policy is needed implies that either monetary policy has re sponded insufficiently or s been ineffective it is difficult to make compelling argument that monetary policy has responded insufficiently when interest rates have been lowered by cumulative total of 525 percentage points since may 16 2000 wh ether it has been ineffective since investment spending has fa llen in every quarter since the beginning of 2001 is more debatable it should be noted however that any tax cut aimed at investment saving or business works through the same channe l as monetary policy by raising the aftertax rate of return on investment in the case of monetary policy this occurs because monetary policy lowers the cost of borrowing the longer run effects of tax reduction in general many economists would s upport the concept that lower taxes made possible through lower government spending would increase the long run sustainable rate of economic growth there is an important distinction however between thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs9 16 in the neoclassical growth model develope d by professor robert solow an increase in the saving rate would initially increase the grow th rate but the growth rate would eventually return to its steady state by contrast endog enous growth theory has stressed the beneficial interaction between technological improvement and other aspects of the economy like capital formation 17 great deal of the saving done by businesses is used to replace the capital that is exhausted producing output thus what is impor tant for the growth in the capital stock is net saving or that over and above what is used to replace the capital consumed in the production of output for an ov erview of us saving s ee us library of congress congressional research service saving in the united states why is it important and how has it changed by brian cashell and gail makinen crs report 98580e 18 contrary to the conventional view some in fluential economists argue that the national saving rate is unaffected by federal budget deficits or surpluses households they argue will alter their saving rates to offset any ch ange in the federal rate household behavior they argue is motivated by concerns about the private capital stock inherited by future generations economists who subscribe to this vi ew would argue that ll of the tax cuts that increase the federal budget deficit would be sa ved by the household sector since they will not be spent these economists would argue that tax cuts will not stimulate aggregate demand they will merely change the sector of the economy where the national saving is done this theory is popularly referred to as ricardian equivalenceconcept and tax reduction that is almost entirely offset by larger budget deficits rather than by lower government spending as all recent proposals plan to do this distinction has important c onsequences for national savi ng and private investment budget deficits nd national saving important to the long run ability of an economy to grow is its ability to dd to its capital stock capital is necessary to ensure that additions to the labor force have the machinery tools and infrastructure with which to produce dditional output in addition there is considerable evidence that the growth in productivity which is the means by which per capita income and living standards gr ow also depends on capital formation as capital often embodies new technologies the basis for productivity growth16 the ability of nation to enhance its capital stock is directly related to how large fraction of its income it saves saving in the united states comes from several sources majority comes from businesses households also play critical role since they are an important source of net saving on which an enlarged capital stock depends17 however government itself plays role in determining the national saving rate investment is only possible with saving and nati onal saving can only come from private saving business saving or government saving when the government runs surpluses it is thought to increase national saving when the government runs deficits it is thought to decrease national savi ng all else being equal18 the major change in the federal fiscal regime that occurred during the mid 1990s in which protracted string of budget deficits gave way to budget surpluses has been widely hailed by economists as re gime that is conducive to capital formation because it raised the national saving rate by freeing resources that had been invested in federal debt for profitable private investment from the perspective of the longer run tax reduction plan that increases the governments budget deficit is not conduc ive to the longrun formation of capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs10 19 it should also be noted that different type s of individuals have been estimated to have different responses to tax changes for exam ple there is evidence that the labor supply of married women and individuals on the threshold of retirement is much more responsive to tax changes than the labor supply of married n thus the recipient of any particular tax cut will be important in determining how much growth the tax cut generates 20 it is difficult to find evidence that tax cuts have positive effects on labor supply and household saving in the united states over th past decade for example the labor force participation rate in america has hardly ch anged despite the many tax changes of the past decade in 1990 it averaged 665 while during 2000 it averaged little over 67 average weekly hours worked was virtually identical in 1990 and 2000 the household saving rate has declined from 65 of gdp during 1992 to 07 of gdp during 2000 despite the incentives to save provided by iras roth iras and various 401k plans for more detailed explanation of supply side effects see us library of congress congressional research service dynamic revenue estimating by jane gravelle crs report 941000s december 14 1994 the academic debate on the magnitude of supply side effects can be found in the symposia supply side economics what remains american economic review v 76 n 2 may 1986 and tax policy further look at supply side effects american economic review v 74 n 2 may 1984if it leads to lower national saving it fa vors the use of resources for consumption rather than capital formation to the extent that lower national saving is replaced by foreign saving more us capital will be supplied by fo reigners and the rewards to that capital will accrue to them behavioral effects there is however another possible longerrun consequence from tax reduction how it affects the incentive structure for working saving investing and risk taking indi viduals are motivated to work for example not by their gross salary but by their aftert ax salary if taxes are reduced in way that raises their aftertax income this may provide an incentive to work more or in the words of the economist to substitute work for leisure the same is true for saving if the aftertax reward is in creased individuals may be encouraged to substitute saving for consumption thes effects are known as substitution effects while this analysis has much to recommend it it neglects another part of the incentive structure the effect of an incr ease in income on individual behavior for example if aftertax income rises individuals may feel sufficiently richer to want to engage in more leisure activity hence they desire to work less similarly if the aftertax reward for saving rises individuals with targeted saving objectives will be able to save less of their income and still achieve their goals these effects are known as income effects the net outcome will depend on the strength of the substitution effect relative to the income effect there is straig htforward method to measure labor and saving responses timates are dependent on ec onomic modeling which in turn is dependent on the assumptions made in the model diffe rent models yield vastly different results ranging from large re sponses to insignificant responses19 thus it remains unclear whether these incentive effects necessarily produce significantly more work more saving more i nvestment or more risk taking20 over the long run the saving effects private and public s hould be more impor tant determinant of growth than the effects on labor since the saving effects are ongoing whereas taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs11 21 if the entire tax cut is saved it can have short run antirecessionary effect that effect depends on some part of the increase in disposable income being spent relevant to this issue is the income distribution of tax reduction beneficiaries individuals at higher income levels would be expected to save higher proportion of an addition to their disposable income than lower income individuals 22 higher government spending or targeted be havioral tax cuts would only have offsetting effects on growth if they promoted work sa ving or investment government investment is an example of spending that would have an offsetting effect although the extent to which different types of government investment increase economic growth is controversial 23 congressional budget office 125year picture of the fe deral governments share of the economy 1950 to 2075 washington july 2002cut would presumably only lead to onetime adjustment in labor supply economic growth is determined by the growth of the labor supply rather than the level of the labor supply and even if tax cuts incr ease the incentive to save unless the entire tax cut is saved the national saving rate would have to decrease since the increase in the budget deficit will be larger than any increase in personal saving21 reductions in income taxes are unique because they directly raise the return to both saving and labor most other types of individual ta xes directly affect only one or the other for example reduction in the payroll tax raises only the return to labor while reduction in the capital gains tax or dividends tax only raises the return to saving through certain types of assets eg equities tax reductions may offset at least some the negative effects that larger budget deficits have on longterm growth alte rnatively financing higher government spending or tax cuts targeted at prom oting noneconomic behavi oral changes eg expanding the child care tax credit thr ough government borrowing is unlikely to have offsetting effects on growth22 evaluating the long term context few economists would be concerned about running temporary budget deficit at time when the economy is operating below full employment since it would probably cause little crowding out in sl uggish economy the path of projected budget deficits under current policy is concern for many economists however when placed in the context of the longterm budgetary outlook even in the absence of further stimulus current policy is unsustainable as the baby boom generation retires the ratio of workers to retirees is projected to fall from 34 today to 20 by 2050 since governme nt programs for the elderly social security medicare and medicaid curren tly operate on pay as you go basis where current workers finance current retir ees these programs will face large funding shortfalls in the future these funding shor tfalls are forecast to lead to budget deficits of 48 of gdp by 2040 79 of gdp by 2050 and 12 of gdp by 2060 under current policy23 some combination of large tax increases and cuts in entitlement spending will be required before that occurshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs12 24 for more information see crs report rl31414 baseline budget projections discussion of issues by marc labonte 25 this concept is explained at greater length in crs report rl30708 social security saving and the economy by brian cashellthese large deficits would occur even though the budget is projected to return to surplus in the next two decades under cb assumptions in fact many analysts have argued that cbos assumptions are too optimistic and the budget may not return to surplus at all in the next two decades for example cbo assumes that all expiring tax cuts including egtrra would not be renewed and disc retionary spending would fall to its lowest level in th postwar period under less optimistic assumptions the government would face higher interest payments and smaller economy since national saving would be wer when the baby boomers retired and even larger tax increases and sp ending cuts would be required24 the only possibility for mitigating these future tax increases and benefit cuts is to raise taxes or cut spending now and use the proceeds to boost the national saving rate this can be done by paying down the national debt the government purchase of private assets or the financing of i ndividual accounts through the social security program the macroeconomic effects of these three choices would be the same by increasing the national saving rate more private investment would occur and the future size of the economy would increase with larger economy the government would have more resources at its disposal in the future to finance the retirement benefits of the baby boomers25 another way to view the longterm perspective is in terms of intertemporal tax smoothing without drastic reductions in government spending future tax increases would be unavoidable thus the governme nt has two choices to sharply increase taxes in the future as government spending increases or to raise taxes by smaller amount at present producing surpluses in the short term which increase the resources available to future govern ments and improve its futu re fiscal position economic theory suggests that the deadweight loss of taxation increases geometrically thus if one wishes to limit the efficiency losses of taxation it is prefer able to raise taxes by smaller amount today because sharp ta x increases in the future would cause larger cumulative efficiency loss even thoug h there are fewer years of high taxation would permanent or temporary tax cut be more effective stimulus to stimulate the economy lawmakers are considering both temporary and permanent tax cuts typically permanent tax cut is thought to be more stimulative ie more of it will be spent than temporary tax cut these results stem from the insights of the life cycle savings model the life cycle model suggests that individuals desire to smooth their consumption over their lifetime rather than base their present consumption on their present income thus people save for retirement so they do not have to lower their standard of living when they stop working in the lifecycle model temporary increase in income in this case from tax cut would be spent little by little over ones lifetime by contrast permanent tax cut wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs13 be spent at the same rate as the rest of one s current income is spent because the tax cut would be received every year in the future thus the theory suggests that tax cut of given size this year would lead to more spending if it were permanent than temporary these results are little too naive to be accepted at face value however since tax rates change all the time rational individuals would not necessarily base their consumption on the tax cut they receive unde r current law they should instead base their consumption on what they believe ba sed on their best knowledge their tax rate will be in the future given likely changes in the future tax code if they believe that tax cut passed today could not be sustained then their consumption behavior would vary little from their behavior in light of temporary tax cut for example law could be passed today that permanently eliminated all taxes but kept government spending constant surely rational individual would not base their consumption decisions on belief that taxation would remain at zero another reason that temporary tax cuts are less stimulative in the lifecycle model is the assumption that households can always borrow against future anticipated income if this assumption were relaxed then temporary tax cut could enable households to make new purchases they would otherwise be unable to make thus stimulating aggregate demand more than the lifecycle analysis would suggest investors may also react differently to temporary tax cut than permanent tax cut however this relates to the theory presented earlier that long term interest rates are currently high because of investor be liefs about future government borrowing if this theory is correct then permanent tax cut would lead investors to believe that the government will undertake even more bo rrowing in the future this would make longterm interest rates even higher toda crowding out more private investment today and making the tax cuts less stimulative by contrast temporary tax cut would have little effect on future borrowing by the government in this theory it would therefore have little effect on future interest rates and cause little crowding out of private investment thus temporary tax cuts provide better stimulus if they lead to significantly less crowding out while permanent tax cuts provide better stimulus if they generate significantly smaller savings response because people act in the way the lifecycle model suggests the long run advantage of temporary ta x cut is that it would not represent continual reduction in public saving and probabl national saving into the future thus relatively less private capital investme nt would be crowded out in the future conclusion congress is currently considering severa l tax cut proposals whose stated primary aim would be to stimulate the economy any proposal w ould affect equity fairness allocative efficiency and the macroec onomy this paper evaluates only the macroeconomic effects of tax reduction from macroeconomic perspective plan to finance tax cuts through larger budget deficits can be judged by its shortrun effects and longrun effects the short run effects concern how the tax cut would affect the business cycle the longrun effects concern how the tax cut would affect longrun growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs14 26 for more information see us library of congress congressional research service economic and revenue effects of permanent and temporary capital gains tax cuts by jane gravelle crs report rs21014for tax cut to have valuable shor trun effects the economy must have unutilized capital and labor otherwise the effect of the tax cut on growth would be dissipated through larger current account ficit higher intere st rates and reduced investment and higher inflation it mu st be large enough to have measurable effect on peoples behavior nd expectations it must be spent rather than saved tax cuts that promote saving are contr actionary in the short run if they were expansionary then the government coul d accomplish greater stimulus by instead increasing public saving through the reducti on of the budget deficit if the proposal meets all of these criteria its effectivene ss should be compared to the effectiveness of monetary policy the other shortrun stabilization tool over the longer run tax cut can incr ease economic growth if it has positive effect on the incentives to work save and invest these incentive effects are unlikely to counteract recession in the s hort run since recession is situation where existing resources are being underu tilized thus there will be little demand for more labor or capital to be brought into operation to have positive effect in each of these areas the substitution effect eg working more because work is more highly rewarded would have to dominat the income effect eg working less because less work is required to achieve the same standard of living but the tax cut will only have positive effect on longrun growth if it generates more savinginvestment and labor supply than the reduction in national saving attributable to the larger budget deficit the intended purpose of tax cut is crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of the measure most importantly tax cuts that are most effective at boosting aggregate demand in the short run are typically least effective at increasing the sustainable rate of growth in the long run and vice versa for tax cut to boost aggregate demand in the short run it must boost either cons umer or investment spending reductions in individual taxes would be expected to boost consumption and tax reductions for lowincome individuals are thought more likely to be spent since those individuals have lower average saving rate by definition if tax reductions to lowincome individuals generate more spending then they will generate less saving with less saving less capital investment can be financed and longrun growth will be lower by contrast reduction in the capital gains tax or dividend tax raises the after tax rate of return on individual investment in assets assuming the substitution effect dominates this tax cut gives an incentive to spend less which would do little to stimulate aggregate demand in the short r and save more wh ich would contribute to long run growth26 to increase overall saving and growth in the long run however the increase in private saving mu st exceed the loss in public saving caused by the larger budget deficit for those who argue in favor of reduc tion in capital gains taxes or dividend taxes it should be noted that their ffects flow through the same channel ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30839crs15 expansionary monetary policy in the short r or reducing the deficit in the long run by raising the aftertax rate of retu rn on investments expansionary monetary policy raises the rate of return on investment by lowering the inflationadjusted cost of borrowing in the short run and reducing the deficit raises the rate of return on investment by raising the national saving rate and thereby lowering the cost of borrowing thus reductions in any of th tax rates would onl be preferable to monetary policy in the short r and reducing the deficit i n the long run if it could generate greater investment re sponse than those alternatives
