senators of the presidents party have long played as general rule the primary role in selecting candidates for the president to nominate to federal district court judgeships in their states they also have played an influential if not primary role in recommending candidates for federal circuit court judgeships associated with their states for senators who are not of the presidents party consultative role with the opportunity to convey to the president their views about candidates under consideration for judgeships in their states also has been longstanding practiceand one supported by the blue slip procedure of the senate judiciary committee senators in general exert less influence over the selection of circuit court nominees whereas home state senators of the presidents party often dictate whom the president nominates to district judgeships their recommendations for circuit nominees by contrast typically compete with names suggested to the administration by ot her sources or generated by the administration on its own whether and how states two senators share in the judicial selection role will depend to great extent on their respective prerogatives and interests senators have great discretion as to the procedures they will use to identify and evaluate judicial candidates ranging from informally conducting candidate searches on their own to relying on nominating commissions to evaluate candidates contact between senators office and the administration can be expected to clarify the nature of the senators recommending role including the degree to which the administration in its judicial candidate search will rely on the senators recommendations if president selects district or circuit court nominee against the advice of or without consulting home state senator the latter must decide whether to oppose the nomination either first in the senate judiciary committee or later on the senate floor from the senators standpoint opposition to the nomination might serve number of purposes including helping to prevent confirmation or influencing the administration to take consultation more seriously in the future on the other hand various considerations might influence the senator not to oppose the nomination including the desirability of filling the vacant judgeship as promptly as possible and if more home state vacancies are possible in the future whether these might provide the senator better opportunity for exerting influence over judicial appointments in recent years the role of home state senators in recommending judicial candidates has given rise to various issues including the following what constitutes good faith or serious consultation by the administration should home st ate senators always have the opportunity to provide their opinion of judicial candidate be fore he or she is nominated how differently should the administration treat the input of senators depending on their party affiliation what prerogatives should home state senators have in the selection of circuit court nominees should the policy of the judiciary committee allow home state senator to block committee consideration of judicial nominee

custom senators of the presidents party as general rule have played the primary role in selecting candidates for the president to nominate to federal district court judgeships in their states they also generally have played an influential if not primary role in recommending candidates for federal circuit court judgeships associated with their states for senators who are not of the presidents party consultative role with the opportunity to convey to the president their views about candidates under consideration for judgeships in their states has been longstanding practice as well in recent years however the role to be played by home state senators in the selection process for lower court judges has periodically been the subject of debate with controversy frequently arising in the senate over whether that body should confirm various of the presidents judicial nominees 1 part of the contention sometimes has involved the question of whether or to what degree senators should play role in advising the president on whom to select as judicial nominees from their states2 to assist in examining that question this report provides an analysis of the role that home state senators historically and in the contemporary era have played in the lower court selection process specifically this report examines the role played by senators in the selection of nominees to two kinds of lower court judgeshipsto us district co urt judgeships in the federal judicial districts lying geographically within the senators states and to us court of appeals judgeships in the judicial circuits of which the senators states are geographic part3 in separate sections the report discusses the historical origins of the role of senators recommending persons for nomination to lower court judgeshipsparticularly the custom of senatorial courtesy and the senate judiciary committees longstanding blue slip procedure the effect of senators political party affiliation on their role as recommenders of judicial

of persons nominated by the president to be us attorneys or us marshals in the senators states also outside the scope of this report are the selection processes for nominees to district or circuit courts in jurisdictions not geographically connected to states and thus not represented by senators specifically not examined herein are the selection processes for nominees to the us district court

appointments of judges in the federal court system are made subject to the approval of the senate4 these appointments take place through process provided for in the constitution in which the president nominates and appoints persons to federal office by and with the advice and consent of the senate 5 exceptions to this rule are the relatively rare judicial appointments which the president alone makes without the requirement of senate approval through his power under the constituti on to make temporary recess appointments6 4 subject to senate confirmation the president makes judi cial appointments to the following federal courtsthe supreme court of the united states us circuit courts of appeals us district courts including the territorial courts us court of international trade us court of federal claims us tax court us court of appeals for veterans claims and us court of appeals for the armed forces regarding the role played by senators in the appointment of supreme court justices see crs report rl31989 supreme court appointment process roles of the president judiciary committee and senate by denis steven rutkus the president also appoints subject to senate confirmation judges to two local courtsthe superior court of the district of columbia and the district of columbia court of appeals federal judges whom the president does not appoint include the following bankruptcy judges appointed by the us courts of appeals administrative law judges appointed by federal executive agencies magistrates appointed by the us district courts and trial and intermediate court j udges in the armed forces appointed by the judge advocate general in each military service 5 article ii section 2 clause 2 in fuller part clause 2 pr ovides that the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law but the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone in the court of law or in the heads of departments 6 specifically article ii section 2 clause 3 of the us constitution empowers the president to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session since the first administration of george washington presidents have made more than 300

respect to judicial appointments when senators vote on nominationeither in committee on whether to report the nomination to the senate or on the senate floor on whether to confirm7 another significant though less public exercise of senate advice and consent on judicial nominations it can be argued occurs when individual senators provide actual advice to the president on whom to nominate to particular federal judgeships by longstanding custom dating back to the early 1800s senators of the presidents party in their capacity as home state senators have regularly provided presidents such advice recommending candidates for judgeships situated in their states or linked by tradition to their states for senators who are not of the presidents party consultative role with the opportunity to convey to the president their views about candidates under consideration for j udgeships in their states also has been longstanding practice

technically each senator is free to recommend candidates for any federal judgeship to be filled by presidential nomination in reality however the ability of senators to have their judicial recommendations heeded by president will in mo st cases depend on the judgeship in question having geographic link to the senators own state senator for instance rarely will be able to exert influence on behalf of judicial candidate for geographically based court such as us district court or us court of appeals if the court is not geographically all or in part within the senators state similarly most senators on any particular occasion might have little basis on which to make judicial recommendations for nationwide court of specialized subject matter jurisdiction such as the tax court or the court of appeals for veterans claims unless they are members of senate committee having jurisdiction over the court have expertise in the courts subject matter or have some other special interest in the court 8 by contrast every us senator makes recomme ndations or in some way is consulted about potential candidates for judgeships in 1 the us district court or courts which geographically fall within the senators state and 2 the us court of appeals circuit of which the senators state is geographic partprovided the circuit judgeship historically has been filled by resident of the senators state9 for these judgeships longstanding senate customs as well as norms in 7 senate vote to confirm requires simple majority of senators voting quorum being present see crs report rl31980 senate consideration of presidential nominations committee and floor procedure by elizabeth rybicki under heading consideration and disposition this quorum requirement is derived from article i section 5 clause 1 of the us constitution which states in part that majority of each house shall constitute quorum to do business hence the quorum for conducting business in senate of 100 members is 51 senators 8 writing in 1953 scholar noted that the president had w ider discretion in the selection of judges to such specialized courts as the tax court and the customs court now the us court of international trade as well as to federal courts in the district of columbia and the territorial courts than he did in selecting us district court nominees in each of the states for members of the senate may not

states court of claims and the united states customs court the power of the individual senator is further diminished in favor of the presidents men since the selection for those posts can be made from

individual senators in the appointment process the two most important of these customs arguably are senatorial courtesy and the blue slip practice of the senate judiciary committee

presidential nominee for an office in the state of senator of the presidents party unless that senator approves10 in our day another scholar has written senatorial courtesy has come to mean that senators will give serious consideration to and be favorably disposed to support an individual senator of the presidents party who opposes nominee to an office in his state this scholar noted however that as the practice of senatorial courtesy had evolved in the contemporary period the senate could not be expected to automatically support senator opposing nomination if his reasons are not persuasive to other senators or if he is not respected member of the senate 11 the custom of senatorial courtesy provides the foundation for special role in the nomination and confirmation process for senator of the presidents party whenever presidential nomination is for federal office in the senators state the senators role is essentially negative one in those relatively rare instances when the senator opposes and thereby seeks to block nominees confirmation in these situations the senator by invoking senatorial courtesy ordinarily can look to the rest of the senates members to join the senator in opposing the nomination much more frequently however the senators role is positive in nature when periodically he or she engages in making recommendations to the president about whom to nominate to federal offices in the senators state in these situations the custom of senatorial courtesy it can be argued encourages the president to be receptive to the senator s recommendationsrather than risk selecting nominees opposed not only by the senator but by the senate as whole united in support of its colleague the precedent of senatorial courtesy according to joseph p harris in his landmark study the advice and consent of the senate 12 was set in 1789 congress had been in session for only three months of its first term when the senate rejected its first presidential nomineeone benjamin fishbourn whom president george washington had nominated to the post of naval officer of the port of savannah though fishbourn apparently had excellent qualifications for the position the

fishbourn nomination and nominated the candidate desired by the two georgia senators in the fishbourn episode the courtesy that the senates members as whole extended to their two colleagues from georgiaby rejecting the nomin ation that the two senators opposedwas an important precedent as harris explained the fishbourn case initiated the custom which requires the president to consult with the senators from the state in which vacancy occurs and to nominate person acceptable to them if he fails to do so the senate as courtesy to these senators will reject any other nominee regardless of his qualification the custom is usually invoked however only by senators of the same party as the president it did not become firmly established in washingtons administration for he continued to hold to the doctrine that the power of nomination belonged exclusively to the president and continued to consult widely in making his selections under later presidents with less prestige less force of character and less determination the rule became firmly established with respect to senators of the same political party as the president 13 harris writing in 1953 described what was then the wellestablished custom which has prevailed since about 1840 wherein us district judges are normally selected by senators from the state in which the district is situated provided they belong to the same party as the president by contrast the president was said to have much freer hand in the selection of judges to the circuit courts of appeal whose districts cover several states 14 another scholar less than decade earlier in 1944 had described as nearabsolute the power of home state senators of the presidents party to select district court nominees the senate he maintained had expropriated the presidents power of nomination so far as concerns appointments of interest to senators of the party in power and the president has virtually surrendered his power directly to local party politics as to appointments in states where the senators are of the opposition15 according to two other scholars senators from the very beginning recognized that judgeships could be used effectively to reward loyal supporters back home senators also realized that it would be damaging to their prestige if the president appointed to judgeship within their own state someone of whom they disapproved as result senators joined together to protect their individual interests in judicial appointment s the custom of senatorial courtesy grew out of these considerations16 in the latter half of the 20th century it continued to be common for senators to regard their role in the appointment of us district judges as more in the nature of selection than of recommendation in 1977 former senator joseph w tydings dmd wr ote that selection of us district judge is power jealously guarded by many senators it is an extremely important source of political patronage and many senators

thad cochran rms amid controversy involving the reluctance of president george hw bush to nominate to vermont district judgeship candidate recommended by senator james m jeffords rvt as matter of custom and tradition in the senate senator cochran declared the senators of the presidents partys recommendations for district court judgeships have been tantamount to selection of that nominee adding that selecting judicial nominees was one of the few patronage positions that senators have outside their staffs 18 echoing senator cochrans views the senate republican conference it was reported went to jeffords defense with resolution asking conference chairman john h chafee rri to advise president bush of the senators support for jeffords choice19 ultimately the candidate recommended by senator jeffords was nominated by president bush and confirmed by the senate by voice vote20 the view of many senators in other words has been that the president should defer to senators of the presidents party in the selection of home state judicial appointees rather than vice versa this view is reinforced by the custom of senatorial courtesy in which the senate as collegial body customarily supports senators of the presidents party in disputes with the president over judicial appointments in their state21 the custom serves as an inducement to the president to try to reach accommodation with home state senators rather than risk senate rejection of nominee whom they oppose as result presidents rarely go forward with nomination for district court judgeship if home state senator of the presidents party has indicated beforehand readiness to oppose the nominee in the senate22 17 joseph w tydings merit selection for district judges judicature vol 61 sept 1977 p 113 hereafter cited as tydings

longer one of unquestioned power to select district court nominees as it has been generally portrayed in the past judicial appointments scholar observed in 1972 that even granting that senators of the party in power may have owned district judgeships at an earlier time in our history they have not during the incumbency of the presidents since truman23 in recent decades senators when recommending judicial candidates increasingly have found it necessary to accommodate new demands or calls from the president which have made their selection power less absolute for instance recent presidents have insisted that candidates whom senators recommend for district judges besides having necessary professional qualifications meet other criteria of particular importance to the president 24 or that the senators submit number of candidates for vacant judgeship rather than only the name of the one candidate they most favor25 further one recent continued for the western district of virginia over the

required return of positive blue slip by both of states senators before allowing consideration of nomination for more than two decades from 1956 through 1978 when senator returned negative blue slip or failed to return blue slip for judicial nomination it was the policy of the committee chair in deference to the senator to decline to schedule hearing or other committee action on the nomination30 in other words home state senator by not returning blue slip or by returning it with negative response could halt all further action on nominee from the state this policy in effect gave senators of either party if they wished to exercise it through the blue slip veto over any home state judicial nomination to which they were opposed31 in so doing the committee policy some scholars have suggested also had the effect of encouraging presidential administrations to consult beforehand with senators of the opposition party as well as of the presidents party to be sure that they would not oppose person being considered for judicial nomination in the state in question 32 since 1979 however deference to home state senators using the blue slip to block or delay judicial nominees has not always been automatic while some chairs of the judiciary committee including senator patrick j leahy dvt in the 110th congress have permitted committee action on judicial nomination only when both home state senators returned positive slips the committee under other chairs by contrast has considered judicial nomination with receipt of only one positive blue slip 33 or on few occasions without blue slip from either home state senator34 while the blue slip policies of various recent chairs of the judiciary committee have varied nearly all policies when articulated in writing have communicated to the

allowed any negative blue slips to automatically veto nomination instead judicial nominations prompting negative blue slips from home state senators received committee hearings and even in some cases were reported by the committee to the full senate these episodes appeared to show that the committees policy during this time was that negative blue slip was not intended to prevent committee action instead senators negative assessment of nominee was meant to express to the committee his views on the nominee so that the chairman would be better prepared to deal with the review of the nomination

the evaluation of negative blue slips the president is now expected to consult and involve each home state senator in the prenomination phase of the selection process without evidence of consultation by the white house various chairm have appeared as matter of policy to accord greater value to negative blue slip submitted by nonconsulted home state senator 36 moreover the role contemplated for senators not of the presidents party when engaging in pre nomination consultation with the president has been expanded official blue slip policy statements by recent chairs of the judiciary committee for instance have not only called for the opportunity for opposition party senators to express opinions about judgeship candidates being considered by the administration but also the opportunity to propose their own candidates to the administration37 in sum the judiciary committees blue slip policy in recent decades as applied in somewhat varying ways by different chairs appears always intended to promote some measure of an advisory role for home state senators of both parties in the judicial nominee selection process moreover the contemplated advisory role has included the opportunity if senators wish to make recommendations to the president about whom to nominate as caveat however it should be kept in mind that the blue slip policy is set by the committees chair and is not part of the committees written rules as result the policys key elements including the degree of importance placed on administration consultation with home state senators is always subject to change in keeping with the prerogatives of the committee chair continued state senators prior to submitting the nomination to the senate if such good faith consultation did not take place he said the judiciary

the selection of federal judicial nominees in their state as general rule senator who belongs to the presidents party has the primary role in recommending candidates for federal district court judgeships in the home state and an influential if not the primary role in recommending candidates for federal circuit court judgeships associated with the home state these as general rule are in contrast to the much lesser roles in recommending district and circuit court candidates played by senator who is of the opposite party if both of states senators are of the presidents party they usually although not always share the responsibility of recommending judicial candidates to the president if neither senator is of the presidents party some other official or officials in their state typically assume the primary role of recommending judicial candidates senators not of the presidents party however sometimes are in position to blish for themselves more influential role in recommending judicial candidates than as just described this particularly might prove to be the case if the senators are perceived by the administration as having the ability and likely inclination to block nominations in the senate either in committee or on the floor unless afforded an enhanced role in judicial nominee selection

senators of the presidents party by wellestablished custom are the key persons who provide the presidents administration with recommendations for us district court judgeships in their state one authority on the judicial appointments process writing in 1987 noted senator of the presidents party expects to be able to influence heavily the selection of federal district judgeship in the senators state indeed most such senators insist on being able to pick these judges and they expect judgeships on the federal courts of appeals going to persons from their states to be cleared by them 39 when only one of states senators is of the presidents party he or she alone by custom is entitled to select all candidates for district judg eships in that state if the administration has concerns about senators recommendation it is expected to resolve those concerns with the senator if the administration continues to have problem with candidate finding him or her unacceptable as nominee the senator and not any other official outside the administration is called on to provide different recommendation if the administration prefers its own candidate it in turn must persuade the senator to agree to its choice for the administration to do otherwise and push forward with nominee objected to by the senator is to risk rejection by the senate given the custom of senatorial courtesy discussed earlier

of their own party or to run the risk of senators sabotaging nomination once it has been sent to the senate40 when only one of states senators is of the presidents party that senator will have almost complete discretion as to whether or how to consult with the states other senator about judicial nominations there is requirement that the former consult with the latter and some senators in such situation may decline to consult with their home state colleague in any way on the other hand many senators in such situations have consulted with their home state colleague in various ways and some have gone so far as to involve them in joint or coordinated process of recommending judicial candidates to the president 41 the following list notes some options available to senator of the presidents party when considering whether or how to consult or cooperate with home state colleague of the opposite party about judicial nominee recommendations the options are not exhaustive but rather identify different degrees of consultation or cooperation about judicial candidates that can exist between home state senators of opposite political parties the senator of the presidents party makes recommendations to the administration without consulting the other home state senator at any stage apprising the latter neither of persons under consideration early in the process nor of persons actually recommended later in the process the senator as courtesy informs the other home state senator of the person whom the former has recommended for judicial nomination without however soliciting the latters views about the candidate or about other possible candidates the senator informs the other home state senator of persons under consideration as potential judicial nominees welcoming input from the latter about these candidates as well as suggestions as to other possible candidates the senator agrees to allow the other home state senator to select minority of the members of an advisory panel which evaluates and screens judicial candidates before the first senator decides whom to recommend 40 ibid p 590 41 for example in 10 states during the carter presidency 19771980 scholar has

state senator allowing the latter to select candidates for minority of the judgeships which become vacant in the state for example for every fourth judgeship the two senators work as coequals in the selection processfor example by using completely bipartisan panel or commission to identify and screen applicants and with all candidate recommendations to the president made by the senators jointly these options as mentioned are almost entirely at the discretion of the senator of the presidents party with his or her views about the judicial appointment process largely determining the extent to which there will be consultation or cooperation with the other home state senator such views in turn may be influenced by the immediate political environment including 1 the nature of working relations between the two senators in ge neral eg strained or cordial 2 the past practices of senators in the state regarding judicial patronage ie whether senators in the state previously worked closely together on judicial appointments 3 the degree of administration support for consultation or cooperation between senators of opposite political parties on home state appointments 42 and 4 the extent to which the other senator is perceived as able or inclined to block home state nominations either in committee or in the full senate43

states senators are of the presidents party they may share the role of recommending judicial candidates to the president or alternately one of them may take the lead role senatorial custom particularly in recent decades provides ample support for both senators having an active role in recommending judicial candidates in their states if each wishes to participate in the process 44 in many states in which both home state senators are of the presidents party both may be engaged in evaluating and selecting judicial candidates one option within this arrangement is for both senators to review and evaluate judicial candidates for every judicial vacancy that arises in their state at their discretion the senators may use an informal process to select candidates for 42 an administration might generally regard bipartisan cooperation between home state senators on judicial nominations as politically beneficial insofar as it paves th way for bipartisan support for these nominations in the senate sometimes however an administration might regard cooperation as going too farfor instance when the senator of the other party is allowed to assume the role of recommending candidates for some of the states judicial nominations and the senator then makes recommendations of which the administration disapproves in such instances an administration might feel it does not have to accept these recommendations or reach accommodations with the senator on mutually acceptable choice as an administration typically would in its interactions with the home state senator of the presidents party 43 the ability of opposition party senators to block lower court nominations from their state will be particularly enhanced if their party is in the senate majority and if the chair of the judiciary committee or the senate majority leader is prepared to support the senators in opposition to home state nomination 44 indicative of this custom was survey in early 1993 during the first months of democrat william j clintons presidency of staff in senate offices on methods used to select candidates for district judgeships at that time18 states were represented by two democratic senators of these 18 states 11 were identified in the survey as having both of their senators jointly involved in the selection of judicial can didates while in five other states one of the senators was identified as the chief sponsor or as taking the lead in the selection process in the two other states the senators had yet to decide on what selection process they would use citizens handbook

on input from close advisers or friends in the legal community alternately th ey may use more formal process for example relying on advisory panels to review applications interview candidates and make recommendations for the senators to choose from at the end of the screening process the senators may agree on one or more candidates to recommend to the president for the judgeship or if they cannot reach agreement they might combine their individual recommendations into one list to submit to the administration another option by contrast is for both senators to be active in the judicial candidate selection process but to take turnsalternating in the role every time there is court vacancy in their state alternating from the workload standpoint in tim required to screen judicial candidates might appear more attractive for senators in states having relatively large number of district judgeships where vacancies occur periodically it however might appear less attractive for senators in states having only handful of district judgeships where vacancies occur infrequently senators agreeing to alternate may decide individually to select candidates through either an informal or formal process as described in the previous paragraph in cases where both senators wish to rely on advisory panels to screen candidates they have the choice of using joint panels which serve on behalf of both senatorswith each senator typically choosing some of the panels members or of using their own separate panels at the end of such an alternating screening process only the senator involved submits recommendation or list of recommendations to the president for the vacant judgeship in question sometimes however in state having two senators of the presidents party one senator may opt out of an active role in recommending judicial candidates leaving the task primarily to his or her home state colleague senator might do so for variety of reasonslack of interest in judicial appointments insufficient time available for the role given other senate responsibilities or out of deference to the states other senator due to the latters seniority interests committee assignments or greater experience in evaluating judicial candidates in such cases the more involved senator proceeding alone as the lead senator may review the backgrounds and qualifications of judicial applicants with informal support or input from others or in more formal arrangement receive evaluations of the applicants or recommendations from an advisory panel established specifically on behalf of the senator to screen judicial candidates at one or more points during the screening process the lead senator can be expected to consult with the other senatorespecially at the point at which the latter can be advised of the candidate or candidates whom the lead senator believes should be recommended or who have received advisory panel recommendations the lead senator before finalizing his or her choice of candidate will want the other senators approvalor failing that at the very least the other senators willingness not to object to the candidates nomination later 45 once candidate is selected the actual recommendation may be made singly by the lead senator or jointly by both senators likewise public statement noting candidates nomination by the president may be made solely by the lead senator or jointly by both senators 45 this endorsement or commitment not to oppose is essential to assure that the nomination will not later be blocked by the second senator either in the senate judiciary comm ittee through nonreturn of blue slip or return of negative blue slip or in the event the nomination were reported by the committee on the senate floor by invoking senatorial courtesy

of the presidents party the survey by the interest group alliance for justice was published shortly after the start of the presidency of william j clinton in january 1993 it was based primarily on interviews with staff members in the offices of democratic senators and house members with additional information obtained through interviews of democratic party officials at the time of the survey there were 11 states in which neither senator was democrat in one of the 11 states judicial candidate selection process was not yet in place and judicial vacancies were pending there in the other 10

it was reported the traditional authority to make recommendations to the president fell to texass senior congressional democrat48 the states senior democratic house member49 likewise at the start of presidency of george w bush republican in january 2001 the new administration looked to other than senatorial sources for advice on judicial candidates in states having two opposition party senators the legal times reported that in the 18 states where both senators are democrats bush will be getting advice on potential nominees from highranking republican house member or the states republican governor 50 without listing the selection methods for each of the 18 states the article noted as examples that in two of the states senior republican h ouse member would be working together with the republican governor on judicial recommendations while in third state republican house member expected to be the presidents point man on judicial nominations51 by custom the role of states senators in judicial candidate selection when neither is of the presidents party is secondary to the role of those officials discussed above who actually choose candidates to recommend to the president customarily in these circumstances the states senators if they are consulted by state officials of the presidents party are consulted for their reactions to candidates under consideration but not for their own preferences where consultations of this sort are done in good faith negative as well as positive feedback from the senators would be welcomed but typically they would not be called upon to make their own candidate recommendations 52 as scholarly study has noted until recent decades 47 citizens handbook supplement pp 315 the secretary of agriculture identified by the survey as the chief

administration played little or role in district judge selection except as permitted in informal agreements between senators and any given administration or by the senate judiciary committee through the blue slip moreover that role described above was generally negative role senator who was not of the presidents party from the state in which judicial nominee would serve could delay or prevent confirmation of nominee by refusing to return the blue slip but the senator could not compel the president to choose his or her candidates 53 the secondary role of senators in judicial candidate selection in states where both are of the opposition party was stated as formal administration policy early in ronald reagans presidency in march 1981 memorandum on judicial selection procedures the department of justice discussed among other things the procedure that would apply in states with republican senators in these cases the memorandum said the attorney general will solicit suggestions and recommendations from the republican members of the congressional delegation who will act in such instances as group in lieu of senators from their respective states it is presumed that

in judicial selection in these cases more active role for states senators might consist of actually serving as primary source for judicial candidate recommendations or selecting at least some of the members of an advisory panel or commission if one is established in cooperation with officials of the presidents party to make judicial candidate recommendations in recent decades various presidents in limited number of situations have allowed states senators when both were of the opposition party an involvement in judicial candidate selection entailing more than simply being consulted during the selection process for example in states having two opposition party senators president john f kennedy scholar has written was sometimes inclined to select persons of the opposition party for judicial appointments in these situation president kennedy used republican minority leader everett dirksen as liaison between the white house and republican senators dirksen was asked to solicit suggestions from the senators in those states which had two republican senators though suggestions of names made directly by the senators were accorded equal treatment55 continued weight with the administration

applicants the commission was to recommend not fewer than five candidates per vacancy to the senators who would then recommend one candidate for each vacancy57 in its first year of operation the

of district court nominees whereas home state senators of the presidents party often if not always dictate whom the president nominates to district judgeships their recommendations for circuit court nominees by contrast typically compete with names suggested to the administration by other sources or gene rated by the administration on its own the lesser role for senators and the more independ ent role of the president in the selection of circuit court nominees is well established by custom in landmark 1953 study of the appointment process the president was said to have much freer hand in the selection of judges of the circuit courts of appeal whose districts cover several states than of district judges who serve within individual states 67 in 1971 during the presidency of richard m nixon scholar wrote when it comes to making appointments to circuit courts the balance of power shifts markedly away from senators to favor decisionmaking by the presidents men68 in 1977 analysis former us senator observed that while many senators had the power to select district court nominees from their states single senator automatically controls who is appointed to circuit judgeships 69 the senators statement proved to be an understatement for during the years of jimmy carters presidency 19771980 his administration relied almost entirely upon circuit judge nominating commission to identify candidates for circuit court nominations in so doing the administration largely excluded home state senators of the presidents party from the process of recommending persons for circuit judgeships the senators however were consulted for their views about the commissions recommendations before president carter actually selected nominee 70 president ronald reagan disbanded the circuit judge nominating commission created by president carter which restored for home state senators role in recommending circuit court candidates71 the role however was not dominant one for during the reagan

picture was portrayed of senators playing subordinate role to the administration when identifying candidates for circuit court judgeships in comparison with their role in recommending district court nominees report found senators were said to have less influence over the presidents selection of nominees to the 12 circuit courtswith senators free to suggest circuit candidates to the white house but with the president traditionally not bound by such suggestions73 at the end of the clinton presidency an outgoing department of justice official noted that while senators usually pretty much decided who was nominated for district court judgeships the appellate court selections were primarily controlled decided by the white house and the justice department mostly the white house 74 subsequently in the presidency of george w bush 2001present the role of senators in recommending circuit court nominees continued as general rule to be less significant than their role in recommending district court nominees the names of circuit nominees have tended to be generated more by the administration than by senators75 with instances of senators having president bush select their candidates for circuit judgeships being exceptions to the rule76 eleven of the 13 us circuit courts of appeals77 it will be recalled are geographically based courts encompassing three or more states in each of these circuit courts many of the seats on the bench have traditionally been linked to particular state and historically overwhelmingly one scholar has observed the majority of replacement appointments for appeals court vacancies have indeed gone to judges from the state in which the vacancy arose 78 hence each time one of these judgeships is vacated senators of the state involved usually can be expected to cite the tradition of the state seat and seek through their own candidate recommendations to preserve the judgeship for nominee from their state79 for their part presidents in recent decades usually but not always have been inclined to make circuit court appointment in keeping with the state seat tradition by selecting nominee from the same state as the vacating judge80 73

the circuit courts in most cases they are not required to do so president will be required to select resident from particular state for circuit court vacancy only when necessary to assure that the court is represented by at least one appointee from that state81 in all other circumstances president is free to appoint resident from any state within the circuit to j udgeship in spite of any historical association particular state might have with the judgeship this latitude of the president to select circuit court nominee from candidates in more than one state prevents senators from being able to assert an absolute claim for their state over any circuit judgeship unless the judgeships vacancy would leave the senators state without representation on the circuit when president selects different state to be represented by circuit judgeship he in effect gives the senatorial prerogatives associated with the judgeship to different pair of senators while senators usually are not the dominant or decisive players in the process of selecting circuit court nominees they nonetheless do enjoy certain prerogatives in the process once judgeship in circuit becomes vacant senators in states falling within the circuit are free to suggest names to the presidents administration regarding possible nominees if the administration has indicated which state it wants the judgeship to representwhether in keeping with traditional state seat or in break with that traditionthe senators of that state if they are of the presidents party customarily are among those who recommend candidates for the judgeship senators of the presidents party one authority has written expect judgeships on the federal courts of appeals going to persons from their states to be cleared by them 82 if the home state senators are not of the presidents party they nonetheless have expectationsbased on the senate judiciary committees longstanding blue slip policythat they too will be consulted by the administration for their views about the prospective nominee perhaps the most forceful input senators can provide to presidents administration regarding potential circuit court nominees is strong disapproval of particular candidate from their state if the candidate is nominated in spite of their objections the senators whether of the presidents party or not will have important senate traditions in their favor if they decide to oppose the nominee in the senate if they are of the presidents party the senators know and the administration will know as well that they have the tradition of senatorial courtesy to call upon as one scholar has noted senators can invoke senatorial courtesy effectively against circuit court nominations provided they are of the presidents party and the nominee is resident of their state 83 hence input from such senators in forceful opposition to the candidate amounts to negative recommendation that the administration should take very seriously to avoid senate rejection of the candidate based on senatorial courtesy continued update of that report 86 of appointments to the circuit courts had been of nominees who at the time of their appointment

would not be expected to invoke senatorial courtesy to oppose circuit court nominee from their state they however can take advantage of the senate judiciary committees blue slip procedure to bolster their opposition in the event candidate objectionable to them is nominated the senators as discussed above may register their disapproval at the committee stage by declining to return blue slip or returning negative blue slip to the judiciary committee such action by home state senator experience has shown can jeopardize or doom nomination depending on the blue slip policy of the committees chair during some chairmanships in recent decades the policy of the judiciary committee has been to allow in some instances committee consideration of judicial nomination receiving negative blue slip or blue slip from one or both of the nominees home state senators 84 when such policy is in effect senators negative blue slip or failure to return positive blue slip does not foreclose the possibility of the committee reporting the nomination to the senate it however at the very least draws the committees attention to the concerns of the home state senator and to the question of what degree of courtesy the members of the committee owe that senators concerns nomination is much more in jeopardy when the judiciary committee policy in effect is not to consider any nomination for which home state senator has not returned positive blue slip when such is the committees policy home state senators opposition to judicial nomination through use of the blue slip eliminates any chance of its being reported out of committee in effect killing the nomination unless the senator can be persuaded to drop his or her opposition accordingly when both of states senators are of the opposition party and they object to circuit court candidate from their state their opposition might persuade the president not to nominate the candidate in turn the senators also might succeed in influencing the president to nominate another individual from their state who is more acceptable to them however president if dissuaded from nominating the candidate objected to by the senators may then consider nominating an individual from another state in the circuit in the event the president chooses this option the administration will longer have to engage in consultation with the same senators regarding the vacant judgeship because they would longer be the nominations home state senators the home state senators wi th whom the administration would be expected to consult would now be the senators of the state of the new circuit court candidate 85 84 see crs report rl32013 the history of the blue slip in the senate committee on the judiciary 1917present pp 13 22 binder where do institutions come

senators office learns that judges hip is or soon will become vacant judicial vacancy is created when judicial officeholder vacates the office for example by retirement resignation elevation to higher court or death or when legislation is enacted creating new judgeship depending on the circumstances current or future judicial vacancy will be brought to the attention of home state senator by the outgoing judge by the administration or on the initiative of the senators office the typical practice of circuit and district judges is to give notice of their planned retirements months in advance 86 sometimes senators learn of an upcoming judicial vacancy when circuit or district judge from their state as courtesy alerts the senators beforehand of the judges intention to retire white house or department of justice officials responsible for advising the president on judicial appointments also can be expected to notify senators office of judicial vacancy in the senators stateparticularly if the senator is of the presidents partyand to invite the senator to make recommendations of candidates to fill the judgeship in this initial contact or soon thereafter the administration might also inform the senator of its preferences concerning candidates and the selection process these preferences for example might include the number of recommendations the senator is expected to submit the qualification standards that the senators candidates must meet and the time frame in which the senator is expected to submit recommendations to the administration also in this preliminary outreach to the senator the administration might discuss paperwork requirements such as the background questionnaires that eventually will have to be filled out by any candidate that the senator selects senator however does not have to wait to hear from outgoing judges or the administration to be informed of current or upcoming judicial vacancies on its own initiative senators office can visit the federal

circuit88 in both lists senator or the senators staff will readily find under the heading of the judicial circuit in which the senators state is located any circuit judgeships as well as any district judgeships within the senators state which are currently vacant or are scheduled to be vacated at specified future date of course senator is free if he or she chooses to initiate judicial candidate selection process or to compile list of prospective judicial candidates before learning that judgeship is vacant or scheduled to become vacant some senators particularly those representing state having many lower federal court judgeshipswhere vacancies might be expected to occur periodicallymight find it advantageous to be ready at any time with names of judicial candidates to recommend

affecting the role of senator in selecting candidates for federal judgeships will be the states other senator as discussed above the extent to which the two senators will share the judicial selection role will depend to great extent on their respective prerogatives and interests in this area one senator might have more prerogatives to select judicial candidates than the other particularly if he or she is of the presidents party and the other is not further if one senator has far more experience or expertise in selecting judicial candidates the other senator might be inclined to defer to the more senior colleague in recommending persons to federal judgeships in addition one senator might be very interested in the judicial selection process while the other might because of other priorities in the senate have less interest in this area if the prerogatives and interests of states senators in selecting judicial candidates are roughly equal eg they are both of the presidents party have about the same amount of senate seniority and are both interested in recommending judicial candidates to the president sharing the candidate selection role in some way seems almost inevitable

candidate selections prior to their being recommended to the administration as well as to join the selecting senator in formally recommending candidates this option might be suitable not only in various situations where only one home state senator is of the presidents party but also where both senators are of the presidents party yet only one wishes to be actively involved in the judicial selection process

minority for example for every third or fourth judicial vacancy this arrangement as noted earlier might be suitable in situations where senator of the presidents party is willing to share the candidate recommending role with home state senator of the other party also senators in states having more than one federal judicial district could apportion between themselves the selection of judicial candidates according to judicial districtfor example with candidates in one district selected by one senator and candidates in the second district selected by the other senator

this arrangement could consist of active involvement of both senators offices in each phase or in most phases of the candidate selection process for example announcing vacancies and inviting candidates to apply reviewing candidate applications interviewing applicants and selecting one or more candidates to recommend to the administration alternately if the senators were too busy to involve themselves with each phase of the candidate selection process and did not wish to assign their personal office staff to selection process tasks they could delegate much of the selection role to an outside screening committee panel or commission 89 in such delegated arrangement the senators might be most involved in the earliest and latest phases of the selection processin the beginning when they would share in appointing members to the screening panel and at the end of the process when they both would weigh the panels candidate recommendations

criteria to determine the fitness of persons from their state who seek to be recommended for us district or us circuit court judgeships ordinarily two sets of criteria can be expected to be most important in governing the senators choicesfirst the standards explicitly set by the administration for judicial candidates and second the personal criteria that the senators themselves are inclined to use when deciding whether prospective candidates merit recommendation to the president in recent decades various presidents have issued guidelines or made public statements regarding the qualification standards that their judicial nominees must meet virtually every president has emphasized the importance of nominee meeting high professional standards and having the ability to be impartial as judge at the same time each president has underscored that judicial nominees must conform with the basic values or ideals that the president believes are inherent in the constitution as well as with the president s views of what judges fundamental role and priorities should be in our nations constitutional system such perspectives on the constitution have tended to vary somewhat from one president to the nextwith some presidents for example emphasizing the limited role of judge in our constitutional system ie whose role is to interpret rather than to make the law and others emphasizing the role of judges in safeguarding constitutional and legal protections of citizens rights 89 the current use by some senators of outside judicial nominating commissions to evaluate and recommend judicial candidates is discussed in more detail later in this report under the heading procedures used to identify and evaluate candidates

standards or goals for senators to meet when selecting judicial candidates endorsing for instance the goal of increasing the representation of women and persons of minority ethnicity in the lower federal courts elaboration of what qualities an administration looks for in judicial candidates also can come from white house or department of justice officials who are involved in the judicial selection process senator seeking to select judicial candidates acceptable to the president will necessarily want to take into account any qualification requirements expressed by the president or other key administration officials senators also will have their own considerations or criteria to guide them in selecting judicial candidates ideally in nearly all cases fundamental starting requirement for senator engaged in the search for judicial candidates will be that any person selected have the professional qualifications integrity and judicial temperament needed to perform capably as federal judge forming backdrop to each senators search will be the custom to appoint lawyers who have distinguished themselves professionallyor at least not to appoint those obviously without merit90 accordingly in many cases judicial candidate will as part of the senators selection process be evaluated or rated by local or state bar association or some other kind of informal or formal panel of lawyers called upon specifically to evaluate the candidates professional qualifications senator should be mindful that once he or she has recommended judicial candidate to the president the candidates qualifications will be closely investigated by administration personnel involved in advising the president on whether the candidate should be nominated the nominees qualifications also will be exhaustively examined by the american bar associations standing committee on the federal judiciary either in the selection process prior to nomination or immediately after the nomination is made 91 finally the nomination will be scrutinized yet again by staff of the senate judiciary committee upon senate receipt of the nomination from the president also senator likely will be guided by at least some political party considerations in the judicial candidate search traditionally the overwhelming majority of all federal judicial nominees come from the same party as the nominating president with more than half of all federal judges having been politically active before their appointments 92 the tradition of selecting candidates having the same party affiliation as the president is linked to political patronage concerns of home state senators of the presidents party in this context home state senator in some instances might regard judgeship recommendation at least in part as reward for major service to the party the president or the senator93 scholarly study of the judicial appointment process cites two reasons why most nominees for judicial office must have some record of political activity 90 robert carp and ronald stidham judicial process in america 3d ed washington cq press 1996 p 240 hereafter cited as carp and stidham judicial process merit the authors continue may mean more than an association with prestigious law firm publication of few law review articles or respect among fellow attorneys potential judge need not necessarily be an outstanding legal scholar

the political patronage system those who have served the party are more likely to be rewarded with federal post than those who have not paid their dues second even if judgeship is not given as direct political payoff some political activity on the part of wouldbe judge is often necessary because otherwise the candidate would simply not be visible to the president or senatorss or local party leaders who send forth the names of cand idates if the judicial power brokers have never heard of particular lawyer because that attorney has political profile his or her name will not come to mind when vacancy occurs on the bench 94 senator also may evaluate the suitability of judicial candidate according to whether certain groups or constituencies are adequately represented on the district or circuit court in question among the representational considerations senator might take into account are candidatess ethnicity religion gender and place of residence for instance at the time particular judicial vacancy occurs senator might be concerned with increasing the representation of certain ethnic group on that court to make its membership more representative of the population of the senators state or of that part of the state in which the judicial district is situated another concern of the senator for example might be to assure that membership in the district court or courts in the senators state represent all of the states geographic regions senators as well may sometimes use philosophical or ideological criteria to evaluate judicial candidates in applying such criteria senator might be concerned with what valueslegal constitutional political social economic nd philosophicalwould underlie candidates reasoning and decision making as judge and wh ether in light of these values the candidate would approach cases with impartiality or with prejudgment senator also might be concerned with gauging how the candidate ultimately might d ecide certain kinds of legal or constitutional issues especially any issues about which the senator personally feels strongly or in what general direction the candidate might move court if joined with judges of similar views applying such criteria senator might find judicial candidate acceptable if his or her orientation appeared sufficiently compatible with the senators the exact philosophical or ideological criteria applied would vary among senators reflecting their individual views regarding the courts the constitution and public policy 95

senators have great discretion as to the procedures they will follow in identifying and evaluating candidates for appointment to federal judgeships these may range over wide spectrum of optionsfrom procedures that are extremely informal unstructured and totally dependent on senators individual judgment to those formalized structured and reliant on judgments of others beside the senator senator for instance may view his or her role in selecting judicial candidate as essentially making personal choice with any input from others being informal in nature and not in any way limiting the senators involvement in the search for candidates by contrast at the other end of the spectrum senator may use formally constituted advisory body 94 ibid p 242 95 in recent years senators have expressed different views on whether it is appropriate to evaluate judicial nominees by their ideology judicial philosophy or views on specific issues notable instance of this was june 26 2001 hearing held by

identify and evaluate judicial candidates but also to make recommendations that would be binding on the senator or that the senator ordinarily would be expected to follow senator as well may take procedural approach that falls somewhere between the two just described or that has elements of each for instance senator may use the services of formal committee of expert advisers to identify and evaluate judicial candidates but with the understanding that the committees recommendations are advisory only and not in any way binding on the senator 96 in november 12 2003 floor speech senator illustrated from his own experience the discretion and flexibility senators have to tailor their own personal approach to judicial candidate selection in the speech made during an extended senate debate on judicial nominations97 the senator stated that over the course of his senate career he saw himself as bearing the following responsibilitythat if you are going to make judicial recommendations to the president of the united states do so with care98 he described two somewhat different approaches that he had taken during his tenure to identify candidates for lower court judgeships in his state in the first 25 years of his senate career he noted i appointed nominating committee made up principally of very distinguished attorneys and judicial figures for whom i had respect and from all over my state i knew these people commanded respect and they were very helpful in identifying each time judicial vacancy occurred several nominees without fail i presented all of these nominees to the president and his staff sifted through them and in each case came up with one of the nominees frequently the one recommended first by the panel 99 in 2002 however upon learning that two us district court judges in his state would be retiring the senator took different approach to identifying judicial candidates100 on this occasion he said he wrote letters to the press throughout his state in the letters he outlined all the of the qualifications he saw needed for federal judge and invited every wellqualified person to 96 senate financial management regulations it should be noted anticipate that some senators will use advisory panels or groups to assist them in selecting judicial candidates the regulations provide in part that individuals who are not senate

emerged after reading all of their applications he interviewed five of the candidateswith principal interest in their professional skills as well as in their characterization of how they would fulfill their responsibilities from the five interviewed candidates the senator submitted three names to the white house and two of those persons were nominated by the president and subsequently confirmed by the senate101 as mentioned above another option for senators is to delegate all or some of their power to evaluate and recommend candidates for federal j udgeships to judicial nominating commissions sometimes also referred to as merit commissions such commissions are ordinarily created by senators for the specifically stated purpose of identifying and recommending highly qualified persons for federal judicial appointment102 while the structure and operations of nominating commissions vary most have the following features in common they have been formally and publicly constituted by one or both of their states senators or by predecessor senators of their state they have specific number of members who have been publicly identified each commission has clearly defined mission each publishes notices of judicial vacancies and invites applicants the applicants fill out standard application form or questionnaire and are evaluated according to procedures that are the same for each application applications must be submitted and the commissions evaluation of applications completed by specified deadlines the commission recommends not one but several candidates for judicial position forwarding the names either to the home state senators or directly to the president typically commission memberships include prominent attorneys in the state or local bar and sometimes leaders of other community groups and they often if not always represent both political parties103 101 ibid 102 for instance in announcing the creation of such commission in 2001 senator declared it

identify candidates for federal judgeships came with the presidency of jimmy carter who at the start of his administration in 1977 urged every democratic senator to establish commission for the selection of candidates for us district judge positions104 by 1980 the last full year of the carter presidency senatorial commissions were operating in 31 states105 although president reagan in 1981 disbanded the commission created by president carter to identify circuit court candidates106 his attorney general urged republican senators to use commissions as democratic senators had done during the previous four years to screen candidates for district court judgeships107 while senatorial use of nominating commissions is longer widespread brookings institution study in november 2007 reported that today 16 senators in eight states use them in five both senators are democrats the study found that most of the presentday commissions had bipartisan memberships circumstance attributed to political necessity bipartisan commission membership is essential in this period of polarized politics with both majority and minority senators ready and able to contest nominations realizing this the democratic senators who use commissions today appoint some republican members named either by themselves or by state republican l eaders similar to what republican senators did during the carter administration 108 senators who use nominating commissions to identify and evaluate judicial candidates often if not always require their commissions to follow cl early defined rules of procedure in wisconsin where its two democratic senators have chartered commission to advise them in the selection of candidates to fill us district court vacancies in that stateas well as for vacancies for us attorneys in wisconsin and us circuit court judgeships which are appropriately considered wisconsin seatsthe charter lays out the rules of procedure in detail the charter provides that the commission shall consist of 11 members in the case of district court and us attorney vacancies or 12 members in the case of circuit court vacancy the number of members that each senator may appoint to the commission varies depending on whether the senator is of the same political party as the president 109 when court vacancy occurs the charter provides 104 goldman picking federal judges p 244 observing

applications as well as for evaluating the candidates qualifications further the charter sets organizational and voting procedures for the commissions members including quorum requirement and the number of affirmative votes required to recommend candidate for nomination finally it states that after the commission has designated not less than four nor more than six individuals as best qualified to fill vacancy the commission shall immediately notify the states nators as to the names of the individuals110 in the above example use of nominating commission can be seen as largely removing senators from the initial search for judicial candidates as well as from the evaluation of all of the candidates who initially submit applications the arrangement however retains for the senators the opportunity to evaluate the smaller number of applicants who ultimately are recommended by the commission further the senators are not required by the language of the commissions charter to forward to the president every commission recommendation that they receive absent commitment to be bound by merit panels recommendations senators retain the discretion to further inquire on their own into the qualifications of persons recommended by the commission and to pass along to the president only those recommendations that they find acceptable 111

as well as by investigations of the federal bureau of investigation fbi into the backgrounds of judicial candidates decides which candidates to recommend to the president for nomination in recent presidencies the selection process has consisted of number of basic preliminary steps including for any given administration all or nearly all of the following at the outset the names of judicial nominee candidates are identified as recommended by senators or others outside the administration or as generated from within the administration the candidates fill out various forms and questionnaires including personal background information form for the fbi financial disclosure form white house questionnaire and questionnaire from the senate judiciary committee sometimes the administration waits until it has narrowed down the nominee search to one candidate requiring only that candidate to fill out the aforementioned forms an initial evaluation or preliminary vetting of the candidates is conducted which includes interviewing some or all of the candidates either by phone or in person and reviewing publicly available information about them such as their published writings and news media accounts of their past activities in public life 113 the candidates also might or might not be asked by the administration to fill out questionnaire of an american bar association committee which evaluates and rates the professional qualifications of nominees for federal judgeships114 continued goldman et w bush remaking the judiciary p 287 the same scholars after

recommended to the president for more intensive evaluation the president clears the candidate for this more intensive evaluation known as detailed vetting the detailed vetting phase of the selection process for any given administration in recent decades has included all or nearly all of the following steps the fbi conducts confidential background investigation of the candidate which typically takes four to six weeks the aba standing committee on the federal judiciary if informed by the administration of the candidate under consideration and upon receipt of an aba questionnaire filled out by the candidate also conducts an investigation of the candidate115 simultaneously with the fbi investigation and with the aba committee investigation as well if that committee is involved in the prenomination selection process executive branch staff from the department of justice or the white house or both carefully review the candidates written opinions or other legal writings depending on whether the candidate is judge or practicing attorney as well as the forms and questionnaires filled out by the candidate and interview persons in the legal community who have had past contact with or have knowledge about the candidate followup interview of the candidate is conducted either in person or by telephone to address any new questions or confirm new information arising out of the detailed vetting process judicial selection staff in the administration evaluate the results of the detailed vetting effort and recommend to the president whether to nominate the candidate in the administration of president george w bush the above steps in the selection process have been directed by judicial selection committee consisting of staff from the white house counsels office and the department of justices office of legal policy olp under the committees direction olp staff have had primary responsibility for investigating the background and qualifications of prospective nominees the sole responsibility for liaison with us senators on the other hand has resided with the white house counsels office staff in this office receive input from senators regarding judicial candidates and consult with senators or their staff at different steps in the judicial candidate evaluation process consultation can be expected to include apprising senators of the status of their recommended candidates and indicating how far along the administration has progressed in narrowing its search for nominee continued evaluations are sent to the senate judiciary committee whic h typically awaits receipt of the aba evaluations before it holds confirmation hearings on the nominations in question 115 however as noted above the aba committee does not perform this role for the current bush administration which unlike previous recent administrations does not inform the aba committee of judicial candidates it is considering or seek the committees evaluation of th candidates before making

regarding judicial appointments can be expected to clarify the nature of the senators recommending role116 principal question to be addressed in these contacts will be the degree to which the administration in its judicial candidate search will rely on recommendations from the senator the senator for instance will want to know whether the administration will give sole or primary consideration to candidates that the senator recommends for particular judgeshipand further whether the administration if not comfortable with the senato rs candidates will seek and rely primarily on additional recommendations from the senator rather than on recommendations coming from others this role typically might be expected when the senator is the only senator in the state of the presidents party or if the states other senator is also of the presidents party and the two are making joint recommendations and if the vacancy to be filled is on district court under different circumstances however the administration might intend the senator to have lesser role the administration for example might welcome recommendations from the senator while also encouraging recommendations from other sources and while conducting its own search for candidates this role might often be the case if the senator is of the presidents party but the appointment in question would be to circuit court in third type of arrangement it might be understood that the senator would not be regarded as primary source for candidate recommendations however as courtesy the administration would consider any recommendations the senator might make apprise the senator of judicial candidates under serious consideration and invite the senators opinions about those candidates before one were selected as nominee this often might be the case when the senator is of the opposition party regardless of the kind of judgeship in question and sometimes might be the case when the senator is of the presidents party and the appointment in question is to circuit court another question to be addressed in preliminary consultations between senators office and the administration will be the number of persons if any that the senator is expected to recommend for single judicial vacancy in recent presidencies the administration practice usually has been to request that senator supply the names of at least three candidates for judgeship affording the president more options in making final choice than would be possible with only one candidate under consideration if multiple recommendations are requested by the administration senator might wish to establish whether this is preference or requirement if requirement the senator might wish to inquire into the administrations possible willingness to initially evaluate only the senators first choice and if finding that choice acceptable to dispense with evaluating the other recommended candidates 117 116 subsequently during particular presidency senator ght consider it necessary to have additional contact with the administration to confirm or further clarify the nature of the senators recommending role this situation might arise for example if the senator believes that the administration is not fully conforming to earlier agreedupon procedures regarding the senators role in the judicial selection process if new administration officials assume responsibility for judicial candidate selection or liaison with senators on judicial selection matters or if new member is elected to the states other senate seat 117 president ronald reagans administration appears to have been the first to institute regular requirement that home state senator provide the names of at least three candidates for vacant judgeship this practice was continued by the administration of george hw bush observed part of the time by the clinton administration and reinstituted as systematic practice by the administration of george w bush such administration requirements however have not always prevented senators from expressing strong preferences for one candidate or from securing for that candidate an inside track in the administrations selection

relationship with the other states senator and the extent to which the two senators would be coordinating or sharing the role as recommender if one senator would be taking the lead to what extent would that senator or administration officials assume the responsibility for consulting with the other senator regarding the search for and evaluation of judicial candidates if an advisory panel were to be used would it serve that senator alone or would the panel s recommendations before being forwarded to the administration be cleared by the other senator as well if neither senator were of the presidents party would designated officials in the presidents party having judicial recommendation role in that state be making recommendations to the administration in close consultation with the senators or apart from them the longstanding practice of presidential administ rations ordinarily has been to give the primary recommending function to senators of the presidents party or to house members or state officials of the presidents party when there are senators from the states of the vacancies if the vacancy to be filled is that of district judgeship for circuit court nominations by contrast the administrations usual practice especially so with the most recent presidencies has been to center its consideration on candidates whom it selected on its own rather than on persons recommended by home state senators118 continued instance during the reagan presidency an attorney working on judicial selections in the white house counsels office noted that some of our fiercest battles were with sameparty republican senators on district judges where president reagan sought to institute very controversial rule he insisted on receiving three names from re publican senators for district court nominees we tried to enforce that rigorously we had some senators who would say if president reagan wants three names ill give him three names smith smith and smith ultimately judge

has been some resistance on the part of some senators but the administration is not sympathetic to senators who submit one name and insist that person be named however the justice department will

altering its usual practices it might for example be amenable to allowing home state senators not of the presidents party in some circumstances greater than usual role in recommending district court candidates or to allowing home state senators of either party greater than usual role in identifying circuit court candidates for the administration to consider further even if afforded only marginal role in recommending candidates at the outset home state senator regardless of party affiliation ordinarily can expect to be consulted by the administration subsequently during the selection process the typical purpose of such consultation will be to apprise the senator of candidates that the administration is seriously considering and to afford the senator an opportunity to express his or her views concerning the candidates 119 accordingly home state senator presumably will want to use his or her initial contact with the administration at the very least to clarify the administrations general policy regarding the recommending role of senators in the selection of lower court nominees in some cases the senator during this initial or subsequent contact might also wish to explore whether he or she can play larger recommending role than ordinarily contemplated by administration policy further the senator might want to clarify when home state judicial vacancy arises how often and for what purpose the administration would intend to consult with the senator until nominee were actually selected

between senator and the administra tion over the selection of judicial nominee can take different forms depending on the stage reached in the selection process early in the process as already noted consultation may consist primarily of the senator providing input to the administration the input in many cases will be in the nature of recommending particular candidate or list of candidates for judgeship if providing more than one name the senator might or might not rank the candidates in order of the senators preferences the input in some cases might also take negative form with the senator expressing opposition to particular candidates or kinds of candidates senator might provide this kind of input if he or she understood that the administration would be relying on its own internally generated list of candidates or on recommendations from sources other than the senator in some instances senator may convey recommendations directly to the presidentfor example in an inperson meeting by telephone or by letterwithout white house or senatorial staff functioning as intermediaries senator or an aide on the senators behalf also may submit recommendations to the president indirectly by transmitting them for example in written or other form to the administration office charged with serving as liaison to senators on judicial appointment questions 119 the administration of president george w bush has asserted on various occasions that it is very open to judicial candidate recommendations from senators of both parties as well as to their views about other candidates under administration consideration at the conclusion of president bushs first term for instance white house counsel told scholars we always consult with home state senators democrats or republicans to find out if there are candidates that they would like for us to consider we are also interested in receiving their feedback on candidates were are considering the consultation has been extensive and consistently so dabney friedrich associate white house counsel quoted in goldman et w bushs judiciary the first term record p 247

in further consultation shifts to the administration to apprise the home state senator where things stand the point at which this first occurs may vary somewhat depending on the particular judicial position to be filled or on the understandings reached earlier between the administration and the senator often however renewed consultation can be said to come when the administration is close to concluding or has concluded its preliminary evaluation of candidate or candidates for judgeships based in part on its interviews of the various candidates if there is more than one candidate and on preliminary examination of the available record of the candidates the administration at some point will be in position to apprise the home state senator whether one candidate has emerged as the clear favorite various policy statements made in recent decades by chairs of the senate judiciary committee have expressed the view that home state senators should be informed when an administration has narrowed its list of candidates for judgeship to one candidate the expectation of the policy statements has been that the home state senators will be so apprised before the president approves that candidate for more intensive formal clearancebefore the candidate undergoes complete fbi background investigation and other aspects of the detailed vetting process discussed earlier if the administration is considering the selection of someone other than candidate recommended by the senator the administration at this point may apprise the senator of this fact affording the senator an opportunity to express any opinions or concerns about the candidate including whether the senator might oppose the candidate if nominated in some instances preliminary review of candidates recommended by senator might result in the administration deciding that none would be acceptabl at that point the senator might be called on to provide additional recommendations for the administration to consider or perhaps less often be informed that administration staff have decided on candidate of their own to recommend to the president if judicial candidate under consideration for formal clearance is person recommended by the home state senator such clearance when it occu rs of course ordinarily will meet with the senators wholehearted approval the subsequent vetting of the candidate as already discussed will involve comprehensive fbi investigation of the candidate and might also include review of the candidates past rulings or legal writings and the questionnaires he or she filled out as well as an initial or followup interview of the candidate and interviews of persons in the legal community who have had past contact with or knowledge about the candidate during this investigation administration consultation with the home state senator might entail little more than providing routine status reports on the progress of the clearance process particularly if nothing problematic about the candidate is found by contrast if candidate under consideration for formal clearance has not been recommended by home state senator subsequent administration consultation with the senator might or might not take place at several points if it acts in keeping with the kind of consultative process called for in past policy statements of the judiciary committee the administration might notify the senator that it is preparing to begin formal clearance process for particular candidate affording the senator an opportunity to provide feedback before it actually initiates the clearance process subsequently if the senator in providing feedback objects to the candidate the administration might in turn as courtesy and in accord with past judiciary committee policy statements notify the senator that the formal clearance process is being initiated despite the senators objections

decides to nominate the candidate consultation again can be expected particularly if the home state senators are of the presidents party specifically the administration if it acts in keeping with past judiciary committee statements will notify home state senators whether or not they recommended the person involved before the nomination is actually made the administration however is not obliged by any rule or longstanding custom to engage in all of the consultative steps just discussed in the absence of any requirements to engage in prenomination consultation presidents administration might not

confirmation might dissuade the president from making new nomination to the judgeship of someone else as objectionable to the senator as the original nominee causing the administration to take

evaluating judicial candidates in such situations senator might wish to publicize rather than conceal these differences to promote his or her own policy preferences and call those of the administration into question if the senator decides to oppose the nomination the first available recourse will be to exercise the prerogatives afforded to home state senator by the blue slip policy of the senate judiciary committee as already discussed the blue slip policy determines what effect the disapproval of home state senator indicated by the return to the committee of negative blue slip or by the non return of the blue slip will have on the prospects for nomination to be considered by the committee the blue slip policy is set by the chair of the judiciary committee usually at the outset

blue slip policies applied over the years it can be argued concerns whether under particular policy home state senator may block committee consideration of nomination simply by returning negative blue slip one expressing opposition to the nomination or declining to return the blue slip the blue slip policy of some committee chairs including the one in effect during the 110 th congress has been to afford that basic veto power to the home state senator when the committees policy is to consider nomination only if both home state senators have returned positive blue slips refusal of one of the senators to do so will block the nomination the senator in such situation might initially have been unsuccessful in trying to prevent the president from nominating particular person nevertheless under the committee policy in effect in the 110 th congress the senator ultimately can succeed in preventing senate confirmation of the nominee by using the judiciary committees blue slip procedure to stop the nomination in committee the policy of some other chairs of the committee by contrast has been not to allow negative blue slip or nonreturn of blue slip by itse lf to automatically block consideration of the nomination in committee for instance the policy sometimes has been applied to allow consideration of judicial nomination when one or even in very rare instances both home state senators have declined to return positive blue slips or to allow negative or unreturned blue slip to block committee consideration only if the administration in the view of the committee chair did not consult in good faith with home state senator prior to selecting the nominee 120 when the judiciary committees blue slip policy is not to allow single home state senator to block committee consideration of lower court nominee the next recourse available to the senator is to convey to the committee his or her objections about the nominee if and when it considers the nomination the senator might have objections based on concerns about the fitness of the nominee to be federal judge or about the nature or lack of consultation that the administration engaged in with the senator

against voting on the nominee or in the event of vote that the vote be to reject even if the senator anticipates that the committee will vote to report the nomination the senator might wish to put his or her concerns about the nominee on record with the committee to set the stage for making the same case again before the full senate another tactical option for the senator will be to try to persuade one or more members of the judiciary committee to engage in filibuster in committeein an effort to prevent the committee from voting on the nomination121 rule iv of the judiciary committees rules of procedure provides that debate on matter before the committee shall be terminated if nondebatable motion is made to bring the matter to vote without further debate and it passes with ten votes in the affirmative one of which must be cast by the minority122 depending on how the chair of the judiciary committee interprets rule iv senator opposing nomination might or might not succeed in preventing committee vote on it and thus block it in committee the senator will succeed in filibuster against the nominee for instance if none of the minority members of the judiciary committee votes in favor of motion to terminate debate and if the chair of the committee interprets rule iv as providing the minority with right not to have debate terminated and not to be forced to vote without at least one member of the minority agreeing123 the senator however will not succeed if the chair wishes to bring the nomination to vote and views the committee chair as having the inherent power to bring matter to vote124 if the judiciary committee votes to report the objectedto nomination the home state senators opposition strategy then shifts to the senate floor at this point the senator if so inclined may inform his or her party leader that the senator wants to place hold on the nomination this action would have the effect of preventing or delaying senate action on the nomination if the majority leader honors the request for hold alternately the senator may request the leader to place hold on another nomination or on an important administrationbacked bill in order to pressure the president to withdraw the objectedto nomination the effectiveness of the hold is grounded in the difficulty for the senate under its rules of getting to final vote on nomination if single senator objects such an objection voiced on behalf of the home state senator would indicate that hold had been placed on the nomination 125 and that the senator placing the hold might be prepared to filibuster the nomination126 to end delay on the nomination and allow for 121 of course if member of the judiciary committee the senator himself or herself may engage in this filibuster either alone or ideally from

leader until an adjournment of the senate for more than 30 days at which point under senate rules the nomination may be returned to the president however if the majority leader decides to schedule action on the nomination the senator must decide whether to filibuster it as well as whether to enlist the support of other senators in this effort for their part senators supporting the nomination in response to filibuster or in anticipation of one may file cloture petition signed by 16 members to end debate if threefifths of the senates membership votes in favor of cloture maximum of 30 hours of

oppose judicial nominee selected by the president with little apparent regard for the views of the senator during the nominee selection process various considerations might influence the senator to take this position one consideration for not opposing the nominee might be the desirability of filling the vacant judgeship in question as promptly as possible to successfully oppose the nomination in the judiciary committee or the full senate would compel the president to make new nomination for the judgeship at later point in time the senators opposition in other words would prolong the time in which the judgeship was vacant hence senator in some situations might consider filling the vacancy with nominee in whom he or she found fault or about whom the senator had been inadequately consulted to be lesser evil than prolonging the vacancy indefinitely by successfully opposing the nominee in the senate in some situations another consideration for not opposing nomination might be the nominees qualifications for the judgeshipparticularly if the nominee appeared highly qualified this consideration it could be argued might be reason for senator not to oppose the nominee 127 for analysis of

likely produce an even more qualified nominee senator also might not wish to oppose particular nomination if it might project to the public picture of the senator as obstructionist or unduly antagonistic in relation to the administration particularly under certain circumstances opposing presidents judicial nomination might be seen as unduly negative for instance if the senators objections to the nominee are purely procedural in nature in essence that the administration afforded the senator little or opportunity to provide input prior to the candidat being nominated the senator might see the merits of opposing the nominee on these grounds as outweighed if the senator finds fault with the nominee and if the public is also likely to look favorably or sympathetically upon the nominee sometimes consideration not to oppose home state judicial nomination might be the likelihood of more judicial vacancies arising in the senators state in the near future senator might see these future vacancies as providing better opportunity for exerting senatorial influence over judicial appointments than is possible by opposing someone whom the president has already nominated further by not opposing particular home state nomination the senator might be in position to gain goodwill with the administration from which the latter might well be moved to afford the senator more enhanced role in the selection process for future home state judicial nominees final consideration for not actively opposing j udicial nominee is that this option would not necessarily preclude the senator from expressing criticisms of the current nominee or of the process used in his or her selection while refraining from opposing the nominee the senator would be free to call on the administration to do better with its next judicial nomination from the senators state the senator also could suggest ways of improving the consultative process between the senator and the administration in the search for future lower court nominees as well as the kind of qualities that the senator deemed important for the future nominees to possess this approach it could be argued would put the administration on notice that public criticism of and possible opposition to the next judicial nominee from that state could be expected if more attention were not paid in the future to the senators views during the nominee selection process g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g5g152g151g140g149g158g141g146g151g144g561g17g139g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g156g561

home state senators have long played an important role in providing advice to presidents on judicial appointments historically presidents have generally been more receptive to such advice when it has come from senators of their own party rather than of the opposition party nevertheless presidential administrations have long recognized that prenomination consultation with opposition party home state senators also is important serving at the very least as means to learn senators views about potential nominees and whether they would be likely to return positive blue slips to the judiciary committee if certain candidates were nominated in recent decades despite periodic controversies over judicial nominations the idea that there should be consultation on judicial appointments between an administration and home state senators regardless of their party appears to have gained widespread acceptance as discussed

g21g142g151g138g157g152g155g156g561 during the nations two most recent presidenci however senators usually of the opposition party have sometimes questioned the adequacy of administration consultation with home state senators in the lower court selection process in 1997 for instance during the presidency of william j clinton senator orrin g hatch rut thenchairman of the judiciary committee drew attention to questions that he said had been raised about the clinton administrations level of consultation with home state senators on lower court appointments while we are on the subject of judicial nominations i would like to respond to some of my colleagues who have come to to express thei r frustration that they have not received the level of consultation that they have expected and typically received regarding nominees from their states it has long been the policy of the senate and of the committee that fair efficient and cooperative confirmation process is best achieved when the executive branch engages in genuine good faith consultation with home state senators in the process of determining whom to nominate for judicial positions 132 several years later senator hatch who had been chairman of the judiciary committee during the last six years of the clinton administration explai ned what had happened to some of the judges nominated by president clinton who were not confirmed seventeen of those senator hatch said lacked home state support which often resulted from the white houses failure to consult with home state senators there was way to confirm those nominations without completely ignoring the senatorial courtesy we afford to home state senators in the nomination process133 130 see more detailed discussion of these letters in above report section

along party lines have periodically debated whether the administration has adequately consulted with home state senators before president bush selected his nominees democratic leaders in the senate have asserted that the bush administration frequently has not consulted with or heeded the advice of their partys home state senators before the president made judicial nominations as result of not receiving senatorial input or receiving but not heeding it the president they maintained has made unwise controversial nominations provoking democratic opposition in the senate134 senate republicans by contrast have defended the bush administration portraying it as having regularly consulted with senators regarding judicial nominations in their states while faulting opposition party senators for seeking through the co nsultative process the power to select whom the president nominates rather than solely making recommendations or expressing opinions about candidates under presidential consideration 135 during two congresses coinciding with the bush presidency the 108th and the 109th congresses the presidents party the republicans had majority control of the senate during the 108th congress the blue slip policy of the senate judiciary committee then in effect did not prevent committee consideration of or action on five circuit court nominations that were ultimately reported to the senate in spite of opposition by democratic home state senators136 in the senate however in the face of significant opposition from democratic members none of the five nominees received final confirmation votes 137 although three were subsequently confirmed 134 in this vein the ranking democratic member on the senate judiciary committee at june 17 2004 executive business meeting of the committee noted that controversial nominee to the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit about to be voted on by the committee was opposed by michigans two democratic senators who each returned

not consult with them if consultation means the administration has to take whatever judges the democrats desi re that is not consultation consultation is letting them know what is on the mind of the

court nominees to change the chambers rules or precedents to require the vote of only simple senate majority to end senate debate on judicial nominations142 senate confrontation over judicial filibusters was averted on may 23 2005 when an agreement was reached by coalition of seven democratic and seven republican senators as part of the agreement the senators in the coalition pledged not to lend their support to filibusters against judicial nominations except under extraordinary circumstances and not to support any change in the senate rules to bar filibusters against judicial nominations as long as the spirit and continuing commitments made in this agreement were kept by all of the senators in the coalition 143 as result of this agreement some but not all of the presidents

various judiciary committee policy statements discussed earlier have prescribed specific consultative steps between an administration and home state senators as requisite elements in consultation conducted seriously and in good faith the statements however did not address how seriously the administration should consider the senators judicial candidate recommendations or their objections to other candidates under administration consideration in various controversies over particular judicial nominations during the bush presidency democratic home state senators asserted that the bush administration did not engage in good faith serious consultation with them during the judicial nominee selection process an assertion denied by the administration the administration view in these controversies appeared to be that it engaged in good faith serious consultation with home state senator on judicial nominations if it considered the input of senator even if it ultimately made decision in the selection of judicial nominee contrary to the senators express wishes on the other side by contrast the view of opposition party senators appeared to be that good faith serious consultation was shown not to have occurred when the president selected judicial nominee over their strong objections or with evident disinterest in candidates that they might have proposed

over the years the bush administrations stated practice has been one of welcoming home state senators views about who should or should not be nominated to fill federal court judgeships in their states153 the administration however appears not always to have informed home state senators prior to announcing the selection of nominee of all candidates under consideration or of the candidate finally chosen to be the nominee for example in at least one such instance circuit court nominee allegedly was selected without prior consultation with the home state senators spokesperson for one of the senators criticized the president for acting in an uncooperative unilateral manner which he said broke sharply from the cooperative process in which previous nominees were chosen 154 153 see for

discussed have been much more accepting of judicial recommendations from senators of their own party than from senators of the opposition party when neither of states senators are of the presidents party the recommending role has traditionally been filled by another state official of the same party as the president such as the governor or the most senior us representative of the presidents party from the state if only one of the states senators is of the presidents party the role of providing recommendations traditionally has belonged to that senator alone to the exclusion of any significant consultative role for the opposition party senator like many of his white house predecessors however president george w bush has selected some lower court nominees from among candidates recommended by opposition party senators in these situations the administration might make special accommodations with opposition party senators for reasons unique to the state in stionfor example to be in keeping with an established practice in the state for its two senators regardless of their party to make recommendations to the president to minimize potential conflict with particular senators whose support for or opposition to the presidents judicial nominations might be regarded as of strategic importance for confirmation purposes or to minimize the chances of opposition party senators using the senate judiciary committees blue slip procedure to block home state nominations in committee in the 110 th congress with the democrats in the senate majority and thus able if voting along party lines to defeat judicial nominee in committee or on the senate floor an issue for the administration is whether to accord primary recommending role to opposition party senators in additional states many opposition party senators presumably would welcome such role nonetheless there would appear to be powerful political and policy incentives for president not to confer this role on opposition party senators in general in states without senator of the presidents party other officials of the presidents party based on tradition can claim role in the judicial selection process and they might well be offended if required to share this role with or relinquish it to opposition party senators further the president presumably would wish as much as possible to draw upon judicial nominee recommendations from persons who are sympathetic to his philosophical views about the judiciary this concern would be an incentive for him to rely as much as possible on input from officials of his own party rather than on opposition party senators

because they come from the senators of the opposition party are ordinarily not at the top of the list among ca ndidates under administration consideration the rare exceptions to this where recommendations by an opposition party senator are major consideration in the selection of circuit court nominees have usually occurred when the recommendations were made jointly with senator of the presidents party or in accord with the recommendations of bipartisan judicial nominee selection panel established in the senators state throughout the presidency of george w bush administration sources have indicated an openness to receiving circuit nominee recommendations from home state senators without however being under any obligation to follow the advice given president bushs disinclination to cede selection power to home state senators of his party in the area of circuit court appointments seemed to be borne out by various news media accounts in 2007 which reported on public disagreements between the bush administration and number of republican senators over whom to nominate to fill certain circuit judgeships washington post story reporting on these disagreements quoted one conservative who is close to the nominating process and who would speak only on the condition of anonymity as saying there has been longstanding practice in republican administrations that courts of appeals nominees are the presidents prerogative period 156 controversy also has arisen periodically throughout the bush presidency over how much influence home state senators of the opposition party should have on the presidents selection of circuit court nominees the controversies usually have occurred when president bush selected nominees who were objectionable to the senators doing so apparently uninfluenced by the senators preselection input aimed at dissuading him from making these choices rather than working with the home state senators to sele ct nominees who would be acceptable to both sides the president his senate critics have alleged selected nominees without regard to the senators nominee preferences or concerns the bush administration as of early march 2008 s not publicly stated as matter of general policy what it regards as the proper degree of influence for opposition party home state senators to have on the selection of circuit court nominees or to what degree the president should accommodate opposition party senators in these selections however if it chose to do so the administration arguably could defend decisions by the president to make circuit nominee selections against the advice of opposition party senators on at least these two grounds first it could be argued if the president typically does not give primary consideration to the circuit court recommendations from home state senators of his own party why should he do so for home state senators of the other party second it arguably is appropriate given the importance of the rulings of the circuit courts in setting precedents that are binding on all the district courts within their circuits that president be concerned with selecting circuit court nominees who have 156 the article

presidents standpoint opposition party senators who have frequently been in public conflict with his administration over the criteria to use in selecting judicial nominees cannot realistically be regarded as providing the most suitable circuit candidate recommendations for the president to consider in the 110th congress however new consideration for the president has come into play one favoring more important role for opposition party senators in the circuit nominee selection process than they traditionally have been afforded this consideration is that circuit or district court nomination has reduced chance of being confirmed by the senate during the 110 th congress if it is opposed by home state senator which was not necessarily the case in previous congresses after being the minority in the senate during the 108th and 109th congresses the democrats in the 110th congress now have majority control of the senate and its judiciary committee as already discussed under the blue slip policy of the judiciary committee now in effect circuit or district court nomination in state will not be considered by the committee if both of the states two senators have not returned positive blue slips for the bush administration the consequences of this policy appear to be as follows if the president selects circuit or district court nominee over the objections of home state senator of the opposition party or in spite of the senators recommendations that someone else be nominated the senator by declining to return positive blue slip can block the nomination in the judiciary committee where an opposition party senator is able and inclined to block home state judicial nomination unless the president selects nominee acceptable to the senator the administration may have to make some accommodation with the senatorif it hopes to see the nomination confirmed the accommodation would consist in some way of affording the senator greater more influential role in the nominee selection process than typically has been afforded opposition party senators in the past

in recent decades the blue slip policy of the senate judiciary committee as already discussed has often varied depending on the committee chair the blue slip policy of the judiciary committee under its current chair is that judicial nomination will not receive hearing unless both home state senators return favorable blue slip to the committee157 several home state senators in the 110th congress have indicated their displeasure with the administration for not having consulted with them more actively in cooperative effort to select circuit court nominees from their states 158 decisions by any of these senators not to return positive blue slips for judicial nominees from their states it has been noted would prevent judiciary committee consideration 157 at the start of the 110th congress an aide to sen patrick j leahy chairman of the judiciary committee said that sen leahy would abide by the same blue slip policy as he had when he previously had been chairman during the107th congress under this policy it was explained both senators from state regardless of party affiliation would have to return positive blue slip on judicial nomination before it could be considered by the

administration has described its judicial nominees as people who are qualified to serve and should be on our courts160 calling for action on all of the nominations already sent forward with fair and open hearings and swift votes by the full senate161 throughout the bush presidency the judiciary committees blue slip policy has often been at the center of senate debate over judicial nominations in this debate senators have differed in their view of exactly how the policy has been applie d in the past and how much control over lower court nominations the policy should confer on home state senators the latter issue of whether the judiciary committee should consider district or circuit court nomination if home state senator has not returned favorable blue slip is of continuing relevance in the 110 th congress the administration position as indicated by the above quote calling for swift votes by the senate on all pending nominations is that the judiciary committee should consider each nomination regardless of whether blue slip has been returned rationale for this position was laid out in an april 2003 letter by thenwhite h ouse counsel alberto gonzales in letter to two democratic senators he explained why in his view the committee should not allow home state senator to block committee consideration of judicial nominee we agree strongly with the bipartisan policy maintained by senators kennedy thurmond biden and hatch as chairs of the judiciary committee we respectfully agree that the tradition of consultation does not and should not entail veto for homestate senators particularly veto wielded for ideological or political purposes rather the intention of the constitution and the tradition of the senate require in our judgement that the full senate hold an up or down vote on each judicial nominee if the objections of homestate senators to nominee are persuasive those objections either will deter the president from submitting the nomination in the first instance or alternatively will convince majority of the senate that the nomination should be rejected as senator kennedy stated in 1981 however the senate has not allowed and should not allow individual senators to ban prohibit or bar consideration of nominee 162 the current chair of the judiciary committee senator patrick j leahy dvt however has asserted throughout the presidency of george w bush that the committeein keeping with the blue slip policy in effect during the period of the clinton presidency when republicans were in the senate majorityshould not act on lower court nomination unless it has received positive blue slips from both home state senators in support of this position senator leahy in the first months of the bush administration stated as the committees ranking democratic member that it had been longstanding practice of the committee for it to solicit and be guided by the views of home state senators and for it not to proceed with action on nominee without the return by both home state senators of their blue slips such policy he said had the effect of encouraging the white house to consult with home state senators in advance 163 in similar 159 ibid for example commenting that president bushs reluctance to consult with democrats makes it likely that few if any nominees from state represented by democratic senator are going to receive

nomination registered by failing to return positive blue slip would doom the nominations chances for committee consideration and hence also for senate consideration and confirmation given that policy the onus is on the administration if it hopes to see its nominee confirmed not only to consult with the home st ate senator but also through process of consultation to select nominee who is acceptable to both the administration and the home state senator if the white house and home state senator cannot agree the president would appear to have at least four optionsto nominate someone objectionable to the home state senator and who thus would have reduced chance of being confirmed to decline to nominate someone at all leaving the appointment in question to be made in the next congress by the next president to make temporary recess appointment which would not require confirmation by the senate or to reenter consultations with the senator i n the hope of finding nominee acceptable to both sides reaching agreement on the choice of nominee recent experience suggests might not always be possible it especially might be difficult when presidential administration and home state senator differ over the criteria to use in selecting judicial nominees or over the policy goals to be served by judicial appointments or when there are sharp partisan differences between the president and the opposition party in the senate over judicial appointments in such circumstances however the consultative process might sometimes present an opportunity for the administration and home state senator to resolve their differences the process for instance might be an opportunity for the administration to address and seek to ease concerns home state senator might have about judicial candidate alternately during consultation with the administration the senators input might in particular circumstances increase the chances for the selection of compromise nominee or one less objectionable to the senator than candidate under earlier consideration by the administration as noted earlier various policy statements by chairs of the senate judiciary committee have listed various specific consultative steps which at the time the chairs regarded as requisite elements in consultation between an administration and home state senators concerning the selection of lower court nominees although not binding on the administration then or now such statements can be seen as helping to identify points during the consultative process when senators continued available from author 164

before nominee is actually selected for any given senator the actual consultative process that takes place between the senator or his or her staff and the administration will be unique to the situation at hand for the particular judicial candidate search in question there will be such unique elements as the extent and nature of input that the senator conveys whether he or she recommends specific candidates and if so the comparative strengths of the senators candidates visàvis others the administration might be considering the predisposition of the administration to the senators input and host other political factors that the administration might have to take into account including its own policy preferences for judicial nominees president experience has shown sometimes nominates judicial candidate other than one favored by home state senator often by custom doing so when the home state senator is of the opposition party whether the president when making such choice has shown due respect for the advisory part of the senators advice and consent role will be personal question for the senator to answerbut one also of likely interest to other senators concerned about the nature of their advice and consent prerogatives as home state senators of key relevance to the question will be the extent to which the administration cons ulted with the senator or the senators staff
