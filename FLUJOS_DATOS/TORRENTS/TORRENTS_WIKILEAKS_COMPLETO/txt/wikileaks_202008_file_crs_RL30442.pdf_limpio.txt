homelessness and how best to assist those who find themselves homeless became particularly prominent visible issue in the 1980s the concept of homelessness may seem like straightforward one with individuals and famili having place to live falling within the definition however the extent of homelessness in this country and how best to address it depend upon how one defines the condition of being homeles s there is single federal definition of homelessness although number of programs in cluding those overseen by the department of veterans affairs v the department of home land security dhs and the department of labor dol use the department of housing and urban development hud definition that definition is one who lacks fixed nighttime residence and whose primary nighttime residence is supervised public or private shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations facility accommodating persons intended to be institutionalized or place not intended to be used as regular sleeping accommodation for human beings number of federal programs in seven different agencies many authorized by the mckinney vento homeless assistance act pl 10077 serve homeless persons these include the education for homeless children and youths pr ogram administered by the department of education ed and the emergency food and shelter program federal emergency management agency fema program run by the department of homeland security the department of health and human services hhs administers number of programs that serve homeless individuals these include health care for the homeless projects for assistance in transition from homelessness and the runaway and homeless youth program hud administers the homeless assistance grants made up of four separate programs that

homeless youth act pl 110 378 higher education opportunity act pl 110315 housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 the college cost reduction and access act pl 11084 and the veterans mental health and other care improvements act pl 110387 legislative activity in the 111 th congress relating to homelessness can also be expected legislation may include attempts to reauthorize the mckinneyvento homeless assistance grants in the 110th congress both the full house and the senate banking committee approved legislation that would have reauthorized the grant programs and made changes to the way in which the grants are administered attention may also turn to homelessness due to the recent downturn in the economy reports from service providers in many parts of the country indicate that the number of individuals seeking assistance may be increasing this report will be updated as warranted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30442g10g152g150g142g149g142g156

youth program was enacted in 1974 as part of the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act pl 93415 the first federal program focused on assisting all homeless people matter their age was the emergency food and shelter efs program established in march 1983 through an emergency jobs appropriation bill pl 988 the efs program was and continues to be administered by the federal emergency management agency fema in the departme nt of homeland security dhs to provide emergency food and shelter to needy individuals in 1987 congress enacted the stewart b mckinney homeless assistance act pl 10077 which created number of new programs to comprehensively address the needs of homeless people including food shelter health care and education the act was later renamed the mckinneyvento homeless

definition of the term homeless individual for purposes of those programs that were authorized through the law see section 103 of mckinneyvento the definition of homeless individual in mckinneyvento is used today to determine eligibility for the hud homeless assistance grants femas emergency food and shelter program the v homeless veterans programs and the dols homeless veterans reintegration program1 section 103 of mckinneyvento defines homeless individual as an individual who lacks fixed regular and adequate nighttime residence and person who has nighttime residence that is supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations including welfare hotels congregate shelters and transitional housing for the mentally ill b an institution that provides temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized or c public or private place not designed for nor ordinarily used as regular sleeping accommodation for human beings 2 the definition is sometimes described as requiring one to be literally homeless in order to meet its requirements3 either living in emergency accommodations or having place to stay this contrasts with definitions used in some other federal programs where person may currently have place to live but is still considered to be homeless because the accommodation is precarious or temporary among the federal programs that have adopted definition of homelessness that differs from the definition in section 103 of mckinneyvento is the department of education ed education for homeless children and youth program the ed pr ogram defines homeless children and youths in part by reference to the section 103 definition of homeless individuals those living in places not meant for human habitation 4 in addition however the education for homeless children and youth program defines children and youth who are eligible for services to include those who are 1 sharing housing with other persons due to ss of housing or economic hardship 2 those living in hotels or motels trailer parks or campgrounds due to lack of alternative arrangements 3 those awaiting foster care placement and 4 children of migrant workers5 the department of health and human services hhs runaway and homeless youth program also has its own definition of homelessness however unlike the education for homeless children and youth program the runaway and homeless youth program definition does not refer to the mckinneyvento act section 103 definition instead the statute defines homeless youth as either age 16 to 21 for transitional housing or age 18 and younger for shortterm shelter and for whom it is not possible to live in safe environment with relative or for whom there is other safe alternative living arrangement 6 1 the definition of homeless veteran is veteran who is homeless as defined by mckinneyvento 38 usc 20021 this definition applies to va programs for homeless veterans as well as the homeless veterans reintegration program 2 42 usc 11302a 3 see for example the department of housing and urban development the third annual homeless assessment report to congress july 2008 p 2 footnote

program and projects for assistance in transition from homelessness pa th both administered by hhs under the health care for the homeless program homeless individual is one who lacks housing and includes those living in private or publicly operated temporary living facility or in transitional housing7 in the pa th program an eligible homeless individual is described as one suffering from serious mental illness which may also be accompanied by substance abuse disorder and who is homeless or at imminent risk of becoming homeless the statute does not further define what constitutes being homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness however the way in which homeless individual is defined was the subject of legislation to reauthorize the mckinneyvento homeless assistance grants in the 110 th congress three bills hr 840 the homeless emergency assistance and rapid transition to housing hearth act hr 7221 also called the hearth act and s 1518 the community partnership to end homelessness act would have expanded the curren t definition of homeless individual in section 103 of mckinneyvento to encompass some people who are in precarious housing situations but are not yet literally homeless this legislation is discussed in greater detail in the section of this report entitled reauthorization of the mckinneyvento homeless assistance grants

it did not come to the publics attention as national issue until the 1970s and 1980s when the characteristics of the homeless population and their living arrangements began to change throughout the early and middle part of the 20 th century homelessness was typified by skid rows areas with hotels and singleroom occupancy dwellings where transient single men lived8 skid rows were usually removed from the more populated areas of cities and it was uncommon for individuals to actually live on the streets9 beginning in the 1970s however the homeless population began to grow and become more visible to the general public according to studies from the time homeless persons were longer almost exclusively single men but incl uded women with children their median age was younger they were more racially diverse in previous decades the observed homeless population was largely white they were less likely to be employed and therefore had lower incomes they were mentally ill in higher proportions than pr eviously and individuals who were abusing or had abused drugs began to become more prevalent in the population 10 number of reasons have been offered for the growth in the number

national bureau of economic research declared that the economy had been in recession since december of 200749 prior to the announcement effects of an economic downturn already could be seen in the employment sector where the unemployment rate had increased in nearly every month of 2008 in december of 2007 the unemployment rate was 49 by december of 2008 it had risen to 72 50 the housing sector also faced difficulty throughout the course of 2008 the foreclosure rate for all loans rose from 128 in the first quarter of 2007 to 297 in the third quarter of 200851 foreclosure rates may continue to rise throughout 2009 due to additional interest rate resets that are scheduled to occur52 increased foreclosures and rising unemployment may result in higher rates of homelessness among all groups but particularly among families facing increased financial strain due to the time lag in community counts of homeless individualsthe last count required by hud occurred in january of 2007 with the next count in january of 200953it is not yet known whether the number of people experiencing homelessness has grown since the beginning of the economic downturn or whether any increased levels of homelessness would be related to the economic situation however anecdotal evidence from shelters soup kitchens and other service providers indicates an increased demand for services and potentially an increase in the number of individuals who are homeless some for the first time 54 school districts are reporting higher numbers of students who qualify for services under the department of educations definition of homelessness55 in addition the 2008 us conference of mayors hunger and homelessness survey reported an average increase in homelessness of 12 among the 25 surveyed cities56 arguably in

estimated to account for about 10 of all users of the homeless shelter system but are estimated to use nearly 50 of the total days of shelter provided 58 the idea of 10year plan to end chronic homelessness began as part of 10year plan to end homelessness in general adopted by the national alliance to end homelessness naeh in 2000 the following year thenhud secretary martinez announced huds commitment to ending chronic homelessness at the naeh annual conference in 2002 as part of his fy2003 budget president bush made ending chronic homelessness in the next decade top objective the bipartisan congressionally mandated millennial housing commission in its report to congress in 2002 included ending chronic homelessness in 10 years among its principal recommendations 59 by 2003 the interagency council on homelessness had been reengaged after six years of inactivity and was charged with pursuing the presidents 10year plan60 as of the date of this report 49 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico the virgin islands and nearly 350 cities and counties have developed tenyear plans to end chronic homelessness 61 permanent supportive housing is generally seen as solution to ending chronic homelessness62 permanent supportive housing consists of lowcost housing paired with social services available to lowincome andor homeless households services can include case management substance abuse counseling mental health services income management and support and life skills services providing permanent supportive housing to homeless adults with mental illnesses or substance abuse disorders is sometimes referred to as the housing first approach housing is found for homeless individuals prior to treatment of their illnesses and addictions in the late 1990s research began to show that finding housin g for homeless individuals with severe mental illnesses meant that they were less likely to be housed temporarily by more expensive public services such as hospitals jails or prisons 63 more recently hud study of three housing first 57 24 cfr 915 58 randall kuhn and dennis culhane applying cluster analysis to test typology of homelessness by pattern of

initiative continuums of care can receive additional funds for permanent supportive housing projects for chronically homeless individuals the initiative to end chronic homelessness has raised some concerns among advocates for homeless people that allocating resources to chronically homeless individuals is done at the expense of families with children who are homeless70 this concern may become more acute if the downturn in the economy puts more lowincome families at risk of homelessness in the fy2008 appropriation for hud congress set aside fu nds for rapid rehousing demonstration process targeted to assist homeless families with dependent children that have one or more moderate barriers to achieving and maintaining pe rmanent housing in addition legislation in the 110th congress

entitled homeless assistance grants the homeless assistance grants have not been authorized since fy1994 though they have continued to be funded through annual appropriations 71 in recent years congress has considered legislation to reauthorize the homeless assistance grants and similar legislation may be introduced in the 111th congress in the 110th congress both the full house and the senate banking committee passed legislation that would have reauthorized the four grants and made significant changes to the way in which they operate 72 the two bills would have consolidated the three comp etitive homeless assistance grants sc shp and sro into one grant program this same c onsolidation proposal was also made in budget requests from president bush in each ye ar from fy2003

would significantly streamline homeless assistance in the united states among other changes the number of applications that hud would be required to review would be reduced from about 6000 to less than 500 and match requirements and eligible activities would be unified under one program73 additional proposed changes to the homeless assistance grants in the 110th congress included renewing permanent housing contracts through the section 8 program rather than through the funds made available for the homeless assistance grants allowing more funds to be used for homelessness prevention activities currently only esg funds may be used for prevention creating separate process for rural comm unities to apply for the competitive homeless assistance grants and giving communities greater say in how to use their funds to address homelessness locally another issue addressed in reauthorization legislation was the definition of homelessness as discussed earlier in the report in the section entitled defining homelessness under the current hud definition homeless individual is one who lacks fixed regular and adequate nighttime residence and who resides in temporary shelter including transitional housing for the mentally ill an institution with qualifications or place not designed for human habitation the two reauthorization bills in the 110 th congress would have broadened the definition in the senate the community partnership to end homelessness act s 1518 would have expanded the definition of homeless individual to include individuals and families who are sharing housing but those doubledup households would also be required to 1 lack the resources to pay for decent and safe housing 2 only be permitted to remain in the shared housing for short period of time 3 have moved three or more times in the past year or at least two times within the last 21 days and 4 not be able to make significant financial contribution toward the shared housing s 1518 also would have included among homeless individuals those persons residing in hotel or motel with the same reservations as those sharing housing however in addition s 1518 would have changed the definition of chronically homeless person to include families with an adult member who has disability currently only unaccompanied individuals are included the definition also would have included persons released from institutions as long as prior to entering the institution they otherwise met the definition of chronically homeless person and had been institutionalized for fewer than 90 days the house bill the homeless emergency assistance and rapid transition to housing hearth act h r 7221 similarly would have changed the definition of chronically homeless under hr 7221 as passed by the house pe rson or family would have been considered homeless if they would imminently lose their housing if they had other place to go and if they lacked resources to obtain other housing imminent loss of housing would have been evidenced by an eviction requiring an individual or family to leave their housing within 14 days lack of resources allowing an individual or family to remain in hotel for more than 14 days or credible evidence that an individual or family w ould not be able to stay with another homeowner or renter for more than 14 days the bill also would have considered homeless anyone who is fleeing situation of domestic violence or other lifethreatening condition in addition hr 7221 would have allowed communities to serve families with children or unaccompanied youth who are defined as homeless by other federal programs under certain circumstances for example the education for homeless children and youth program head start and the runaway and 73 fy2009 hud budget justifications
