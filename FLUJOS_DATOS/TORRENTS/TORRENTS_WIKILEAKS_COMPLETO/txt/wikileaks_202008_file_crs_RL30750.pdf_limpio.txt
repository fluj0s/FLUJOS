certain overthecounter drug products the herbal form known as ma huang in china has been used as remedy for asthma in western cultures ephedrine the active drug product ingredie nt has been used as bronchodilator and decongestant for various respiratory probl ems more recently dietary supplements containing ephedra have been promoted for weight reduction and as performance enhancer in body building and other sports under the provisions of the dietary s upplement health and education act of 1994 the f ood and drug administration fda must show that supplement is unsafe and causes harm before it can be removed from the market in 1997 following several hundred reports of adverse effects allege d to be caused by ephedra use fda proposed rules to restrict the dosage prohibit supplements containing ephedrine to be combined with other know n stimulants and require specific warnings on ephedracontaining supplem ents the proposed rule was criticized for the lack of scientific evidence to support dosage limitations and the labeling requirements which led the agency to withdraw part of the proposal in 2000 however several high profile deaths attribut ed to ephedra led fda to re propose the original regulation in 2003 and publish final rule prohibitin g the sale of ephedra under the safety provisions of dietary supplement health and education act in februa ry 2004 in april 2005 the fda ban was overturned in fe deral district cour t but subsequently upheld in the us court of appeals in august 2006 several congressional hearings have focused on the limitations of fdas current adverse events reporting system which was used by the agency to conclude that dosage restrictions and manda tory labeling were needed and specific cases of death attributable to ephedra government accountability office report examined the scientific basis for fda s 1997 ephedra proposal and c oncluded that the number of adverse event reports relate d to ephedra warranted ag ency

of ephedra follo wing completion of rand corporation report commissioned to review the existing science the rand report indicated that the literature showed that while ephedra can promote modest shortterm weight loss in clinical trials there was insufficient data on longterm benefits for weightloss and body building and combined with ot her stimulants it was associated with increased health

pharmaceutically ac tive compound found in both natural form in herbal ephedra and the synthetic ingr edient present in certain overthecounter otc drug products1 dietary supplements containi ng ephedra and their regulatory status have been of ongoing concern to congress the supplement industry and consumers this report will attempt to clarify the current regulatory status of dietary supplement products containing ephedra ephedra is botanical w hose herbal properties have been known for centuries by the name of ma huang in china where it was first used as remedy for the treatment of bronchial asth ma although some 40 species are known worldwide its herbal and pharmaceutical effects are attributable to the contents of ephedrine and related alkaloids found primarily in the species of chinese origin historically practitioners of traditional medicine in china have been trained in the art and skills of compounding small amounts of variet of botanical ingredients including ephedra to treat specific conditions ma huang has generally been consumed in the form of an invigorating tea or infusion with beneficial ffects on respiration in western cultures ephedrine has been used for years in various drug products ephedrine is mainly used as an ingred ient in bronchodilator nd decongestants for treating asthma and hayfever and to combat circulatory collapse in reaction to anesthesia poisoning shock and allergic reactions most recently ephedra in pill form has been promoted for weight reduc tion and as performance enhancer in body building and other sports the pharmaceutical effects of ephedra are due to the ephedrine alkaloids but the herbal product may not have the same phy siological effect as the pure compound which can be produced synthetically the ephedra herb has been used for similar medical purposes alt hough dietary s upplement advocates claim that its action is more gentle and less likely to cause adverse effects however report that investigated the pharmacokinetics of ephedrine from three commercially available herbal ma huang products compared to 25 milligrams mg ephe drine hydrochloride capsules showed that the products had similar effect2 the authors reported thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30750crs2 3 barnes j et different standards for reporting adrs to herbal remedies and conventional otc medicines facetoface inte

chapter 10 asthma by d m williams and t h self p 229230recent increases in ma huang toxicity were not due to the differences in the absorption rates of botanical ephedrine compared with synthetic ephedrine but instead resulted from accidental overdose often promoted by offlabel claims and belief that natural medicinal agents are inherently safe the dietary supplement health and ducation act of 1994 dshea exempted dietary supplements from the type of prem arket approval process that drugs medical devices and food additives must undergo befo re they are allowed to be sold for medical devices and food additives manufact urers must demonstrate to the food and drug administrations fda satisfaction th at the products are safe through adequate scientific testing prior to marketing in the case of prescription and otc drugs manufacturers must prove thr ough adequate and wellcont rolled investigations that their products are safe and effective befo re they can be approved for marketing however congress effectiv ely shifted the burden of proof under dshea from the manufacturer to the agency to show that dietary supplement is unsafe standard significantly more difficult to meet moreover the agency must demonstrate that the dietary supplement causes harm before it can be removed from the marketplace in the case of herbal supplements fda s only voluntary reports from consumers to rely on along with generally limited scientific evidence very often ephedra is one of several supplements consumers are using thus complicating determination of the actual cause of an adverse reaction because the law does not require that these products undergo premarket testing and ev aluation there is reliable baseline information on the possible side effects that can be used to anticipate or compare adverse events another confounding factor is research evid ence that supplement users are less likely than other consumer s to report adverse effects from product they use3 in contrast when ephedrine is used in prescription or otc products it is regulated as drug by fdas center fo r drug evaluation and research cder ephedrine is used for treating mild forms of asthma and is also approved by the agency for treating such conditions as hypotension nasal congestion and sinusitis fda considers nonprescription ephedrine to be safe and effective as bronchodilator preferably when us ed under doctors care the dosage recommendations in adults and children over 12 years are 125 25 mg every 4 hours not to exceed 150 mg per day4 according to the industry handbook the principal adverse effects can include central ner vous system cns stimulation sleeplessness nausea loss of appetite tremors tachycardia and urinary retention5 the handbook further indicates there are reports

several hundred re ports of adverse effects including number of deaths attr ibuted to the supplements use it convened on october 1112 1995 an ephedra working group which included members of the fda

believed that there were cer tain levels that were safe for use of ephedra subsequently fda proposed rule for ephedra that addressed issues concerning its dosing labe ling and warning statements7 the agency proposed that in supplement form single dose shoul d not exceed eight milligrams and products should bear required labeling to indicate th at more than 24 mg should be taken in given day also labeling information was to indicate that the product should not be used for longer than seven days and required warning statement that the product was not for longterm use such as for body building andor weight loss the agency also proposed to prohibit the use of ephedr in dietary supplements in combination with ingredients that have known stimula nt effect such as caffeine which might cause an interaction in addition fda proposed that statement accompany any claims that encourage shortterm excessive intake to enhance purported effect such as increased energy stating that consuming more than

reporting aers system which had been the source of the agencys justification for proposing the regulatory changes also came under scru tiny the aers data were criticized for being insufficient to determine whether the adverse events reported were actually caused by ephedra use as result of the continued criticism of the agencys use of the aers as the basis for its rulemaking fda announced in april 2000 that it was withdrawing certain provisions of the proposed rule on ephedra8 the provisions that were withdrawn included the dietary ingredient limit for ephedra on per serving basis proposed compliance procedures for use of the high performance liquid chromotography method for sample analysis limitations on the duration of the products use and the prohibition on cla ims for longterm use such as for bodybuilding and weight loss the agency re tained the sections of the proposed rule that would prohibit use of ingredients w ith stimulant effects in combination with

accompanied by recommendation that use be discontinued if they expe rience certain signs or symptoms continued adverse events reporting on march 31 2000 fda released 140 additional recent cases of

congressional review act in the meantime fda released consumer alert that announced its plan to prohibit sales of phedracontaining diet ary supplements and urged consumers to stop using these products the agency also sent certified letters to over 60 manufacturers who had been pr oducing supplements containing ephedra to provide the companies with advance tice of the final rule to be published to

further scientific testing in us district court for the distri ct of new jersey the arguments were heard on april 12 2004 and rejected from the bench on the same day because the case put forth by the plaintiffs did not meet certain legal standards the judge would not immediately stay the rule and ordered the plaintiffs to submit additional briefs so that the court could reach decision on whether to stay the ban permanently in its announcement of its plans to pr ohibit the sale of ephedracontaining supplements fda indicated that it had reached this decision after conducting an exhaustive and

ruling was in favor of utah supplement company that had challenged th agencys ban claiming that ephedra has been consumed safely for hundreds of years and that the agency had not proven that supplements containing ephedra were rmful the decision prevented fda from stopping the manufacturer from selling its pr oduct containing ephe dra and sent the case back to the agency to determine both safe and dangerous vels of ephedrine ephedras active ingredient hhs official s and department of justice department lawyers took some time to examine the rulin g to determine the next step some anti ephedra advocates viewed the ruling as falling short of an outright reversal of the ban and interpreted the lang uage in the order as only pplying to specific lower dosage 10 milligrams segment of the market the supplement manufacturers attorney declared that the courts ruling has lifted the fda ban on august 17 2006 the us court of ppeals for the tenth circuit in denver upheld the fdas final rule declaring all dietary supplements c ontaining ephedrine alkaloids adulterated and therefore illegal for marketing in the united states14 this decision reverses the 2005 decision in utah the appeals courts ruling demonstrated the soundness of the agency s decision to ban dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloid s consistent with dshea it also found that congress required fda to conduct riskbenefit an alysis under the provisions of the act counsel for the supplement company that had originally challenged the fda ban plans to ask for rehearing of the case by the full court since the

on its website without being subjected to vettin g process to determine the likely cause of the adverse reaction according to fda offi cials this process was used to expedite release of adverse cases to interested parties in lieu of freedom of information procedures which usually take up to year to respond to specific requests thus the cases were reported as they were receive d due to the agencys limited resources to review the cases before they were re leased committee members acknowledged that the resources needed to improve the adverse events reporting system were limited the house committee on science requested that the general accounting office gao examine the scientific basis fo r fdas ephedra supplement proposal and determine whether the agency adhered to the regulatory flexibility analysis requirements for federal ru lemaking on august 4 1999 gao released report in which it raised concerns about the process by which fda had compiled the 800 reports on the harmful effects of ephedra16 the report indicated that the agency was justified in its determination that the number of adverse events relating to supplements containing ephe dra warranted agency atte ntion and consideration of steps to address safety concerns ho wever gao expressed concern about the manner in which fda used the adverse events reports in supporting the proposed dosing levels and duration of use limits and concluded that the agency needed additional evidence to support these restri ctions the report indicated that while ephedra might be harmful the agency lacked adequate data to set dosage levels gao concluded that fdas ec onomic analysis contained the basic elements of federal agencys costbenefit analysis however the agency analysis was not sufficiently transparent about how it reached its estimate of the co sts and benefits of the proposed actions the gao report led to fdas decision to withdraw portions of the proposed rule in 2000 in the fy2001 hhs appropriations report

estimate the level of risk that use of these supplemen ts poses to consumers the researchers reviewed 140 reports of adverse events re lated to ephedracontaining supplements submitted to fda between june 1 1997 nd march 31 1999 the results indicated that 31 of cases were considered to be definitely or probably related to the use of ephedracontaining supplements and 31 were deemed to be possibly related among the adverse events 47 involved cardiovascular symptoms hypertension palpitations tachycardia and stroke and 18 involved the central nervous system seizures ten events resulted in d eaths

requested that the agency revoke the parts of the 1997 pr oposed ephedra rule that still stood and implement an industry standard for the beling and marketing of dietary supplements containing ephedra the industry standard for labeling and marketing of supplements containing ephedra outlined in the petition was essentially the same as the provisions outlined above in this repor t of the industrys voluntary program that had been in place for more than eight years the indus try indicated in the petition that virtually all major manufacturers and distributors of ephedra pr oducts represented by the trade associations filing the petition ve already adopted the voluntary program guidelines in december 2000 the council for respons ible nutrition announced the results of the cantox health sciences interna tional report that it had funded to review recent clinical trials on the safe use of ephedra30 cantox analyzed in detail 19 clinical trials aers from fda case reports and published articles including data from human and animal studies the report i ndicated that ephedra is safe to use at total daily dose of 90 mg divided into smaller doses of up to 30 mg each which would cause observed adverse effects in addition 150 mg total daily dosage was determined to be the lowest level at which moderate adverse effects were first observed observations the hhsfda determination that ephedra was risk to public health under the standard for safety in dshea represented the first time that the 1994 statute has been used to prohibit the sale of dietary suppl ement the process which started in 1997 was both time consuming and labor intensive for the department to establish that it had met the standard of si gnificant and unreasonable ris k the fdas final decision appeared to have been based on the coll ective information available ephedras pharmacology clinical studies of its safe ty and effectiveness hundreds of adverse event reports including 150 deaths an ex tensive review of th published literature and report of an independent scientific institute since the department decided to appeal the recent legal challenge to the ephedra ban and prevailed the ephedra case could serve as model for the review pr ocess and procedures for supplement that raises public health concern in the future the current voluntary adverse reporting sy stem continues to be controversial due to its limitations in providing the information needed to determine causality between the use of supplemen ts containing ephedra and suspected health problems these limitations also make it difficult for fda in its rulemaking to address safetyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30750crs18 31 barnes j et different standards for reporting adrs to herbal remedies and conventional otc medicines facetoface

supplement ingredient that seems to present public health concern the aer reports are generally incomplete and difficult to use in establishing whether ephedra was the cause of particular adverse event in given individual furthermore according to barnes et al31 the number of adverse reports received into the system may represent an underreporting of the actual number of adverse events occurring future research on the use of ephedra for weight reduction may shed some light on its efficacy as well as on any adverse events that may occur in more controlled research environment and holds out the possibility of evidence of benefits outweighing the risks to the ex tent that it might be regulated and used as drug congress has continued to revi ew the problems with the voluntary aers system for supplements through oversight hearings and reports in 2006 it introduced and enacted legislation that w ould require mandatory reporting of dietary supplement aers see crs report rs22480 for further information nevertheless the number of adverse event reports relating to supplements containing ephedra seems to indicate that there is problem with its use in at least select group of consumers who experience severe adverse reac tions including life threatening events following use of the s upplements given the current dearth of controlled clinical trials it is impossible to ascertain which consumers many of whom seem to have known health probl ems might be adversely affected by ephedra use it seems plausible that termining safe level of ephedra for the general population as whole may never be possible an additional question to be examined concerns the health effects of caffeine in combination with ephedra fdas decision to prohibit the sale of s upplements containing ephedra signaled final agency determination that there was safe level to date new information has been reported that changes that deter mination the industrys claim that ephedra has been used for hundreds of years while technically correct fails to consider the different dosage and uses to which it is be ing put today although the final rule was still subject to the congressional review act after it was publis hed congress did not alter the final rule and by the time of the ban number of members had been advocating that fda ban ea the congressional language encourag ing nihods to conduct research on ephedra was aimed at helpin g to generate the answers to numerous questions on the health effects and the vulnerable popula tions that should avoid use of this supplement however specific funding has been provided for such an initiative congress has indicated that it should be s upported out of existing funds while the funding provided to ods has been increased in recent fiscal year s there are number of areas of research investigation compe ting for the monies that the office receives furthermore the results of any research focused on specific supplement ingredient that is funded by nihods will not be ava ilable for threefive years because of the time involved in initiating such progra m completion of the research and publication of the results in peerreviewed journal nevertheless the recent announcement concerning the expansion of research on the safety of these productshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30750crs19 suggests that the department recognized the need to seek additional information on the health impact from the use of ephedra containing supplements the plans for future research on supplement ingredients were pl aced on hold following fdas decision to ban ephedra given the number of adverse event reports associated with ephedra including the number of deaths and the amount of controversy surrounding the strict requirements that fda had or iginally proposed for diet ary supplements containing ea the final rule to prohibit the sale of ea as dietary supplement was an interesting development the more mode rate voluntary selfregu latory program for the formulation and labeling of ephedracontaining pr oducts that the supplement industry has had in place for some time was not dopted by all manufacturers of ephedracontaining products and was not considered as effective as it might have been bills introduced in the 108th congress would have mandated number of the provisions of both the fda proposed rules nd the selfregulatory program that the supplement industry has endorsed the re gulatory stalemate might have been resolved by the fda decision to prohibit the sale of this supplement ingredient however the recent court challenges may keep the question of regulation open the longterm impact of the ephedra ban and the court ruling may be to raise concern among some lawmakers and others about changes needed to make dshea more effective in addressing regulation of supplements in the future several bills introduced in the 108th and 109th congresses attempted to begin to address concerns beyond the problems with ephedracont aining products alone see crs report rl30887 for further information congre ss has now made ae rs mandatory for dietary supplements with the enactment of s 3546pl109462 fda had indicated it planned to complete rule s on good manufacturing practices gmps by the end of 2006 however to date fina l regulations have been published in addition the agency also is reportedly developing approaches to systematically review the evidence about the safety of individual diet ary supplement ingredients it remains to be seen whether these va rious piecemeal changes w ill improve fdas ability to regulate supplements in the future
