protection agency epa published its final revisions to the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for particulate matter particulates or pm on october 17 2006 epas actions leading up to and following promulgation of the 2006 standard has been the subject of considerable congressional oversight epas implementation of the standard beginning with the designation of those geographical areas not in compliance will likewise be an area of concern and debate among many members of congress states and other stakeholders for some time promulgation of naaqs sets in motion process under which the states and the epa identify areas that exceed the standard nonattainment areas using multiyear air quality monitoring data and other criteria requiring states to take steps to reduce pollutant concentrations in order to achieve it as an initial phase of this process in its august 2008 letters responding to recommendations received from states epa proposed area boundaries typically defined by counties or portions of counties for consideration as nonattainment for the 2006 naaqs epa expects to finalize these nonattainment designations by the end of 2008 with an effective date of april 2009 following formal designation the states have three years to submit state implementation plans sips which identify specific regulations and emission control requirements that would bring an area into compliance the 2006 naaqs strengthened the preexisting 1997 standard for fine particulate matter 25 micrometers or less in diameter pm 25 by lowering the allowable daily concentration of pm 25 in the air the daily standard averaged over 24hour periods is reduced from 65 micrograms per cubic meter µgm3 to 35 µgm3 however the annual pm 25 standard which addresses human health effects from chronic exposures to the pollutants is unchanged from the 1997 standard of 15 µgm 3 the 2006 naaqs did not substantially modify the daily standard for slightly larger but still inhalable particles less than or equal to 10 micrometers pm 10 retaining the 24hour standard but revoked the annual standard for pm 10 the epa is not requiring new nonattainment designations for pm 10 the 2006 tightening of the pm 25 standards is expected to affect areas currently designated nonattainment for the 1997 pm 25 naaqs number of areas would be designated nonattainment for the pm 25 naaqs for the first time in its august 2008 letter to states epa identified 215 counties and portions of counties in 25 states for designation as nonattainment only for the revised 2006 24hour pm 25 standard epas final designations for nonattainment of the 1997 pm 25 naaqs included all or part of 205 counties in 20 states and the district of columbia the majority of which did not meet the annual pm 25 standard overall the total number of co unties or portions of counties throughout the united states that will be designated nonattainment will increase as result of the 2006 naaqs

air quality standards or naaqs for pollutants whose emissions 1 may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare and 2 the presence of which in the ambient air results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources the statute further requires that epa review the latest scientific studies and either reaffirm or modify previously established naaqs every five years the epa has identified and promulgated naaqs for six principal pollutants commonly referred to as criteria pollutants particulate matter pm ozone 3 key measure of smog nitrogen dioxide 2 or inclusively nitrogen oxides1 nox sulfur oxides sox or specifically so 2 carbon monoxide co and lead pb on october 17 2006 the epa published its revisions to the naaqs for particulate matter pm to provide protection against potential health effects associated with short and longterm exposure to particulates including chronic respiratory disease and premature mortality2 the 2006 particulates naaqs primarily tightened the preexisting 1997 standard for fine particulate matter 25 micrometers or less in diameter pm 253 the standard for slightly larger but still inhalable particles less than or equal to 10 micrometers pm 10 established in 19874 was not similarly strengthened establishing naaqs does not directly limit emissions rather it represents the epa administrators formal judgment regarding the leve l of ambient pollution that will protect public health with an adequate margin of safety promulgation of naaqs sets in motion process under which the states and the epa first identify geographic nonattainment areas those areas failing to meet the naaqs based on monitoring and analysis of relevant air quality data states have three years from the date of epa s final

types of naaqs primary standards the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the epa administrator are requisite to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety and secondary standards necessary to protect public welfare broad term that includes damage to crops vegetation property building materials etc 6 the primary naaqs include daily 24hour limit for both pm 25 and pm 10 and an annual limit for pm 25 the previous annual limit for pm 10 was revoked to attain the annual standard the threeyear average of the weighted annual arithmetic mean pm concentration at each monitor within an area must not exceed the maximum limit set by the agency the 24hour standards are concentrationbased percentile form indicating the percentage of the time that monitoring station can exceed the standard for example 98 th percentile 24hour standard indicates that monitoring station can exceed the standard 2 of the days during the year for pm 25 and pm 10 the secondary welfare naaqs are the same as the primary standards as modified and published in the october 17 2006 federal register notice the primary pm 25 and pm 10 standards are as follows pm 25 strengthens the daily 24hour standard which currently allows more than 65 micrograms per cubic meter µgm3 under the 1997 pm 25 naaqs by setting new limit of 35 µgm3 based on the threeyear average of the 98th percentile of 24hour pm 25 concentrations retains the annual standard at 15 µgm3 pm 10 retains the daily 24hour standard at 150 µgm3 set in 1987 but changes from the 99th percentile to more than one exceedance per year on average over three years eliminates the annual maximum concentration 50 µgm3 standard for pm 107 as will be shown in more detail in the following section strengthening the daily standard for pm 25 will have implications for those counties and partial counties 6 the use of public welfare in the caa includes but is not limited to effects on soils water crops vegetation manmade materials animals wildlife weather visibility and climate damage to and deterioration of property and hazards to transportation as well as effects on ec onomic values and on personal comfort and wellbeing whether caused by transformation conversion or combination with other air pollutants 42 usc 7602h 7 based on the findings in the epa pm criteria document and staff paper and the casacs concurrence that the studies reviewed do not provide sufficient evidence regarding longterm exposure to warrant continuation of an annual standard see 71 federal register 2653 section iii rationale

geographical areas not achieving the established naaqs based on monitoring and analysis of relevant air quality data is critical step in naaqs implementation section 107d of the caa 42 usc 7407 establishes the process for designating attainment and nonattainment areas and setting their boundaries but allows the epa administrator some discretion in determining what the final boundaries of the areas will be areas are identified as nonattainment when they violate or contribute to the violation of naaqs

tribes provide initial designation recommendations to epa for consideration in section 107d1a 42 usc 7407 the statute st ates that the governor of each state shall submit list to epa of all areas in the state designating as nonattainment any area that does not meet or that contributes to ambient air quality in nearby area that does not meet an air quality standard emphasis added areas are identified as attainmentunclassified10 when they meet the standard or when the data are insufficient for determining compliance with the naaqs following state and tribal designation submissions the epa administrator has discretion to make modifications including to the area boundaries as required by statute section 107d1bii the agency must notify the states and tribes regarding any modifications allowing them sufficient opportunity to demonstrate why proposed modification is inappropriate but the final determination rests with epa measuring and analyzing air quality to determin where naaqs are not being met is key step in determining an areas designation attainment or nonattainment designations are made primarily on the basis of threeyears of federally referenced monitoring data11 epa

associated issues by robert esworthy and james mccarthy 9 though not required to do so tribes have been encouraged to submit recommendations the area designation requirements under the caa section 107 are specific with respect to states but not to tribes the epa follows the same designation process for tribes per sections 110o and 301d of the caa and pursuant to the 1988 tribal authority rule which specifies that tribes shall be treated as states in selected cases 40 cfr part 49 for information regarding tribes that have participated in the pm 25 designation recommendation process see httpwwwepagov pmdesignations 10 section 107d1aiii of the caa pr ovides that any area that epa cannot designate on the basis of available information as meeting or not meeting the standards should be

relevant factors13 and recommends that states apply these factors in their determinations in conjunction with other technical guidance examples of these factors include population density and degree of urbanization including commercial development growth rates traffic and commuting patterns weather and transport patterns and geographytopography states and tribes may submit additional information on factors they believe are relevant for epa to consider nonattainment areas include those counties where pollutant concentrations exceed the standard as well as those that contribute to exceedance of the standard in adjoining counties entire metropolitan areas tend to be designated nonattainment even if only one county in the area has readings worse than the standard in addition to identifying whether monitored violations are occurring states or tribes boundary recommendations for an area are to also show that violations are not occurring in those portions of the recommended area that have been excluded and that they do not contain emission sources that contribute to the observed violations g18g15 g344g495

consolidated metropolitan statistical areas15 did not generally serve as the presumptive boundary for nonattainment areas under the 2006 pm 25 standards rather than establish presumption for the minimum size of an area in its june 2007 guidance16 epa instructed states and tribes to evaluate each area on casebycase basis epa expected that nonattainment areas for the 2006 24hour pm 25 would include counties with monitors violating the 24hour standard and nearby counties that contribute to that violation epa also recommended that states and tribes consider using common boundaries for areas to be designated as nonattainment for both the annual and 24hour pm 25 standards this information in conjunction with air emission and air quality data as well other relevant factors as recommended in epa s guidance such as population density growth rates traffic and commuting patterns weather and transport patterns and geographytopography were used by states in determining the boundaries for the designated areas as required by statute epa responded to the states with its modifications to the area designation recommendations for the 2006 pm 25 naaqs for the 24hour standard in letters dated august 19 2008 the epa solicited the states comments and additional information for consideration in determining the final designations17 as it did in implementing the 1997 pm 25 naaqs and has done with other naaqs epa used its discretion to expand the size of nonattainment areas added more counties or portions of counties or to combine areas that state listed as separate areas into single larger unit epa also combined nonattainment counties across state lines into the same nonattainment area if the counties are part of the same metropolitan area the counties that epa has identified as nonattainment for the 2006 pm 25 naaqs are indicated in the map in figure 1 on the next page while the identified areas can seem small compared with the approximately 3000 counties in the united states nonattainment counties tend to have larger populations than those in attainment for example nearly 90 million people about 30 of the us population live in the 205 counties designated nonattainment for the current 1997 pm 25 naaqs the map distinguishes those counties not previously designated nonattainment for the pm 25 naaqs and those areas that are being designated for the 2006 pm 25 24hour standard that were previously designated nonattainment for the 1997 pm 25 naaqs the agency identified 57 areas in 26 states comprising 215 counties 169 counties and portions of 46 additional counties for designation as nonattainment for the revised 2006 24hour pm 25 standard see table in appendix for state by state countyarea nonattainment designations the epas designations do not identify counties violating the annual standard as the level is unchanged from the 1997 pm 25 naaqs areas include whole and partial counties and as with the designations for the 1997 pm 25 and

naaqs is critical step in naaqs implementation and historically has been an issue of concern and debate among epa states and tribes various stakeholders and many members of congress the epas 2006 tightening of the pm 25 standards will increase the number of areas typically defined by counties or portions of counties in nonattainment and subsequently potentially result in an encumbrance on states to achieve compliance in august 2008 letters to states epa provided its proposed modifications to nonattainment designation recommendations submitted by states for the 2006 pm 25 naaqs epa intends to finalize the designations for the 2006 pm 25 naaqs by december 18 2008 although this determination could be delayed up to year if the administrator determines that the agency has insufficient information historically there have been disagreements between epa and states and other stakeholders with regard to final naaqs nonattainment designations following the final nonattainment determination state local and tribal governments are to outline detailed control requirements in plans or sips demonstrating how areas designated nonattainment will meet the 2006 pm 25 naaqs although large portion of the nonattainment areas for the 2006 pm 25 naaqs identified by epa in august 2008 overlap with those areas designated nonattainment for 1997 pm 25 naaqs these new designations are based on the 24 hour standard whereas the previous designations were based on the annual standard the implications of this with regard to sips could vary significantly from area to area based on numerous factors states would not be required to submit sips until 2012 and would not have to meet the pm 25 standard until 2014 or april 2019 if qualified for an extension34 the epa is not requiring new nonattainment designations for pm 10 and it does not anticipate any significant incremental cost impacts associated with the change in the pm 10 standard the associated impacts on specific geographical nonattainment areas would be speculative at best because compliance with the 2006 revised particulates naaqs is several years off with regard to the 1997 pm 25 naaqs states with nonattainment areas must be in compliance with the 1997 pm 25 naaqs by april 5 2010 unless they are granted an extension implementation of the 1997 pm 25 naaqs already delayed considerably is
