texas and the third in march 2006 in cow in alabama shortly after the first case us depar tment of agriculture usda and other officials announced measures to improve ex isting safeguards against the introduction and spread of bse previously the majo r safeguards were 1 usda restrictions on imports of ruminants and their products from countries with bse 2 ban on feeding most mammalian proteins to cattle and other ruminants issued by the food and drug administration fda and 3 targeted domestic surveillance program by usdas animal and plant health inspection service aphis the agency responsible for animal health m onitoring and disease control some argued that these safeguards were inadequate as evidenced by findings of bse here and subsequent federal efforts to bolster pr otections most new actions announced by usda on december 30 2003 were under the purview of usdas food safety and inspection service fsis responsible for the safety of most us meat and poultry these actions took eff ect in january 2004 and included 1 holding tested carcasses until bsene gative results are obtained 2 banning nonambulatory downer cattle from human food and 3 banning certain add itional animal parts from human food usda also increased work and spending on national animal identification and tracking system and undertook an enhanced bse surveillance program among other activities on january 26 2004 fda announced planned changes to its safeguards including dditional bovine materi als banned from the human foods and cosmetics it regulates ban on poultry litte r restaurant waste and ruminant blood products from ruminant feed nd stricter oversight of feed manufact uring in lieu of these changes fda on october 6 2005 proposed ban in all types of animal feed of some higherrisk ca ttle parts final

cdc has estimated that foodborne diseases cause approximately 5000 deaths each year in the united states many are caused by such bacteria as campylobacter coli listeria salmonella and yersinia bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease current and proposed safeguards introduction overview bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease is fatal degenerative neurological disease of cattle it is believed to be caused by an abnormal protein called prion it is in the family of related diseases referred to as transmissible spongiform ence phalopathies or tses ts include scrapie in sheep and goats chronic wasting disease cwd in deer and elk and creutzfeldtjakob disease or cjd in humans bse is believed to be spread to cattle in feed but not transmitted directly from one animal to another in herd worldwide bse has been found in more than 187000 animals in approximately two dozen count ries however the major ity of cases approximately 183000 have been in the united kingdom uk where the disease was first detected in 1986 most of the rest occurre d elsewhere in europe although japan and north america have reported multiple cases the total number of annual cases has declined steeply since their peak in 1992 in the uk bse is thought to be transmissible to humans who eat contaminated beef causing variant form of cjd variant or vcjd that was first recognized in 1996 during the bse outbreak in the uk almost 200 people have been diagnosed with vcjd since 1986 most of them in the uk as of midmay 2007 persons had been reported to have contract ed vcjd in the united states1 as of midmay 2007 bse had been reported in 14 cattle in north america one animal found in canada in 1993 had been imported from the uk the rest were born in north america and were det ected in 2003 or afterward they include 10 nativeborn cases in canada one case in the united states us which was born in canada and two na tiveborn us cases because the first canadian case in 1993 is not relevant to an understanding of r ecent north american bse risk or control measures it is often excluded from official case counts while both nativeborn ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32199crs2 cases were born prior to the institution of feed controls the feed ban in 1997 at least six of the 11 canadianborn animals i ncluding the one discovered in the united states were born after similar controls we re implemented in canada also in 1997 this has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the f eed ban in general and the speed and thoroughness of its implementation particularly in canada list of north american bse cases follows canada december 1993 canada reported bse in cow imported from the uk in 1987 around the height of the outbreak there may 20 2003 canada announced the firs t native case found in black angus beef cow that was born in saskatchewan in march 1997 and presented for slaughter in alberta in january 2003 january 2 2005 canada confirmed bse in an alberta dairy cow born

recall activities release february 9 2004 on the internet at httpwwwfsisusdagovoarecallspreleaseupdate0672003htm class ii recall is health hazard situation where there is re mote probability of adverse health consequences from the use of the product according to th release usda does not have explicit statutory authority to mandate meat recalls or to initiate recalls on its own however some believe that because usda has the power to withdraw inspection effectively keeping meat from the food supply such mandatory authority is implied for more information about meat inspection and slaughter practices see crs report rl32922 meat and poultry inspection background and selected issues by geoffrey s becker 3 fsis update of recall activities june 24 2005 usda confirmed the sec ond first nativeborn us bse case 12yearold brahma cross cow from texas ranch this animal had been killed nd tested in november 2004 when bse was initially ruled out but subsequent retesting of brain tissue in june 2005 confirmed bse march 13 2006 usda confirmed the th ird second nativeborn us bse case nonambulatory re d crossbred cow in alabama that was more than 10 years old us beef recall first us case on december 23 2003 upon the announcement of bsepositive cow in washington state fsis requested voluntary recall of 10410 pounds of meat traced to the affected animal and 19 others slaughtered and processed along with it2 the agency announced that upon reviewing slaughte r records for the bsepositive cow it had determined that highrisk materials the anim als brain spinal cord and lower intestine distal ileum had been removed at slaugh ter and that the muscle meats that passed inspection posed an extremely low likelihood th at the beef contained the infectious agent that causes bse the agency stated that th tissues of highest infectivity are the brain spinal cord and distal ileum and all were removed from the rest of the carcass at slaughter therefore the meat produced were cuts that would not be expected to be infected or have an adverse public health impact the recall is being conducted out of an abundance of caution3 most of the recalled product was distributed to stores in the west and primarily in oregon and washington according to various news reports these reports indicated that some individuals already had consumed meat from the affected production lot consisting of the positive cow and others slaughtered with it on december 9 2003 usdas february 9 2004 release observed that additional beef was mixed in with the originally recalled beef products at several points in the distribution network this caused the department to expand the recall to approximately 38000 pounds second and third us cases material from the second and third us cases did not enter the food or feed supply according to usda the texas cow had been delivered to texas plant where its remains would have been processed into pet food according to usda officials however thes remains were held during testing for bse and ultimately were incinerated the alabama cow was buried on the farm so beef recall was necessary in either casehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32199crs4 4 usda final bse update monday february 9 2004 included in the 255 were 28 of the 80 cattle that had entered the united states with the cow that tested positive for bse because of lack of records only 28 of th 80 other imports were positively identified contributing to the need for th wider investigation and destruction of more animals for timeline see crs report rl32932 bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease in north america chronology of selected events by geoffrey s becker 5 usda texas bse investigation final epidemiology report august 2005 for recent usda information see http wwwaphisusdagovnewsroom hot_issuesbseindexshtmlus cases of bse in the first us case usda stated that virtually risk to public health existed however the department announced vol untary recall of thousands of pounds of beef that had entered the food supply as precautionary measure see box and also conducted an extensive epidemiological investigation into how the cow likely contracted bse and whether other animals so might have the disease during this investigation which was officially c oncluded on february 9 2004 more than 700 cattle at 11 facilities we re destroyed and 255 of those we re tested for bse all with negative results the 255 were deemed of interest because they could have been from the source herd in alberta canada4 in the second us case usda said that material from the animal entered the food or feed supply the epidemiological investigation comple ted in late august 2005 attempted to trace all adu lt animals that left the i ndex farm the texas ranch after 1990 and all progeny born within two years of the bse cows death sixty seven animals still on the index farm were killed and tested all negative for bse usda determined that 200 animals of intere st had left the farm 143 of which were slaughtered only two others were found live one was not tested because its age ruled it out as suspicious animal and the other tested negative of the rest 34 were presumed dead one was known dead nd 20 were untraceable usda also was interested in two calves born to the bse co w but due to recordkeeping gaps it had to trace total of 213 calves to try to eliminate the calves of interest none were found alive to test most were fed and slaughtered for beef5 regarding the third us case in whic h material entered the food or feed supply the animal had been euthanized and buried on the farm aphis and alabama state offi cials investigated 36 farms and five auction houses and conducted dna testing on herds that may have include d relatives of the bse case however they were unable to determine the cows herd of origin or to find any related animals of interest except for the two most recent calves of the infected animal one calf was still on the farm of the infected cow and being held by aphis for observation the other had died the year before officials also conducted inve stigations into the source of the feed consumed by the infected animals because feed containing infective ruminant material ie meat and bone meal from rendered cattle is considered the most likely source of bse infection of concern to so scientists however was th at several of the canadian bse cases were born after 1997 when both th united states and canada instituted similar but separate bans on the use of most mammalian proteins in cattle feed thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32199crs5 6 bill tomson much still unknown about two us bse cases dow jones newswires june 8 2006led some to question the effectiveness of such feed ban in general andor the effectiveness of its implementation in ca both nativeborn us cases were born before 1997 in june 2006 usda official reported th at the two nativeborn us cattle had atypical bse not the type seen in cattle in europe or in the other north american cases6 the implications of this finding in cluding whether atypical bse could be spread by novel means or whether existin g controls are appropriate are unclear at this time the usda official stated at the time that there were plans to change existing controls and the partment was already in th process of ramping down its domestic bse surveillance activity the north american bse cases prompted widespread debate over the effectiveness of us and canadian safe guards against bse these safeguards generally have been implemented incremen tally over number of years not only as response to its emergence in great britain and spread to other countries but also to evolving scientific evidence about this relatively new disease its causes and means of transmission many animal h ealth experts inside and outside of government assert that these regulatory developments have not constituted piecemeal approach to addressing the bse threat but rather an increasingly unified system of overlapping and complementary safeguards some critics nonetheless have questioned whethe r these safeguards are providing adequate protection against bse also at issue have been whether their costs to taxpayers and industry are justif ied whether such steps are defensible scientifically and will fully restore foreign markets confidence in the safety of us cattle and beef and whether other types of regulatory andor legislative actions should be considered among other questions safeguards in place pr ior to december 2003 in the wake of the far more extensiv bse outbreaks in the united kingdom and other countries starting in 1986 us offici als had by the late 1980s begun erecting what they and beef industry leaders had termed the three firewalls to keep the disease out of the united states and to c ontain it immediately if it should occur here restrictions on imports of ru minants and their products from countries with bse ban on feeding most mammalian proteins to cattle and other ruminants and targeted domestic surveillance program number of critics argued that this system was inadequate government officials acknowledged that the system wa s not failsafe but asserted that it was scientifically defensible and kept the ri sks of bse to both us agriculture and human health at extremely minimal leve ls among other evidence they

they could be challenged additional safeguards after december 2003 despite official reassurances that th us beef supply and cattle herds were safe the first appearance of bse in the ited states ignited more vigorous debate on the us safeguards it also spu rred usda officials to announce on december 30 2003 number of major new actions aime d at strengthening bse protections these additional actions th secretary of agriculture stated had been under consideration for some time prior to confirmation of the us bse case they are discussed at greater length later in th is crs report the new

register fda published jointly with usda somewhat different approach in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr asking for public input on additi onal measures under consideration to help prevent the spread of bse significantly the fda stated that it has reached preliminary conclusion th at it should propose to remove specified risk material srm from all animal feed and is currently working on proposal to accomplish this goal on october 6 2005 fda published its long awaited proposed rule to tighten feed restrictions by banning from all animal feeds some higherri sk cattle parts ie some srm final rule had not been issued as of midmay 2007 some have criticized fda over both the p ace and adequacy of these proposed changes fda officials have defended their ru lemaking noting that they needed to fully consider the latest scientific advice and consider in addition to the safety aspects rules impact on affected industries and on the environmen t for details on these developments see later sections of this report international review team findings the international panel of bse experts had released its findings on february 4 20049 the panel the international review team or irt subcommittee of usda advisory committee on animal diseases concluded that it is probable that material from other infected animals imported earlier from canada and possibly europe has been rendered nd fed to us cattle likely causing indigenous infection here although the panel obser ved that many of the govern ment actions taken so far had been effective and conformed to international standa rds it nonetheless recommended additional steps these included further tightening animal feeding rules by fda and more extensive testing of cattle to gain better understanding of the prevalence of any bse here some bse experts and consumer gro ups welcomed findings from the report others in the beef feed and relate d industries responded that the irt had exaggerated the risks based on faulty assumptions and had not properly distinguished between the bse situation in north america and the far more extensive problems experienced in europe some claimed th at the panel report

questioned others the full committee recommended that the harvard center review the subcommittees report in light of its prior risk analysis10 the actions taken by usda and fda in response to the finding of bse in north america were intended not only to reassure consumers and protect livestock health but also to calm foreign markets most of which had ba nned the entry of us cattle and beef products after december 23 2003 beef exports continue to recover slowly although korea remained effectivel closed at the end of 2006 and number of major markets still restrict certain types of us beef11 discussion of each major safeguard follows trade restrictions with few exceptions countries with bse can trace the first cases to importation of affected animals or infected byproducts in this section us import controls to prevent bse are examined within the context of internationally accepted standards worldwide some 24 countries includi ng the united states had reported one or more indigenous cases of bse and veral others reporte d only imported cases as of early 2007 the united kingdom uk where bse was first reported has experienced some 183000 of the approxima tely 187000 cases worldwide and most of the rest have been found elsewhere in europe annual bse cases peaked in the uk in 1992 at more than 37000 and have been declining there since then12 as the uk was coping with thenrisi ng number of bse discoveries usdas animal and plant health inspection service aphis the lead agency for controlling animal diseases began to impose series of import restrictions here during 1989 aphis first began to ban by not issuing import permits the importation of live ruminants ie cattle sheep goats deer elk buffalo and most ruminant products from the uk and other countries where bse has been diagnosed on december 6 1991 aphis published formal rules banning the importation of ruminants ruminant meats and related products fro m bse countries these rules essentially superseded the policy of not issuing import permitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32199crs9 13 sources for this section various aphis b ackgrounders and briefing materials available at

should evaluate the source countrys risk mitigation measures as whole not as separate items on checklist see for example declaration of david wilson head of the oie international trade department february 17 2005 in the case ranchers cattlemen action legal fund usa vs usda cv 0506blgrfcon december 12 1997 as bse cases were em erging in other parts of europe aphis instituted ban on importing ruminan ts and most ruminant products from all of europe on december 7 2000 usda bega n to prohibit imports of all rendered animal protein products regard less of species from europe out of concern that feed of nonruminant origin was potentially cr osscontaminated with the bse agent these prohibitions on imports are distinct from the fdas domestic feed controls described later in this report13 international bse standards the organization of international epizootics oie the international animal disease control organization has recomme nded that disease risk assessments be carried out to promote consistent scie ncebased practices and transparency in international trade oie provides guid ance and standards for countries managing bse within their borders and bsefree count ries wanting to maintain their status these bse guidelines are formally published within the oie terrestrial animal health code as for other animal diseases the oie standards for bse are considered to be scientificallybased guidelines and recommendations not hard and fast rules for trade veterinary authorities in indivi dual countries are free to interpret and implement these guidelines to help preven t the introduction of foreign diseases into their domestic herds and flocks14 the oierecommended trade conditions for such countries become increasingly restrictive as countrys bs risk status increases under the oie code trade in some ruminant products even from highest risk country theoretically could occur so long as the exporting country followed the recommended safeguards15 until 2005 the oie code described five bse ri sk categories for exporting countries ranging from bse free to high bse risk there are now three categories see below in practice however most count ries including until august 20 03 the united states were banning most ruminant products from any country that reported even single case of bse many still do in august 2003 the united states had announced that it canada and mexico were entering into discussions at the oie to develop new guidance for resuming trade with countries that have reported bse under certain conditions the basis for the proposal according to us officials was that conditions for trade should be basedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32199crs10 16 statement of aphis administrator ron dehaven march 9 2007 accessed may 18 2007 at http wwwaphisusdagovnewsroomcont ent200703oie_statement3907 shtmlnot simply on the number of mad cow cas country has reported rather trade conditions should better reflect the adequacy of countrys safeguards in addressing whatever level of risk is found through scie ntifically valid risk assessment in other words countries with strong safeguards should not be penalized because rigorous testing has found an acceptably low number of bse cases whereas another exporting country with inadequate prot ections may simply not be testing for andor reporting the disease on may 26 2005 the oie ag reed to new bse trade guidelines included is simplified hierarchy of risk category 1 countries are those with negligible risk and thus subject to the least restrictive conditions for exporting ruminants and ruminant products category 2 are those countries with controlled risk and category 3 are those where the risks are unknown in another guideline change oie deci ded that trade in boneless muscle beef from cattle under 30 months of age should be considered to be safe regardless of their exporting countrys bse risk profile so long as that country has appropriate controls in place for example one control would be an acceptable method for determining these animals ages and for segregating them from older animals aphis announced in march 2007 that the oie scientific commission had approved the us request to be classified as category 2 controlled risk country16 the recommendation and the same risk designa tion for canada were to go to the oie general assembly for final approval in late may 2007 ag ain as under the prior oie guidelines for bse the newly modified guidelines leave it up to the exporting countries to convince importing country author ities that their beef and cattle are safe the importing country in turn might or might not accept these demonstrations of safety and might not necessarily agree to observe the oie guidelines us officials have stressed on veral occasions that they expect other countries to recognize the oie designation in opening th eir markets to more types of us beef see japan and korea beef trade issues below if bilateral trade disagreement over countrys bse safeguards were to reach an international dispute panel presum ably that panel would look to the oie guidelines for direction in resolving it however dispute resolution process such as under the uruguay round agreements administered by the world trade organization can be lengthy and not always settled to the satisfaction of either party the ussupported approach to bse and trade has been put to the test by practical developments between the united states and its trading partners more specifically canada has been gaining continued expansion of its permitted ruminant exports to the united states although the administration and many in congress agree with canada several us produ cer groups and their allies do not see canadian beef and cattle imports below at the same time the

animals born before march 1 1999 aphis stated that it had chosen the march 1 1999 cutoff for live cattle shipment because this was what it had determined to be the date of effective enforcement of the canada feed rule an agency official explained that its assessment allowed for six months beyond the formal implementation of the ban in august 1997 and also for an additional year for th normal

anywhere from 10 to 25 of cattle according to various estimates the united states also agreed to among other things an expanded srm definition to cover cattle of all ages usdas current srm list is somewhat different and generally covers only cattle over 30 months of age the announcement had stated that the two countries would evaluate this interim system by july 2005 and modify it if appr

additional animals in this group harbored the disease and were slaughtered and rendered infectivity may have been intr oduced into the canadian and us cattle feed supplies before the 1997 feed ban was implemented in both countries if additional animals were infected they may have been exported to the us as well it appears that any related introduction of bse into the us from canada would have been due to the import of either infected animals or contaminated feed imports are plau sible source of introduction of bse into the us from canada because the american and canadian beef industries are closely linked during the last five ye ars the us has on average imported over 12 million cattle and 185000 tons of feed annually from canada30 international review team in its february 4 2004 report the international panel of bse experts which examined the first us bse case and the governments response the internati onal review team or irt observed the number of cattle actually infected on the farm of origin in canada was probably small indeed the index case identified in the usa may be the only infected animal from the canadian herd of origin that survived to adulthood however it is probable that other infected animals have been imported from canada and possibly also from europe these animals have not been detected and therefore infective material has likely been rendered fed to cattle and amplified within the cattle population so that cattle in the usa have also been indigenously infected therefore animal s that have not been identified from the birth cohort of the index case do not repr esent significant additional risk for further propagation of bse within the usa31 in another section of its report th irt commended the united states for following sciencebased

resulted from the feeding of rendered byproducts of infected animals including highly infectious brain tissue to other cattle as protein supplement th cause of the first cases of bse is unknown theories include spontaneous emergen ce of single case or the anomalous transmission of the sheep sc rapie agent to cattle it is thought that the long incubation period and possibly ch anges in rendering and feeding practices led to amplification of the agent in the feed supply and spread of the disease for years before it was recognized in 1986 in 1988 the uk banned the practice of feeding ruminant byproducts back to ruminants when the purported causal link between bse and the human disease variant creutzfeldjakob disease vcjd was announced by the uk in 1996 the united states added similar controls over cattle feed to prevent spread of the disease should it emerge the fda center for vete rinary medicine cvm responsible for the safety of animal feeds began prohib iting the use of most mammalian protein in feeds for ruminants in august 1997 re striction commonly called the feed ban38 fda registers and inspects renderers feed mills pet food manufact urers animal feed distributors and others to ensure compliance in 2002 report on the feed ban the gao not ed that relative to other countries us surveillance and import controls were stronger but the feed ban was more permissive39 the harvard study concluded th at the feed ban was the dominant protective firewall and would protect agai nst spread of bse even if the other firewalls failed conversely the study also showed that failure of the feed ban led to the greatest increase in number of bse cases many also noted that certain continuing permissible prac tices may nonetheless result in the feeding of rendered ruminant materials to cattle one such pot ential breach is the feeding of rendered cattle to poultry and the subsequent incor poration of poultry wa ste called litter which may contain spilled feed

limited its recommenda tions to improved enforcement of the existing feed ban others suggested that the regulation itself be changed to enhance protection the harvard study found that if bse were present in the united states the greatest source of potential feed contamination would be from cattle that died on the farm and were rendered by products from these animals could legally be fed to nonruminants and the harvard st udy found that if one such rendered cow were bsepositive the resulting release of in fectivity into the feed supply could lead to new bovine cases from single s ubsequent breach in the feed ban40 many including the gao and the harvard study have noted that there are opportunities for noncompliance at many points in the feed chain and that some may be difficult to detect such as intermittent commingling of feeds on farms that feed cattle along with poultry and ot her livestock some experts argued that if highrisk materials were prohibited in all animal feeds that crosscontamination breaches at feeding and the concurrent regulatory oversight of these activities would become irrelevant livestock industry representativ have expressed concern about potential lost income if certain beef byproducts we re to lose their commercial value yet others have voiced concern about poten tial environmental and other impacts of converting these byproducts from their us eful functions and instead designating them as waste following the first us bse case the fda in january 2004 announced imminent plans to expand feed ban restric tions the agency published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr in 2004 and proposed rule in 2005 each with provisions that varied from the other and from the 2004 announcement the regulation had yet to be alte red as of midmay 2007 an analysis of these rulemaking proposals follows the feed ban prior to december 2003 the feed ban imposed in 1997 did not pr ohibit the inclusion of potential bovine risk materials such as brain and spinal cord in all animal feeds but only those feeds intended for ruminants fda required that feeds containing ruminant material be labeled with prohibition against feeding to ruminants and that firms and farms effectively separate prohib ited and nonprohibited feeds in production shipping and feeding the ban exempted certain bovi ne byproducts such as blood milk gelatin and restaurant plate waste on the premise that the exempted materials posed minimal risk of transmission some have questioned the feed ban exem ptions including the practice of using rendered bovine blood in milk substitutes for calves based on concerns that the agent linked to the human form of bse vcjd could be present in blood another center at fda had recommended that persons having

expanded measures to prevent cr osscontamination of ruminant feeds with nonruminant feeds in mills and storage facilities43 on february 3 2004 the irt recommended additional steps including more stringent animal feed restrictions than those just announced by fda the panel expanded both the proposed list of products that should be banned from ruminant feed and also from the feed stream in general recommending that the current feed ban be extended to exclude all mammalia n and poultry protein from all ruminant feeds and that all specified risk material or srm must be excluded from all animal feed including pet food44 the panel defined srm more stringently than had the usda in december 2003 in its f ood safety provisions recommending the removal of highrisk tissues from all cattle

july 14 2004 published an anpr seeking information and comment about its tentative conclusion th at it should propose removing srm from all animal feed to adequately control the risks associated with crosscontamin ation throughout feed manufacture and distribution and with inte ntional or unintentional misfeeding on the farm46 since this measure would eliminate the need for protections against cross contamination or ban on feeding of pou ltry litter fda said those proposals would not be finalized at that time but would be reassessed in light of possible expanded srm ban but the previously announced bans on feeding bovine blood and plate waste were also not finalized fda inst ead posed number of questions to gather information and relevant scientific evidence as well as economic environmental and other consequences of variety of pr oposals including an srm ban in feed consumer groups and some members of congress criticized the fda for its failure to move more quickly on proposed feed ban modifications they said that decisions regarding the ex emptions for blood and plat waste would not depend on decision on srm prohibitions and that the blood and plate waste exemptions should therefore be promptly removed the blood exemption has been the subject of considerable discussion blood is us ed to make formula milk replacer for newborn calves which some experts feel may be especially susceptible to infection from small doses of the bse agent the oie continues to state as it ways has that bovine blood and blood products in feed do not present risk for bse transmission47 but in its rationale for proposing blood ban in january 2004 f da noted recent concerns about human transmission of vcjd by blood transfusion which suggested that infectious prions could be present in blood while also ting that transfusion would likely pose greater risk from minute exposures than would feeding48 in its july 2004 anpr the agency requested comment on the evidence of transmission risk from blood in feed the fda next published proposed rule to modify the feed ban on october 6 200549 comments were accepted until decem ber 20 2005 after which they were to be

tonsils and part of the small intestine distal ileum of ca ttle of all ages the octobe r 6 proposed rule also would not ban even from ruminant feed bl ood and blood products plate waste and poultry litter explaining its proposal fda stated that banning the brain and spinal cords of cattle 30 months and older w ould remove 90 of bse in fectivity without creating an undue burden on the rendering and meat i ndustries it based the 90 claim on report by european union scientific pa nel which found that approximately 64 of the infectivity in an animal with bse is in the brain and 26 is in the spinal cord each of the remaining srms covered by the usdafsis human food ban contain much smaller percentages of total infectivity fda said50 even though the existing feed rule pr ovides strong control measures and compliance is high by renderers protein blenders and feed mills fda acknowledged that concerns about crosscontamin ation remain for example without fully dedicated equi pment it may not be possible to verify that there is zero carryover of feed or feed ingredients in equipment even where firms cleanout procedures have been judged to be adequate in addition resource constraints limit fdas ability to assure full compliance by all segments of the industry that are subject to the current bse feed regulation for example resources are not available to the fda nd its state counterparts to fully verify compliance on over 1 million farms where cattle are being fed51 the agency also noted cerns not only about unintenti onal but also intentional misfeeding of nonruminant feed to ruminants on the farm financial incentives may exist to do so whenever inexpensive sources of prohibited protein are locally available fda concluded adding that it believes the proposed rule would protect cattle by removing the highest risk materials even from nonruminant feedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32199crs25 52 hodges jim american meat institute foundation october 6 2005

separate from nonruminant feed bans on poultry litter blood products andor plate waste in ruminant feeds and larger list of srm to be prohibited in all feeds it generally concluded that such additional measures are not necessary because the partial srm ban being proposed w ould remove an estimated 90 of bse infectivity however it again asked for further comments on these options initial reactions to the proposed rule we re mixed the american meat institute ami representing the major meat packing companies described the approach in part as the appropriate sciencebased policy52 the national cattlemens beef association ncba declared that the pr oposals would further enhance stringent bse safeguards already in place and diligently enforced in the united states for the past two decades but ncba said it would be analyzing the rule to ensure that it is sciencebased53 members of the rendering indus try expressed concerns about the cost of the proposed measures to their indus try these concerns are discussed further in section on environm ental and economic impacts consumer advocacy groups argued that the proposal was too weak because among other things it didnt prohibit srms from all animal feed and because it continued to allow exemptions for bovi ne blood poultry litter and plate waste in cattle feed for example comments from consumers union argued among other things that the proposed list of srms was too narrow to adequately protect the feed supply and is more narrow than the srm definition used by fsis to protect the supply of beef for human consumption54 as of midmay 2007 fda had not finalized any proposed changes to the feed ban an fda official was quoted in sept ember 2006 as saying that the agency may have underestimated the impacts that the ban of

proposed rule enough potential remaining bse infectivity ie 90 would be rem oved from the feed supply leaving much lower cost burden to industry than broader srm ban which would bring only minimally greater risk reduction and at fa r higher cost for example as the economic analysis estimates banning all srm plus all dead and downed cattle carcasses would have cost the indus try an estimated 195 million to 240 million such broader ban also would have d major environmental implications because quantities of all srm d ead and downer animals c ould total 21 billion pounds or more and much of this woul d have to be incinerated pl aced in landfills or otherwise disposed of59 industry comments the national renderers association nra which commissioned its own economic analysis of the proposal commented that by prohibiting most if not all cattle brains and spinal cords from all livestock feed markets the rule would have immedi ate and profound impacts on the livestock sector particularly on the re ndering industry and livestock producers the analysis based in part on survey of rendering plants conservatively estimated the direct economic losses faced by the rendering indus try and livestock producers at more than 1277 million annually substantially higher than fdas estimate when slaughter plants costs of handling and disposing of newly prohibited mate rials are added the aggregate impact would exceed 150 million annually the nra argued the nra sponsored analysis concludes that fda significantly underestimated the proportion of dead cattle and calves th at are currently re ndered in the united states that the proposed rule severely reduces the number to be rendered that reduced collections by renderers and high er fees would create more potential for environmental problems and that livestock producers disposal costs could increase by 112 million per year reduced mbm and tallow sales from the loss of deadstock for rendering could exceed 157 million

ban enforcement activity on public website64 its january 12 2007 update reported that it had received more than 50000 inspection reports since the program began on 19492 re nderers feed mills protein blenders and related establishments the agency noted that 5905 of them 30 handled materials prohibited for use in ruminant feeds of this subset fda reported that the vast majority were within compliance more specifically the january 2007 update f ound that seven of the firms that handled prohibited material 01 we re classified as socalled official action indicated or oai meaning that significant problem s were found that warranted regulatory sanctions for example one oai might be that the manufacturer lacked the procedures to ensure that ruminant feed is not contaminated with nonruminant feed another 188 firms 32 were classified as voluntary action indicated or vai meaning that problems were found but only advisory actions were warranted vai example might be minor recor dkeeping lapse fda explained the preamble to the october 6 2005 propos ed feed rule provides additional insights into compliance with the present ban fda stated that during fy2004 and the first half

does not include all serious violations in its calculations because it reclassifies firms as being in compliance once they correct violations matter how long problem existed for this and other reasons gao said that fda did not have sufficient information to calculate compliance rate and recommended instead that the agency report enforcement information in its complete context also in its 2005 report gao concluded that fda had made improvements in its management of the feed ban since the 2002 gao report but that various program weaknesses c ontinue to undermine the nation s firewall against bse one of the weaknesses cited was the lack of uniform approach to identify all the additional feed manufacturers onfarm mixers and othe r feed industry businesses beyond the approximately 14800 firms the ag ency had identified at the time among other concerns gao also commented that fda had not reinsp ected approximately 2800 firms for several years and therefore did not know whether they use prohibited materials in their feed that the agency had not required warning label on feed for export that is not intended for cattle and other ruminants and that it had not always alerted usda and the states when it learns that cattle may have been given prohibited feed feed testing program fda started small discreet feed testing program in 2003 which gao evaluated in an oct ober 11 2005 report

provide the basis for their final determinations on samples extended periods to complete nearly half of the 989 samples studied by gao making it possible for feed to be consumed before results were in and inadequa headquarters oversig ht of the program the feed ban in canada on june 26 2006 the canadian food inspection agency announced proposal to strengthen the countrys feed ban introduced in 1997 with new measures to become effective on july 12 200769 the expansion would prohibit srms in all animal feeds and in fertilizer the canadian ban is somewhat stronger than the fda proposal of october 2005 the list of srms is somewhat more restrictive and the prohibition against srms in fertilizer is not included in the fda proposal there may be trade and other concerns if the fda s final feed rule is substantially different from the amended canadian rule congressional role if congress more closely reviews the feed ban and its role in preventing the spread of bse issues for consideration might include the effects on the safety of the feed supply of banning dow ner animals from slaughte r and thus channeling them to rendering and whether current oversig ht of the feed ban has accommodated this shift the effect of changing market conditions that may result from the downer ban on the safety of both food and feed in the united states and that processes to ensure the safe disposal of animal remains are included in new regulations as they are implemented congress also could scrutinize the anticipated changes in feed ban restrictions proposed by fda particular ly regarding their economic implications their likely impact in strengthening bse pr evention and the agencys strategies for enforcement in its july 2004 anpr fda requested comment on the matter of whether its authorities under the federal food drug and cosmetic ac t and the public health service act provide legal basis to suppor t an srm ban the concern is that srm themselves are not harmful unless they were to contain bse or other tse agent since there is not test to identify the presence of harmful tse agents in feed the agencys authority to prosecute viol ation of an srm ban may not be clear in

implementation bse surveillance and testing in cattle overview the goals of bse surveillance are to determine the prevalence of disease in country and to ensure timely detection and response to cases surveillance is not synonymous with testing depending on th disease of interest surveillance may or may not involve laboratory tests for bs which is clinically similar to other neurologic diseases surveillance requires testing so the two activities are closely intertwined bse testing is constrained by the unique nature of the disease and this drives the design of surveillance programs because it evokes imm une or inflammatory response bse cannot be diagnosed from bl ood urine or other noninvasive samples and because abnormal prions are found in abundance only in the brain and spinal cord an animal must die or be killed to be tested also research to date suggests that existing tests cannot detect th disease in an animal any time sooner than two to three months before an animal begins to exhibit clinical signs of infection representatives of the usda and some in industry have repeatedly stressed that bse testing serves to support the surveillan ce program and is not directly intended as food safety testing dr elsa mura then the usda under secretary for food safety testified in 2004 that the consistent removal of cer tain highrisk tissues from cattle at slaughter described in greater detail in subsequent section of this report is the relevant f ood safety protection70 for this reason usda argues that bse surveillance program does not have to test every animal slaughtered for food but can instead use targeted sampling to determine overall prevalence after the first report of bse in us cow in december 2003 the us bse surveillance program came under fire from cr itics who argued that the program did not test sufficient numbers of animals or was not properly targeting highrisk animals thereby failing to give true picture of bse risk in the united states the international review team in particular commented in its report that uncertainty about domestic bse prevalence hampered decisions about the scope of other safeguards such as the feed ban some observers proposed that surve illance should approx imate programs in european countries where every adult anima l was being tested or japan which has claimed to test every animal slaughtered usda has argued that it already tested many more animals than are recommended by the oie and that because the program targeted animals with suspicious signs it could detect bse if it were present at

cattle in the united states as of january 1 2006 complicating factor was that japa n the top foreign customer had demanded that all ca ttle be tested for bse as precondition for again accepting us

such testing would be unscientific expensive and bad trade precedent private testing issues are discussed later in this report bse surveillance in the united states prior to december 2003 in 1990 aphis began surveillance for bse in cattle in response to the british livestock outbreak the program grew steadily in scope from few thousand animals tested annually in the mid1990s to about 20000 animals each year in 2002 and 2003 out of about 35 million ca ttle slaughtered each year71 the washington state cow was the first bsepositive animal detected by the program three highrisk groups of cattle were target ed for surveillance animals that die on the farm animals exhibiting neurologic signs and sample of downers animals presenting nonambulatory at slaughter wh ile the former two groups

to some of the public concerns that the identification of the bsepositive cow may have been mishandled85 the ig testified that her office also found substantive evidence that usda officials provided

results and were later destroyed cattle market prices fell in response to news of the inconclusive findings but generally recovered once the conclusive negative results were announced usda was criticized both for releasing too mu ch and too little information though some industry groups said the policy to release pa rtial information struck the right balance during the wait for final

science is ever evolving it is not static and as we learn more we apply the knowledge us da is carefully reviewing its testing to ensure that it is in line with the very latest science he said adding perhaps the most important thing to remember is that weve only needed this test three times since our enhanced surveillance began94 in the four instances of inconclusive s including the march 2006

programs permit label claims for marketing rather than food safety purposes including the organic label and number of certified beef and quality system assessment programs98 government officials and many in industry countered that especially because bse is foreign animal disease there must be strong federal oversig ht of control measures and that allowing privatesector testing of lowrisk animals

the program this amount was in addition to allocations for bse surveillance coming out of annual congre ssional appropriations which rose from 2 million in fy2001 to 17 million annually in each of fy2005fy2007 projected this is an expected cost of testing 40000 animals per year101 responding to questions at an april 2006 briefing on the program the aphis administrator estimated that the weekly cost of testing between 5000 and 7000 animals was approximately 1 million102 congressional role the 108th and 109th congresses closely followed the enhanced bse surveillance effort as it was getting under way in 2004 when concerns were raised about its basic design and initial operation many members expressed interest in the impact of testing on cattle prices particularly whenever usda reported anything other than negative finding of bse as occurred on four occasions during the two years of enhanced surveillance there was renewed congressional interest in testing when usda at oigs insistence

downer cattle in the food supply usdafsis took this regulatory action as part of the series of rule changes it announced on december 30 2003 this ac tion was published on january 12 2004 as an interim final rule104 under the rule meat inspectors must condemn all nonambulatory cattle presented for inspec tion for human food regardless of the reason for their condition downers are defined as nonambulatory or disabled animals that are unable to rise from recu mbent position ie to stand or are unable to walk the action was based on the concern that animals could become non ambulatory as result of bse proponents of this ban ve argued that downer animals pose numerous food safety hazards not limited to bse but including microbial hazards such as salmonella they have noted that some prominent fastfood chains already ban the use of these animals for the meat they accept opponents of the ban have expressed concern about the integrity of bse surv eillance if these animals are longer brought to slaughter and ve questioned the sc ientific basis of the ban in light of its economic impacts as noted earlier usda says it has taken steps to ensure that many downed animals can tinue to be tested even if they are diverted from slaughter for human food usda estimated that up to 200000 downer cattle were slaughtered in the united states annually and accounted for less than 1 of roughly 35 million animals slaughtered within this total 25 or perhaps higher were ultimately condemned by meat inspectors as unfit for human consumption105 usdas statistical agency then collected two years of onfarm national data it estimates there were approximately 465000 nonambulatory cattle and calves at u s beef and dairy operations in 2003 and 450000 in 2004106 some within the cattle industry have argued that the downer ban should distinguish between animals that cannot wa lk because of bse or another potentially dangerous disease and those that are simp ly lame and presumably safe for use as

nonambulator cattle were suffering in tr ansport to and after arrival at slaughter plants some in congre ss believed that ban on their inspection effectively reducing any higher value as human food would serve to improve their treatment other new slaughter and processing protections additional measures announced on decem ber 30 2003 include policy to hold meat from any animals tested for bse until the test results are known ban on air injection stunning which is suspected to spread brain matter through the bloodstream and into meat ban on mechanicallysepar ated meat in which bones may be

contradictory statement that until better understanding of bse prevalence were established the 30 month cutoff was reasonable temporary compromise the full advisory committee reported that the usda action to ban srm from animals ove r 30 months removed the highestrisk tissues from the food supply and was in accord ance with international standards the harvard risk assessment c oncluded that srm

ileum defined to be at least 80 inches and to utilize the rest of the small intestine in food or cosmetics th actions were in response to industry comments that technology exists to ffectively remove the distal ileum112 congressional role although bses potential impact on food sa fety and public health has been of interest to many members of congress the traderelated animal disease and economic aspects of the disease have attr acted as much attention still few proposed measures in the 109th congress would have direc tly or indirectly affected fsiss oversight of bse safeguards in meat plants for example as noted earlier s 73 focused primarily on keeping higherri sk cattle parts out of animal feeds but one section of the bill explicitly would have made it illegal for any person to introduce into interstate or foreign commerce these and other prohibited materials among other provisions other measures focused on the downer issue during action on the fy2004 agriculture appropriations bill hr 2673 in the 108th congress for example lawmakers debated amendments that reflected the content of companion bills in the house and senate the downed animal protection act hr 2519s 1298 these would have amended the 2002 farm act to re quire that downed animals at stockyards market agencies livestock dealer facilitie s and slaughter f acilities be euthanized immediately and barred from federal inspection the nate adopted the downed animal provision in its version of the fundi ng bill but it was dropped in conference on the final measure incorporated into the fy2004 consolidated omnibus appropriations pl 108199 in the 109th congress during floor cons ideration of the fy2006 usda appropriation hr 2744 on september 20 2005 the senate adopted by voice vote an amendment by senator akaka that would have prohi bited nonambulatory livestock from being used for human food the housepassed bill lacked such ban and the amendment was dele ted during the housesenate conference when the senate adopted the provision there was discussion of its potential to protect against bse however the amendment would have applied not only to cattle but also to any sheep swine goats horses mules or othe r equines that are ble to stand or walkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32199crs48 unassisted at the point of antemortem inspection senator akaka also again introduced the downed animal protection act as s 1779 the house companion bill by representative ackerman was hr 3931 one bill hr 4121 in the 108th congress would have amended the federal meat inspection act to define nonambulatory as any cattle that at the time of examination and inspection is unable to rise from recumbent position or unable to walk for any reason including metabo lic conditions or ce ntral nervous system disorders unless the reason for such in ability is fatigue st ress obdurator nerve paralysis obesity or one or more broken or fractured appendages severed tendons or ligaments or dislocated joints these or other proposals aimed at addre ssing the food safety and animal welfare aspects of the bse issue could reemerge in the 110th congress senator akaka and representative ackerman in january 2007 in troduced bills s 394 hr 661 to ban downed animals in human food and to requi re that they be humanely euthanized immediately among the possible venues for debating them are

of disease discovery bse or other many an imal producers support establishment of nationwide identification id system capable of quickly tracking animals from birth to slaughter many of them already k eep records on the identities of each of their animals primarily for herd mana gement and marketing purposes still though animals often ma be identified individually as part of an animal disease program nationwide comprehensive us animal id system is in place some observers have suggested that such system for example would have enabled usda to find more of the cows importe d from canada with the december 2003 bse cow aphis officials acknowledged that they had concluded th eir investigation of the us outbreak after positively identif ying only 28 of the 80 cattle that were imported with the bse cow the limitations of th cattle identificati on system necessitated more extensive tracing exercise than would otherwise have been necessary in order to identify the cattle to be culled in

cool continues into the 110th congress where some members still oppose the delay and have expressed their intention to require implementation sooner117 others are working to make cool voluntary not mandatory program for indus try among the reasons that cool is needed according to supporters is that c onsumers have right to know where their food is from particularly in light of r ecent animal health and food safety concerns such as the two bse cases in canadianbor n cows cool critics have countered that it is thinlydisguised trade barrier intended to increase the costs of imports and that it undermines us efforts to reform world agricultural trade moreover they argue that as designed the mandatory program for industry will be extremely expensive to maintain and might hold them lega lly accountable for inadvertent or minor mistakes in records prior to enactment of mandatory cool in 2002 industry leaders were seeking from usda voluntary program for labeling beef of us origin although such labeling already is permitted so long as existing fsis conditions are satisfied presumably newer more specific origin program would have b een more attractive to the industry separately after the

transmitted or can be transmitte d to humans under natural conditions however there is not yet strong evid ence that such transmissions could not occur to further asse ss the possibility that the cwd
