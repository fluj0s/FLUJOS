supreme court upheld drug testing program of st udents participating in nonathletic extracurricular activities even though negligible evidence of drug use problem among such students was shown several terms ago in veronia school district 47j v acton 2 the high court first considered the constitutionality of student drug testing in the public schools at issue there was school district program for ra ndom drug testing of high school student athletes which had been implemented in res ponse to perceived increase in student drug activity all student athletes and their parents had to sign forms consenting to testing which occurred at the seasons beginning nd randomly thereafter on weekly basis for the seasons duration students testing confirmed positive were given the option of participating in drug assi stance program or suspension from athletics for the current and following season 6 to 3 majority of the court led by justice scalia upheld the program against fourth amendment challenge central to the majoritys rationale was the custodial and tutelary relationship that is created when children are committed to the temporary custody of the state as school master in effect permitting degree of supervision and control that could not be exercised over free adults students had diminished expectations of privacy by virtue of routinely required medical examinations factor compounded in the case of student at hletes by insurance requirements minimum academic standards and the general lack of privacy in the locker room and communal undress that is inherent in athletic participati on moreover because school sports are not for the bashful student athletes were found to have lower expectation of privacy than other students balanced against this diminished privacy interest was the nature of the intrusion and importance of the governmental interest at st ake first the school district had mitigated actual intrusion by implementing urine coll ection procedures that simulated conditions nearly identical to those typically encounter ed in public restrooms by analyzing the urine sample only for presence of illegal drug s not for other medical information such as disease conditions diabetes or pregnancy and by insuring that positive test results were not turned over to law enforcement fficials school offi cials unquestionably had an interest in deterring student drug use as part of their special responsibility of care and direction toward students that interest was magnified in veronia by judicial findings that prior to implementation of the progra m large segment of the student body particularly those involved in interscholastic athle tics was in state of rebellion fueled by drug and alcohol abuse sc hool officials interest became perhaps compelling in the case of student athletes due to the risk of physical harm to the drug user or those with whom he is playing hi s sport consequently the court dismissed actons argument for less intrusive policy of suspicionbased testin g reasoning that the fourth amendment only requires that governme nt officials adopt reasonable policies not the least intrusive ones available the majority in veronia cautioned against the assumption that suspicionless drugtesting will readily pass muster in other constitutional contexts justice ginsburgs brief concu rrence also emphasized her understanding thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21082crs3 3 133 f3d 984 7th cir cert denied 525 us 824 1998 4 172 f3d 574 8th cir vacated as moot 172 f3d 582 8th cir 1999 5 in practice the policy affected nearly the

1998the decision applied only to testing of student athletes expressly reserving the issue of whether such programs could be constitutionally extended to other segments of the student population justice oconnors di ssent distinguished public employee and student drug testing arguing that suspicionbased testing would be entirely effective in the high school setting division of opinion soon emerged among the lower courts as to how broadly veronia could be applied to permit suspicionless drug testing that included student groups bey ond athletes the question was first confronted by the seventh and eighth circuits in nearly identical cases todd v rush county schools3 and miller v wilkes4 involving random drug testing policies that pplied not only to student athletes but also to students participating in any other extracurricular activity while actual or imminent drug problem was identified among th affected student populations in either case the policies were uphe ld the school policy in todd applied not only to participation in extracurricular activities but also to students who drove to and from school all of whom were subj ect to random drug testing5 in sequel to todd joy v pennharrismadison school corp6 212 f 3d 1052 7th cir 2000 the seventh circuit reconsidered policy mandatin g random drug testing of st udents who drive to school as well as those who participate in extracu rricular activities conceding that the todd outcome was not compelled by veronia and that todd was crucial to joy the court resorted to stare decisis as basis for upholding the policy finding that veronia allowed the testing of student drivers expressing c oncern however that the danger of slippery slope continues to haunt our jurisprudence7 the appeals court emphasized that it was not sanctioning drug testing of an entire stude nt population tacitly encouraging the supreme court to revisit the issue and provide the lower courts with additional guidance parting company with the todd line of decisions was trinadad school district 1 v lopez 8 where the colorado supreme court disa pproved of policy for drug testing all students in extracurricular activities wher there was convincing evidence of higher drug usage rates by students participating in extracurricular activities or that the reasonable privacy expectations of such students had been so diminished by constraints of the sports culture or otherwise as those imposed on student athletes in veronia instead of targeting students in fo rmal school activities the policy in willis v anderson school corp9 mandated testing for any student w ho possesses or uses tobacco products is suspended for three or more days for fighting is habitually truant or violates any otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21082crs4 10 id at 417school rule that results in at least threeday suspension10 because indiana law required oneonone meetings w ith such students prior to suspension in effect permitting observation of any suspicious drugrelated behavior the drug testing policy was rejected since the benefits of deterrence alone did not warrant departure from traditional reasonable suspicion standards conflict among the circuits was created when the tenth circuit refused to permit the random testing of student s participating in extracurricu lar activities outside of the sports arena in 1998 the tecumseh public school district adopted student activities drug testing policy which required suspici onless drug testing of students wishing to participate in any extracurricular activity such activities included future farmers of america future homemakers of america academic team s band chorus cheerleading and athletics any student who refused to submit to random testing for illegal drugs was barred from all such activities but was not otherwise subject to penalty or academic sanction lindsay earls challenged the di stricts policy as condition to her membership in the high schools show choi r marching band and academic team but did not protest the policy as applied to student at hletics the district court granted the school district summary judgment but was reversed on appeal th tenth circuit panel found that any special need that the school district had for suspicionless tes ting of students in these circumstances was less immediate than the risk of injury posed to student athletes in veronia particularly given the paucity of ev idence of an actual drug abuse problem among those subject to the policy in the earls case on june 27 2002 by 5 to 4 vote the us supreme court reve rsed the decision of the tenth circuit and held that the tecums eh school districts random drug testing program was reasonable means of preventin g and deterring student drug use and did not violate the fourth amendm ent the courts decision wr itten by justice thomas was joined by chief justice rehnquist and justices scalia kennedy and breyer in its role as guardian and tutor the majority r easoned the state has responsibility for the discipline health and safe ty of students whose privacy interests are correspondingly limited and subject to greater control than those for adults moreover students who participate in extracurricular activities have limited expectation of privacy as they participate in the activities and clubs on voluntary basis subject themselves to other intrusions of privacy and meet official rule s for participation the fact that student athletes in the veronia case were regularly subject to physical exams and communal undress was not deemed essential to the out come there instead that decision depended primarily upon the schools custodial responsibility and au thority which was equally applicable to athle tic and nonathle tic activities the testing procedure itself involving coll ection of urine samples chain of custody and confidentiality of results was found by justice thom as to be minimally intrusive and virtually identical to that approved by the court in veronia in particular the opinion notes test results are kept in separa confidential files only available to school personnel with need to know they ma not be disclosed to law enforcement authorities and they carry disciplinary or academic consequen ces other than limiting extracurricular participation given the minimally intrusive na ture of the samplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21082crs5 collection and the limited uses to which the test results are put we conclude that the invasion of students privacy is not significant finally the majority ruled that the school di strict had an important interest in the health and safety of its stude nts including prevention and terrence of drug use which was reasonably served by its drug testing program citing several anecdotal instances of drug use at tecumseh schools justi ce thomas nonetheless concluded that neither individualized suspicion nor demonstrat ed problem of drug abuse were necessary predicates for student drug testing program and there is threshol d level of drug use that need be satisfied similarly in separate concurrence justice breyer emphasized the national scope of the drug problem in ducation and the inefficacy of supply side interdiction efforts by government as factors supporting the reasonableness of the schools drug testing program even in the absence of individualized suspicion justice ginsburg joined in dissent by th ree other justices ffered point by point rebuttal of the majority rationale first the dissenters objected generalized concern for student health and safety while bas ic to the schools caretaking was not so immediate as to constitute special need satisfying the veronia analysis nor were they persuaded that drug use by students engaged in extracurricular activities other than athletics such as band and choir exposed them to any greater safety risk than nonparticipants who use drugs in the gene ral student population thus the special susceptibility to drugrelated injury of student athletes apparent in veronia was not factor in this case while voluntary partic ipation in extracurricu lar activities necessarily entailed some additiona l regulation of student conduct justice ginsburg would not equate the situation to student athletic s interscholastic athletics require close safety and health regulation schools choir band nd academic team do not more importantly conceding evidence of some drug use among students at the tecumseh schools the problem was not major as compared to the explosive drug abuse problem sparked by members of athletic teams described in veronia absent drug abuse problem among students participating in extracurricular activities justice ginsburg concluded the intrusion on students privacy was constitutionally impermissible unlike student athletes whose reasonable expectations of privacy are diminished by the communal nature of the sports locker room participants in othe r extracurricular activities do not relinquish all sense of personal privacy to the realities of the sc hool environment student drugtesting proliferated in public schools across the nation after the 1995 veronia decision application of th special needs analysis to programs of increasing scope and variety had largel confounded the lower federal courts which as illustrated above failed to achieve consis tent results even as to sts administered in virtually identical circumstances beyond resolv ing this judicial conflict the majority interpretation of the fourth amendment in pottowatomie county may significantly broaden the discretion of public school officials to perform student searches in the academic setting despite re latively scant record of prior student drug abuse justice thomas opinion emphasizes fairly general cern of the state for student health and safety and an important terrence interest as justif ication for broadly based drug testing program absent from the equation seems to be the risk of serious injury and pervasive history of drug abuse by student at hletes that actuated the courts deliberations in veronia as such the latest opinion may set new constitutional mark blurring any real distinctions for drug testing purposes between high risk students groups and the general school population prior to the tenth circuit decision in tecumseh for examplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21082crs6 11 tannahill ex rel tannahill v lockney independent school district 133 f supp2d 919 ndtex 2001 the sc hool district policy in lockney essentially made random testing prerequisite to attending the public schools any refusal to submit consent form for urine testing subjected the student to the same punishment as positive result twentyone day suspension from all extracurricu lar activities three days of inschool suspension and three sessions of substance abuse counseling all 388 of the secondary school students in the district except for the plaintiff had taken the drug tests 12 see bc v plumas unifie d school district 192 f3d 1260 9th cir 1999 13 chandler v miller 520 us 305 1997a federal district court in texas invalidated universal drug testing

example metal detectors drugsniffing dogs and randomlocker inspections implemented by many school di strict as respons to school violence12 only once has the supreme court found that the govern ment failed to find special need for the particular search at issue georgia state requirement that candidates for certain public offices submit to drug test prior to election13 whatever outer limits there may be to the special needs doctrine however whether as applied to universal st udent drug testing or to other alleged invasions of student privacy in the academic setting will have to await further
