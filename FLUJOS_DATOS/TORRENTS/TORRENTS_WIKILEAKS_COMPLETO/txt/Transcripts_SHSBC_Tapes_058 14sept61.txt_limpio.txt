shsbc 58 goals and terminals assessment lecture given on 14 september 1961 okay this is 14 sept ad 11 saint hill special briefing course and theres nothing much to talk to you about today and probably you should all go home theres hardly anything to learn its too much and besides if you did learn it what could you do with it people would get clear just people would get clear thats all something horrible happen you got new routine that is going to require of you some additional skills and that routine i repeat consists of setting the pc down finding the pcs goal finding the pcs terminal assessing the prehav level and running the prehav level and then assessing for engrams the pc has been in valence in and then handling the various engrams one by one and now we come to question mark how soon we return to the prehav general runs after weve done that its not been determined but ill tell you this youll see pcs needle get awful loose after youve run couple of engrams boy it starts getting awful loose id say offhand it probably depends on the pc to marked degree how many engrams you run him before you run back to the general run of things because after youve run one or two engrams of course the pc is going to be in some sort of well hes going to have all kinds of locks and everything stacked up and whole new set of engrams and you find the pc changes gradiently they lose their chronic somatics at first and then they lose their chronic emotional difficulties and third or fourth engram why they probably lose some other things and start to get down to cases on the thing and then if you do another general run assess again on the prehav level and do the general run on their terminal once more youll probably come up with some more an interesting series of engrams again and then you have to do the same thing theoretically the engrams should run faster and faster they should do better and better and were into phase of it which weve had trouble with before and that is getting somebody to run an engram and we have the answer to that get subjective reality on being in some engrams and you wont have any difficulty running them trying to run an engram without any subjective reality winds up in arc breaks and upsets of magnitude but nevertheless can be done and will have to be done in some places of the world all right now that general rundown of course is flanked by security checks the whole thing is flanked by security checks everything about it running engrams general prehav run terminal checking goals checking just to run it backwards thats all flanked by security checks what ratio of security check and so forth well the more difficult it was to get pc insession the more id concentrate on security check see the more thats proportionate amount if the pc is difficult to get into session or difficult to keep insession i would just come down on that security check with spiked boots because thats where it lies thats where youre going to get the fastest release of anything and if you cant seem to get anyplace on security check there is an extreme form of security check known as the not know version of security checks i wouldnt advise running it now that youre running engrams there is point in running the other because youll run him into two or three different chains if you start running not know you see on engrams and thatll carry forward one set of engrams and then terminal carries forward another set and its all kind of messy and if youre going to run anything like engrams id just run them on the terminal line thats where they appear now lets look it over whats made this whats made this activity possible we were steered widely out of course by auditors taking forever to assess or auditors taking time at all to assess this is lecture is on assessment goals terminal assessment im just following the routine down yesterday i took up security checks today why ill take up goals and terminal assessments we were steered wildly out of our course by auditors number one first instance just assessing i dont know what get some old tomato can off the shelf and gaze at their reflection in it or something and say well thats your goal and thats your terminal and youve had it and then that went to the other aristotelian extreme of well 285 hours later were still assessing for the goal somewhere in between that is the best amount but if you take more than ten or twelve hours for assessing for goal i can tell you very very plainly that your rudiments are out now washington course you know had thirty students and throughout the course in the course of thirty hours they probably only got about thirty hours of auditing per student in that six weeks course on goals and during that thirty hours they found not one goal there was crosschecking on rudiments in that course unlike the 22nd american unlike the south african course similarly very few goals were found on the melbourne course and i dont know positively whether or not they checked rudiments on each other or not but i would say not if they did it was very ineffectual and it boils down to this although the instructors of the washington course are very incredulous they are sort of uhhuughhhgh on the communication lines now well were certain people in the course that we found the goals and terminals on well were the goals and terminals in their first 150 list and you know theyre just just dont believe it they just dont believe it it just is not possible for them to comprehend that every one of their students had their rudiments out now what theyre not estimating is the delicacy of the goal and how rapidly it disappears from sight and youve either got to be very skilled auditor with terrific altitude or youve got to have the rudiments in take your choice i can get goals and terminals with the rudiments out all right thats simply question of altitude the degree of altitude you have over your pc is the degree you can keep him insession and that is the whole story of how to get the goal and terminal but if you sit there and apparently dont know what youre doing and youre very unpositive you know you take the emeter and say well lets see now wheres see the instruction book over here see and so on and so on and so on hmmmhmmmhmmflihffllflmm whats this oh oh i havent got the cans plugged in now here are the these are the what the uh cans i dont know why are these called cans you ask the pc you havent got any altitude anymore its gone you just poured it down the sink and thats the end of it all youve got to do is sit there unconfident and you get an inconfident preclear all youve got to do is look stupid and sound stupid and youll have stupid session as an auditor thats the whole works youve got to know your business and the degree that you inspire confidence in the pc is actually just the degree that you know your business the degree you could do the trs the degree you can do model session the degree of familiarity with which you handle the emeter the positiveness and directness of your questions to the pc these things are all altitude if you want to know what altitude is it has nothing to do with your past record you can have the most marvelous past record in the world and you sit down in front of this pc fumble with the emeter fumble the command be unconfident in your handling of the pc and you have altitude so altitude is never automatic altitude is made and it is made right in session every session by the expertness with which you do the session and if you want altitude all youve got to do is do letterperfect session and thats all there is to altitude because that itself inspires confidence in the pc thats well worth knowing isnt it dont let ever hear you say now any of you well if i were just ron i could get this done in hurry you just say instead well now if i acted like i knew my business well enough i would get this done in hurry okay because look ive got altitude with some of the pullman car porters ive audited they dont know from adam you know lots of the people ive audited they never heard of they never heard of scientology they never nothing yet they respond immediately and at once bang well why why well because i dont fumble thats about the only thing you can say about it also theres very high r i keep very high r in session reality up up up i dont get chatty or nonsensical with the pc but i am apt to be slightly didactic in session not overwhelming but just to keep the r up if i dont think the pc is acting right im liable to ask him why arent you insession you know im sitting there wondering why theyre not insession so i ask him why theyre not insession this rfactor is such tremendous factor and is so little appreciated and so little understood that persons auditing will be incomprehensible to him in that its apparently good with one pc or on one day and not good on another pc or on another day with the same pc you see its his auditing skill is goes over the rolly coaster well thats because his r goes over the rolly coaster his reality on the subject goes over the rolly coaster pc can always tell and so forth well i gave session last night if the pc doesnt mind my remarking on it and the pc was at once struck with the fact that we were not going along as smoothly as we had the session before well theres question about the fact that the r was out but it was out between and the session it wasnt out with much with the pc it was out between and the session now how was it out between and the session i didnt know what the hell to do two nights before i had this pc in an engram night before had the pc perfectly right there had it all spotted and identified all ready to run next session i was going to take it up of course thats little mistake in itself to locate an engram and not run it see but not much of mistake youll find yourself doing it quite often its unavoidable and set the pc down and what do you see well i see blackness whats going on nothing what reactions can guy get on meter nothing i start talking about this incident nothing i get nowhere and i suddenly say where the hell am i and what are we doing well i didnt express it aloud too much and the r went out just like that but i myself was totally baffled what the hell was going on pc was of assistance whatsoever quite quite usual in running the type of engram you run into the pc says well i just dont know and thats it youre not even asking him notknow question i just dont know and then the pc will get restive too when youve located an engram perfectly and the pc right in it and then you hit the same engram and the pc cant find it pc says whats happening well of course to some slight degree they blame the auditor why dont you take and shove into this engram you know thats kind of thing well what engram how could i shove pc into an engram i couldnt locate identify do anything with i mean that engram was szszszsz you say what are you looking at he says im looking at blackness yeah well good now wheres this go to the point where something or other was happening the last time or something like that what do you see nothing blackness well lets see what we can find in this well in the first place youre not youre not looking for needle in haystack person whos looking for needle in haystack is looking for needle see he knows its needle well looking for an engram you dont know what the hell youre looking for lot of the time you just dont know what youre looking for because thats the keynote of an engram dont know pc cant tell you he cant find out on the meter and you yourself dont know now what all right so the rfactor went out and it was little bit difficult to keep the pc insession because my reality factor went out because it startled and then i never remarked on it to the pc see it did startle was the pc in the engram wasnt the pc in the engram had we lost the engram was there something else were we on some kind of chain what was the matter here of course it worked out the pc was in the engram and the engram didnt have anything much about it it was just totally dark it was all black it was black for whole lifetime the pc was blind there were remarkable somatics there was nothing very dramatic except how the pc had lost her eyesight and that was done under an anaesthetic and that was unrecoverable took three hours to run the engram which was kind of championship run and i finally even resorted to lock scanning and some other tricks not lock scanning i scanned the pc through that whole lifetime several times trying to make the pc hang on the point of trauma pc never hung just the pc would keep running into these things and learning more about it and ran emotion and things when were you apathetic yeah you know and so forth ran off emotional curves did everything i could think of and we finally got it and we got it all straight and it was the damnedest story anybody had ever heard of it almost made sick at my stomach but there it was there it was but the rfactor went out basically because i wasnt too frank with the pc because i was taken totally by surprise you find the engram there it is it has the somatics its all properly registered its got picture its got visio theres everything with it and you say well well catch it next session next session what engram where pc was right in it that was the trouble with the whole thing nothing ever happened pc totally dependent on visio visio sonic shut off emotional downcurve everything else all right now i could have done better on this you can always do better you always have sixfoot rearview mirror with tiny little peephole in the front and i could have said well this is awfully odd here its we had it and where is it where is the point we had last night and you know im puzzled about this and possibly the rfactor would have gone up i dont know whether it would have or not but it would have made an easier session well it wasnt difficult to run this session nothing happened except it just wasnt very highpowered session and it took about three hours to run the thing see but i think it would have taken three hours to have run it anyhow because it was whole lifetime from earliest childhood to complete adulthood all blind on pc who was totally dependent on visio well that was rough one to crack not many somatics connected with it nothing very dramatic that way all right the rfactor has great deal to do with this the auditor in this case was suddenly uncertain you wouldnt have been uncertain i had horror when i got halfway through running this how in the name of god one of these auditors in the class would run this thing you know because brother i was using the whole lousy lot you know i was using the whole book of tricks from to izzard you know i was running emotional curves and i was running not know in all different kinds of fashions and i was using scanning not scanning through engrams but scanning through lifetime and you know you scan somebody through lifetime and hell hang up in the moment of trauma see and you say well go to the beginning of this thing now scan rapidly on through to the end of that life and hell hang up in the engram necessary to solve that life you see and the engram was whole lifetime and id never expected this breadth i thought i had about you know i didnt think about it very hard i thought maybe i got an hour or two see an hour or two of lifetime oh nothing like that something on the order of i dont know sixty seventy years pc finally had cognition and the pc exteriorized from the body and could see again why she had the cognition well she said to herself you know well why didnt i do that long time ago you know why did i live that lifetime at all that was what it amounted to but the pc was on chain where the pcs taking it all for granted see it since that chain is very usual to the pc and is very outrageous to the auditor its fantastic see and the pc says oh yes yes something on the order of well they took the empire state building and parked it on cloud and it sailed away you know and the pc is going on with perfectly usual ordinary activities you know so they took drink of water you see is the way it sounds to the pc going through it you see and to the auditor it says well so then they took liquid fire and poured it into everybodys eardrums you see its just going just completely jarred out so the rfactor couldnt have helped but be out in the engram and only somebody with natively high rfactor you might say could have kept it in but i had horrors i said how in the name of god could they run this one in the first place they would have said to the pc what are you looking at oogh and the pc would have said blackness and i dont know and just about ten fifteen minutes with that type of questioning after it you would have been absolutely certain almost all of you would have been absolutely certain there was engram there and the pc is sitting right in the middle of it and you would have gone off and tried to run another engram your pc would have arc broke and that would have been that so it was dynamite situation its tricky its tricky all right well you can confront that in due course but confront first how to find goal and the rfactor is terribly important when you run an engram but it is even more important when you are running goals in the first place homo sap apparently gets in games condition about goals so the rfactor will drop what goals have you had go ahead list your goals i dare you oh oh i tell you auditor reality would have been pretty bad to smother them but auditor reality can be very bad while doing somebody elses goals because its sort of native games condition wont let the pc have goal apparently thats what it adds up to so you just have to overcome this and somehow or another keep high r and do everything youre doing very positively and very confidently and the way to do things positively and confidently is very simple just know your business in order to be positive and confident all you have to do is be superlatively good at your business and what is your business all right this is very simple got to have your trs your model session and know exactly what youre doing with goals assessment if you know those things you look confident and if youre willing to let the pc have goal and if youre having difficulty getting the pcs goal why dont you just ask yourself that question am i let willing to let this pc have his goal why youll find out you can get this goal now that is different approach than rudiments in i just call it to your attention here that this is another approach this comes under the head of altitude how much altitude do you have while youre auditing the pc well you have as much altitude as you are competent and that is all the altitude you will ever have youre competent also in that session your competence cannot go on automatic all right now that is another approach and if you can keep your competence level up and not stumble and bumble about the whole thing and do proper job of it youll find out that the goal doesnt disappear see now youve got another whole angle of it is you buck this up with the rudiments and you make the rudiments very good and you make it so the pc doesnt have any immediate withholds from you pc is willing to talk to the auditor able to talk to the auditor and get those rudiments in get those in real good make sure the pc doesnt have present time problem and so forth you can spend quite bit of time on that and then get your goals assessment done now let call to your attention mistake that was made on the washington course which was just conducted and that is they were evidently from the records mary sue was looking at were doing tremendous amount of security checking under the guise and heading of rudiments now how the hell anybody managed that i dont know but it had nothing to do with the price of fish the withhold that you are looking for while doing the rudiments is the withhold from you personally which will make the pc unwilling to talk to you in the session you arent looking for all of the withholds of the life that is why you run security check entirely independent of your normal sessions you are not trying to do security check while you are doing rudiments and of course you would foul up like mad as much as eighteen hours of the thirty hours devoted to looking for goals in the washington course was devoted to rudiments and that is just balderdash i dont mind saying so but it was all devoted to doing security checks can you think of any better way to deny pc goal isnt that interesting you get up so far in the rudiments and you say well are you withholding anything from something like that and pc doesnt have any fall at all theres reaction and you say well come now you must be withholding something from somebody ah well put it that way yes see youd never get around to doing goals assessment hmhmhmhm smart huh now if you go on past that withhold button you want to know what the pc is withholding from you right now and you see the rudiments are all nownesses the present time of the rudiments and so forth the present time problem as addressed in the rudiments means situation which exists now in the physical universe whether its long or short durations it must have nowness about it now the one thing we have stepped little bit wide from on this is the rudiment concerning arc breaks because youll find that the pc has had limited auditing track very limited auditing track few hundred at most thousand or two at the absolute outside some oldtimer might possibly come around with fifteenhundredhour auditing track in view of the fact that youve got pc who has had many arc breaks with other auditors it is better to ask what havent you been able to tell an auditor and when you see its much better to approach it that way but you will find out that you can also play this one to death after youve done that with pc once and have gotten the backtrack off you should shorten that rudiment to not an auditor what havent you been able to tell when was that see you just cut down your track now the others under the heading sort of crossedup thing of straightening up auditing with the pc at the same time that you were running rudiments so remember that its got double barrel the proper rudiment is just see the rudiments are actually addressed to keeping the auditor insession with the pc reversewise now the auditor has confidence that the pc is not going to go out of session so of course he keeps the pc insession thats the basic purpose of the rudiments nobody laughed it just has to do with that session the rudiments ordinarily have to do with that session that auditor and then on gradient scale its that session that auditor auditors dont go outside the realm of the auditing session or auditing sessions if you really want to start doing fast rudiments and keep them in because thats the rudiments that will be out all youre trying to do with rudiments is not solve case youre trying to set up session so the pc will be in session during that session that is all now you will find it necessary to establish willingness to be pc on lot of people well whats he willing to be and what is he unwilling to be that goes long way that becomes process if you needleflatten it it is adequate for your purposes if you tone armflatten it of course you run the whole case you get the difference between these two things so dont ive altered that little thing in my notes i dont know if i passed it along to you in that form but it is just needleflatten all rudiments rudiments get needleflattened processes get tone armflattened well whats needleflattened well when you dont when you ask the question again do you get needle reaction you dont get needle reaction so you dont ask the question again now thats fairly simple isnt it nothing much to that so lets take look at this and realize that the first and foremost necessity is competent auditor who does know what hes doing and pc who is insession with that auditor even though he might not be insession with some other auditor thats your second requirement and then actually let the pc have his goal dont go catandmousing around about the thing let him have his goal the goal will appear ordinarily in the first 150 and boy that is wide figure i mean that is big figure i think it ordinarily occurs in the first 50 but im just saying 150 just to take care of exceptions let him have it if you havent found it in that length of time then assume one that you apparently havent any altitude with this pc and two that the rudiments are out well now how do you solve the altitude well you solve the altitude with the pc by doing competent job and you get the pc insession of course by getting the rudiments competently done thats all and if i didnt get his goal within the first 150 goals pc gave i would just go back and beat the rudiments to death on whole basis in other words i would i would just hit this willingness to be pc you see with that particular facet whats wrong with the auditor is the unwillingness of the pc to be pc id make sure that the present time problems and so forth were at least kicked out little bit id make sure of all of these various points in the rudiments i would just beat them to death and id go back and do the same goals assessment all over again got it i dont know that i would let somebody else check the rudiments but seem rather dull but you might have somebody else check the rudiments just in case theyre only in with you or something but arent really in with you or some goofball situation like this that you cant quite undo the lock of what is this means the pc has become wary of giving you his goal or the pc has become very distracted from the subject of goals thats all it means you havent got the pcs goal in the first 150 well the pc has become distracted now goals by elimination is perfectly valid way of finding goals but this can be carried to much much too great length you can do goals by elimination just by reading the list each goal once do you realize that read the list over and over and over and youll still do goals assessment by elimination you dont have to add repeater technique to it itll eventually work out actually theres hardly even any time to be won and if you find the pc is getting edgy about repeater technique well just start reading the goals list from beginning to end simple check each one and say well that ones in and that one isnt in and so forth and so on go back to the beginning of it and read the goals list again youll find those that were in have now dropped out and gradually itll boil down to the one thats in and thats it because only one goal is going to register now there is worse crime than doing long goals assessment and finally finding the goal there is worse crime and that is doing stinking lousy hitormiss who cares wrong goals assessment now you can really louse up pc that just wastes the whole works and it does worse than that it actually harms the pc so do careful goals assessment and i wont say then that you should rush the goals assessment up just to get within ten hours or that sort of thing at the end of ten hours youre not sure well keep on going but remember youve already got the pcs goal when youve had the first 150 and thats for sure it would be very unusual and rare case that it went any further than that you keep asking the pc for goals youre just bludgeoning him youre bludgeoning him with more goals you want more goals more goals more goals more goals you can always add goals to the list but dont knock person apart because he cant think of any and that was one of the symptoms that was turning up on these endless assessments auditor would finish the list and then demand more goals hed say well have you got any more goals and the pc would get needle reaction look the needle reaction was on for christs sakes i havent got any more goals see it was needle reaction on an arc break and then the auditor would sit there and say well what is that goal what goal hell i could have given it to him if i had been the pc at the time you see id wring your neck man you see just as blunt as that because thats what it amounts to you get an arc break read and you say well theres more goals and that nonsense can actually continue by actual test for about 150 hours pretty grim huh there arent any more goals all there are are arc breaks but they never get cleaned up dont you see every time your needle falls well you say well there must be more goals but actually its falling on an abc break and the pc does want to find what his goal is so he somehow or another holds him insession and hes more or less on auto by this time see the rudiments are wildly out when you get into this kind of situation sir you go over very elementary routine here and without adding anything much to it why you will find the pcs goal it is of course from my viewpoint im explaining to you how to find white pebble in the middle of black desert you see it just isnt possible for anybody not to be able to do this you know because of that impossibility i eventually had to assign it to that one theres some kind of goals condition going on here which is super games condition its specialized condition that relates to one human being letting another human being have goal and its even gotten into auditing which shocks you know because ive never seen anything else get into auditing like this must be though it was happening all the way around the world the first list of how you got the pcs goal is so simple theres nothing much to it i mean so you got the pc to give you list of goals and then you went over them and found out the one that fell the most and that was the pcs goal auditors couldnt do that dont think they can i dont think they can now because they read cognition surges and all sorts of things on these things pc gets new goal and he gets hell of surge you see hey what do you know i when i was nine years old i wanted to blow up the local bank hey what do you know you know i did you know he gets big fall and the auditor says well thats his goal and writes it down thats it and then says well all right whats the terminal for this who would blow up bank and and whod blow up bank oh uh i guess uh bank robbers uh yeah bank robbers would huh well who else would blow up bank well i guess uh most anybody would blow up bank oh anybody good ill write that one uh uh who whod be capable of blowing up bank well my mother would be ah your mother good thats it and of course they got big fall on it because the person had thats odd my mother it flashes into mind shed blow up bank thats very peculiar and you get big fall you see the falls never repeated by the way the fall would never repeat on the bank and itd never repeat on this terminal so they assess mother on the prehav scale this usually with great care taking eight or nine hours to do this one get all the levels totally reacting you see and then pick out one kind of at random and then run it you know next time they do the assessment why they got 15 levels live and they run on that level for little while next time they do the assessment they got 24 levels live and they do the assessment and run it again and now they got the whole scale live and the pc is spinning in just this is actually the way it was going so i developed assessment by elimination and i found out it worked and proved it out to myself and found out that this was the way it worked and i could do it very easily and it actually made my job easier too and that was dandy and that is to say you took these 30 40 50 60 100 goals the pc gave you and you eliminated them and you found out oddly enough that they would all eliminate every single one of them would eliminate except the pcs goal and i figured well nobody could make mistake doing that so that was released that way and the immediate response to that was to go on doing an endless goals assessment just keep asking for more goals and then more goals and you who were here you know how that was it was it was pretty grim what was this but i was operating on datum that you dont know about and that is that people have been assessed some very rare cases have been assessed to clear without finding the goal they must have been by former auditing you see just within about three or four centimeters of the top and then you did an assessment and they cognited on these things and blew forth to clear it has happened well in view of the fact that it happened i thought this other could possibly happen too then but it didnt and it doesnt and quick recapitulation on the whole thing showed that the goals were always within the 150 and that was it so the upshot of this is that its just assessment by elimination now the person is going to rephrase goals and is going to think of different goals of course you have to put those things down but its mostly when the pc volunteers them that you put those down youre not beating him to death trying to find vast new numbers of goals and youll find that youve got the pcs goal and that thats it because it all eliminated and only that goal is falling now the speed with which you can do this is totally dependent on your skill not the pcs difficulty see youve got big altitude factor youll at once pull this pcs goal up and there itll be you see but if the pcs feeling little bit queasy about goals and is getting arc broke and other things are going off and the rudiments go out all of sudden goal ceases to react evidently its very delicate thing evidently the rudiments out can suppress the goal and in the absence of very much altitude this happens easily you got the pcs goal the pc gave you the goal but it disappears off the meter so do the other goals disappear off the meter everything disappears off the meter why do they disappear off the meter well because the rudiments are out that is all rudiments are out of course altitude has gone to hell and pc isnt insession or anything else so the proper way to do goals list the best way i know of to do goals list at this time is to ask the pc to come to session with list of all of the goals they have ever had and then sit down take the various categories of goals like secret goals withheld goals any other kind of category of goals that you can think of and ask him for few of those and you ask him for few more of those and in the next category and get few of those and run it down so youre not getting wild needle reactions on the thing youll wind up with goals list there that will be maybe maybe as much as 150 maybe as little as 60 or 80 and then having gotten this why you well i just start in doing an assessment by elimination probably the best thing you ought to do in view of the difficulties weve had on it is to check the rudiments now that youve got the goals list check the rudiments and start in from the beginning and just mark the goals that react as you pass them by and some of those goals will be quite null now there are two ways you can do it and both of them are quite valid one you can repeater technique them repeat the goal 2 3 times if its still in leave it and if its gone now scratch it and the other one is just go over the list just read the list one goal after the other goal and those that are still in mark them as still in the next time you read the list those that are out you omit if they all disappear consider that the whole list has been muffed and get the rudiments very thoroughly in and go back over the whole list again just as though youve never assessed now that would give you the pcs goal see i dont think you could miss now once youve got the pcs goal once youve got the pcs goal you want to be very sure that that is it and the way to be very sure is to get somebody else to check it now the way to check goal is to take this goal against some of the others that were reacting last you know some that were still in the last ones that disappeared something like that and read it over in comparison with the ones that were still in you know go by it casually as though its just one of these other goals see not give it undue emphasis and you may be reading 5 6 8 10 goals there you see and you just go over this list read them down see if any of these other goals now react and then find out if that goal is consistently reacting first thing you want to do when youre checking is to check the rudiments and then if the rudiments are out get the pc to go back and get the rudiments put in and then check the goal dont check goals with rudiments out and youll find that the goal if that is the pcs goal will react very nicely and very neatly and thats all there is to it now pcs often get very sure that such and so is their goal and if i catch any student off of this course i dont care you can do it maybe off of course in lower south ambria or something dont for gods sakes qanda with this dont dont qanda with pc please if you learn one thing here please learn dont qanda with the pc the pc says well i just know thats my goal i just know it is i just know it is i just know it is look that had nothing to do with the price of fish the emeter knows maybe its their goal and maybe it hasnt isnt their goal ive had pcs going around this very place saying well thats my goal to blow up the first national bank and thats it we know that yes sir thats my goal there is doubt about that you see and thats out tomorrow that disappears and their goal is something else but they can get hung up on one of these goals but this doesnt mean that because they get hung up on one and keep on telling you that that is the goal that it isnt the goal you see the goal theyre telling you about may be the goal and it may not be the goal thats beside the point works same way with terminals it may be the terminal it may not be the terminal what the pc is telling you had nothing to do about it when you check it out you know what the pc says has nothing to do with it thats all you just never take what the pc says thats all man you just dont do it because youre going to make some serious damned blunder thats going to wind up somebody in one awful mess im not kidding you take the wrong goal just because the pc said it was that well youre playing an awful overt on that pc and you take the wrong terminal just because the pc was absolutely sure that it was bank president that was the terminal yeah who would rob the bank the bank president all right thats it because thats the most logical one of course thats it and so forth well you buy that just because the pc says so you run that on the prehav scale and the next thing you know you have more levels live and you run it on another level and youve got more levels live and youre just making the whole scale go live and what youre doing is bringing into play every bit of the step six phenomena step six phenomena only took place when you were operating with the wrong terminal whole bank beefs up the whole bank goes live if you start running the wrong terminal so its very dangerous thing to do and its not mild thing to do at all and one of the easiest ways to fall from grace on this is to take what the pc says is his terminal regardless of what the emeter says the emeter knows if it doesnt check out on the emeter it isnt it and if it if it fails to check out on the emeter it may still be it but it means just the rudiments are out get the rudiments in itll react now you assess terminal exactly the same way and theres tricky ways of assessing terminals you can ask for both the cause and effect end of the goal now under the heading of terminals cause and effect end of the goal im not scolding you but actually my temper has been sorely tried in the last few months on this subject its looking for this not white pebble its this white mountain in the middle of black desert you see its very simple you just take any goal and it usually has cause and effect you consider the goal causedistanceeffect like communication line dont you see and theres something that does it to something in almost every goal in other words i you see want to rob the first national bank all right theres i who wants to do the robbing and theres the terminal to be robbed see theres two things there so you can get two lists and itll appear on either end but dont worry about that too much and if you find it too difficult to reinterpret just do the simple list you just say well who would rob the first national bank or what would rob the first national bank you see and something on that order there is point however in in avoiding this but you im only reason im putting this reservation in there is because i imagine there can be goals that itd just try your wits trying to find out which is the cause and which is the effect end of the thing like to be myself well who is trying to be what and youve opened up the whole field and youre nowhere of course this is just nowhere goal its quite usual its quite an ordinary goal for pc to wind up with to be myself great who are you now youve got tough terminals run man its tough terminals run youve got not clue nobodys got clue what is the terminal myself who are you thats the obvious thing you have to ask well i who who are you who is trying to be who is the double one see who are you trying to be who see its quite amazing that you can do terminals assessment on it at all yet its very common goal all right now you mustnt omit you mustnt omit things as terminals because to pc here and there youre going to find spacecraft is more real than spaceman and although we have always so far broken the what over to who you know found spacecraft and it wound up to be spaceman i imagine from just that indicator that sooner or later theres going to be what that doesnt break down to who its going to be the first national bank and that is it it isnt any who robbing anything its the first national bank see thats it thats the goal terminal its what weve found enough of them well heres common sort of occurrence on the track fellow is riding around minding his own business in spaceship only blowing up planets and doing other minor things and hardly troubling anybody you see hardly at all and terrific numbers of overts you see and he smashes up spacecraft 1 spacecraft 2 spacecraft 3 spacecraft 4 spacecraft 5 then starts putting spacecraft 6 in danger sort of impulsively and it starts getting chipped up and the next thing you know this fellow will not assess as who this fellow will assess as spacecraft good enough if you cant make it come out to who well its obviously thats it whats he done hes sort of splattered all over spacecraft and is being one now when you realize that body is vehicle this is not as odd as it might look body is vehicle thetan carrier now youve got to use some sense in making terminals assessment but like in doing an assessment on goals you dont prompt you dont prompt just lay off prompting the safest thing to do is to just leave it alone thats the safest thing to do if the pc doesnt say it it isnt said you understand because you can feed him something weird and get reaction on it and it isnt quite right and then you have lot of trouble then you get an arc break and i think most of the arc breaks on goals is prompting see i think that would be the most fruitful source of them so although i have prompted successfully it doesnt mean that it always works he says well i dont know to be denizen of the frozen north yes thats the goal thats the goal youre operating on to be denizen of the frozen north all right and you say all right well give terminal for that its always very safe question uhi cant think of any and you say well who would be denizen of the frozen north well i cant think of any uh well who would occupy the place well cant think of anybody at all oh what temptation at this moment you know to say because you know youve got it on your own branch line of terminals goals terminals you know say the royal northwest mounted policeman well of course the pc has to reject this pc has to reject this and to that degree rejects you as the auditor and every time you give pc suggestion of that character and he has to reject it why you hes thrown you had to throw you out of session in other words he had to go on auto you see to some slight tiny degree and this may be the source of these arc breaks may be straight out of the area of prompting i almost never prompt but ive had four or five auditors sitting behind while i was doing goals assessment on somebody passing notes its his wife you know its his its his wife this isnt distractive at all to the pc you see its his wife they dont realize that its just because im trying to hold the pc insession that i dont turn around to them and say very impolitely why dont you shut up if its his wife its his wife and if it isnt his wife it isnt his wife and that is all there is to it now the auditors phrasing the auditors phrasing of the goal wont run much less assess it wont run its got to be the pcs phrasing of the goal so you start feeding him leads oh wow see youve just opened up the doors to all sorts of errors hes got to reject the auditor he cant rephrase it himself you see so just knock off the prompting and you will be very much happier auditor you know whats wrong with the pc the pc is always looking like this you know always looking like this and he says mmmmmmmm mmmmmm mmmm you know he always does you say he must be robot its very obvious hes robot very very very obvious and he sits there and he cant think of another terminal and he doesnt know what would be in factory see he just hasnt any idea you know what would be in factory factory factory nobody in factories factories are always empty you know and he goes mmmmm hmmm you say god almighty why didnt he fall wise to this thing and terrible temptation you know to say could it be robot could it be robot could it be could it be well he gets all wound up hes got to reject you got to reject you by rejecting the suggestion dont you see and hes got to look at it now hes got to get his own thought channel straightened out and back again he doesnt quite know what hes doing and you can waste half an hour session time just like that bang that is the least that will happen with prompting turns out it wasnt that at all the terminal is derrick hell finally fall wise to it now in view of the fact that the terminal has got lot of notknowingness connected with it dont expect them to come up with rapidity expect lot of comm lags expect lot of comm lags on something of that sort now wherever you have pc in session on goals and terminal assessment your temptation because it is apparently very loose action not very tight auditing situation dont you see he isnt running anything and so on your tendency is to be loose in your auditing you let down your barriers and when you let down your barriers your altitude goes right along with it youve got to be more careful during goals and terminal assessment of proper adherence to professional appearance than in any other auditing situation its obvious that auditors havent done this because theyve taken forever to get terminals and goals so casualness or lack of discipline in carrying out the routine must itself be very poor now there is routine designed that does solely goals assessment i thought of designing one time and i said oh god thats too something or other special model session you see for goals assessment i thought afterwards oh thats going too far man another model session and that sort of thing you dont have to have one but you certainly have to keep up professional demeanor and you have to be very crisp and you mustnt let it down and you must carry it forward competently or the goal will disappear and later on when you get the terminal itll disappear anything is liable to happen in this line so you take your emeter and you put the pc on it and you read things off in very businesslike fashion you acknowledge every time whether the pc speaks or not it is not necessary to have the pc say one single word while youre reading goals or terminals list back to them but always acknowledge as though the pc has spoken always acknowledge you say to rob the first national bank he says absolutely nothing you say thank you sounds kind of odd to you but youll find the pc gets hung up hes kind of answered it dont you know he kind of you know hes thought it now thats enough now for pc to be required to speak or answer up or say very much while youre reading list like this is quite distractive and you think the pc may not be insession so you may be trying much too eagerly to get the pc to look like pc while youre reading this list and its not necessary at all all he does is sit there on total irresponsibility holding the cans thats enough all i expect of pc is the goals list and the terminals list and to sit there in some kind of of state of attention matter how slight thats all i expect of pc in doing goals and terminal assessment you know he isnt supposed to say oh well yes oh rob first national bank well yeah why you just read that goal i see rob the first national bank lets see ill think about robbing the first national bank for moment thats fine oh bunk you dont want to have anything to do with that see so you tell pc before you start reading the list you do not have to speak you do not have to say anything if you dont want to it is only necessary that you sit there and listen to read this list that is the only thing i actually expect you to do and if you want to say something why by all means do so and you just say that to the pc before you start any kind of list and youll find out youll just make left and right you know ram wham wham wham wham right on down the line all right now on reading goals or terminals list you of course read only instant read you do not read latent read if the read takes place more than tenths of second after youve read the goal or terminal it is latent read it must read now and youll find the further the terminal is off the line the further the goal is off the line the further the terminal is off the line if you could time the meter reaction with microsecond meter alongside of it you would find theres direct relationship to how far the goal is off the line to the length of time it takes the emeter to respond unfortunately its measured in microseconds the further it is the slower the read until this gets over to total idiocy you see its dropping fifteen or twenty seconds after youve read the goal why that has nothing to do with it nothing to do with it pay any attention to it it isnt even read its an afterthought remember that the goal and the terminal are the sum and substance of the reactive mind and if anything is going to instant read on meter its the goal and the terminal theyre going to read right now instantly so you ignore latent reads well now to be on the safe side what do we mean by latent read its any read that takes place from onehalf to one second after the question is stated anything that takes place onehalf to one second after the end of the question or the end of the terminal reading is latent read an instant read is anything that takes place up to half second that is just to make very sure that you dont miscalculate it because you can be speaking to somebody who has difficulty with english and youve got little comm lag the comm lag wont be much though that will just be that little splitsecond comm lag youre reading youre doing the goals assessment on somebody from germany and youre doing it in english and their native tongue is german and theyre having difficulty with english and havent spoken it for year or two or something like this and youll find out theres just little wheel turn but youll find out this will occur on everything so that you can quickly measure it up and its more than half second let assure you so that would be for very special case and the more it is close to the goal and the more it is close to the terminal the faster the read is going to occur and as i say if you had microsecond meter you could probably establish goals assessment instantly and immediately by second meter that is sitting alongside of this meter you know plugged into it there was current there after your voice impulse it would be very complicated meter which is why i dont advocate building one it would have to take voice impulse and measure the length of time from the voice impulse to the meters impulse in other words itd be slightly connected to the auditor in that his voice would actuate it and when his voice ceases it would have to instantly measure the length of time from his voice ceasing to the current going through the emeter im merely stating this just as as an indicator youll see this as you get more experience on the thing that its fast its real fast and when youve got the persons goal you say bank pres you got read see you dont even get chance to say bank president bank pres read and its cashier is the next terminal on the thing and you say cashier read see cashier isnt it you could establish that actually with due attention to the emeter but nobody is asking you to do that and that is not part of the routine or regimen its just little indicator that you can some nonsense that you can pay some attention to its not even very valuable nonsense at the moment all right the characteristic of the reactive mind is that it hasnt concept of time that is the first thing that goes out in an engram is the concept of time so that the engram becomes all time so of course that thing which reads with the least time is the most reactive that is the total rationale all right now if youve gone all the way through terminals list and you suspect there may be some more terminals why by all means get some more terminals onto the list but this itself can be defeated activity when you start getting up to hundred or two terminals this just starts getting to be nonsense somebody has missed id go back and i would take the whole group that i had gotten before i noticed the pc was having trouble giving them to id take the earlier group and then i would cover that one with the rudiments in i would get the rudiments thoroughly in and then i would go over it and i would pick the terminal out of it now persons terminal will only bury if the rudiments on the sessions in which it was found were out thats the only thing that will bury it you clean up the sessions itll reappear and therefore youre interested in getting the thing checked basically to find out if it still reads elsewhere now in doing goals and terminals assessments you can run into odd bugs you can run in to some interesting odd propositions where the present time problem of the pc which he doesnt actually realize is getting in the road of his goals assessment and his goals assessment is not his present time problem or something is crisscrossed up like this well it to some degree has something to do with his rudiments being out but that goal which has to do with his present time problem will read sporadically it will read very sporadically itll be in and itll be out and itll be in and itll be out and then itll be out and itll be out and itll be out and then all of sudden its in again and so on its not any instant read connected with the thing thing just lurking so you can suspect that there might have been something wrong with the auditing room or might have been something wrong with the auditor or there might have been something wrong with the sessions present time thats the first thing you ought to suspect on something like that and as i say we had the example of somebody being assessed up on the second british second floor and what do we find we find the persons fear of height was getting this and im i was told afterwards after i mentioned this last time that being audited in the basement had something to do with kicking in dungeons or something of the sort see so that wasnt so good either we still got the persons goal so its all right but present time problem of the auditing environ it wasnt present time problem in life having to do with life or livingness it was just having to do with the auditing environ was kicking in and raising the devil with the goals assessment well actually that should have been discovered on the question is it all right to audit in this room so it goes right straight back to rudiments out see rudiment was out and the rudiment that was there is it all right to audit in this room and that should have been caught and all that difficulty would have been avoided dont you see and you wouldnt have had any questions at all on the thing all right to recapitulate to do an assessment it is best to tell the pc to go off someplace and sit down and you know tonight or something and do full list of goals and you can also give him withheld goals and secret goals or anything else you want to give him on the list and say give goals for all of these subjects and so forth and hell come back with large sheaf of paper and he sometimes has hundred goals on it and then you yourself look at the meter and ask if hes got any more on this subject that subject or the next subject you see and youve made sure that he doesnt have any arc breaks on this and you just drain down the needle reaction and you get few more that he might not have mentioned or might have been too reticent to tell somebody about or something like this and then thats about it just consider well youve got the list all right thats fine now your reading of that list can be done by repeater technique going over and over and over which is the common most accepted way of doing it but which can wind up some pcs in difficulty or just reading the list over and over and every time you get an instant reaction from goal you mark that its still in and you longer get an instant reaction on another goal and you consider its out and you just scratch goals and check goals and scratch goals and check goals and thats all you do then you finally have got it down to the end of the thing you find out youve got two or three reacting and maybe that was the end of that session or something of the sort and catch it the next time and go over that and then maybe go over the whole list again before you get real sure find out if theyre all null you know then you got it down to one goal and theres one goal that just is consistently reacting and it reacts very nicely and very consistently and thats it well get somebody else to check it now if that goal has not appeared the first thing that you must assume is that the rudiments were out in that session so you laboriously put the rudiments in now you put them in with thud dont try to do full security check when you get to withholds but lets find out if there were any withholds while that goals assessment was going on and lets find out if there are any withholds from you particularly you know that kind of thing and get this thing in get it back real good and then do goals assessment from scratch well this is less difficult than youd think much less difficult than youd think because most of them will be out now anyhow and hell only be left with handful of goals and youll come right on back and you will find the persons goal again well what if this happened again well by this time get the rudiments in and do it all over again and set the case up and just keep doing that not getting more and more goals and going on and on and on and on and on with the compounding errors you got it all right now same way with terminal same way with terminal youve got the persons goal youre going to do terminals list i actually dont care what wording you use to do the terminals list theres cause end of the terminals line an effect end of the terminals line there apparently there are two lists but you can get far too mechanical for this and you could say well who wanted to be baseball player fellow says i did well thats not informative because you certainly cant run i as terminal and all right you its an oddity for you to say well whats what would so you call baseball player or what who would play baseball or something like this and you get some more of these and some more of these and some more of these and the reason you do that is because the pcs statement baseball player might be just hair out it may be pitcher you see it may be batsman it might be something else see its just enough out that it wont quite run and you get that thing straightened out and you usually got it but goal of this particular character now im taking somebody elses goal in vain but im sure that she wont mind goal of this character to have particular kind of body well that leaves the doors wide open dont you see whats particular kind of body and you get description of this body what would you call such body you see who would have such body what kind of body is it see that gives you two lists you know who would have it and what is it and you get that list and shake that list down and get that all straight and youve got it made and thats the proper way to do one of these things when youve got that taped it will make considerable difference in your pc and your final tests of the thing are these did it make much difference to your pc that you found that terminal does it make any difference to the pc well if it didnt make much difference to the pc there might be some question on it not enough question on it however but to cause you to do the final test and the final test is such an elementary test that it is hardly even worth describing you assess the pc on the prehav scale and assessing the preclear on the prehav scale you find level for that terminal all right you run that level until the tone arm motion slows down youre not getting very much tone arm motion left sometimes you have to run the level for while to get some tone arm motion to appear but let us say the tone arm motion has appeared and disappeared off the tone arm and you do reassessment well the first time you assess there were only 4 levels live of the prehav scale when you did it and this time you do an assessment and you have 12 levels live on the prehav scale youd better drop that just like hot potato because that is wrong terminal and if you persist in running it any further than that the pc is going to go into the soup so what do you do at this time you get the rudiments in and you do goals assessment using the original list and you find the pcs goal and youre much horrified because its the same goal probably and then you get the terminals assessment on the thing and you will find that that was wrong now it can only be wrong if you did it wrong but something slipped its the wrong terminal and that is positive proof if you want to get good auditor reality on this sometime pick terminal at random on pc you know you pick terminal you know you make up your mind now that this person looks like robot so you say thats fine now were going to run robot on the prehav scale all right now were going to do an assessment on robot would robot be serene and here we go see whichever way you assessed it would robot have faith and i imagine as some academy student is doing probably this very instant is asking somebody would robot have tr 10 go up the list very nicely do proper assessment you will find that the robot will assess by elimination yes the robot does have level thats fine now were going to run this level note carefully however how many levels robot was alive on the prehav scale note that carefully and mark it down an arithmetical number there were 5 levels live on the prehav scale when we assessed robot there are the pencil dots that say which levels were alive there were 5 now were going to run it and we give it 212hour enthusiastic run with all the rudiments in and everything going along just perfect you see and the auditing command perfect fiveleg bracket everything is fine now reassess it on the prehav scale youre going to find about 10 levels live well good they will assess too so you assess those things down to just got 1 level left now were going to take this one level and we make perfect command we get the rudiments in if we can and were going to take this one level and were going to run it on the preclear robot good and were going to run it for 212 3 4 hours oh the preclear will be getting gains pc will be feeling much better odd somatics but very much better not quite sure but probably all right confidence in the auditor you see and now flatten that second one and now you got 5 and 10 written up there in the corner do another assessment on the pc on the prehav scale and youre going to find anything youre not going to find 5 youre not going to find 10 youll be finding 15 or 20 levels live actually works out works out every time its just mysterious little slide empirical fact that moved in sideways on us your arbitrary terminal is not the pcs terminal well you havent heard saying too much lately about auditing prehav 13 little of it goes an awfully long ways why because youre running arbitrary terminals oh yes theyre assessed terminals to some degree
