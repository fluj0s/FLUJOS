enterprises or rural industries absorbed much ex cess labor employing over 130 million rural inhabitants however township enterprises are becoming more mechanized and less labor intensive in order to compete in the market47 in addition according to some economists agricultural mechanization may make an additional 25 of chinas 800 million peasants redundant in the next five years48 the resulting

social instability wh ile state economic and trade commission minister sheng huaren admitted that large protests in some regions have occurred sheng stressed that the government must address the issue immediately to prevent the situation from getting worse and maintain social stability and at the same time appropriately deepen reform61 in june 2001 the communist party central committee published report which warns that relations between party officials and the masses are tense and collective protests are on the rise the report suggests that the anticipated acceleration of economic reforms will lead to even greater social conflict62 studies show that state industrial wo rkers are potentially troublesome for the chinese leadership for three reasons first many of these workers feel bitter about not having benefitted more from the countrys economic boom while still better off than many peasants and rural migrants they have nonetheless suffered from both absolute and relative declines in living standards and socioeconomic status many soe workers are not only materially worse off than they were in the early1990s but also poorer relative to workers in the grow ing private sector their wages are less than twothirds that of workers in priv ate joint venture and foreign companies63 second chinese work units have nurture d strong group ties which are conducive to collective action third most state industr ial workers are literate and live in large urban areas near centers of intellectual activity these factors contribute to feelings of frustration and antigovernmental sentiment the capacity to mobilize and organize effectively for political action and the like lihood of joining dissi dent movements led by intellectuals on the other hand other analysts descri be five principal factors that weaken labor as political force first the ccp and the police are watchful of labor activities in the work unit and elsewher and aggressively suppress independent union activity and political linkages among all social groups second in the past decade the aims of chinese workers have been mainly economic and local in nature their protests generally concern issues of pay and

third the private economy has provided pressure valve for labor discontent allowing many workers to find alternative means of livelihood fourth many analysts argue that chinese workers lack unity some
