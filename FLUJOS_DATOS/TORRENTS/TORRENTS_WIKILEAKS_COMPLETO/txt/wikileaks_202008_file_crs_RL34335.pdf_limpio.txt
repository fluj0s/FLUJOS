power struggles among pr esidents prime ministers and army chiefs military regimes have ruled pakistan directly for 34 of the countrys 60 years in existence and most observers agree that pakistan has sustained history of effective constitutionalism or parliamentary democracy the country has had five constitutions the most recent being ratified in 1973 and significantly modified several times since from the earliest days of independence the countrys armed forces have thought of themselves as saviors of the nation perception that has received significant though limited public support the military usually acting in tandem with the president has engaged in three outright seizures of power from civilianled governments by gen ayub khan in 1958 gen ziaulhaq in 1977 and gen pervez musharraf in 1999

of pakistans three most prominent prime ministers one zulfikar ali bhutto was executed another benazir bhutto exiled then later assassinated and her husband jailed for eight years without conviction and the last nawaz sharif suffered seven years in exile under threat of life in prison for similar abuses before his 2007 return such longstanding turmoil in the governance system may partially

three weeks later mizra was exiled and army chief gen ayub khan installed himself as president while declaring martial law and banning all political parties thus formalizing the militarization of pakistans political system his appointment of senior civil servant as deputy martial law administrator gave some legitimating cast to the event and four years later ayub kh an introduced new constitution that sought to legitimate his rule in the absence of martial law in 1977 and in the midst of political turmoil involving prime minister za bhutto and the pakistan national alliance opposed to him army chief gen ziaulhaq in apparent collusion with conservative islamic groups declared martial law suspended the constitution dissolved the national assembly and took power in bloodless coup he vowed to hold national elections within 90 days but soon rescinded that promise and spent the next 11 years making changes to the pakistani constitution and system of governance that would ensure his continued hold on power two of the three coups détat zia in 1977 and musharraf in 1999 were entirely extraconstitutional in nature see robert stern democracy and dictatorship in south

numerous and serious political crises culminating in the december 27 assassination of former prime minister and leading opposition figure benazir bhutto who had returned to pakistan from selfim posed exile in october bhuttos killing in an apparent gun and bomb attack the circumstances remain controversial has been called national tragedy for pakistan and did immense damage to already troubled efforts to democratize the country pakistans security situation has deteriorated sharply the federal government faces armed rebellions in two of the countrys four provinces as well as in the federally administered tribal areas fa ta the country experienced about 44 suicide bomb attacks in the latter half of 2007 that killed more than 700 people 4 the country is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections in february 2008 pakistan now suffers from considerable political uncertainty as the tenuous governance structure put in place by president musharraf has come under strain musharraf himself was reelected to second fiveyear presidential term in controversial october 2007 vote by the countrys electoral college and under mounting domestic and international pressure he finally resigned his military commission six weeks later yet popular opposition to military rule had been growing steadily with series of political crises in 2007 bungled attempt by musharraf to dismiss the countrys chief justice supreme court rulings that damaged musharrafs standing and credibility constitutional questions about the legality of musharrafs status as president return to pakistans political stage by two former prime ministers with considerable public support and the pressures of impending parliamentary elections now set for february 18 2008 the catastrophic removal of benazir bhutto from pakistans political equation dealt serious blow both to the cause of pakistani democratization and to us interests on november 3 2007 president musharraf had launched second coup by suspending the countrys constitution and assuming emergency powers in his role as both president and army chief the move came as security circumstances deteriorated sharply across the country but was widely viewed as being an effort by mushar raf to maintain his own power his government dismissed uncooperative supreme court justices including the chief justice and jailed thousands of opposition figures and lawyers who pposed the abrogation of rule of law it also cracked down on independent media outlets many of which temporarily were shut down the emergency order was lifted on december 15 but independent analysts find little evidence that the orders lifting has led to meaningful change given what they see as repressive media curbs and stacked judiciary on the day before his action musharraf issued several decrees and made 4 see the south asia terrorism portal database at ht tpwwwsatporgsatporgtpcountriespakistandatabase fidayeenattackhtm

government or to boycott the process in protest following bhuttos assassination and ensuing civil strife the election commission chose to delay polls until february 18 the decision was criticized by the main opposition parties which accuse the government of fearing major loss but which have chosen to participate as musharrafs political clout has waned the ruling musharrafallied pmlq party faces

madrassas that gave rise to the afghan taliban movement pakistans islamist parties are conservative advocates of central role for islam and sharia islamic law in national governance they also oppose

showing has in the past been quite limited they won only two parliamentary seats in the 1993 and 1997 elections and gained about 11 of the total vote in 2002 their best national showing ever the mma spent the period 20022007 as the dummy opposition in islamabadnominally opposed to the musharraf government at the center but allowing for musharrafs controversial constitutional changes in 2003 and enjoying provincial power in pakistans two western provinces including in outright majority in the north west frontier and in coalition with the nationally ruling pmlq in baluchistan 22 this allowed for what many observers called an intentional marginalization of pakistans nonislamist opposition parties in 2007 the mma became weakened by the increasingly divergent approaches taken by its two main

directly opposing views on the wisdom of participating in upcoming elections the mma all but formally split diminishing its prospects for holding power in pakistans two western provinces still the jui
