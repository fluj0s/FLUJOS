under the foreign sovereign immunities act the fsia and statutory exception to immunity applies 2 subject matter jurisdiction over the saudi charity and saudi princes acting in their official cap

the saudi defendants3 this report examines the legal bases for those dismissals overview of the foreign sovereign immunities act the foreign sovereign immunities act the fsia applies to all foreign states and their agents and instrumentalities4 immunity for sovereign nations against suits in us courts has long history and is based on the principle that conflicts with foreign nations are more effectively ddressed through dipl omatic efforts than through judicial proceedings5 congress passed the fsia to codify these long standing principles and to clarify limitations on the scope of immunity that had emerged in international practice6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34726crs2 6 continued 2356 discussing congresss intention to codify an understanding of immunity as restricted to public

litigation since congress added the exception to the fsia in 1996 the exception has also spurred legal disputes over attachment of assets as result it has been amended several times most recently by section 1083 of the national defense authorization act for fy2008 which added provisions regarding attachment of foreign assets to facilitate satisfaction of money continuedthe fsia contains both general presumptive rule against litigation in us courts and number of exceptions permitting suits as general rule foreign states together with their agents and instrumentalities are immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and from the states7 however the fsia authorizes jurisdiction over foreig n nations in several exceptions8 namely foreign state is not immune from us courts jurisdiction where 1 the foreign state has waived its immunity9 2 the claim is specific type of admiralty claim10 3 the claim involves specified commercial activities11 4 the claim implicates property rights connected with the united states12 5 the claim arises from tortious conduct that occurred in the united states13 6 the claim is made pursuant to an arbitration agreement14 or 7 the claim seeks money damage s against designated state sponsor of terrorism for injuries arising from terrorist act15 the exception for designated state sponsors of terrorism removes immunity for

state courts occasionally hear cases involving foreign defendants cases involving foreign states or foreign officials are usually removed to federal courts under 28 usc 1441d for this reason this discussi on focuses on jurisdiction in federal courts 20 28 usc 1332a 21 28 usc 1330a 22 see republic of austria v altmann 541 us 677 691 2004 at the threshold of every action in district court against foreign state the court must satisfy itself that one of the the fsia exceptions applies as subjectmatter jurisdiction in any such action depends on that application quoting verlinden v cent bank of nigeria 461 us 480 49394 1962only to countries designated by the us department of state as state sponsors of terrorism17 this list currently includes cuba iran sudan and syria18 jurisdiction in cases ag ainst foreign defendants before asserting jurisdiction to accept case federal court19 must establish its authority over the dispute involved and the parties to the litigation in other words courts must assert both subject matter jurisdiction over each claim and personal jurisdiction over each defendant in case for cases involving foreign defendants the analyses for subject matter and persona l jurisdiction differ according to whether the fsia applies subject matter jurisdiction for claims by us plaintiffs against foreign nonstate defendants to whom the fsia does not apply for example claims against individuals or corporations federal law authorizes subject matter jurisdiction as long as the am ount in controversy exceeds 7500020 in contrast for claims against foreign states and their instrumentalities the fsia is jurisdictional gatekeeper the fsia denies subject matter jurisdiction over claims against foreign defendants entitled to immunity21 conversely the fsia authorizes subject matter jurisdiction over claims in which foreign state would be entitled to immunity under the fsia but for the application of an exception22 personal jurisdiction personal jurisdiction is the second threshold hurdle for assertion of judicial authority in cases involving foreign defendants whereas subject matter jurisdiction governs courts power over particul ar claims personal jurisdiction governs courts pow er over particular defendant s thus even if courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34726crs4 23 in rem jurisdiction is an alternative jurisdicti onal basis permitting suits in some admiralty cases and in cases in involving immovable property in rem jurisdiction does not authorize judicial power over particular defendants rather it provid jurisdiction over property located in the united states as practical matter in rem jurisdiction is unlikely to serve as basis for defendant to which the fsia applies because the fsias exceptions effectively cover in rem jurisdiction for this reason in permanent mission of india to the united nations v city of new york case involving real property located in the united states the supreme court essentially ignored any potential analysis of in rem jurisdiction and focused instead on the interpretation of the property exception under the fsia 127 sct 2352 2007 24 28 usc 1330b 1608 25 fed r civ p 4k however most us states socalled longarm statutes extend personal jurisdiction to the extent authorized under the us cons tituti on thus in many cases identical statutory and constitutional anal yses apply to personal jurisdiction questions 26 intl shoe co v washington 326 us 310 316 1945 int ernal quotations omitted 27 helicopteros nacionales colombia v hall 466 us 408 416 1984 internal quotation marks omitted 28 id at 414 n8establishes jurisdiction over the subject matter of claim it cannot exercise its authority over defendant for w hom it lacks personal jurisdiction23 personal jurisdiction requires both statutor authority and satisfaction of fifth amendment due process standards as w ith subject matter jurisdiction statutory authority for personal jurisdiction over fore ign defendants follows one of two distinct routes according to the fsias applicati on if the defendant is foreign state or its agent or instrumentality personal jurisdiction is statutorily authorized under the fsia if subject matter jurisdiction is established24 alternatively for defendant who is not foreign state or its agent or instrumentality the ordinary procedure for obtaining statutory authority for personal jurisdiction applies typically federal court must find statutory authority for personal jurisdic tion in the laws of the state in which it sits25 however constitutional limits apply regardless of statutory basis for personal jurisdiction under the due process clause personal jurisdiction is constitutional if 1 defendants have had certain minimum contacts with the judicial forum attempting to assert jurisdic tion and 2 asserting such jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice26 the type and quantity of contacts necessary to constitu minimum contacts differ according to the type of personal jurisdiction general or specific that applies general jurisdiction which allows court to exercise jurisdic tion over foreign defendant for any claim does not require contacts related to the specific claim in the case but instead requires continuous and systematic contacts with forum27 conversely specific jurisdiction which limits courts jurisdic tion over defendant to claims in particular case involves continuous and systematic requi rement instead it requires that defendants contacts with the forum relate to or arise out of the claim at issue in the case28 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34726crs5 29 538 f3d 71 30 id at 7576 31 id at 78 32 id at 75us court of ppeals decision in in re terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 in august 2008 the us court of ppeals for the second circuit affirmed dismissals of claims against the kingdom of saudi arabia saudi charity saudi princes and saudi banker in in re terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 29 plaintiffs in the case are victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks they alleged that the saudi defendants d supported qaedas financ ial backers prior to the attacks and were therefore civilly liable for plaintiffs injuries however the court of appeals did not reach the merits of these allegations instead the court held that us courts lack jurisdiction over the claims against the saudi defendants30 the legal bases for this holding were lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia and lack of pe rsonal jurisdiction the most significant aspects of the court of appeals opinion we re interpretations of the fsia namely 1 its interpretation of agent or instrument ality under the fsia as extending both to the saudi charity and to individuals sued in their official capacities and 2 its interpretation of the comme rcial activities and torts exceptions under the fsia as having narrower scope than plaintiffs had advocated the courts holding facilitates relatively broad scope of foreign sovereign immunity and therefore relatively narrow scope of subject ma tter jurisdiction over foreign officials and governmentcontrolled entities this decision is generally in line with other circuit court rulings in additi on language within the opinion reflected the courts deference to the fsias underlyi ng emphasis on resolving disputes with foreign actors through diplomatic rather than judicial channels background in re terrorist attacks is case consolidated for pretrial purposes in the us district court fo r the southern district of new york31 the second circuit court of appeals opinion review ed dismissals of only subset of the claims at issue in the case plaintiffs in in re terrorist attacks are individuals and businesses injured by the september 11 terrorist attacks they brought claims based on state and federal tort law and various federal laws including the torture victim protection act for injuries suffered as result of the attacks32 the dismissed claims fall into four categories 1 claims against the kingdom of saudi arabia 2 claims against four sa udi princes in their official capacities 3 claims against the saudi high commission for relief to bosnia and

capacities33 underlying all of the claims was the alle gation that defendants had played critical role in the september 11 attacks by fundi ng muslim charities that in turn funded qaeda34 the court affirmed dismissals of the first three sets of claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia because the fsia precludes courts from asserting jurisdiction over claims against foreign stat one of the fsia exceptions must apply before us court may assert jurisdicti on over the kingdom of saudi arabia or any of its agencies or instrumentalities as discussed below th second circuit held that none of the fsia exceptions applied the fourth set of claims those broug ht against princes in their personal capacities fell outside of the scope of the fsia nonetheless as discussed below the court dismissed those claims fo r lack of personal jurisdiction charity and princes as agents and instrumentalities of the kingdom because foreign states agent or instrumentality is entitled to the same immunity to which its state itself is entitled under the fsia key threshold question was whether the shc and the princes sued in their official capacities qualified as agents or instrumentalities under the fsia the fsia defines agency or instrumentality as any entity which is 1 separate legal person corporate or otherwise 2 an organ of foreign st ate or political subdivi sion thereof or majority of whose shares or other ownershi p interest is owned by foreign state or political subdivision thereof and 3 not us citizen or created under the laws of third country35 the shc charity whether the shc was an agent or instrumentality turned on whether it was an organ of the kingdom of saudi arabia36 the court applied multifactor test derived from prev ious second circuit decision and from decisions from other circuits to deter mine whether shc was such an organ37 specifically the court applied the following five criteria 1 whether the foreign state created the entity for national purpose 2 whether the foreign state actively supervises the entity 3 whether the fo reign state requires the hiring of public employees and pays their salaries 4 whether the entity holds exclusive rights to some right in the foreign country and 5 how the entity is treated under foreign state law38 emphasizing that the saudi govern ment had formed shc and paid

council of islamic affairs the body responsible for monitoring and approving i slamic charitable giving both within and outside the kingdom and the fourth prince is the shcs president in addition to his roles as provincial g overnor and crown prince41 although several other federa l courts of appeals have ruled on the extension of foreign sovereign immunity to foreign offici als treatment of officials under the fsia was question of first impression for the second circuit42 raising number of textual arguments and referencing the fsias legislative history the court held that individuals acting within their official capacities are indeed agents or instrumentalities of their states and are therefore entitled to immunity under the fsia to the same extent as their states43 the court noted that at the time the fsia was enacted congress expresse d desire to codify common law principles one of which was that immunity extends to states officials44 the court also emphasized the potential erosion of immunity for foreign states if immunity extended only to government actions distinct from the actions of officials as individuals noting that the state cannot act ex cept through individuals45 the second circuit court of appeals holdi ng is consistent with the conclusions of five of the six other federal courts of appeals that have considered whether an individual may be protected as an agent or instrumentality46 only the court of appeals for the seventh circuit reached the opposite conclusion in enahoro v abubakar the seventh circuit rejected military junta generals immunity claim47 focusing on the text of the fsia the enahoro court held that the phrase separatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34726crs8 48 id at 88182 49 id given that the phrase corpor ate or otherwise follows on the heels of separate legal person we are convinced that the latter phrase refers to legal fiction business entity which is legal person if congress meant to include individuals acting in

together with l ack of statutory refere nces to individuals suggested lack of congressional intent to extend immunity to individuals48 specifically it held that if congress had intended separate legal person to encompass individuals it would have used more natural language rather than phrase often intended in law to refer to corporations49 in in re terrorist attacks the second circuit characterized the seventh circuit as an outlier on this issue50 relevant fsia exceptions after holding that the fsia applied not only to the kingdom of saudi arabia but also to saudi officials and the shc as an agency or instrumentality of the kingdom the court of appeals next examined whether any fsia exception applied first the court held that the terrorist state exception did not apply because the us state department has not designated the kingdom of saudi arabia as state s ponsor of terrorism51 next although the court found two other exceptions the commercial activity and torts exceptions potentially relevant52 neither exception applied to the saudi defendants commercial activities exception to support their argument that the commercial activities exception should pply to the saudi defendants the in re terrorist attacks plaintiffs characterized defendants charitable contributions to muslim groups as form of money laundering53 the court rejected this characterization as incompatible with th supreme courts interpretation of the commercial activities exception the fsia defines commercial activity as regular course of commercial conduct or particular comme rcial transaction or act54 the court noted the circularity of this definition and relie d upon the us supreme courts definition of commercial activityfor the context of the fsia exception as the type of actions by which private party engages in trade and traffic or commerce55 under this definition the court noted that the ppropriate focus in termining whether an action constitutes commercial activity is on an actions nature rather than its purpose with this framework the court upheld the district courts finding that defendants charitable cont ributions fell outside the scope of the commercialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34726crs9 56 because it determined that the contributions fell outside of the scope of commercial activities the court did not decide whether m oney laundering or other criminal acts could constitute commercial activities under the fsia id at n17 57 id at 87 58 id at 88 59 id at 96 60 id at 9395 61 id at 9495 62 idactivities exception by reason of their non commercial nature re gardless of the contributions alleged money laundering purpose56 torts exception finally the court rejected the torts exception as inapplicable to claims against the saudi defendants sp ecifically the court noted that congresss purpose in enacting the torts exception was to create liability for incidents such as traffic accidents that occur in the united states57 furthermore the court was concerned about the effect that an expa nded torts exception would have on the other fsia exceptions it emphasized that if the exception were expanded to include all conduct conceivably characteriz ed as tortious the torts exception would vitiate the terrorist state exceptions limitation to designated terrorist states58 princes sued in their personal capacities for claims made against saudi banker and against seve ral saudi princes for actions taken in their personal capacities subject matter jurisdiction was not precluded by the fsia however the court upheld the district courts determination that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the saudi defendants sued in their personal capacities59 specifically the court concurred with the district courts finding that the princes sued in their personal capacities lacked sufficient contacts with the forum to permit personal jurisdiction under the cons titutional minimum contacts standard plaintiffs argued that the minimum contacts test was satisfied because the defendants had purposefully directed activity at the judi cial forum by supporting the attacks the court rejected this argume nt acknowledging that it had been successful argument in cases where defendants were primary participants in the terrorist acts but holding that the banker and princes activities were too attenuated from the actual attacks to satisfy due pro cess requirements60 similarly the court rejected the plaintiffs argument that potential foreseeability of the terrorist attacks was sufficient basis for establishing minimum contacts61 it noted that foreseeability alone is insufficient to pass constitutional muster for personal jurisdiction instead the constitutional standard requires intentiona l conduct expressly aime d at residents in the forum62httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34726crs10 63 id at 90conclusion in in re terrorist attacks the us court of appeals for the second circuit joined several other federal courts of appeals which have interpreted the fsias agent or instrumentality definition as encompassing foreign individuals sued in their official capacities the court also adopted narrow interpretations of the commercial activities and torts exceptions under the fsia those threshold interpretations undergirded th courts legal bases for di smissing claims against various saudi defendants for lack of jurisd iction thus the court of appeals decision restrains efforts by september 11 victims and other plaintiffs seeking recovery in us courts against foreign officials and governmentcontrolled entities like the saudi charity despite its impact on the plaintiffs th courts opinion emphasized that lack of judicial jurisdiction under the fsia should not necessarily exculpate foreign nations or their agents and instrumentalities from suffering consequences as result of supporting heinous acts the court noted that deterrence or punishment does not begin and end with civil litigation brought by individual plaintiffs our government has other means at its disposal sanctions trade embargos diplomacy military action to achieve its foreign policy goals63 in this way the in re terrorist attacks opinion appears to correspond with c ongressional intent in enacting the fsia
