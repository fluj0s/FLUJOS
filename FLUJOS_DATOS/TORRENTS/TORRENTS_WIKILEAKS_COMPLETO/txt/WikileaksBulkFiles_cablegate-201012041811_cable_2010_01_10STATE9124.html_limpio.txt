persuade irans engagement on its nuclear program classified by nea assistant secretary jeffrey d feltman for reasons 14 b and d ref state 120288 1 u this is an action request please see paragraphs 25 summary 2 c the united states along with its partners has made an unprecedented effort to engage iran in an effort to diplomatically resolve the international communitys concerns with irans nuclear program irans lack of constructive response so far and its continued reluctance to cooperate with international efforts to build confidence and transparency in its nuclear program demand response department requests posts to draw on the attached narrative to explain our rationale for why sharpening the choice that iran faces by increasing pressure is necessary at this point and to secure the cooperation of host governments in these efforts end summary objectives 3 c for all posts except moscow paris beijing london and berlin please draw on narrative beginning in paragraph 11 to highlight us efforts to mobilize diplomatic engagement with iran in 2009 underscore the lack of meaningful iranian response to those efforts especially since the p51 political directors meeting with iran in geneva on october 1 2009 outline us view of next steps including increasing pressure on iran and seek enhanced bilateral cooperation to increase pressure 4 c for moscow paris beijing london and berlin posts may share the general tenor of our message but do not need to deploy the points themselves with host governments 5 c points should be deployed by ambassadors to most appropriate senior counterparts posts may not leave any part of this message in writing with host governments deadline 6 u posts should report any substantive response to their efforts by february 3 elisa catalano neafo catalanoestatesgovgov 6479533 and richard nephew isnra nephewrmstatesgovgov 6477680 are the departments pocs background 7 sbu with its p51 partners the us has been pursuing policy towards iran that includes engagement state 00009124 002 of 006 and incentives as well as pressure since the 1 october 2009 meeting of the p51 political directors and representatives from iran the united states has been working closely with its partners to engage with iran to build international confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear program based on the agreement in principle reached with iran in geneva we have focused on supporting the iaeas proposal for refueling the tehran research reactor trr facilitating the iaeas investigation of the previously clandestine uranium enrichment plant at qom and pressing for followon meeting between p51 political directors and iranian representatives explicitly on irans nuclear program 8 c the results since october 1 have been disappointing iran has not accepted the iaeas trr proposal instead iran has rejected series of updated and more flexible proposals from the iaea and our partners on some terms of the proposal ref and has offered substantially different counterproposal which fails to address the concerns about its nuclear program does not fulfill the objective of building confidence in irans nuclear intentions and as eu high representative lady ashton described in effect rejects the iaeas proposal iran has also announced its intent to expand its nuclear program including its intention to start enriching uranium to higher levels to make its own trr fuel if its terms are not accepted on the fuel deal although iran granted iaea access to the facility at qom its cooperation was limited and there remain serious questions about irans intentions for the facility which is in open defiance of five security council resolutions finally iran to date has gone back on its earlier commitment to meet again with the p51 to discuss its nuclear program 9 sbu former iaea director general elbaradei released his latest report on iran on november 16 2009 and the iaea board of governors bog adopted resolution on iran on november 27 2009 the resolution notes the board of governors serious concern that iran continues to defy the requirements and obligations contained in unsc resolutions and iaea resolutions the board of governors also expressed its serious concern that contrary to the request of the board of governors and requirements of the security council iran has neither implemented the additional protocol nor provided the access necessary for the iaea to provide assurance as to the absence of additional undeclared nuclear activities 10 u president obama secretary clinton and other p51 leaders identified the end of 2009 as key period for assessing irans responsiveness while the offer of engagement remains on the table we have begun to work with partners to prepare new measures to increase pressure on iran diplomatic policy narrative 11 u begin talking points overview where weve been and where we are the president made clear his readiness to open new page in our relations with iran based on mutual respect this new approach featured our offer to engage iran directly as well as our readiness to become full and active participant in the p51s efforts to resolve international concerns about irans nuclear program through negotiations we stated clearly our support for irans right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy provided iran meets its state 00009124 003 of 006 international obligations and carries out its responsibilities within the npt framework when we met with the iranian delegation in geneva on october 1 along with our p51 partners we sought irans commitment to three concrete actions which would demonstrate its intentions for its nuclear program support the iaeas proposal for refueling the tehran research reactor facilitate the iaeas full investigation of the previously clandestine uranium enrichment plant at qom agree to followon meeting between p51 political directors and iranian representatives by the end of october explicitly focused on nuclear issues but also open to discussion of any issues raised by any party each of these agreed actions presented iran with an important opportunity to begin to assure the international community about its intentions for its nuclear program and to pursue together diplomatic resolution to our differences iran has not followed through on any of these three commitments president obama also stated last year that we would continually assess irans responsiveness to these offers and that the end of the year would present key period of assessment it is increasingly clear that iran has not taken advantage of the opportunities we have offered year into the obama administration iran has not taken practical concrete steps that would begin to create confidence in its nuclear intentions iran continues to enrich uranium despite unsc requirements that it suspend such operations revealed it had been building secret uranium enrichment facility at military base near qom in violation of its safeguards agreement and security council resolutions continues to refuse cooperation with the iaea in addressing the full range of iaea questions about the peaceful purposes of its nuclear program has not accepted the iaea proposal to refuel the trr which was response to an iranian request despite us and our partners significant efforts to be flexible and address iranian concerns with the deal and since meeting with representatives of the five permanent members of the security council and germany in geneva on october 1 has refused all subsequent efforts to schedule another meeting to discuss its nuclear program iran has not been able to say yes to balanced iaea proposal that would provide fuel for its tehran research reactor and begin to build mutual trust and confidence notably by transferring 1200kgs of its low enriched uranium abroad as an indication of irans peaceful nuclear intent underscoring the significance of the iaeas trr proposal in november 2009 former iaea dg elbaradei said that the proposal had extensive builtin guaranteesthe russians are guaranteeing implementation state 00009124 004 of 006 the americans are ready for the first time to guarantee the implementation the iaea will take custody of irans material so the international community as whole will guarantee implementation on irans desire to retain possession of its nuclear material under delivery of the fuel which is the basis of irans counterproposal dr elbaradei rejected this approach saying publicly in november after iran first raised this idea that this would defeat the whole purpose of the iaeas agreementthis is not solution while it allowed iaea inspectors to visit its newly revealed enrichment site near qom it did not provide the iaea with the full access the organization requested notably by agreeing to the iaeas request for access to specific iranian nuclear officials and answering iaea questions regarding the history and purpose of the facility the clandestine construction of this facility was inconsistent with irans iaea safeguards agreement and is in open defiance of security council resolutions as the iaea reported in november 2009 iran continues to develop its nuclear program regardless of international concerns and iaea npt and unsc requirements most starkly in its construction of secret uranium enrichment facility at military base near qom as former director general elbaradeis report on november 16 outlines this facility and the circumstances surrounding it raises the persistent question of additional such undeclared facilities the iaea report makes clear that iran has failed to cooperate fully and transparently with the iaea answering questions about the use of this facility and the possibility of other facilities iran has failed to take advantage of the creative trr proposal engage with us constructively on other elements of its nuclear program and cooperate fully with the iaea it also still defies unsc requirements that it suspend its enrichment program instead announcing an expansion of its nuclear program even more it is threatening to begin enriching its leu to higher levels of enrichment if the international community does not accept trr deal on its terms terms that would not build confidence as they would reduce and delay transfers of leu from iran irans continued nuclear activities and its refusal to engage meaningfully with the international community risks possible arms race in the region and undermines the global international nonproliferation regime as whole as you know israel has stated that an iran with nuclear weapons poses great threat to its security and that it reserves the right to defend itself we believe irans continued noncompliance with its international obligations regarding its nuclear program poses serious threats to stability in the region presenting iran with united global front is the best avenue to resolve the iranian nuclear issue through diplomatic means in addition to its disregard of its nuclearrelated obligations iran continues to support terrorist organizations like hamas and hezbollah and militant groups in iraq it also provides some support to the taliban to facilitate attacks against isaf forces in afghanistan also of deep concern to the international community is the dramatic uptick in repression inside iran as secretary clinton said recently we are deeply disturbed state 00009124 005 of 006 by the ruthless repression that iran is exercising against its citizens who seek to exercise their universal right to free expression and assembly the pressure aspect of the strategy making the case the two elements of the p51 strategy engagementincentives and pressure were always intended to run in parallel because without credible threat of consequences it is unlikely that iran will make strategic or even tactical change in direction for that reason we have always recognized the possibility that we would need to increase pressure to sharpen the choice that iran faces in order to persuade iran that the international community is serious still our emphasis over the course of this year has been on outreach and engagement rather than pressure unfortunately to date iran has failed to respond constructively pressure is not an end in itself it is means to encourage iran to recalculate costs and benefits and to return to course of constructive engagement at the negotiating table but without unmistakable and meaningful consequences there seems little prospect for such return the international community has already imposed strict measures on iran via various multilateral fora to demonstrate that iran cannot ignore its responsibilities without cost we believe more aggressive enforcement of this existing and robust international framework along with the application of significant additional pressure will illustrate to iran the sharp choices it faces should it continue to rebuff efforts to resolve our differences diplomatically unity among members of the international community is absolutely essential to demonstrate to iran that there are serious consequences for its continued refusal to engage constructively with the international community over its nuclear program such unity was clear when the iaea board of governors adopted its iran resolution in november it was also clear in the european councils declaration on iran issued in december both were useful and immediate opportunities to increase pressure on iran we believe irans continued noncompliance regarding its nuclear program deserves the full and urgent attention of the international community next steps we stand behind our offer to engage with iran but we are rapidly approaching the moment when we will have to give full meaning to all elements of our strategy we along with our partners believe that the time has come to increase pressure on iran such pressure is necessary to uphold the integrity of the unsc and iaea and demonstrate that continued noncompliance has consequences the us believes that multilateral pressure would be best achieved through new security council action and swift implementation of that action however action alone may not be sufficient to persuade iran to change course there is much more that can and should be done immediately to implement measures already required under the existing international sanctions framework we therefore ask our partners to state 00009124 006 of 006 ensure that we are collectively enforcing all those measures that are already in place as comprehensively as possible we regret that iran has missed repeated opportunities for meaningful engagement our intent is not to escalate conflict but to press for diplomatic resolution inaction is what the iranians are hoping for as they draw closer to achieving nuclear weapons capability on january 16 we and our p51 partners met to take stock and discuss next steps regarding iran as the chairs statement reflects we agreed that iran has failed to follow up on the key understandings reached in our meeting with the iranian delegation on october 1 2009 we are united and remain committed to our approach while we will continue to seek negotiated diplomatic solution we believe it is time for consideration of appropriate further measures we are here today to intensify our consultations with you as one of our partners in the international community on next appropriate steps aimed to persuade iran to bring its nuclear program into full compliance with its international obligations we urge these steps with steady determination that we must do everything we can including applying greater pressure to encourage iran to return to constructive course of engagement for eu member states useu and tokyo only as we move ahead with and beyond the process we also will want to work with you to agree on additional actions we could take on coordinated national basis to magnify the impact of new security council resolution and demonstrate to iran our seriousness of purpose clinton
