exploration on january 14 2004 president bush announ ced new goals for nasa the vision for space exploration the president directed nasa to focus its efforts on returning humans to the moon by 2020 and some day nding them to mars and worlds beyond twelve us astronauts walked on the moon between 1969 and 1972 humans have visited mars the president further directed nasa to fulfill commitments made to the 13 countries that are its partners in the in ternational space station iss in the nasa authorization act of 2005 pl 109155 cong ress endorsed the goals of the vision and directed nasa to establish program to accomplish them the nasa authorization act of 2008 pl 110422 reaffirms this endorsement and expre sses the sense of congress that other countries should be invited to par ticipate in the moonmars program as part of an international initiative under us leadership nasa is developing spacecraft called orion formerly the crew exploration vehicle and launch vehicle for it called ares i formerly the crew launch vehicle an initial operating capability ie first flight into earth orbit with crew on board is planned for march 2015 with the ability to take astronauts to and from the moon following later than 2020 nasa stresses that its strategy is to go as we can afford to pay with the pace of the program set in part by the available f unding most funding for the vision is being redirected from other nasa activities the space shuttle program w ill be terminated in 2010 and us use of the iss will end by 2017 nasa has not provided cost estimate for the vision as whole its 2005 imple mentation plan estimates that returning astronauts to the moon will cost 104 billion not including the cost of robotic precursor missions and that using orion to service the iss will cost

exploration systems mission direct orate esmd is responsible for implementing the moonmars program the fy2009 request for esmd is 3500 billion the house and senate committees r ecommended 3506 billion and 3530 billion respectively pl 110422 authorizes 3886 billion in baseline funding plus 1 billion to accelerate the availability of orion and ar i the bulk of all these amounts would be for the constellation systems program wh ich is developing orion and ares i and related activities the requested 23 increase for constellation systems is consistent with nasas previous projections for the program the fy2009 request for esmd restores full funding for the commercial orbital transportati on services cots program to help privatesector companies develop space transportation systems that could service the iss after the shuttle is retired the house committee recommended 20 million less than the request for cots without prej udice based on estimate d expenditures the senate committee recommended the requested amount along with host of impleme ntation challenges the visi on creates issues about the balance between human space exploration nd nasas other activities in science and aeronautics nasa administrator michael griffin has reportedly said i will do everything i can to keep orion and ares i on schedule that will be right behind keeping shuttle and station on track and then after that well fill up the bucket with our other priorities7 the 2005 and 2008 authorization act s both emphasized that nasa should have balanced set of programs including science and aeronautics as well as activities related to the vision the senate committee report for fy 2009 also expressed concern about nasas prog rammatic balance nasa science programs the fy2009 request for the science ssion directorate smd is 4442 billion after adjusting for the accounting change th is is 6 decrease from fy2008 but almost the entire decrease results from transfer of the deep space and near earth networks from smds heliophysics division to the sp ace operations mission directorate the house and senate committees reco mmended 4518 billion and 4523 billion respectively both totals included reallocated balances carried over from past fiscal years pl 110422 authorizes 4932 billion the reque st would increase funding for research and analysis in all four smd divisions as well as for suborbital research carried out on balloons and sounding rockets requested increases for planetar science and earth science would be offset by requested decr eases for astrophysics and heliophysics the request for planetary science includes 60 million to initiate new program in lunar robotic science including moon orbiter to be launched by 2011 nd pair of small landers to be

mission the house committee recommended an additional 20 million for this purpose while the senate committee urged development within available funds the request for astrophysics includes funding for the nasadoe joint dark energy mission jdem as directed by congress in the fy2008 explanatory statement but not for the space interferometer mission sim both committees recommended the requested amount for jdem in fy2008 nasa reallocated part of sims funding to new exoplanet exploration initiative which could include smaller version of sim as recommended by the fy2008 senate committee report srept

nuclear spectroscopic telescope array nustar the senate co mmittee recommended 30 million both co mmittees recommended increases to cover cost gr owth in several science programs nasa aeronautics research the fy2009 request for the aeronautics research mission directorate is 446 million that level is consistent with nasas previous projections but it would be 13 decrease relative to the fy2008 appropriation fter adjusting for the accounting change most of the proposed reduction would be in two programs airspace systems down 26 million and fundamental aeronautics down 34 million the house and senate committees recommended 515 million and 500 million respectively pl 110422 authorizes 853 million pl 110422 dir ects nasa to align its fundamental aeronautics program with t of 51 technology challenges identified by the national research council9 according to nasa 47 of those challenges are well represented in nasas current and proposed aeronautics research portfolio and that portfolio is also closely aligned with the 2007 national aeronautics rd plan10 the space shuttle and the international space station construction of the iss suspended after the columbia disaster in february 2003 resumed in september 2006 nasa plans ven more shuttle flights in 20082010 to complete the iss plus one mission in 2009 to service the hubble space telescope two additional flights in 2010 to supply

suspend any activ ity that would preclude the continued operation of the space shuttle after fy2010 if the next president were to decide to delay its scheduled retirement the gap between the end of shuttle flight s in 2010 and the expected availability of orion in 2015 raises several issues some an alysts are concerned that placing fixed termination date on the shuttle may create schedule pressure similar to that identified as contributing factor in the columbia disaster some question whether the united states should be dependent on russia to launch us astronauts to the iss during the gap period11 major concern is how nasa will re tain its sk illed workforce during the transition from shuttle to orion especially if orions schedule slips and the gap lengthens administrator griffin has testified that ori ons first flight coul d be moved forward to september 2013 at the cost of an additional 2 billion12 pl 110422 authorizes 1 billion for this purpose in fy2009 but the house and senate committees recommended additional funds considering the modest iss research agenda that remains some observers question whether completing the iss is worth the cost about 2 billion per year plus about 3 billion per year for the shuttle and 1 billion per year of i ndirect costs in the cross agency support account alternatively some policymakers want to restore the iss research program for example the h ouse recommendation for esmd included 50 million nearly double the request for resear ch on the iss the 2005 authorization act directs that 15 of iss research spending be used for nonvisionrelated research and pl 110422 authorizes an additional 100 million for iss research utilization and directs nasa to extend iss availability through at least 2020 some observers consider it essential to fulfil us commitments to its international partners in the iss russia japan canada and 10 countries in eur ope others find this rationale insufficient to justify the expense the fy2009 request includes 5775 billion for the space operations mission directorate somd which consists of th space shuttle the iss and the space and flight support program requested decrease of 285 million for the space shuttle is largely offset by requested increase of 247 million for the iss both are consistent with nasas previous projections they reflect the trend toward the shuttle programs completion in 2010 and the pla nned construction schedule of the iss the requested increase for space and flight support mostly re flects the transfer of the deep space and near earth networks from smd the house and senate committees recommended 5765 billion and 5775 billion respectively pl 110422 authorizes 6075 billion including 150 million for the additional shuttl flight to deliver the alpha
