bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 bcra2 also known as the mccainfeingold law establishes increased contribution limits for house candidates whose opponents significantly selffinance their campaigns this provisionin tandem with section 3043 which applies similar program to senate candidatesis frequently referred to as the millionaires amendment basically the complex statutory formula provides that if candidate for the house of representatives spends more than 350000 of personal funds during an election cycle individual contribution limits applicable to his or her opponent are increased from the usual current limit 2300 per election to up to triple that amount or 6900 per election likewise for senate candidates separate provision generally raises individual contribution limits for candidate whose opponent exceeds designated threshold level of personal campaign funding that is based on the number of eligible voters in the state for both house and senate candidates the increased contribution limits are eliminated when parity in spending is reached between the two candidates bcra also requires selffinancing candidates to file special disclosure reports regarding their campaign spendingas such expenditures are madein addition to reporting in accordance with the regular periodic disclosure schedule 4 g5g138g156g142g561g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561 in 2004 and 2006 jack davis was candidate for the house of representatives from the 26th congressional district of new york during the 2004 election cycle he spent 12 million which was principally from his own funds and during the 2006 cycle he spent 23 million which with the exception of 126000 came from personal funds in 2006 after the federal election commission fec informed davis that it had reason to believe that he had violated bcras disclosure requirements for selffinancing candidates by failing to report personal expenditures during the 2004 election cycle davis filed suit in the us district court for the district of columbia seeking declaration that the millionaires amendment was unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the fec from enforcing the law during the 2006 cycle district

constitutionality of limits on individual contributions and coordinated party expenditures8 while recognizing that contribution limits implicate first amendment free speech interests it has sustained such limits on the condition that they are closely drawn to serve sufficiently important interest such as the prevention of corruption or the appearance of corruption9 on the other hand the court observed that it has definitively rejected any limits on candidates expenditure of personal funds to finance campaign speech finding that such limits impose significant restraint on candidates right to advocate for his or her own election which is not justified by the compelling governmental interest of preventing corruption instead of preventing corruption candidates use of personal funds reduces the candidates dependence on outside contributions and thereby counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse to which contribution limitations are directed 10 with regard to the millionaires amendment the court observed that while it does not directly impose limit on candidates expenditure of personal funds it imposes an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises that first amendment right11 further it requires candidate to choose between the right of free political expression and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations12 if it simply increased the contribution limits for all candidatesboth the selffinanced candidate as well as the opponentit would pass constitutional muster13 although many candidates who can afford significant personal expenditures in support of their own campaigns may choose to do so despite the millionaires amendment the court determined that they w ould bear special and potentially significant burden if they make that choice14 in fact the court concluded that if candidate vigorously exercises the right to use personal funds it creates fundraising advantage for his or her opponents15 8 see id slip op

upheld provision of the federal election campaign act feca providing presidential candidates with the option to receive public funds on the condition that they comply with expenditure limits even though it found overall expenditure limits to be unconstitutional17 distinguishing the millionaires amendment from fecas presidential public financing provision the davis court observed that the choices presented by each of the statutes are quite different18 by forgoing public financing presidential candidate can still retain the unencumbered right to make unlimited personal expenditures in contrast the millionaires amendment fails to provide any options for candidate to exercise that right without abridgement19 finding that the millionaires amendment imposes substantial burden on the first amendment right to expend personal funds in support of ones own campaign thereby triggering strict scrutiny the court announced that it is not sustainable unless it can be justified by compelling governmental interest 20 as the court held in buckley reliance on personal funds reduce s the threat of corruption and therefore the burden imposed by the millionaires amendment cannot serve that governmental interest responding to the fecs argument that the statutes asymmetrical limits are justified because they level the playing field for candidates of differing personal wealth the court pointed out that its jurisprudence offers support for the proposition that this rationale constitutes compelling governmental interest according to the court preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption are the only legitimate and compelling government interests thus far identified for restricting campaign finances 21 moreover the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment22 specifically the court cautioned that restricting candidates speech in order to level opportunities for election among candidates presents ominous implications because it would permit congress to arrogate the voters authority to evaluate the strengths of candidates competing for office23 v oters are entrusted with the duty to judge candidates for public office and according to the court different candidates have different strengths some are wealthy others have wealthy supporters who are willing to make large contributions some are celebrities some have the benefit of wellknown family name leveling electoral opportunities means making and implementing judgments about which candidates should be permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election the constitution however confers upon voters not congress the 16 424 us 1 1976 for further discussion

article i 2 and it is dangerous business for congress to use the election laws to influence the voters choices24 in considering the constitutionality of the disclosure requirements contained within the millionaires amendment the court emphasized that it has repeatedly held that compelled disclosure significantly infringes on privacy of association and belief as guaranteed under the first amendment therefore it has subjected such requirements to exacting scrutiny in order to ascertain whether there is relevant correlation or substantial relation between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed 25 in view of its holding that the millionaires amendment is unconstitutional the court likewise reasoned that the burden imposed by its disclosure requirements cannot be justified and accordingly struck them down26 g6g146g156g156g142g151g157g146g151g144g561g17g153g146g151g146g152g151g156g561 in dissent justice stevensjoined in part by justices souter ginsburg and breyerargued that the millionaires amendment represents congresss judgment that candidates who spend over 350000 of their own money in campaign for house or senate seat have an advantage over other candidates who must raise contributions the statute imposes burden on selffinancing candidates and quiets speech 27 instead the dissent found that it does more than merely assist the opponent of selffunding candidate to make his or her voice heard and that this amplification in way mutes the voice of the millionaire who remains able to speak as loud and as long as he likes in support of his campaign28 as result of finding direct restriction on the speech of the selffinanced candidate the dissent would subject the millionaires amendment to less rigorous standard of review 29 indeed the dissent specifically criticized the courts landmark buckley ruling which struck down limits on expenditures arguing that number of purposes both legitimate and substantial can justify the imposition of reasonable spending limits30 maintaining that combating corruption and the appearance of corruption are not the only governmental interests justifying congressional regulation of campaign financing the dissent remarked that the court has also recognized the governmental interests of reducing both the influence of wealth and the appearance of wealth on the outcomes of elections while conceding that such prior decisions have focused on the aggregations of wealth that are accumulated in the corporate form it reasoned that the logic of such decisionsparticularly concerns about the corrosive and distorting effects of wealth on the political processcould be extended to the context of individual wealth as well31 24 id 25 id slip op at 18 26 see id 27 id slip op at 5 stevens j

playing field among candidates in fact the davis court determined that congressional attempts to do so would supplant the choices of the voters notably the decision also seems to be departure from its
