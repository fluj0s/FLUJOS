2355 2000 the supreme court held under the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the sixth amendment any fact other than prior conviction that increases the maximum penalty for crime must be charged in an indictment submitted to jury and proven beyond reasonable doubt 120 sct at 2355 in earlier cases the court had held that proof beyond reasonable doubt is due process prerequisite for conviction that the burden of proving any element of crime may not be shifted to the defendant although the defend ant may be afforded the benefit of establishing lesser included offense that mandatory minimum penalties may be established and imposed and that the fact of prior conviction may be used to increase as much as ten fold the penalty for the offense found by the jury following the decision the lower federal courts have held that 1 the rule applies to federal drug trafficking cases and other cases under similar statutes 2 it does not apply to the use of prior convictions as sentencing factor 3 it does not bar the use of mandatory minimum sentencing procedures unless the statutory maximum penalty for the underlying crime is exceeded 4 it does not invalidate the federal sentencing guidelines 5 its retroactive application to past cases is limited and 6 even when the rule applies an earlier sentence may be allowed to stand if the fact

jersey introduction in apprendi v new jersey 120 sct 2348 2000 the supreme court called into question the sentencing role of federal judges at the very least the decision has required alterations in the manner in which federal drug statutes and similar provisions are prosecuted and it may herald the demise of the federal sentencing guidelines apprendi holds that under the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the sixth amendment any fact other than prior conviction that increases the maximum penalty for crime must be charged in an indictment submitted to jury and proven beyond reasonable doubt 120 sct at 2355 the courts sharp change of direction and the slim and fragile nature of the consensus among the members of the majority make predictions perilous it is therefore perhaps not surprising that the various federal appellate courts have thus far construed apprendi narrowly winship and its progeny apprendi is the latest in line of cases that begins with winship where the court expressly confirmed that due process demands the guilt of an accused be found beyond reasonable doubt in re winship 397 us 358 364 1970 in doing so it declared that the due process clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged id emphasis added conviction cannot be had it later explained by requiring the defendant to prove the absence of one of the elements of the crime with which he is charged thus for example state may not require an accused to prove that he acted in the heat of passion ie with an absence of malice aforethought and therefore is not guilty of murder for which malice aforethought is an element but only of manslaughter mullaney v wilbur 421 us 684 698701 1975 due process in this context is focused upon the prosecutors responsibility to prove each of the crimes elements beyond reasonable doubt due process is not offended if the defendant must prove the existence of lesser included offense rather than the more serious offense with which he was charged so state may outlaw the intentional killing of another as murder but allow the accused to claim guilt under less severely punished crime when he can show by preponderance of the evidencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30888crs2 1 new york defined the crime of second degree murder as intentionally killing another nypenal law 12525 1975 it outlawed as manslaughter intentionally killing another under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance nypenal law 12520 1975 it gave defendant accused of second degree murder an affirmative defense under which he would be considered guilty only of the lesser offense of manslaughter if he could establish that he killed under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance nypenal law 12525 1975 2 the mcmillan procedure exposed anyone convicted of various designated offenses to mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for five years if the sentencing judge found by preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had brandished firearm during the commission of the offense 3 subsection of 8 usc 1326 makes it crime for deported aliens to reenter the united states without special permission offenders are subject to imprisonment for not more than 2 years unless prior to deportation they had been convicted of aggravated felony in which case they are subject to imprisonment for not more than 20 years 8 usc 1326b2 almandareztorres had entered plea of guilty to charge of violating subsection 1326a but argued that the sentencin g factor of prior conviction must in fact be considered an element of separate crime which in order to comply with the fifth amendment had to be charged in the indictment the court did not agree we conclude that the subsection is penalty provision which simply authorizes court to increase the sentence for recidivist it does not define separate crime consequently neither the statute nor the constitution require the govern ment to charge the factor that it mentions an earlier conviction in the indictment 523 us at 22627that he acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance patterson v new york 432 us 197 2057 19771 still focused upon the prosecutors responsibility to prove each of the crimes elements the court held that once the prosecution has done so denial of due process occurs simply because the defendant convicted of the crime is subject to mandatory minimum sentence based upon the prosecutions proof to the court not the jury of an additional sentencing factor by preponderance of the evidence and not beyond reasonable doubt mcmillan v pennsylvania 477 us 79 93 19862 moreover these sentencing factors could be used to enhance the maximum penalties as well as to establish minimum penalty thus majority of the court saw constitutional impediment in statutory scheme that raised the maximum penalty of crime from 2 years to 20 years based on the presence of particular sentencing factor to be established to the courts satisfaction by preponderance of the evidence after conviction almandareztorres v united states 523 us 224 22627 19983 even in capital punishment cases where due process standards are sometimes insufficient to satisfy constitutional requirements for imposition of that unique penalty the court held that the judge as well as the jury may be entrusted with the task of determining the existence of aggravating factors necessary to justify execution walton v arizona 497 us 639 647 1990 logical though it may have been in light of the courts precedents majority of the courts members became uneasy with the implication s of almandareztorreshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30888crs3 4 since the apprendi majority consisted of the four dissenting justices in almendareztorres and justice thomas it might be more accurate say that four justices remained uneasy and pivotal fifth justice began to question the wisdom of almendareztorres 5 whoever with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm takes motor vehicle that has been transported shipped or received in interstate or foreign commerce from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation or attempts to do so shall 1 be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 15 years or both 2 if serious bodily injury as defined in section 1365 of this title including any conduct that if the conduct occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states would violate section 2241 or 2242 of this title results be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 25 years or both and 3 if death results be fined under this title or imprisoned for any number of years up to life or both or sentenced to death 18 usc 2119almost immediately4 they began with an arguably strained statutory interpretation in which they characterized various statut ory factors as elements rather than sentencing factors they did so they explained because otherwise the statutes might be considered constitutionally suspect jones v united states 526 us 227 1999 presented facts similar to those in almendareztorres jones was indicted and convicted of carjacking in violation of 18 usc 2119 conviction carried sentence of imprisonment for not more 15 years 18 usc 21191 but the maximum sentence was increased to 25 years if the offense resulted in serious bodily injury 18 usc 21192 and to life imprisonment if the offense resulted in death 18 usc 211935 neither the indictment nor the instructions to the jury made any mention of bodily injury but the presentence report did and recommended sente nce of 25 years which the trial court imposed the court of appeals affirmed united states v jones 60 f3d 547 9th cir 1995 the supreme court in 54 decision reversed the court concluded that the statute did not create single crime with three possible sentences instead it created three separate crimes each with its own penalty ie simple carjacking not more than 15 years carjacking where serious bodily injury results not more than 25 years and carjacking where death results life imprisonment it observed however that while we think the fairest reading of 2119 treats the fact of serious bodily harm as an element not mere enhancement we recognize the possibility of the other view any doubt that might be prompted by the arguments for that other reading should however be resolved against it under the rule repeatedly affirmed that where statute is suspectable of two constructions by one of which grave and doubtfu l constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided our duty is to adopt the latter 526 us at 239 to find otherwise the court believed might bring it into conflict with the principle that under the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the sixth amendment any fact other than prior conviction that increases the maximum penalty for crime must be charged in an indictment submitted to jury and proven beyond reasonable doubt 526 us at 243 n6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30888crs4 6 only few weeks prior to apprendi near unanimous court announced castillo v united states 120 sct 2090 2000 another elementsorsentencingfactor decision in which the court appeared hesitant to pursue the jones broad implications the statute in question 18 usc 924c prohibited the use or carrying of firearm in relation to crime of violence and increased the penalty dramatically when the weapon used or carried is for example machinegun 120 sct at 2091 internal quotation marks omitted in doing so the court concluded subsection 924c created series of crimes in which the presence of machinegun or one of the other sentenceescalating weapons was an element id although some might not find this construction more compelling than the one produced in jones the text of 924c is appended the court did this is stronger separate crime case than either jones or almendareztorres cases in which we were closely divided as to congress likely intent 120 sct at 2096 other than possibly this reference to jones castillo neither speaks nor hints of construction driven by the specter of unconst itutionality the court might have confirmed jones in castillo but apprendi state case provides broader base 7 in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation usconst amend vi person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law usconst amendv these rights thus guaranteed against theapprendi apprendi confirms the constitutional suggestions in jones 6 apprendi was convicted

allegations which supported its application 120 sct at 2352 nevertheless in the plea agreement the prosecution reserved the right to seek the hate crime enhancement and apprendi reserved the right to challenge its constitutionality id the trial court sentenced apprendi to hatecrimeenhanced term of 12 years on one of the unlawful possession counts which otherwise would have carried maximum term of 10 years and rejected his constitutional arguments the new jersey appellate courts affirmed apprendi v state 304 njsuper 147 698 a2d 1265 1997 affd 159 nj 7 731 a2d 485 1999 the supreme court in decision written by justice stevens and joined by justices scalia thomas souter and ginsburg reversed and remanded 120 sct 2348 the court declared that the jury trial and notification clauses of the sixth amendment and the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30888crs5 federal government are made binding upon the states by the due process clause of the fourteen th amendment nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law the fifth amendment also insists that persons shall be held to answer for capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on presentment or indictment of grand jury historically this fifth amendment right to grand jury indictment has not been counted among those rights encompassed within the concept of due process however and therefore has not been considered binding upon the states see eg hurtado v california 110 us 516 1884 apprendis tentative acknowledgement might seem to invite reexamination apprendi has not here asserted constitutional claim based on the omission of any reference to sentence enhancement or racial bias in the indictment he relies entirely on the fact that the due process of law that the fourteenth amendment requires the states to provide to persons accused of crime encompasses the right to trial by jury and the right to have every element of the offense proved beyond reasonable doubt that amendment has not however been construed to include the fifth amendment right to presentment or indictment of grand jury that was implicated in our recent decision in almendareztorres v united states we thus do not address the indictment question separately today 120 sct at 2356 n3 citations omitted 8 this case turns on the seemingly simple question of what constitutes crime all of the constitutional protections turn on determining which facts constitute the crime that is which facts are the elements or ingredients of crime historic authority establishes that crime includes every fact that is by law basis for imposing or increasing punishment in contrast with fact that mitigates punishment 120 sct at 2367268 9 i do not believe that the courts increase in the maximum penalty rule is required by the constitution last term in jones v united states 526 us 227 1999 this court found that our prior cases suggested the following principle under the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the sixth amendment any fact other than prior conviction that increases the maximum penalty for crime must be charged in an indictment submitted to jury and proven beyond reasonable doubt id at 243 n 6 at the time justice kennedy rightly criticized the court for its failure to explain the origins contours or consequences of its purported constitutional principle for the inconsistency of that principle with our prior cases and for the serious doubt that the holding cast on sentencing systems employed by the federal government and states alike id at 254 264272 dissenting opinion today in what will surely be remembered as watershed change in constitutional law the court imposes as constitutional rule the principle it first identified in jones 120 sct at 2395 2380embody principal that insists that other than the fact of prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt 120 sct 2362363 justice thomas together with justice scalia agreed but added concurrence that suggests they would have gone furth er8 justice oconnor wrote dissent in which she was joined by chief justice rehnquist and justices breyer and kennedy 120 sct at 2380 at the heart

of host of federal statutes which outlaw particular type of misconduct and then provide an escalating series of penalties when certain aggravating factors such as serious bodily injury are present in the case of most statutes these escalating factors were considered sentencing factors assigned to the domain of the judge rather than the jury but are now subject to the right to jury determination and proof beyond reasonable doubt list of the federal statutes transformed by apprendi is appendedimpact the consequences of apprendi are substantial and potentially enormous its most obvious and immediate impact is upon federal drug sentencing practices section 841a of title 21 of the united states code outlaws trafficking in controlled substances as general rule trafficking in heroin cocaine and other schedule i or ii controlled substances is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years 21 usc 841b1 c trafficking in large amounts of these controlled substances eg 100 grams of heroin can increase the maximum penalties to imprisonment for not less than 5 nor more than 40 years not less than 10 years nor more than life for repeat offenders 21 usc 841b1b and trafficking in very large amounts eg kilogram or more of heroin raises the penalties to imprisonment for not less than 20 years nor more than life 21 usc 841b1a10 prior to apprendi an accused was entitled to jury determination of his guilt under section 841 but questions of the amount of the substan ce involved were considered sentencing factors to be decid ed by the judge11 subject to few exceptions apprendi has changed all that the sentencing factors of section 841 and its equivalents are now elements of separate offenses to be charged in the indictment and found by the jury beyond reasonable doubt12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30888crs7 13 finally as we made plain in jones last term almendareztorres v united states 523 us 224 1998 represents at best an exceptional departure from the historic practice that we have described even though it is arguable that almendareztorres was incorrectly decided and that logical application of our reasoning today should apply if the recidivist issue were contested apprendi does not contest the decisions validity and we need not revisit it for purposes of our decision today to treat the case as narrow exception to the general rule we recalled at the outset 120 sct at 2361 2362 second and related one of the chief errors of almendareztorres an error to which i succumbedwas to attempt to discern whether particular fact is traditionally or typically basis for sentencing court to increase an offenders sentence 523 us at 243244 see id at 230 241 for the reasons i have given it should be clear that this approach just defines away the real issue what matters is the way by which fact enters into the sentence if fact is by law the basis for imposing or increasing punishmentfor establishing or increasing the prosecutions entitlementit is an element to put the point differently i am aware of historical basis for treating as nonelement fact that by law sets or increases punishment when one considers the question from this perspective it is evident why the fact of prior conviction is an element under recidivism statute indeed cases addressing such statutes provide some of the best discussions of what constitutes an element of crime one reason frequently offered for treating recidivism differently reason on which we relied in almendareztorres supra at 235 is concern for prejudicing the jury by informing it of the prior conviction but this concern of which earlier courts were well aware does not make the traditional understanding of what an element is any less applicable to the fact of prior conviction 120 sct at 2379 14 see eg united states v martinezvillalva 232 f3d 1329 1331 10th cir 2000in apprendi the supreme court held that other than the fact of prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt as defendant correctly concedes the apprendi court made it clear that its holding is subject to narrow exception and it is not applicable when the sentenceenhancing fact is prior conviction as in this case the apprendi court specifically declined to revisit or overturn almendareztorres this case falls squarely within the exception to the apprendi holding and is governed by almendarez torres accord united states v guadmuzsolis 232 f3d 1363 1363 11th cir 2000 united states v pachecozepeda 234 f3d 411

of prior conviction apprendi however limits its sweep at least for the time being it creates an unmistakable recidivism exception other than the fact of prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury 120 sct at 2362363 emphasis added the limitation is not inadvertent but it is hardly warmly embraced both justice stevens opinion for the court and justice thomas concurrence imply that almandarez torres upon which the exception is based was probably incorrectly decided13 nevertheless if only for now almandarez remains the law and post apprendi courts continue to hold that recidivism is valid sentencing factor that may be used to increase defendants sentence beyond the maximum term that would otherwise apply even if the prior conviction is neither mentioned in the indictment nor presented to the jury14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30888crs8 states v terry 240 f3d 65 734 1st cir 2001 united states v powell 109 fsupp2d 381 38384 edpa 2000 united states v gebele 117 fsupp2d 540 54849 wdva 2000 15 see eg united states v aguayodelgado 220 f3d 926 93334 8th cir 2000the rule of apprendi only applies where the nonjury factual determination increases the maximum sentence beyond the statutory range authorized by the jurys verdict if the nonjury factual determination only narrows the sentencing judges discretion within the range already authorized by the offense of conviction such as with the mandatory minimums applied to aguayodelgado then the governing constitutional standard is provided by mcmillan as we have said mcmillan allows the legislature to raise the minimum penalty associated with crime based on nonjury factual findings as long as the penalty is within the range specified for the crime for which the defendant was convicted by the jury apprendi expressly states that mcmillan is still good law though limited in application see also united states v houle 237 f3d

has come to somewhat different conclusion united states v flowal 234 f3d 932 93638 6th cir 2000 overturned mandatory sentence of life imprisonment predicated on the lower courts preponderance of the evidence findings of the quantity of cocaine involved in the offense and defendants two prior convictions in addition to the fact that sentence exceeded the applicable statutory maximum of the offense found by the jury without reference to the quantity of cocaine involved 30 years and thus triggered apprendi considerations the panel expressed concern that the district court gave flowal mandatory maximum sic sentence that might not have actually been mandatory or even permissible had the district court properly submitted the issue of the drugs weight to the jury later panel read the additional comment as more than mere dicta united states v ramirez f3d 6th cir 21601 faced defendant who had been sentenced to mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years which the lower court felt compelled to impose because of its finding that the offense involved 10 kilograms of cocaine unlike flowal the sentence imposed was less than the maximum that might have been imposed without reference to weight of the cocaine again 30 years becaus of prior conviction nevertheless the ramirez declared that the narrow question before us in the instant case is whether the rights increases the penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum the second distinct limitation of the appren di rule is its deference to the statutory maximum the restriction has obvious implications first it permits judicially determined and imposed mandatory minimum sentences as long as they do not exceed the maximum penalty imposed by statute second it leaves the federal sentencing guidelines unimpaired finally it lets stand previously imposed sentences grounded upon erroneous assumptions of law which nevertheless came to rest within the applicable statutory maximum apprendi disposes of any potential challenge to the validity of mandatory minimum sentences that do not exceed statutory ceilings by recasting mcmillan we limit mcmillans holding to cases that do not involve the imposition of sentence more severe than the statutory maximum for the offense established by the jurys verdict 120 sct at 2361 n13 the point has not been lost on subsequent federal appellate panels15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30888crs9 discussed in apprendi are triggered by the drug statutes progression of increased mandatory minimum penalties based in part on the quantity of drugs possessed we recently decided this issue in united states v flowal another way of stating the same point in the language of apprendi is to say that the assessment of acts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which criminal defendant is exposed such as moving up the scale of mandatory minimum sentences invokes the full range of constitutional protections required for elements of the crime in spite of prompting in ramirez concurrence neither panel explains the apparent inconsistency between its holdings and apprendi s reformulation of mcmillan which sanctions statutes that impose mandatory minimums that do not exceed the statutory maximum 16 the principal dissent in addition treats us to lengthy disquisition on the benefits of determinate sentencing schemes and the effect of todays decision on the federal sentencing guidelines the guidelines are of course not before the court we therefore express view on the subject beyond what this court has already held see eg edwards v united states 523 us 511 515 1998 opinion of breyer j for unanimous court noting that of course petitioners statutory and constitutional claims would make difference if it were possible to argue say that the sentences imposed exceeded the maximum that the statutes permit for cocaineonly conspiracy that is because maximum sentence set by statute trumps higher sentence set forth in the guidelines 120 sct at 2366 17 it is likewise unnecessary to consider whether and if so how the rule regarding elements applies to the sentencing guidelines given the unique status that they have under mistretta v united states 488 us 361 1989 but it may be that this special status is irrelevant because the guidelines have the force and effect of laws id at 413 scalia j dissenting 120 sct at 2380 n11 thomas j concurring apprendi seems to forego coverage of the federal sentencing guidelines by setting its rule to work beyond the applicable statutory maximum knowing that the sentencing guidelines operate only up to that maximum ussg 5g11a the apprendi dissenters however sense this result may be in conflict with apprendi s underlying rationale the actual principle underlying the courts decision the dissent opines may be that any fact other than prior conviction that has the effect in real terms of increasing the maximum punishment beyond an otherwise applicable range must be submitted to jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt 120 sct at 2391 oconnor j dissenting if so the dissenters speculate the principle thus would apply not only to schemes like new jerseys under which factual determination exposes the defendant to sentence beyond the prescribed statutory maximum but also to all determinatesentencing schemes in which the length of defendants sentence within the statutory range turns on specific factual determinations eg the federal sentencing guidelines id and they add justice thomas concurrence appears to endorse this construction when he essentially concedes that the rule outlined in his concurring opinion would require the invalidation of the sentencing guidelines 120 sct at 2391 oconnor j dissenting in fact neither justice stevens in his opinion for the court nor justices thomas nor scalia in their concurrences offer great deal to allay the dissents concerns the court notes that the issue was not before it and that guideline sentences must fall within the maximum prescribed by statute16 justice thomas observes that the impact on the guidelines need not be addressed but sounds ambivalent on the merits of the issue17 justice scalia who joins in justice thomas concurrence writes separately to emphasize the constitutional necessity of jury facthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30888crs10 18 i feel the need to say few words in response to justice breyers dissent it sketches an admirably fair and efficient scheme of criminal justice designed for society that is prepared to leave criminal justice to the state judges it is sometimes necessary to remind ourselves are part of the state and an increasingly bureaucratic part of it at that the founders of the american republic were not prepared to leave it to the state which is why the jurytrial guarantee was one of the least controversial provisions of the bill of rights it has never been efficient but it has always been free 120 sct at 2367 scalia j concurring 19 united states v kinter 235 f3d 192 199201 4th cir 2000in the case before us the sentencing judge determined under the preponderance standard that kinter paid more than one bribe and that washington datas profit was 96 million findings that required the court to impose sentence of between 46 and 57 months in the absence of these findings the maximum punishment allowable under the sentencing guidelines woul d have been 10 months kinter therefore contends that apprendi required those two facts to be submitted to jury and proven beyond reasonable doubt before they could form the basis of an enhancement of his sentence this contention essentially boils down to an argument that apprendi renders much if not all of the current sentencing practices under the sentencing guidelines unconstitutional but the apprendi court explicitly limited its holding to factual determinations that increase the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum because apprendi does not apply to judges exercise of sentencing discretion within statutory range the current practice of judicial factfinding under the guidelines is not subject to the apprendi requirements at least so long as that factfinding does not enhance defendants sentence beyond the maximum term specified in the substantive statute see also united states v white 240 f3d 127 136 2d cir 2001 hernandez v united states 226 f3d 839 84142 7th cir 2000 united states v lewis 236 f3d 948

least in its present form begins where the sentence guidelines end at the maximum penalty prescribed by statute later cases have rejected the contention that operation of the guidelines contravenes the apprendi rule19 there is one other consequence of apprendi s deference to statutory maximums federal appellate courts pointing to this aspect of apprendi have declined to overturn sentences imposed before apprendi was handed down that fall beneath the applicable statutory maximum even if they were otherwise imposed contrary to the apprendi rule20 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30888crs11

invalid state capital sentencing schemes requiring judges after jury verdict holding defendant guilty of capital crime to find specific aggravating factors before imposing sentence of death walton v arizona 497 us 639 647649 1990 id at 709714 stevens j dissenting for reasons we have explained the capital cases are not controlling neither the cases cited nor any other case perm its judge to determine the existence of factor which makes crime capital offense what the cited cases hold is that once jury has found the defendant guilty of all the elements of an offense which carries as its maximum penalty the sentence of death it may be left to the judge to decide whether that maximum penalty rather than lesser one ought to be imposed the person who is charged with actions that expose him to the death penalty has an absolute entitlement to jury trial on all the elements of the charge almendareztorres 523 us at 257 n 2 scalia j dissenting emphasis deleted see also jones 526 us at

us 639 647649 1990 see at 2365 366 walton did approve scheme by which judge rather than jury determines an aggravating fact that makes convict eligible for the death penalty and thus eligible for greater punishment in this sense that fact is an element but that scheme exists in unique context for in the area of capital punishment unlike any other area we have imposed special constraints on legislatures ability to determine what facts shall lead to what punishmentwe have restricted the legislatures ability to define crimes under our recent capitalpunishment jurisprudence neither arizona nor any other jurisdiction could provideas previ ously it freely could and didthat person shall be death eligible automatically upon conviction for certain crimes we have interposed barrier between jury finding of capital crime and courts ability to impose capital punishment whether this distinction between capital crimes and all others or some other distinction is sufficient to put the former outside the rule that i have stated is question for another day 120 sct at 2380 thomas j concurringcapital punishment and other procedural questions although the courts capital punishment jurisprudence may sometimes call for more process than is due in due process cases apprendi does not abrogate the courts existing construction under which the constitution is said to permit assignment of the ultimate sentencing decision to either judge or jury the exception stands on two critical distinctions first in capital punishment cases the sentencing decision follows jury determination of guilt on capital offenses ie the maximum penalty for the crime of conviction is death21 moreover the eighth amendment elaborately supplements the jurys role in capital cases with wide range of additional safeguards22 apprendi deals with sentences that is with punishment and so it might be thought to apply to sentences in any form but not necessarily to the remedial repercussions of conviction nevertheless some consequences of conviction whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30888crs12 23 united states v balogun 146 f3d 141 146 2d cir 1998the legislative history makes plain that congress

v pratt 239 f3d 640 64648 4th cir 2001 the issue here is further complicated by the fact that the circuits are divided over the maximum permissible term of supervised release in drug cases subsection

supervised release for violations of statutes such as subsection 841b1c unless otherwise provided some courts read subsection 841b1c as otherwise providing so that the permissible range of release

for certain types of criminal conduct cannot alter the simple fact that forfeiture is precisely that punishment 26 united states v corrado 227 f3d 543 550 6th cir 2000we reject the defendants argument that the jury must decides the extent of forfeiture or that the district court as the agreed trier of fact must make fact determinations based on the beyond reasonable doubt standard see united states
