computer the other we are having an issue imagery products products collected captured 30 products from the scan eagl exploited and posted 10 products to the csd and our local cohost summary success able to show hand off tasking from jaric to us and back of scan eagle mission where help is needed there needs to be better understanding of adhoc taskings when there is handoff of mission the direct

conduct fire mission threads with afatds attempt to exploit global hawk data significant issue high speed guards are still not working and therefore we cannot federate with the cfblnet imagery products products collected mti from both jstars and astor sigint from rj imagery from raptor pulled sharp imagery summary successes we had two groups of vips visit the danville site the first group was led by general cartwright usmc who is the vice joint chief of staff and ltg wood jf com deputy commander general cartwright and ltg wood both know and understand dcgs and what dcgsa has accomplished todate general cartwright stressed that we all need to start doing business different from the past and that the technolo gy within dcgs is good start the second group of vips was t he new jstars program manager hes impressed with what dcgsa has accomplished and now has good understanding of how we plan to migrate cgs capabilities into dcgsa we were able to access sensor data from seve ral different systems via the metadata catalog and then we were able to build an sa overlay we were able to conduct several fire missions from echo with afatds at ft monmouth we did not exploit gh because of data link problems we were able to download sharp data performed exploitation and posted the resultant products via the dib to the ipl dgsx location langley afb dgsx pocs chris hadley personnel 4 personnel with issues to report activities summary of planned activities support dib federation across the ddte enterprise function as tped node for u2 and global hawk missions test dcgs 102 ingest capabilit ies of other available imagery from additional platforms during ec08 significant issues at this time we have not been able to fully federate with all the ddte nodes access to imagery to support exploitation for the gh mission has impacted our ability to support the federated tped mission we could not access the imagery throug h dib federation or through the site ipl replay of missed mission data needs to be coordinated based on the availability of the ped sites our node is not manned for 247 operations the cross domain solution is still not available at this time and limits federation success dhmodia humint team mivg location michelson labs pocs john grant matt leclaire bert newton personnel 3 personnel with issues to report activities summary of planned

issues so the jil transferred file s overnight from the cfe storage location at china lake to the jil and is now able to view mivg files summary successes jfcom jil was able to see the mivg data on cfe after it was downloaded to their local network drives worked with imagery analysts in room 136 to have jpeg shots taken from mivg video and overlayed within googleearth where help is needed need

groundair integration and isr collects in the vehicle ltg was impressed with the ability to disp lay the uas video on t he ctp and suggested it supplement rather than replace the rover theorizing that the rover could display near overhead uas fmv direct link while the ctp displays the fmv from uas downrange both ltg wood and col mehle were struck by t he potential of boeings multitarget track mtt that will allow tracking of moving ta rget on eo motion imagery via pixel movement cdr crissman coined the term eo mti to describe the capability ms wilson directed the plurality of her attent ion to
