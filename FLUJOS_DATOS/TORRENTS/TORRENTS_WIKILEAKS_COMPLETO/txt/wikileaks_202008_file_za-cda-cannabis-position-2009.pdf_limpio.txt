this paper aims to provide rational and coherent framework for discussion and policy development in south africa regarding cannabis use and trade apart from rving as an information document the conclusions reached on the subject are based on review of available literature on the nature extent effects or consequences of cannabis use as well as related government policies in south africa and to some extent in other countries the paper notes that cannabisor more specifically cannabis sativa grows in many parts of the world including south africa legend has it that canna bis was transported into africa by way of india and saudi arabia in the pharmacopoeia it is classified as hallucinogenic psychodysleptic or psychomimetic that alters perceptions and emotions and in international drug control conventions as narcotic and more generally as part of the following groups of psychotropics depressants alcohol valium stimulants nor coffee and nicotine major cocaine and amphetamines disrupters cannabis ls d antipsychotics and medication for mood disorders lithium the main mindaltering psychoactive agent in cannabis is delta9 tetrahydrocannabinol thc the concentration of which is reported to be general ly high in south african crops although psychoactive effects generally last couple of hours cannabis ingested is discharged from the body at very slow rate not much is known about the interaction between thc and other factors substances conditions of the body when ingesting cannabis historically cannabis has been cultivated for many reasons including medical reasons in south africa it is cultivated as cash crop for local and external consumers it is most often prepared as tobaccolike mixture which is smoked in pipe using an ordinary pipe or brokenoff bottle top or rolled into cigarette it is frequently mixed with crushed methaqualone tablets occasionally with other drugs such as cocaine and in some cases sniffed with methylated spirits to give it quick kick cannabis is metabolised more efficiently through smoking than intravenous injection or oral ingestion cannabis smoke contains all the constituents of tobacco smoke except nic otine including carbon monoxide bronchial irritants and carcinogens furthermore unlike toba cco nicotine intake the ingestion of cannabinoids can have adverse psychiatric effects and like ivalcohol intake it is likely to result in acuteshortterm and longterm physical and psychological harm as physiologically developing persons have lower resistance young peopleespecially those of childbearing agecan experience repercussions from c annabis use not only for themselves but also for the children they may bear shortterm effects of cannabis use are those that immediately follow us and occur while the psychoactive effects last these effects are generally refe rred to as cannabis intoxication and divided into somatic psychological and psychomotor effect s somatic effects include cardiovascular effects such as increased heart rat b bronchopulmonary effects that are similar to those of tobacco c ocular effects s uch as redness of eyes and conjunctival irritation and d other effects such as dry mouth due to creased saliva secretion increased appetite due to drop in blood sugar level and s ometimes nausea vomiting diarrhoea and urine retention psychological and psychomotor effects that have been reported include mood disorders distortion of time space and selfi mage diminished shortterm memory diminished ability to concentrate and perform complex ta sks slower reflexes and impaired coordination of movement it has been found that cannabi s products bind haemoglobin thus limiting the amount of oxygen that can be carried to the heart tissue this deficiency could trigger heart attacks in susceptible people t he impaired coordination and reaction time that follow cannabis intoxication can be hazardous whe n driving car operating heavy machinery flying plane or engaging in other activities that require good coordination and reflexes as well as quick judgement there is evidence of causal role of acute cannabis intoxication in motor vehicle and other accidents reported longterm adverse effectsconsequences of chronic cannabis use espec ially relate to the respiratory system carcinogenicity the immune system the endocrine system reproductive functions the cardiovascular system and the risk of becoming depe ndent on the drug for example the consequences of chronic and intense cannabis use seve ral joints per day for several years have been found to be similar to those of cigare ttes in terms of carcinogenic risks for the respiratory tract as well as the mouth the t ongue and the esophagus an association between chronic cannabis use and the onset or relapse of various mental disorders has also been found eg psychosis and schizophrenia various studies have reported that chronic users of cannabis among especial ly socioeconomic disadvantaged persons and offenders develop social adjustment diffic ulties eg impaired family relationships poor occupational and educational performa nce as well as vinvolvement in criminal activity such as trading in illicit drugs property crim violence eg rape and gang life cannabis use during the pre adolescent years has also been found to contribute towards impaired educational performanceattainment and social development indeed various studies have shown that the more intenseheavy and the earli er the age of onset of drug useincluding the onset of cannabis usethe greater the likeli hood that the user will progress to multiple drug use lifestyle to longterm drug cannabis use to drug cannabis dependence and to drugcannabiscrime lifestyle regarding vulnerability to cannabis use and particularly cannabisassociated debilities it is important to note that in south africaas in various other african countries and further abroadthe cannabis consumer market has broadened and new patterns of use have come to the fore usage which used to be largely reserved to males older age groups and particular occasions has spread to all age groups and to being used in variety of ways and occasions as well as for range of reasons an increase in cannabisrelated problems is expected to accompany the increase in usage moreover complex combination of individual and environmental factors has been shown to contribute to the increase in the level of cannabis use and the expected increase in associated problems national study among detainees in police stations in south africa for example found that as population density and level of formal housing increased in neighbourhood eg magisterial district so did the probability decrease of gender differences in cannabis consumption and b greater population density in neighbourhood increased the probability of individuals experiencing violent encounters eg threatsstabbing with knife with these encounters in turn increasing the probability of the individuals concerned taking cannabis it has also been shown that drug use including cannabis use and associated problems arise and are maintained within context of limited socioeconomic opportunities although affluence does not vinecessarily provide insulation against cannabis use and associated problems furthermore the normalisation of cannabis use has been found to contribute to increased cannabis use and associated problems ie its integration into daytoday activities and using it for reasons other than those traditionally accepted and well regulated this papers analysis of drug control in selected countries with variable degree of restrictions regarding cannabis highlighted the following points as the use of and trade in cannabis can impair the health and soc ioeconomic status of individuals communities and regions and can impede sustainable local nd regional development initiatives as represented in for example nepad asures for countering these adverse effects are essential to be effective measures against the adverse effects of cannabis usetrade need to be x1comprehensive and integrated eg attend to cannabis within the wi der context of psychoactive substance use and trade b

evaluated x1especially attentive to young people and x1premised on inherently salutary principles governments that have instituted or few legal restrictions against pe rsonal or recreational and medical use of cannabis experience difficulties in ensuring that provisions for the medical use of cannabis are realistic instead of theoretical or symbolic gestures and in preventing the general public and young people in part icular from believing that cannabis use is harmless the south african governments national drug master plan ndmp genera lly reflects drug control strategy that takes note of lessons learnt in various other countries with regard to ways of countering cannabisrelated problems however the follow ing two issues have to be given more attention viix1indications in other countries that drug treatment courts lower recidivism and criminal labelling indeed divert offenders with drugrelated problems into appropriate treatment and x1the value of widespread public awareness of the adverse effects of pa rticular patterns of cannabis use and b widespread public participation in effort s at countering cannabisrelated problems finally the following statements of the directorgeneral of the unite d nations office on drugs and crime in vienna reflects key issue when considering cannabis policy the priority the international community is attributing to stronger toba cco control legislation is twin to global efforts to maintain strong c ounternarcotics legislation if we apply the spirit of the tobacco control conventi on agreed by 171 member states to cannabis it is clear what we need to do we ne ed to ensure that the centre of our attention is the health and the well being of our people however is there not contrast between efforts by the internation community to negotiate and agree on convention on tobacco because of the lethal consequences of its abuse and the frequently heard calls to liberaliz the production trafficking and abuse of cannabisa

comprehensiveinternational reviews of the subject eg by kalant 2004 the united nations office on drugs and crime 2002 2003 the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 drugscope 2001 in the united kingdom the irish government in its national drug strategy of 20012008 department of tourism sport and recreation 2001 the united nations office for drug control and crime prevention 1999 the world hea lth organization 1997 and du toit 1978 2 background although cannabis has been the subject of much research and discussion locally and abroad it is not easy to synthesise the literature because of the complexity of the subject and difficulty to distinguish between fact and fiction canadian senat special committee on illegal drugs 2002 hanson and venturelli 1998368 for example comment as 1 the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002143 states the following when distinguishing between effects and consequences of cannabis use most of the works consulted in pharmacology toxicology and psychiatry speak of chronic effects for our part we prefer to speak of consequences resulting from chronic use there are two reasons for this first of all because these consequences result not so much from the substance itself as from the way it is used therefore we are not dealing with the effects of the substance but rather with the consequences that may arise from repeated or even heavy use we feel this distinction is fundamental because it is common at all levels of public discussion to blame the substancehere cannabis there alcohol or medications even other illicit drugswhen in fact we must learn to distinguish between patterns and methods of use by that we mean atrisk behaviour which varies with the substance of course and which does not depend solely on the intrinsic properties of the substance but stems in an overall approach from the relationship between the substance and its place in society integrated or not from the individuals characteristics and from the society in which the substance is used of course by that it should be clear that we consider as separate for cannabis as for alcohol use atrisk use and heavy use or abuse and that we reject the equivalency often made between use and abuse where any form of use is perceived as abuse at the same time we are aware of the vagueness that surrounds these various types of behaviour and that there is clearly defined boundary even less universal boundary between use harmful use and dependence consequences therefore refer to chronic use which then includes atrisk and heavy use 1south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis follows perhaps other substance has been the object of so much res earch and controversy as cannabis emphasis added it is difficult to wade through the emotions politics and rigidity found in writings on marijuana to tease out the objective clinical reality extreme views go back to the 1930s when the film reefer madness portra yed an after school marijuana club for high school students in suits and ties who bec ame hallucinatory destructive and even suicidal after using marijuana hereafter the terms cannabis and marijuana as well as b the terms psychoactive substance s ubstance and drug will be used interchangeably the difficulty of distinguishing between truth nd bias in written material is however not unique to writings on cannabis remarking on scie ntific writings generally the south african saliem fakir 2004 recently noted what s been missing from science is not truth rather the problem is the ethical disposition of scientists with commercial or political interest who latch onto every last vestige of scientific opinion s long as it proves their case research and discussions on the use of cannabis highlight various issues ttention is drawn to indications that in the current global context cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug is spreading in certain regions and in some regions the age of onset of use is declining2 costa 2003 united nations office for drug control and crime prevention 2000 available research data suggest similar trends in south africa at least in certain communitiesregionssectors and since the early 1990s da rocha silva 2004 parry myers morojele flisher bhana donson plüddemann 2004 united nations office on drugs and crime 2003 brook whiteman finch morojele cohen 2002 international narcotics control board 2002 united nations office on drugs and crime 2002 unit ed nations office for drug control and crime prevention 1999 in south africa attention has also been drawn to the wide accessibility of cannabis cannabis is generally the cheapest of available illicit drugs in south africa united nations office for drug control and crime prevention 1999 users can either buy it from the black market at about r5 per matchbox or r10 per bank bag or they cultivate it themselves in any space available the following statistics parry 2002696 underline the w ide accessibility of cannabis in south africa between 1991 and 2000 the south african narcotics bureau 2 it is important to take cognisance of the following cautionary note in the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002101 obviously use patterns are not immediately comparable from one country to another not only because of cultural differences but because the systems for collecting data on use patterns do not all measure the same things in the same way or even for the same period 2south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis arrested 38 814 people on charges related to the possession of cannabis and 59 539 for dealing in cannabis indeed cannabis is widely cultivated in south africa ahmed 2001 united nations office for drug control and crime prevention 1999 for some south africans the cultivation of cannabis has become source of income whic h they have to protect even with their lives cannabis is grown for the local as well as overs eas market the south african police service for example reports that cannabis is export ed from south africa to inter alia the united kingdom and the netherlands it is shipped out by air or by sea regular police raids on plantations in kwazulunatal and the ea stern cape indicate that the cultivation of cannabis is flourishing especially in deep rural are as ahmed 2001 limited resources and the rough terrain in deep rural areas hamper efforts at detecting and stemming cultivation united nations office for drug control and crime prevention 1999 although various studies have confirmed the positive medical potential of cannabis many scientists are adamant that alternative drugs that do not lead to dependence are equally effective and are already available in the market canadian senate s pecial committee on illegal drugs 2002 department of tourism sport and recreation 2001 world hea lth organization 1997 advocates for the medical use of smoked cannabis frequently claim that it reduces nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy countera cts the wasting syndrome associated with aids and helps in the treatment of glauc oma however they fail to mention the negative side effects of cannabis use eg negative c ardiovascular effects negative effects on the lungs and undesirable mental and behavioural effects another issue brought to the fore in discussions of cannabis is its psychoactive nature cannabis has been shown to affect perception mood cognition behaviour or motor function when ingested kalant 2004 canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 united nations international drug control programme 1997 related to this issue are discussions about the risks that cannabis use may pose for the user and the community in this regard skidelsky 200356 observes that although smoking cannabis is in some respects less risky than drinking alcohol eating dope is serious business when cannabis is ingested the effects are felt more intensely last much longer and are good deal harder to predict in the parlance of drugtaking losing it completely becom real possibility in south africa the effectsconsequences of cannabis use have raised c oncern in various circles based on situation analysis of drug use in low resourced and lowincome 3south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis setting in kwazulunatal in south africa mathe 20033 for example comments as follows while developed countries are concerned about more sophisticated drugs such as lsd ecstasy heroin and cocaine in the lowresourced settings of sout h africa cannabis is the drug that merits attention since it is the most asily available and affordable drug to the poor and it is to some extent responsible for the high failure rate dropping out of school unemployment and even rampant preventable diseases that lead to high death rate although the accumulated body of knowledge on the outcomes or effectsconsequen ces of cannabis use has facilitated certain generalisations researchers caution against simplistic and finite generalisations and especially generalisations that characteri cannabis as necessarily or intrinsically having adverse outcomes or for that matter blame c annabis use as for example the root cause of various adverse conditions attention is drawn to the com plexity and variability of the relationship between the use of cannabis and various adverse conditions or for that matter outcomes of such use generally and in line with public health ph conception of drug use the point is made that the outcomes of cannabis use are function of combination of interrelated factors such as the pharmacologic nature of the drug the psychosocial characteristics of the user and the environmental circumstances in which usage is initiated and maintained da rocha silva 2004 canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 ph conception of cannabis use is suit ed to the increasing prominence that is given in south african public policy making to preventative rather than reactive deterrentpunitive and integrated solutions to socioeconomic problems recent policy documents that emphasise preventative and integra ted solutions include the reconstruction and development programme of 1994 the national crime prevention strategy ncps of 1996 the 1997 white paper for social welfare the integrated and sustainable rural development strategy isrds of 2002 and the 1998 white paper on safety and security moreover the ph conception allows agencies concerned with countering adverse effectsconsequences of cannabis use such as the international narcotics control board 2003 the united nations office for drug cont rol and crime prevention 1999 and the new economic partnership for africas deve lopment nepad to link the issue of preventative and integrated solutions to efforts towards facilitating social development as called for in the white paper for social welfare 1997 4south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis the use production and distribution of cannabis are overseen by internationa l conventions such as the united nations single convention on narcotic drugs of 1961with cannabis designated as an illicit drug however pressure towards more liberal approach has mounted in countries such as australia canada and the united k ingdom canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 in contrast strong opposi tion towards adopting more liberal policies in respect of the use production and distribution of cannabis generally prevails in african countries international narcotics control board 2003 against the above background subsequent paragraphs discuss in more detail the composition of cannabis its cultivation and in particular the rationa behind such cultivation methods of use health and socioeconomic risks vulnerabili ty to usage and adverse effectsconsequences as well as policy related to the use production and distribution of cannabis to facilitate perspective and comprehensiveness availabl information regarding the south african context as well as selected other countrie s on the african continent and abroad is considered 3 composition of cannabis cannabis is simply the hemp plant cannabis sativa canadian senate spe cial committee on illegal drugs 2002 hanson venturelli 1998 du toit 1978 cannabis is known by large variety of names among the different ethnic groups socioeconomic classes nd locations in south africa eg grass joint boom zol dope skyf we ed hash mojat and poison customer must know the lingua franca of the people in hishe r specific location to be trusted enough as trader or customer and do business in public places cannabis sativa grows in many parts of the world hanson and venturelli 1998 state that although most botanists agree that there is only one specie s sativa and that all the variants indica americana and africana belong to that species ot hers believe that the variants are three distinct species indica is considered to have the most potent resin but climate soil and selective plant breeding all influence potency cannabis is dioecious which means it has male and female plants there are more than 400 known chemicals in the cannabis plant the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 200277 notes classified in the pharmacopoeia as hallucinogenic psychodysleptic or psychotomimetic cannabis is disrupter or modulator that is to say that it alters 5south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis perceptions and emotions classified in the international conventions as narcotic cannabis belongs to the class of psychotropics which comprises five major groups depressants alcohol valium stimulants minor coffee nicotine and major cocaine amphetamines disrupters cannabis lsd antipsychotics and dication for mood disorders lithium the main psychoactive mindaltering agent in cannabis is delta9tet rahydrocannabinol thc some varieties of cannabis are less toxic than others furthermore thc is most concentrated in the flowering tops and upper leaves of the female plant the average concentration of thc is 75 however in female plants that have been bred without pollination such as sinsemilla one of the most potent varieties t he concentration can be 24 indeed sinsemilla and other potent varieties of cannabis are partic ularly traded in the black market and fetch higher price conditions such as type of seed soil moisture and fertility amount of sunlight and temperature affect the amount of active ingredients in the plant hanson venturelli 1998 the most potent varieties thrive better in hot upland climates the thc content of the cannabis grown in south africa is reported to be generally comparatively high united nations office for drug control and crime prevention 199924 thc accumulates in the fatty body tissue and readily spreads in the innervated tissues of the brain canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 it reac hes peak in the blood plasma in less than nine minutes and falls to about 5 after one hour psychoactive effects generally last two to seven hours after use it is discharged from the body at very slow rate with traces of one joint remaining in t he body for up to three weeks canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 eddy 1995 the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 200283 also cauti ons that not much is known about the interaction between thc and other factors substance s conditions of the body when ingesting cannabis noting in all we do not know how the effects of thc concentration interact with personal factors way of smoking health sta alcoholism or medication however it is likely that the same thc concentrati on does not have the same effect on all smokers 4 history of the cultivation of cannabis the first known record of cannabis use is found in the book of drugs written by the chinese emperor shen nung in about 2737 bc cannabis was prescribed for treating gout m alaria 6south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis gas pains and absentmindedness the chinese were the first people to docume nt cannabis use as indicated in their book rhya which was published in the 15th century they referred to the cannabis plant as ma maw which means valuabl or endearing for thousands of years they produced fibre for clothes and medicine from it the nega tive effects of the plant were also documented by the chinese around 500 bc they observed that youngsters became wild and disrespectful from the recreational use of canna bis hence some referred to the plant as the liberator of which led to its banning in china however because of rampant use it was later legalised the ancient greeks also knew about cannabis galen described the genera l use of hemp in cakes which when eaten in excess were narcotic herodot us described the scythian custom of burning cannabis seeds and leaves to produce narcotic smoke in steam baths it was believed that breathing this smoke caused frenzied activity groups of people would stand in the smoke and laugh and dance as it took effect in india cannabis formed an essential part of religious ceremonies for thous ands of years the rig veda and other chants describe the use of soma which is believed to be some variety of cannabis early writings describe ritual in which resin was collected from the plants in assyria records reveal that by the year 650 bc azulla some drug was used for making rope and cloth azulla was also consumed to induce euphoria there is clarity as to how this drug was transported into africa but it has been suggested that it came by way of india and saudi arabia it is beli eved that the spaniards transported the plant to the west as source of fibre and seed the ca nadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002112 also notes although not indigenous to africa the cannabis plant is part of religious m edical and cultural traditions across almost the entire continent in egypt it has been grown for over 1 000 years while the first evidence of its presence in ce ntral and southern africa dates back to 14th century ethiopia where ceramic smokingpipes containing traces of cannabis were discovered in north africa cannabis influenced m usic literature and even certain aspects of architecture since in s ome homes room was set aside for kif or cannabis where family members gathered to sing dance and tell stories the plant was also used as remedy for snake bite hotte ntots to facilitate childbirth sotho and as remedy for anthrax malaria blackwater fever and blood poisoning former rhodesia the united nations office for drug control and crime prevention 199921 also c omments that in various countries in africa including south africa cannabis has probably grown wild and perhaps been cultivated and used for narcotic purposes for hundreds of years du 7south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis toit 1978 states that when whites under the dutch east india company s ettled in the cape of good hope in 1652 cannabis was already being smoked by various indigenous groups including the khoikhoi and san it was known as dagga furthermore there are indications that in the kwazulunatal province in south africa cannabis has been c ultivated and used by many generations since centuries ago it is furthermore important to note vidence presented at 1998 meeting of heads of national drug law enforcement agencies in africa that south africa is one of the largest producers of cannabis in the world united nations office for drug control and crime prevention 1999 5 rationale for the cultivation of cannabis cannabis is cash crop the united nations office for drug control and crim prevention 199927 for example comments in 1998 report on trafficking trends in africa t hat cannabis has become cash crop grown not only to supply the increasing market of the youth in major cities of the african continent but also for export ma inly to europe and north america the cannabis plant is weed that requires little care it grows we ll almost everywhere and thrives well in temperate regions it resists pests and therefore requires pesticide it develops deep roots and when its leaves fall off they produce minerals nd nitrogen which are returned to the soil it can be planted in the same soil for up to 20 years in row without any noticeable depletion of the soil although fertilisers and care in the cultivat ion of cannabis are inclined to add to its potency its costeffective production and hi gh yield make mockery of any attempt to seek an alternative crop for the producers f urthermore while the nutritional value and the clothing and paper produced from the plant can be obta ined from alternative products the economic value of cannabis on the black market where it is traded for its psychoactive effect is generally unsurpassable it is also ge nerally expensive in countries such as canada to obtain cannabis for therapeutic purposes even though cannabis has been cultivated for economic purposes for many years throughout south africawith the main areas being kwazulunatal and the eastern cape where it grows easilylittle is known about the exact amount of cannabis that is cultivated ahmed 2001 united nations office for drug control and crime prevention 1999 du toit 1978 it is an open secret that cannabis is illegally cultiva ted in some open spaces and at gravesites around townships such as soweto and katlehong in gauteng users ever so 8south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis often use whatever space is available to cultivate cannabisplant pots backyards and unsuspecting employers gardens among flowers and vegetables indeed cannabis i n urban and rural south africa is almost as commonly available as snuff despi the efforts of the south african police service to destroy cannabis fields in south afric cultivators continue their cannabis production with some being prepared to protect their fields with their lives the following reasons for the production of cannabis have been advanced nutritional value the seed serves as food gruel which resembles oatmeal can be prepared from t he seed the leaves of the plant contain much roughage while the seeds are good sourc of protein and oil without saturated fat thus reducing the risk of heart attack production of clothes the fibre of the hemp plant can be woven into any kind of cloth much of the cotton material used for clothing in canada is produced from hemp in fact the first levis blue jeans were produced from hemp however as it takes much manual labour to convert the he mp into usable fibre and fishnets and other equipment used in the process tend t be in short supply alternative fibres have come to replace the cannabis plant production of paper the stalk of the hempcannabis plant has two parts namely the bas t fibre and the hurd pulp the first paper to be produced in ancient china was from hemp fibre pa per is thin tough and bit rough whereas pulp paper is less strong than fibre paper but easier to make softer thicker and preferable for most everyday purposes spruit van laar 1997 medicaltherapeutic use cannabis has long history of medical use in various countries grinspoon bakalar 1993 cannabis was used to treat

the early 1800s united states physicians used cannabis extracts to produce tonic for both medi cinal and recreational purposes however in 1937 its use as an intoxicant wa s prohibited by the 9south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis marijuana tax act nevertheless in the same year tinctures of cannabis were still cited in the united states pharmacopeia and national formularys list of therapeutic drugs until 1937 nerve tonic produced from the cannabis plant was legally retail ed in south africa for many years mankind here attached medicinal value to the cannabis plant and used it for many ailments such as epilepsy asthma heart ttack multiple sclerosis and cancer spruit van laar 1997 some religious groups such as the rastafari ans refer to it as the holy plant that induces calmness and inner peace some tradit ional healers eg ngaka malopo and some indigenous religious leaders in south africa also assert tha t cannabis helps people to see into the future and to hear voices of prophecy this is in keeping w ith hanson and venturellis 1998372 statement subjective euphoric effect associated with marijuana use is the ongoing social psychological experiences

mg codein hall degenhardt 2003 bagshaw hagen 2002 campbell tramer carrol 2001 however according to these authors some patients re port adverse psychotropic effects from these cannabinoids hanson and venturelli 1998 also not that the painrelieving potency of cannabis has not been carefully studied and compared with the painrelieving properties of other analgesics such as the narcotics or spirintype drugs indeed various researchers have emphatically stated that cannabis and re lated products must be rigorously tested for toxicity and therapeutic effectiveness process which is time consuming expensive and not worthwhile if other drugs are already available t hat offer therapeutic efficacy comparable to or better than the marijuana substa nces in addition concerns about the abuse potential and the social stigma associated w ith marijuana need to be considered hanson venturelli 1998385 x1antinausea effect cannabis thc or related drugs have often been used for the symptomatic rel ief of extreme nausea and vomiting that tend to accompany cancer chemotherapy hall degenhardt 2003 in canada in the late 1970s and early l980s for example cannabis wa s used medically by hundreds of patients mainly in the form of synthetic tetrahydroc annabinol in state projects for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in cancer c hemotherapy this practice was however discontinued because each state program had to comply w ith an enormous federal paperwork burden that was more than the physicians and administrators involved could bear grinspoon 1998386 hall and degenhardt 2003 further state that newer antiemetics such as ondansetron appear to provide better control over nausea and vomiting than drocanna binol with fewer adverse effects there may be value in exploring the effica cy of combining ondansetron and drocannabinol to manage poorly controlled or delayed vomiting hall degenhardt 2003 12south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis 6 methods of use the united nations office for drug control and crime prevention 19991920 notes that in africa cannabis is most commonly smoked although it is also processed into cannabis paste by pounding the plant and adding water hashi sh by scraping the resin off the leaves and then compressing and cannabis oil distilled from the seeds processed cannabis derivatives are added to various foods and beverages including local gin and in some african countries cannabi s can also be taken as an infusion and smoked in mixture with cocaine c rack cocaine or heroin in south africa it is also mixed with crushed methaqualone tablets known as white pipe miranda 1998 observes that in south africa cannabis is most often prepa red as tobaccolike mixture which is smoked in pipe or rolled into ci garette ordinary tobacco pipes are sometimes used but brokenoff bottle tops sometimes known as green pipes are more common the mouths of these pipes are blocked with tightly coiled silver paper from cigarette packs other pipes used for cannabis are quite bizarre with some taking the same shape as bottlenecks but are made of leather copper and many other mat erials including ornamental wood cannabis can also be eaten in cakes or taken in liquid form as some type of tea some youths in the rural areas in south africa add methylated spirits to the drug in order to give it quick kick when used in the latter form it is sniffed 7 health and socioeconomic risks of cannabis use views and research findings on the health and socioeconomic risks of ca nnabis useor for that matter adverse effectsconsequencesare varied and even conflicting on occasion in the late 1930s for example cannabis was classified as narcotic in the united states it was declared killer drug that also causes insanity but by 1944 scienti sts from the new york academy of medicine declared that cannabis was not the killer that many thought it to be in 1992 abood and martin wrote cannabis was mistakenly considered narcoti c like opium and legal authorities treated it as such hanson venturelli 1998368 whereas solomon as cited by hanson and venturelli 1997365 found that those who had been smoking cannabis for years showed mental or physical deterioration that may be attributed to the drug abood and martin 1992 found that an acute dose of cannabis could produce adve rse reactions ranging from mild anxiety to panic and paranoia in some users 13south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis the varying quality of cannabis and the fact that it is impossible t know the amount of drug taken without analyzing the original material and the leftover st ub or roach are some of the factors that complicate research and decisions regarding the health and socioeconomic risks of cannabis hanson venturelli 1998370 indeed the effect s of cannabis use are mediated by the dose and concentration of the thc ingested the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 in canada als notes the following complicating factors in discussions about the effects of cannabis first while the effect of thcthe main active component in cannabison the central and pe ripheral nervous system has been established fairly clearly there is uncertaint as to the effects of the other chemicals in cannabis second research on the effects of cannabis tends to be based on experiments with animals and molecules extracted for experimental purposes third decisions regarding the effects of cannabis generally do not go beyond identifying statistical association between cannabis and other factors which association does not necessarily indicate causal relationship fourth the complexity of the human body and in particular the interactive relationship between various aspects of the body and between the human body and the environment in which it operates make it difficult to go beyond making arbitrary or fragmentary decisions about the effectsconsequences of cannabis us fifth the effects of cannabis use are also influenced by number of other factors such as the length of time cannabis has been taken the route of administration the frequency of use the users experience and expectations concerning the use of cannabis and other drugs the age of onset of use the context of use and whether other drugs are used in combination with the cannabis concern has consequently been expressed about indications that presentday cannabis can be about 20 times more potent than the marijuana on the s treet in the 1960s and 1970s hanson venturelli 1998365 the canadian senate special commi ttee on illegal drugs 200281 however cautions against glib conclusions about the potency of presentday cannabis noting that the main change has been in maximum concentrations obtained as result of sophisticated crossbreeding and cultivation methods where as average concentrations have not significantly changed over the past 30 years the c oncern about the concentration of presentday cannabis particularly relates to indicat ions that comparatively high concentrations of cannabis smoke contain all the consti tuents of tobacco 14south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis smoke except nicotine including carbon monoxide bronchial irritants and carci nogens furthermore unlike tobacco nicotine intake the ingestion of cannabinoids ca n have adverse psychiatric effects and like alcohol intake it is likely t result in acuteshortterm and longterm physical and psychological damage as physiologically developing persons have lower resistance the harm that young peopleespecially those of chi ldbearing age can experience from cannabis use can have repercussions not only for them but also for the children they may bear kalant 2004 notwithstanding various factors complicating research and decisions about t he effectsconsequences of cannabis use review of the available lit erature on the subjectand in particular literature on the adverse effectsconsequencespoints to va rious generalisations or consistencies that will be discussed in the following paragraphs t he complexity and variability of the subject across time place and individuals howeve r caution against finite interpretation of these generalisations indeed accentuate the importanc of ongoing and progressively more rigorous research 71 shortterm or acute effects of cannabis use when cannabis smoke is inhaled thc the psychoactive ingredient rapidly leaves the blood through metabolism and is taken up in the tissues thc which is fat soluble and its metabolites tend to combine with proteins in the blood and remain s tored in body fats for long periods whereas it may take up to 30 days to completely elim inate thc after single dose measurable levels of thc in the blood of chronic users have been tected weeks after they have taken the last dose when cannabis is smoked thc absorption in the lungs and its transportation to the brain are rapid thc reaches the brain within as littl as 14 seconds after inhalation cannabis is metabolised more efficiently through smoking than through intravenous injection or oral ingestion it is also more potent hanson venturelli 1998 the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002139 describes the acute or shortterm effects of cannabis as those that are produced immedi ately after use and while the psychoactive effects are being experienced these effects corre spond to what has been described as cannabis intoxication and are generally divided into somatic psychological and psychomotor effects somatic effects include cardiovasc ular effects such as increased heart rate b bronchopulmonary effects that are simila r to those of 15south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis tobacco c ocular effects such as redness of eyes and conjunctival irri tation and d other effects such as dry mouth due to decreased saliva secretion increas ed appetite due to drop in blood sugar level and sometimes nausea vomiting diarrhoea and urine re tention psychological and psychomotor effects that have been reported include diminished shortterm memory disturbances in psychomotor performance such as diminished ability t concentrate slower reflexes and reaction time impaired coordination of movements and diminished ability to perform complex tasks at comparatively high doses and in the case of users who are unfamiliar with the effects of cannabis unpleasant experiences are reported such as anxiety panic delusions hallucinations depression paranoia and even acut psychosis hall degenhardt 2003 canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 rey tennant 2002 hall degenhardt linskey 2001 drugscope 2001 cannabis intoxicati on generally consists of two phases high phase followed by coming down phase user becomes high after forcibly holding cannabis smoke in the lungs for few minutes being high entails experiencing various changes including changes in mood and intellectualcognitive functioning as well as sensory and physical somatic changes it is important to note though that in his review of research findings on the effe cts of cannabis use kalant 2004 observes that although cognitive impairments of various types re readily demonstrable during acute cannabis intoxication there is suitable evidenc for concluding that longlasting functional losses can result from chronic and comparably hea vy cannabis use during persons adult years changes in mood may include feelings of euphoria well being being carefree and calm hilaritygaiety talkativeness soc iability and greater interpersonal empathy have also been observed changes in intellectual funct ions generally include increased selfconfidence feeling of being able to perform tas ks more easily and distortion of time space and selfimage sensory changes may entai l increased sensory perception eg of colour and sound and stronger tactile impressions physic changes that manifest may include dry mouth elevated heartbeat loss of coordination and loss of sense of balance coupled with slower reaction times the accelerat ed heartbeat could trigger anxiety and panic attacks palpitations reduced exercise tolerance i n persons with heart conditions and even contribute to the development of heart problems in persons who are predisposed to heart problems in fact in humans cannabis causes both va sodilation enlarged blood vessels and an increase in heart rate related to the amount of thc consumed abood martin 1992 the vasodilation is responsible for reddening the eyes w hich is 16south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis often seen in cannabis smokers when vasodilation is caused by canna bis use an abnormally low blood pressure can occur when one is standing and if the user sta nds up quickly after smoking lightheadedness or fainting may result it has been found that ca nnabis products bind haemoglobin thus limiting the amount of oxygen that can be carried to the heart tissue this deficiency could trigger heart attacks in susceptible people pal fai jankiewics 1991 the effect of cannabis on people with heart rhythm irregularities is not yet known the impaired coordination and reaction time that follow cannabis intoxica tion can be hazardous when driving car operating heavy machinery flying plane or engaging in othe r activities that require good coordination and reflexes as well as quick judgement the intensity of these effects varies based on the dose and concentration of thc and whether other drugs such as lsd andor psychedelic magic mushrooms are used t ogether with the cannabis hanson venturelli 1998 world health organization 1997 in his review of the literature on the effects of cannabis use kalant 2004 draws attent ion to evidence of causal role of acute cannabis intoxication in motor vehicle and other accidents the south african medical research council has also reported that laboratory sc reening for cannabis of patients presenting at five trauma units in three cities in south africa over three years 19992001 showed that between 241 and 427 of the patients tested positive across sites and over time between 330 and 545 of male trauma patients t ested positive for at least one drug excluding opiates which was mostly cannabis andor methaqualone the state of euphoria resulting from the high phase in cannabis intoxicati on is usually mild or shortlived typical high from one joint may last two to three hours the coming down phase tends to be characterised by feeling of sluggishness and drowsi ness that disappears gradually 72 longterm effectsconsequences of cannabis use reported longterm adverse effectsconsequences of chronicor for that matter comparatively intenseheavycannabis use generally relate to especial ly the respiratory system carcinogenicity the immune system the endocrine system reproduc tive functions the cardiovascular system and the risk of becoming dependent on the drug ll degenhardt 2003 canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 swift ll 17south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis 2002 socioeconomic adverse consequences have however also been reported espe cially in comparatively poor socioeconomic contexts effects on the respiratory system inhalation of smoke can cause serious damage to the lungs smoke is mixture of tiny particles suspended in gas mostly carbon monoxide these solid particl combine to form residue called tar because cannabis smoke is inhaled more deeply tha n tobacco smoke even more tar residue may be retained hanson venturelli 1998 consroe sandyk 1992 the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002144 notes that the percentage of tar deposited in the lungs is higher after smoking cannabis 80 than after inhaling tobacco 64 and the deposits are even greater for cannabis with lower concentration of thc probably because smokers draw on the joint more the national institute of health 1999 in the united states further mentions that laboratory and clinical evidence have shown that cannabis use can resul t in cellular changes and contribute to respiratory problems such as laryngitis pharyngitis bronchitis asthmalike conditions coughing hoarseness and dry throat evidence suggests that many year old smokers of both cannabis and tobacco have lung damage comparable to that found in long term tobacco smokers however although it is clear that the tar from cannabis and tobacco respectively has damaging effects it is not clear whether smokers who use both cannabis and tobacco suffer synergistic or additive effects hanson venturelli 1998 jones 1980 carcinogenic and immune system effects cannabis smoke has been found to increase the risk of cancerous tumours alt hough the need for more rigorous research into the issue is emphasised canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 this risk is associated with inter alia t he fact that cannabis smoke contains carcinogenic ingredients such as benzopyrene and in higher concentrati on than in the case of tobacco smoke canadian senate special committee on ill egal drugs 2002 indeed drugscope 2001 notes that cannabis smoke has been shown to be more important risk factor than tobacco and alcohol use in the early development of respiratory cancers furthermore although thc itself does not seem to be carcinogenic it has been found to alter the function of certain cells such as macrophages that ttack foreign bodies the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002146 for example notes the data available seems to indicate that the consequences of chronic and intense cannabis use 18south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis several joints per day for several years are similar to those of c igarettes in terms of carcinogenic risks for the respiratory tract as well as the mouth the t ongue and the esophagus kalant 2004 further notes that chronic inflammatory and precancerous cha nges in the airways have been demonstrated in cannabis users because th c can change the function of cells that neutralise foreign bodies eg bacteria it has be suggested as having an immunosuppressive effect on the human body although in some experimental s tudies on animals it has been shown to stimulate the immune system canadia n senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 effects on sexual performance and reproduction drugs including cannabis may alter sexual behaviour affect fertility and damage the chromosomes of germ cells in both male and female users the first scientific report that refers to cannabis in this respect was written by the indian hemp commission it states that cannabis has sexually stimulating effect like alcohol yet is used by asian india n ascetics to diminish sexual appetite this apparent discrepancy may be doserela ted effect because when used occasionally over the short term cannabis may act as n aphrodisiac by releasing the central nervous system inhibitions furthermore under the influence of cannabi s ones perception of time is often altered and this could make the pleasura ble sensations appear to last longer than they actually do cannabis affects the sympathetic nervous system increasing vasodilation in the genitals and thus delaying ejaculation cannabis how ever has several effects on semen the total number of sperm cells and the concentrati on of sperm per unit volume are decreased during ejaculation moreover there is an increase i n the proportion of sperm with abnormal appearance these qualities are usually associa ted with lower fertility and higher probability of producing an abnormal embryo should fertilisation ta ke place high doses over period of time lead to depression of libido and im potence possibly due to the decreased amount of testosterone the male sex hormone hanson venturelli 1998 various studies have shown that cannabis use during pregnancy can result in intra uterine growth retardation kalant 2004 nahas latour 1992 fernandezruiz et 1992 indeed in his review of research on the health effects of cannabis use kalant 2004 draws attention to the growing body of evidence that indicates subtle but seemingly permanent effects on memory information processing and executive functions in the offspring of women who used cannabis during pregnancy 19south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis mental health effects number of studies have noted an association between cannabis use and various mental disorders such as mood disorders and depressive episodes anxiety disorders pers onality disorders and conditions such as psychosis and schizophrenia kalant 2004 arse neault et 2002 canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 rey tennant 2002 the length of time cannabis is used and the dose ingested are sa id to mediate the relationship between cannabis use and mental disorders more recently kalant 2004 points to several studies that ascribe ca usal role to cannabis in the onset or relapse of schizophrenia arseneault et 2002 furthermore underline that number of studies have shown that earlyadolescent cannabis use represents greater risk for schizophrenia outcomes than later cannabis use dependence the expert committee on drug dependence of the world health organization who defines drug dependence as follows canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002153 state psychic and sometimes also physical resulting from the interaction between living organism and drug characterized by behavioural and other responses that always include compulsion to take the drug on continuous or periodic basi s in order to experience its psychic effects and sometimes to avoid the discomfort of its absence tolerance may or may not be present person may be dependent on more than one drug in terms of this definition and his review of the literature since 1996 kalant 2004 concurs with reviews by for example the who 1997 and the canadian senate spec ial committee on illegal drugs 2002 that some cannabis users develop cannabis dependence syndrome socioeconomic consequences various studies in south africa and abroad report that chronic users of cannabi s among especially socioeconomic disadvantagedmarginalized persons and offenders deve lop social adjustment difficulties eg impaired family relationships poor occupati onal and educational performance as well as involvement in criminal activity such as tra ding in illicit drugs property crime violence eg rape and gang life da rocha silva 2004 fli sher et 2003 world health organization 1997 they also draw attention to resea rch findings 20south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis showing that poor occupational performance and social interactional difficult ies can accompany cannabis dependence cannabis use during the pre adolescent years has been shown to contribute towards impaired educational performanceattainment and social development inde ed various studies have shown that the more intenseheavy and the earlier the age of onset of drug use including the onset of cannabis usethe greater the likelihood that the use r will progress to multiple drug use lifestyle to longterm drugcannabis use to drugc annabis dependence and to drugcrime lifestyle da rocha silva 2004 lynskey coffey degenhardt ca rlin patton 2003 world health organization 2003 brook et 2002 canadian senat special committee on illegal drugs 2002 guthrie et 2000 united nations offi ce for drug control and crime prevention 2000 world health organization 1997 the progression from the onset of cannabis use to outcomes such as multiple drug use and drugcrime lifestyle has however been found to be function of complex interac tion between inter alia the availability of various drugs the characteristics of the i ndividuals and the environment concerned da rocha silva 2004 canadian senate special committ ee on illegal drugs 2002 world health organization 1997 8 vulnerability to cannabis use and associated adverse effectsconsequences du toit 1978 reports that initially south african whites associate d cannabis smoking primarily with the indigenous african populations and secondarily with l ower socioeconomic lifestyle devoid of christian values and characterised by degradation and escapism in the form of mindaltering experiences by the early 1970s ho wever researchers observed the extensive use of cannabis among the youth of all racial groups in south africa du toit 1978 notes that it was not unusual for young south africans of whate ver ethnic background to smoke cannabis at parties he further comments that while merican students were heartily experimenting with uppers and downers and lsd their whi south african counterparts were cautiously breaking the cannabis barrier and while state legislatures and the highest office in the united states were talking of legalising the use of cannabis in south africa it was classified with heroin opium and lsd as an ille gal dependenceproducing drug 21south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis available research suggests that in south africaas in various other frican countriesthe cannabis consumer market has broadened and new patterns of use have come to the fore usage which used to be largely reserved to males older age groups and particular occasions has increasingly spread to all age groups and to being use d in variety of ways and occasions as well as for range of reasons da rocha silva 2004 fl isher et 2003 southern african development community 2002 united nations office for drug control and crime prevention 1999 it also cuts through all socioeconomic classes from the poor to the wealthy while the poor tend to use it in its purest form as gre pipe people from other socioeconomic classes tend to use it together with other drugs such as methaqualone mandrax in which case it is referred to as white pipe the increase in the general level of cannabis use can be expected to be accompanied by general increase in associated problems world health organizat ion 1993 the 2002 annual report of the southern african development community sadc regional drug control programme for example notes that the increase in cannabis use am ong young people has created new situation in which cannabis abuse is as serious threat to the wellbeing of the youth in the region in addition the medical researc h councils south african community epidemiology network on drug use sacendu has observe d with regard to admissions to drugrelated treatment centres in gauteng and cape town that persons admitted for problems related to cannabis use between 2000 and 2002 tended to be younger than 20 years rather than older various studies have shown that complex combination of individual and environmental factors contributes to an increase in the level of cannabis use and associated problems in community da rocha silva 2004 united nations office for drug control and crime prevention 1999 national study among detainees in police stations in south africa for example found that as population density and level of formal housing increased in neighbourhood eg magisterial district so did the probability decrease of gender differences in cannabis consumption and b greater population density in neighbourhood increased the probability of individuals experiencing violent encounters eg threatsstabbing with 22south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis knife with these encounters in turn increasing the probability of the individuals concerned taking cannabis da rocha silva 2004 furthermore number of studies on the african continent have shown that drug use including cannabis use and associated problems inter alia arise and are maintained within context of limited socioeconomic opportunities although affluence does not necessarily provide insulation against cannabis use and associated problems da rocha silva 2004 united nations office for drug control and crime prevention 1999 on the level of the individual emphasis is placed on for example t he normalisation3 of cannabis use as contributor to increased cannabis use and assoc iated problems ie integrating it into daytoday activities and using it for reasons other than those traditionally accepted and well regulated canadian senate specia l committee on illegal drugs 2002 calafat 2000 study of drug use in ten african countries uni ted nations office for drug control and crime prevention 199973 notes in this respect that weakening of social norms against drug including cannabis use has bee n occurring and this process is driven by the functional use of drugs hist orically in the countries covered cannabis consumption has been principally male prac tice though this is starting to change with consumption now reaching increa singly into different gender age and religious groups at least part of the expansion of consumer groups is due to the rise in functional use of cannabis the functional use includes use by those doing physically demanding or dangerous work those confronting social danger which applies to work that involves transgress ion of taboos those wishing to escape conditions of social andor personal misery when cannabis is cultivated at homewhether for trading consumption or rel igious andor personal reasonsthere is very little chance of preventing the onset of canna bis use among children and postponing the age of first use street children irrespectiv of their age have also been found to be particularly at risk of using cannabis resea rchers have also observed that children under the age of 16 who smoke cigarettes also tend to use cannabis other illicit 3 the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002110 notes that trivialization of cannabis consumption has been noticed and imputed to reduction in the perception of cannabisrelated risks and greater availability aside from trivialization there is also an acculturation aspect the idea that cannabis will eventually be considered psychoactive substance akin to alcohol and tobacco whose risks we learn to recognize and manage 23south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis drugs are almost never used by youths unless they have first used cannabis w orld health organization 1997 using cannabis places the youth in the company and under the influence of those who use andor deal with illicit drugs it may also resul t in other dangerous and illegal activities the following categories of young people have also been identified as bei ng most vulnerable to cannabis use young people from povertystricken families these are children who use cannabi s as means of escaping conditions at home such as hunger fights etc young people from abusive families cannabis is hallucinogen which provides n escape from reality and temporary solution to ones problemtrouble young people from homes where parental discipline is lacking among these are homes where parents work far from home and are therefore not in position to monit or their childrens behaviour as well as in families where parents do not care about the whereabouts of their children young people who bow to peer pressure persons who are susceptible to pee r pressure may smoke cannabis in order to be acceptable to their peers young people who attend private schools such persons have been found to have easy access through teachers who supply them with drugs eg cannabis they are also often from wealthy families get big allowances and thus have ample money to spend on drugs the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002166 concludes t hat because of its potential effects on cognitive and psychosocial functions any use of cannabis in those under age 16 is atrisk use and for those between the ages of 16 and 18 heavy use is not necessarily daily use but use in the morning alone or during school activities available research in south africa suggests that lone andor morning use of cannabis may not be uncommon among young people da rocha silva 2004 9 policy on cannabis in selected countries over the past decade arguments in favour of liberating certain patte rns of cannabis use from legal sanctions have been mounting in many countries including in afri ca to make an informed decision about the approach to be adopted locally regarding cannabis this section 24south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis reviews existing policies on cannabis within the wider global context in fact the section first notes the key elements in existing international drug control measuresa s represented in the united nations conventionstreaties on narcotic eg cannabis and psychotropi c substances before reviewing drug policy in africa and more particularly in south afric as well as in selected other regions and countries4 with variable restrictions on cannabis 91 key united nations conventions on narcotic and psychotropic drugs key united nations conventiontreaty concerning the regulation of drugs inc luding cannabis is the single convention on narcotic drugs of 1961 the primary aim of this treaty is to achieve worldwide cooperation in the fight against drug abuse and drug trade for purposes other than medical and scientific purposes spruit van laar 1997 article 28 of the convention which deals with the control of cannabis stipulates the following if party permits the cultivation of cannabis for the production of cannabis resin it shall apply thereto the system of controls as provided in article 23 i n respect of the control of the opium poppy this convention shall not apply to the cultivation of the cannabis plant exclusively for industrial purposes fibre and seed or horticultural purposes the parties shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to prevent the misuse of and illicit traffic in the leaves of the cannabis plant following this convention the plenary meeting of the united nations 6th convention on narcotic and psychotropic drugs which was held on 19 december 1988 adopted the following resolutions united nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances 1988 member states were deeply concerned by the magnitude of and rising trend in the illic it production of demand for and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances which pose serious threat to the health and welfare of human beings and adversely affect the economic cultural and political foundation of society 4 practical constraints with regard to available time and literature influenced the choice of countries included in this analysis 25south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis were deeply concerned by the steadily increasing inroads into various soci groups made by illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and parti cularly by the fact that children are used in many parts of the world as an illicit drugconsuming market and for purposes of illicit production distribution and trade in narcoti c drugs and psychotropic substances which constitute danger of incalculable gravity recognised the links between illicit traffic and other related organised crimina l activities that undermine the legitimate economies and threaten the stability security and sovereignty of states recognised that illicit traffic is an international criminal acti vity the suppression of which demands urgent attention and the highest priority were aware that illicit traffic generates large financial profits and wealth enabling transnational criminal organisations to penetrate contaminate and corrupt t he structures of government legitimate commercial and financial business and society at all levels were determined to deprive persons engaged in illicit traffic of the proceeds of their criminal activities and thereby eliminate their main incentive for so doing desired to eliminate the root causes of the problem of abuse of narcoti c drugs and psychotropic substances including the profits derived from illicit traffic concluded that measures are necessary to monitor certain substances including precursors chemicals and solvents which are used in the manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances the ready availability of which call for international co operation in the suppression of illicit traffic by sea recognised that eradication of illicit traffic is collective res ponsibility of all states and that to that end coordinated action within the framework of internati onal cooperation is necessary reaffirmed the guiding principles of existing treaties in the field of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and the system of control which they embody recognised the need to reinforce and supplement the measures provided in the single convention on narcotic drugs 1961 and the 1971 convention of psychotic 26south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis substances in order to counter the magnitude and extent of illicit traffic and its grave consequences recognised the importance of strengthening and enhancing effective legal ans for international cooperation in criminal matters to suppress the internation criminal activities of illicit traffic and desired to conclude comprehensive effective and operative international c onvention that is directed specially against illicit traffic and that cons iders the various aspects of the problem as whole in particular those aspects not envisaged in the existing treaties in the field of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances according to 2002 report of the international narcotics board 2003 179 member states of the united nations signed the single convention on narcotic drugs of 1961 and 166 member states signed the united nations convention against illicit traffic i n narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances of 1988 92 southern african development community sadc and the african union au in 2001 the drug control committee of the sadc communicated the following po sition regarding the production of cannabis to the sadc council of ministers the sadc drug control committee of representatives from sadc member st ates as instituted by the sadc protocol on combating illicit drugs of 1996 st rongly denounces and rejects the movements to legalise or decriminalise ca nnabis and the cultivation of indian hemp communities are urged to mobilise themselves in protest against the production abuse and trafficking of cannabis or hemp and illici t drugs and to develop legal frameworks drug supply reduction training as well as drug demand reduction activities this position was upheld in subsequent meetings in 2002 and 2003 indeed recent review of drugrelated policies in the sadc region concluded that little support for the decriminalisation of cannabis use seems to prevail united nati ons office on drugs and crime 2003 however this does not mean that the issue has not been thoroughly debated 19982002 review of the sadc drug control programme for example states that lthough total legalisation or decriminalisation of illegal drugs including ca nnabis has never been considered in discussions the issue of provisional legalisation has bee n debated but found 27south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis inappropriate for the following reasons first the limited regulatory capacity of mos t member states made provisional legalisation of illegal drugs and cannabis in particular impractical second member states argued that lenient attitude towards ille gal drugs in some member states would attract producers traffickers and users from other regionscountrie s thus increasing the strain on already heavily burdened health welfare and s ecurity structures third the sadc drug control protocol and united nations drug control conventions restri ct member states from implementing measures that legalise illegal drugs eg ca nnabis in some form or the other the heads of national drug law enforcement agencies and other relevant bodies on the african continent have also pointed out that country in the sadc region has the capacity andor resources to provide control measures to subvert the anticipa ted problem of cannabis being cultivated alongside indian hemp according to the sadc d rug control committee law enforcement emphasised that trafficking in and abuse of cannabis pose threat to security health and socioeconomic development in africa and should thus be countered united nations office on drugs and crime 200317 at the 46th session of the commission on narcotic drugs in 2003 ambassador antonio head of the dele gation of the commission of the african union emphasised need for upholding prevailing legal sanctions regarding cannabis and stated cannabis remains the main concern in africa the issues revolve around illicit cultivation trafficking and abuse as result of the permi ssive use and open sale by some countries in europe and some other countries illicit cul tivation of cannabis in africa is on the increase and an increase in illi cit cultivation of cannabis in africa will surely have ripple

in an international council on alcohol and addictions icaa policy discussion paper the focus of harm reduction is to reduce and prevent the harmful effects of the use of alcohol and other drugs and this goal can be pursued with many strategies including those focused on drugfree living because it is unlikely that totally drugfree society would ever be attainable approaches to harm reduction do not presume abstinence in the shortterm 30south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis active in international agencies concerned with drug control apart from be ing signatory to international conventions on drug control eg single convention on narcotic drugs of 1961 united nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances of 1988 94 north america united states of america and canada because of the comprehensiveness of policy developments in the usa and these developments reflecting to some extent policy developments in canada t his section will discuss policy developments in the usa in more detail than in the case of canada united states of america the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 observes tha t issues related to illegal drugs represent core and complex element in the internal and even external affairs of the usa government the usa government is for example known to play role in united nations efforts at negotiating and enforcing international drug control c onventions although the general approach to drug issues in the usa tends to be prohibit ive to the extent of reflecting war on drugs states and even cities in the usa vary considerably in terms of the extent to which the production distribution and use of drugs including c annabis are prohibited the usa has also not always imposed restrictions on drugs t he use and sale of drugs were for example legal and common in the usa from the mid19th century to the end of the 19th century since the beginning of the 20th century progressively more restrictive drug policies and actions were introduced in the usa these measures varied across statescities notwithstanding federal government efforts to counter difference s eg to avoid policyaction in one statecity impacting negatively on policyaction in others more specifically with the enactment of the harrison narcotic ac t in 1914 the foundation of the usa governments war on drugs was laid this act required anyone selling drugs to be licensed and keep record of sales and b use rs to obtain prescriptions from physicians for medical reasons excluding efforts to keep addicts com fortable or maintain their addiction in combination with successful prosecutions of narcotic suppliers eg physicians and pharmacists these restrictions resulted in diffic ulties in accessing legal supplies of drugs matters worsened with the enactment of the 1970 federa l controlled substances act that categorised drugs in terms of the degree to which restrictions were 31south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis imposed on production distribution possession and use cannabis was identifi ed as schedule i drug that could only be possessed for research purposes that were licensed by the federal government the antidrug abuse amendment act of 1988 furthermore raise d federal penalties for drug including cannabis offences in the 1990s more severe legislative measures against drug dealing were proposed by the usa congress eg to im pose civil liability on drug dealers for the harm caused by the use of controlled s ubstances to increase penalties for drug dealers who involve children in the drug trade and in part icular who use children under 18 years to distribute controlled drugs in or near schools or l ocations such as playgrounds and video arcades notwithstanding petitions to the usa congress to loosen restrictions on the possession of cannabis it remained federal crime eg on the ground tha t cannabis had high potential for abuse and that b individuals tended to take cannabi s in amounts hazardous to their own and others health and safety although the uniform controlled substances act of 1994 set out the prohibited activities in detail t facilitate some legislative consistency across the nation specific fines and sentencing were left to the discretion of individual statescities indeed the federal government could not enforce federal laws at sta city level as result legislative and sentencing discrepancie s developed with some states experimenting with extremely harsh penalties and others cutting sent ences and repealing mandatory minimum sentences for various nonviolent offences in order for example to lessen the cost of drug control on the criminal justice system moreover since the late 1970s medicalrelated cannabis laws were i ncreasingly enacted in states eg laws providing for therapeutic research programm laws allowing patients access to cannabis for medical purposes and laws that rec ognised the medical value of cannabis symbolically indeed under the investigational new drug ind progra mme the usa federal government allowed eight patients with limited range of medical conditions compassionate access to cannabis over the period 19781992 pacula chiriqui reichman 2002 number of individual states also passed legislation that all owed the use of cannabis for medical purposes under conditions similar to those specified in the federal ind programme all of which required federal government approval and oversight by dece mber 2001 32 states allowed the medical use of cannabis 22 allowed the medical use of cannabis in therapeutic research programme and 9 allowed physicians to pres cribe cannabis hall degenhardt 2003 pacula et 2002 32south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis medical use of cannabis was however complicated by various factors t he federal controlled substances acts prohibition of manufacturing and distributing cannabis inhibited legal access to cannabis the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 notes in this respect that since pharmacies did not sell marij uana some distribution centres called buyers clubs emerged but have been hampered by fede ral law enforcement indeed federal enforcement efforts have not thus far targeted indivi duals who possess or cultivate small amounts for medical use only the buye rs clubs also known as compassion clubs have been targeted furthermore although some stat laws allowed physicians to prescribe cannabis physicians were hesitant to do so be cause of the possibility of prosecution by the federal government and b legal liability for ny harm that may be caused to patients for whom they prescribed cannabis it is thus not surpri sing that available data suggest that relatively few patients in the usa use cannabis for medical purposes even in the states with the most liberal laws hall degenhardt 2003 developments with regard to usa policy and law however do not relat to supply reduction only in fact and as noted by the canadian senate special com mittee on illegal drugs 2002 national drugcontrol policy in the usa emphasises prevention education treatment research and supply reduction activities the 2001 annual report of the office of national drug control policy for example states through balanced arra of demand reduction and supplyreduction actions we strive to reduce drug abuse and ava ilability by half and the consequences of drug abuse by at least 25 by 2007 the office of national drug control policy ondcp was established in the late 1980s through the national narcotics leadership act of 1988 the ondcp oversees drug control activiti in the usa with number of federal government departments participating the department of justice being the key role player these departments are expected to cooperate w ith local government agencies and nongovernmental agencies eg community and professional groups strategic goals set by the ondcp include canadian senate speci committee on illegal drugs 2002 educate and enable americas youth to reject illegal drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco increase the safety of americas citizens by substantially reduci ng drugrelated crime and violence reduce health and social costs to the public of illegal drug use 33south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis shield americas air land and sea frontiers from the drug threat finally it is important to note the development of drug courts in the u sa as observed by james and sawka 2000 in their review of the drug court movement in various countries this movement began in the late 1980s in the usa in response to rising rates of drugrelated court cases and the inability of traditional law enforcement and justi ce policies to reduce the supply and demand for illegal drugs it spread to all 50 states nd at the beginning of 2000 there were 700 of these courts reviews of evaluations suggest that drug court s generate cost savings and lower recidivism although researchers caution that more indept h and rigorous analysis is needed to make definitive conclusions about the cost and be nefits of drug courts james sawka 2000 usa drug courts focus on diverting druginvolved offendersespecially first offenders and juveniles and generally not those charged with drug traffickinginto appropriate drugrelated treatment programmes james and sawkes 2001 note drug courts are designed to deal with nonviolent offenders who are offered an opportunit to complete drug treatment program in return for dismissal of charges dive rsion or pre sentencing model or reduction in custody or probation time postsentence m odel in the case of juvenile courts special attention is given to comprehensive intake assessment intervention strategies that counter unconstructive peer influences and gang involvement b assess and attend to family functioning c involve the relevant offenders family members and d incorporate an outreach or home visit component immediate sanctions for noncompliance and rewards for progress and information sharing between court and treatment agents while complying wi th confidentiality requirements canada as in the usa and since the beginning of the 20th century drug policy in canada tended to largely focus on supply reduction canadian senate special committee on il legal drugs 2002 with the establishment in the late 1980s of the national drug s trategyand in 1992 of the canadian drug strategy cdscalls for balanced approach to reduc ing both the 34south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis demand for drugs and their supply were made an analysis of the work of t he cds by the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs in 2002 concluded as follows canada needed comprehensive and coordinated national drug strategy for whi ch the federal government had to provide sound leadership any national drug strategy had to incorporate all psychoactive substanc including alcohol and tobacco to be successful national drug strategy had to involve partnership w ith all levels of government and also with nongovernmental organizations intermittency of funding diminished the ability to coordinate and i mplement the strategy clear objectives for the strategy had to be set out and comprehensi ve evaluations were required there was need for an independent organization to conduct national surveys at least every second year canadas drug strategy had to adopt balanced approach coordination at the federal level had to be given to body that is not an integral part of one of the partner departments commissions of enquiryin particular the dain commission 19691973and legislative initiatives strengthened calls for more balanced and rational or researchbased approach to drug control focusing on supply as well as demand reduction whil considering the benefits of cannabis eg medical use the canadian senate specia l committee on illegal drugs 2002 draws for example attention to the following key findings of the dain commission since in addition to health problems cannabis use entails signi ficant costs to the family to society and to the economy the state has responsibi lity to restrict the availability of harmful substancesand in particular to prevent the expos ure of the young to them such restriction is proper object of the criminal l aw however the criminal law should not be used for the enforcement of morali ty without regard to potential for harm another example is section 10 of the controlled drugs and substances act that came into effect in 1996 which stated that the purpose of sentencing was to contribute to the respect for the law and the maintenance of just peaceful and safe societ while encouraging 35south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis rehabilitation and treatment of offenders and acknowledging the harm done to victims and to the community canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 in 2001 the canadian government passed the marihuana medical access regulat ions mmar which provided for compassionate access to cannabis for seriously ill patients while research regarding its therapeutic value continued the cannabis could be supplied by the government who sourced it from commercial supplier or grown under licenc by the patient or by person designated by the patient in order to protect the consumer safe and efficient measures for the production and distribution of seeds and dried c annabis were considered to obtain compassionate access to cannabis an applicant had to obtain declaration from medical practitioner indicating that the recommended use of cannabis would mitigate the applicants symptoms and that the benefits from the u would outweigh the risks only physicians who had signed the mmar would be asked to supply the seeds and the dried cannabis to their patients the following broad categories of patients would be eligible for the scheme 1 those with terminal illness and life expectancy of less than 12 months 2 patients with multiple sclerosis spinal cord injury or di sease cancer pain aids arthritis or epilepsy and 3 patients with symptoms associated wi th serious medical condition other than those described in categories 1 and 2 where among other things conventional treatments have failed to relieve symptoms of the medica l condition health canada office of cannabis 2002 by april 2002 only some applications for compassionate access had been pproved and patients had been supplied with cannabis under the government programme in august 2002 the new minister for health delayed the full operation of the scheme until clinical trials had demonstrated the safety and efficacy of cannabi s in treating the indicated disorders abraham 2002 according to abraham 2002 this decision was based on the fact that the canadian medical association and the canadian medica l protective association both advised physicians not to prescribe cannabis as there was firm c linical evidence that cannabis was effective for most of the indications for which it could be prescribed the two associations further claimed that practitioners who prescribed cannabis would be legally liable for any adverse effects experienced by patients for whom they presc ribed it hall degenhardt 2003 in conclusion the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 notes 36south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis the mmar are not providing compassionate framework for access to ma rihuana for therapeutic purposes and are unduly restricting the availability of mari juana to patients who may receive health benefits from its use changes are urgently needed with regard to who is eligible to use cannabis for therapeutic purposes and how such people gain access to cannabis research on the safety and efficac of cannabis has not commenced in canada because researchers are unable to obtain the product needed to conduct their trials 95 australia and new zealand as in the case of the earlier analysis of policy and action in the usa and canada this section focuses largely on drug policy in australia the reason is again the fact that new zealand largely emulated developments in australia australia before the 1960s cannabis was little known and used in australia pre1970 efforts to regulate its use however prohibited its cultivation possession and use canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 pressure towards less prohibi tive approach developed after the 1979 report of the south australian royal commission int the non medical use of drugs that recommended that legal sanctions against smallscale cannabis use be removed with the introduction in 1985 of the national campaign against drug abuse the national drug strategy nds in 1993 and the national drug strategic framework in 19981999 focus on public health and harm minimisation materialised the emphasis was on supply reduction international cooperation evaluation and accountability indeed s pecial features of the nds included the following canadian senate special comm ittee on illegal drugs 2002 recognition of the complexity of drug issues the need for attending to licit as well as illicit drugs the need for balanced intervention that considers supply as well as demand reduction and b wide range of intervention options based on evidencebased practice6 6 based on the concept of harm minimisation options could range from abstinenceoriented interventions to programs aimed at ameliorating the consequences of drug use among those who cannot be reasonably expected to stop using drugs at the present time 37south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis the need for intervention sectors eg health law enforcement education non governmental organisations and private industry to work in partnership and the need for providing effective institutional support to intervenors the focus on demand reduction as well as supply reduction relates to vidence of the cost involved in drug production and trafficking the canadian senate special commit tee on illegal drugs 2002 notes in this respect cost of making cannabis illegal is the exposure of cannabis buyers to range of other potentially more harmful illicit drugs which are available for sa another cost is the involvement of organized crime in large scale cannabis production and distribution finally the illicit drug market generates sizeable cash economy and some police officers become involved in corrupt activities such as drug use drug dealing protection of drug dealers theft of drugs andor money and presentation of false evidence in court examples of the infrastructural intervention systems that developed in au stralia were the intergovernmental committee on drugs including officers in inter alia healt h law enforcement education and customs in each australian jurisdiction and b the australian national council on drugs consisting of people with relevant expertise from the government nongovernment and communitybased sectors to provide policy advice these structures were tasked to develop national drug action plans which specify priorities for reducing the harm arising from the use of licit and illici t drugs strategies for taking action on these priorities and performance indicators although responsibility for making and enforcing drug laws rests primarily w ith state governments in australia national government is responsible for overarching legis lation as such the federal government for example ratified the three major internat ional treaties on illicit drugs and instituted the obligations under these treaties i n terms of various federal laws although cannabis possession is regarded as criminal offence in all the states legislative restrictions and specifically penalties vary across st ates for example in some australian jurisdictions adults charged with simple cannabis offences shown to possess small quantity of cannabis for private use rather than for trafficking purpos could be issued an expiation notice and offenders would be able to avoid prosecut ion by paying the specified fee system of cautions for minor cannabis offenders exists i n certain states diversionary drug courts that emphasise harm minimisationreduction of drug u have also been established in some australian jurisdictions 38south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis finally it is important to note that in august 1999 the new south w ales premier appointed working party to advise on whether cannabis and cannabinoid substances had any medical uses and if they did how these substances could be used for medical purposes without decriminalising recreational cannabis use in its report the working party confirmed that drocannabinol was useful in treating hiv cancerrelated wasting and nausea caused by cancer chemotherapy it also noted evidence that drocannabinol may relieve painful muscle spasms in patients with neurological disorders and pain who do not respond to conventional analgesics it recommended further research on the therapeutic use of ca nnabis and cannabinoid drugs in all of these conditions hall degenhardt 2003 new zealand cannabis has been shown to be the third most commonly used drug in new zealand after alcohol and tobacco with the number of joints tending to be particularly high in the age group 1517 years indeed young people have been identified as highrisk group particularly members of disadvantaged groups maori youth and those who have pre existing problems on the whole highrisk groups also include people with mental disorders polydrug users and pregnant women the new zealand health committee recommended in 2003 that more res earch on cannabis and the harm it causes be conducted and emphasised the need for government to provide harm reduction information designed to minimise lung damage resulting from the smoking of cannabis the committee also recommended that the government take leading role in promoting the message that young people should not use cannabis and t hat it develop policy to reverse the trend of heavy use among 1524yearold young people the committee raised concern about the fact that about 3 of the new zea land population was at serious risk of cannabis dependence disorder cannabis dependence was reportedly more likely to occur among users who were also dependent on alcohol of si gnificance among the committees recommendations was also that all suicide referrals shoul d be tested for traces of illegal drugs especially cannabinoids as well as alcohol in order to further investigate the relationship between cannabis use and suicide the committee found strong association between cannabis use and excessive use of alcohol as major caus of road accidents and subsequently recommended that mechanism by which impairment by cannabi s could be 39south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis detected be included and also that all people killed in road accidents be tested for tra ces of all illegal drugs and alcohol including cannabinoids although 523 of submissions to the new zealand health committee we re in favour of selective legalisation of cannabis use and in accordance with parliamentary discussion on the issue the government has undertaken not to introduce legisl ation to change the legal status of cannabis the majority of submissions to the com mittee were completely opposed to any change in the law that would allow under18yearolds to use cannabis it was recommended however that the law contain options for dealing with minor cannabis use t hat avoid criminalisation such as cautioning for first offenders diversion to education programmes or health treatment and fines for repeat offences with flexible payment options or compulsory education 96 europe the netherlands the united kingdom switzerlan d and sweden as in earlier sections the drug policies of some of the countries unde r consideration in this section are reviewed in more detail than the drug policies in the other countries of concern netherlands drug policy in the netherlands is generally quite liberal compared to other countries particularly with regard to cannabis this liberal approach makes sens consideringas observed by the canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002the emphasis in dutch culture on the wellbeing of all citizens on individual fre edom and on the state remaining reserved in religious and moral matters also of importance re the pragmatism that underlies dutch culture b the countrys long trading history and c the states involvement in the drug trade in the former dutch colonies current dutch drug policy however leans to large extent on the recommendat ions of commission of enquiry that was established in 1968 by the nati onal federation of mental health organisations with regard to cannabis the commissi on recommended the following 40south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis removal of the use and possession of small quantities of cannabis from criminal law statutes and in time doing the same in respect of other drugs classification of charges related to the production and distribution of c annabis as misdemeanours instead of criminal offences and provision of drug treatment opportunities to people in need the commission based its recommendations on the view that canadian s enate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 illicit drugs can be used in controlled and limited way and that marginalizing drug using subcultures has significant negative repercussions specifically becom ing member of the drug scene may familiarize cannabis user with other drugs and patterns of use and one kind of drug user eg heroin user will contami nate another kind of drug user eg cannabis user when the two are forced into one marginalized subculture furthermore once started drug policing would have t be constantly enlarged to keep pace with the neverending escalati on of drug use indeed the criminal law option of opposing drug use can be described as inadequate and extremely dangerous and can be expected to boost polari zation between the different parts of society and can result in increased violence the dutch approach to drugcannabis control has not insulated the country agains t drug problems social approval and use of cannabis have progressively increased pecially among young people furthermore according to the canadian senate special comm ittee on illegal drugs 2002 1995 report entitled drugs policy in the netherlands continuity and change pointed out that the dutch population face internal difficulties in connection with the nuisances caused by cannabis coffee shops for dutch citizens and neighbouring countries as result of narcotourism furthermore the dutch system is also face d with the problem of supplying coffee shops with cannabis and cannabis derivatives which is still entirely illegal in addition from theoretical standpoint the very principle of facto legalization is debatable it fosters arbitrary action nd in particular leaves the field open to trafficking in fact the legalization of trafficking prevents any control in practical terms the main criticism is that the dutch polic has not reduced the use of drugs nor has it eliminated the risks ass ociated with drug abuse more specifically since the late 1970s drug policy in the netherlands was developed i n terms of the following premises canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 harm reduction approach to drug control that focuses on preventing andor alleviating social and individual risks related to drugs b ensures rational relationship 41south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis between risks and control measures and c prioritises repressive meas ures against drug trafficking normalisation approach that views social control as being achie ved through depolarisation and the integration of deviant behaviour rather than isolati on and removal while viewing drug problems as normal social problems rather than unus ual concerns requiring extraordinary treatment market separation approach that classifies and deals with drugs ccording to the risks posed distinguishing between soft drugs schedule ii drugs that include traditi onal hemp products such as cannabis and hashish and hard drugs schedule i drugs that are regarded as presenting an unacceptable risk to dutch society indeed while dutch policy allows for the use of soft drugs eg cannabis hard drugs are prohibited unconditionally and the authorities strive relentlessly to stop trafficking and inform the public of the risks of drug taking the sale and advertisement of all types of drugs are prohibited yet small quantities of cannabis are easily availabl at coffee shops with authorities turning blind eye to such trading the coffee shops however may neither advertise nor sell hard drugs or admit anyone under the age of 18 years it is also important t note that the netherlands imposes only maximum penalties for drug offences furthermore the law criminalises possession trafficking cultivation transportation manufa cturing import and export of drugs including cannabis and cannabis derivatives united kingdom drug policy and in particular the misuse of drugs act of 1971 as amende d in the united kingdom prohibit the cultivation production possession or supply of cannabis to another person although maximum penalties for cannabis are comparatively severe t here is considerable discretion in how the law is applied and in many cas the police only issue cautions eg in the case of persons found in possession of comparativel small amounts of cannabis and persons who are first offenders debate has however for some been taking place on the need to loosen prohibitions with regard to issues such as the medical use of cannabis b the decriminalisation or legalisation of cannabis for recreational use and c the cost of drug control canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 42south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis it is also important to note that in 1998 the newly elected labour governm ent adopted tenyear drug strategy particularly relating to illegal drugs and inc luding cannabis the focus is on young people b drugrelated crime c increased access to drug treatment and d restricting access to drugs especially in respect of chil dren 516yearsold canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 because of the complexi ty of the drug problem many different departments and organisations are involved in the implementa tion of the strategy the strategy has the following objectives to help young people resist drug misuse in order to allow them to ac hieve their full potential to reduce levels of repeat offending among drugmisusing offenders by giving the opportunity to take appropriate treatment acknowledging that the supply of treatment services is well below mand the government plan provides for the creation of national treatment agency whi ch will be responsible for the provision of drug treatment and the delivery of highquality services harm reduction strategies will be increased the medical use of cannabis has long history in the united kingdom having been prescribed as medicine until 1973 since the late 1990s the issue came again strongly to the fore in non governmental debate for example in 1998 the science and tec hnology committee scost of the house of lords tabled comprehensive report on the history of the medical use of cannabis and its pharmacology concluding that the advent of host of new and better synthetic drugs led to the abandonment of many ancient herbal remedies including cannabis and although cannabis is not in the premier league of dangerous substances new research tends to suggest that it may be more hazardous to health than might have been thought only few years ago scost however conceded that cannabis has medical applications in tre ating the painful muscular spasms and relieving other symptoms of multiple sclerosis nd other forms of pain hall degenhardt 2003 moffat 2002 it recommended clinical trials of c annabis in the treatment of these conditions and research into alternative modes of administration eg sublingual rectal that would retain the benefit of smoking without its adverse effects the government has since permitted pharmaceutical company to grow cannabis i n order to develop cannabisbased medicine and the medical research council s also funded 43south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis clinical trials of cannabis preparations to test their efficacy h all degenhardt 2003 moffat 2002 scost also recommended that medical practitioners be allowed to pre scribe cannabisbased preparations as unlicensed medicine and on the nameddrug basis with medical professional bodies providing guidance and safeguards against improper practi ces however scost stressed that it would be inappropriate to prescribe canna bisbased medicine to pregnant women people predisposed to schizophrenic illness and people with cardiovascular conditions and that it was essential to warn users of possible negative side effects regarding possession and recreational use of cannabis various studies c alled for reforming legislation particularly in the case of comparatively sma ll amounts and personal recreational use of cannabis trace klein roberts 2004 canadian s enate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 the studies recommended the reclassific ation of cannabis from class b to class c ie least harmful drug7 trace klein and roberts 20042 observe that consideration has for example been given to growing recognition that arresting cannabis users was not having any overall impact on the level of its use growing recognition of the costs to the taxpayer of all these arrests the majority of which resulted in nothing more than caution concern at the impact that cannabis caution or conviction for an othe rwise lawabiding citizen could have on their future career or travel plans concern at the wide variation in arrest and prosecution practice around the country pressure on police managers to concentrate their resources on offences that are of more concern to the public the broadly successful implementation of scheme piloting the concept of not arresting cannabis users public and political debate that recognised the differential harms caus ed by different patterns of drug use 7 the main act on drugs in the united kingdom is the misuse of drugs act of 1971 which categorises controlled drugs into class class b and class c to reflect the degree of harm they are considered to cause to the individual or society when misused with class as the most harmful and class c as the least harmful drugs canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 44south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis pressure to reclassify cannabis was successful and on 29 january 2004 c annabis and its derivatives were moved to class c in terms of an amendment to xisting legislation trace et 2004 measures were also taken to counter potential negative conse quences of the re classification such as the media presenting the reclassifica tion as an admission of defeat in the battle against drugs and b the general public and young people in particular being led to believe that the possessionuse of cannabis has been legali sed these countermeasures included the following trace et 2004 it was decided that the possession of cannabis would still be an arrestable offence following reclassification it was decided that the maximum penalties for supply of cannabis should remain highly punitive the association of chief police officers acpo issued guidance t hat made it clear that there will be general presumption against arrest for cannabis poss ession but there are circumstances in which individuals may be arrested if their ction is seen to extend beyond simple possession this will apply x1if people are smoking in public and flouting the law x1if they are 17 or under x1if they are caught in possession of cannabis in or around places where children congregate and x1if people are known locally to be repeatedly in breach of the law concern about the wisdom of the reclassification of cannabis is however continuing as observed by trace et 2004 expert opinion in the field is divided some express concerns about the danger of sending more tolerant message to young people others worry about the consequences of introducing wider margin of police discretionand even great er potential for inconsistencythan existed before in this respect it is important to not that critics have pointed out that the legal position for police office rs is essentially unchangedthey still have wide discretion on whether to arrest and possi ble penalties range from further action to period of imprisonment 45south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis switzerland in line with the complex political and cultural context of the country drug policy is quite complex and diverse in switzerland the country constitutes confederati on of 26 cantons with diversity of linguistic ethnic and denominational communities the cantons developed their first drug policy when the general level of drug use increased in the late 1960s focusing on the repression of drug use and trafficking the prevention of drug use among especially young people and abstinencebased t reatment concern about hivaids and the miserable state of drug dependants in the open drug scenes in various swiss cities resulted in the development of t reatment services eg needle exchange programmes that sought to assist drug dependants to protect themsel ves against hivaids and hepatitis an increase in the level of drugrelated probl ems further resulted in the introduction of comprehensive harm reduction measures in the 1990s notably t he promedro federal programme the objectives of the 1991 promedro programme were to decrease the number of new drug users and to prevent people from becoming drug dependent to help users t overcome their addiction through treatment and social integration to im prove the living conditions and the health of drug users to reduce harm and facilitate their social integration canadian

users in october 1998 the promedro federal programme was transformed into 19982002 strategy with the following pri orities canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 to strengthen commitment to primary and secondary prevention and ea rly intervention to prevent addiction to consolidate the range of treatments in coordinated system s well as harm reduction and social integration measures to establish and operate effectively national epidemiological monitoring centre based on the model of the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction to forward in an effective manner the findings of epidemiological studies scientific research and evaluations to experts and decision makers to implement process to foster quality management throughout the ent ire promedro program to ensure optimum coordination and organization for various commissions and forums the 19982002 strategy retained the fourpillar approach to drugs and set the follow ing objectives with regard to the respective pillars prevention was to focus on especially children and young people spilling over or spreading of drug problems across individuals nd sectors of society was to be countered and individuals were to be prevented from progress ing from casual to more intensive drug use treatment was to be directe d at assisting addicts to break their habit socially reintegrate and achieve better phys ical and mental health harm reduction programmes would include projects such as needle exchanges for addicts injection sites offers of employment and housing support for women involved i n commercial sex work to maintain their drug use and consultation services for children of 47south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis drugaddicted parents law enforcement methods included canadian senate s pecial committee on illegal drugs 2002 focusing enforcement activities on the manufacturing of drugs trafficking and money laundering assigning more officers to the drug police and making greater use of spec ialists from other sectors finance professionals intercantonal and international cooperation agreements with police forces from neighbouring countries accelerating and improving the processing of information networking systems and access to the police department networks from many european countries improving cooperation between the police and the private sector banks chem ical industries etc improving police effectiveness and making greater use of frontline liaison workers strengthening the legal structure for example policing legislation witness protection it is also important to note that narcotics legislation in switz erland has been closely tied to international conventionstreaties indeed the narcotics act of 1924 was enacted to enable switzerland to align itself with the international opium convention of 1912 the act was accordingly revised at regular periods since 1996 dependenceproducing substances and preparations with morphine cocaine or cannabis have been considered under the revised narcotics act currently the act inter alia prohibits the cultivation importation manufacturing and selling of smoking opium heroin hallucinogens eg lsd and hemp for the extraction of narcotics or hash the act also contains criminal provisions that apply to anyone who unlawfully cultivates manufactures extracts processes or prepa res narcotics anyone who unless authorised stores ships transports imports exports provides distributes sells buys holds possesses or otherwise acquires narcotic s and anyone who finances illicit traffic in narcotics acts as an intermediary or encourages consumption offenders are liable to imprisonment fine or reprimand depending on the seriousness of the act committed finally and with regard to cannabis in particular it is important to note that major revision of existing legislation is under consideration specifically to relax legislative restrictions and based on similar arguments presented in other countries 48south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis sweden drug policy in sweden has been characterised as restrictive compa red to that in other countries in the european union indeed the canadian senate special commit tee on illegal drugs 2002 observes that in sweden the drug phenomenon is considered one of the most serious social problems if not the most serious and drugs are viewed as an external threat to the country and as jeopardizing swedens traditional values indeed the vision of drugfree society is so widely accepted that it is not questioned in the political arena or the media furthermore almost all forms of involvement with narcotics including c annabis are prohibited in terms of the narcotics criminal act of 1968 as amended t he canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs 2002 also notes that in sweden cannabis is viewed as dangerous drug and its use as the beginning of career in drugs recent drug policy is embedded in the 20022004 national strategy or action pl an directed at reducing the number of new recruits to drug abuse eg t hrough preventive actions focused on young people b encouraging more drug users to give up the habit eg through treatment support and c reducing the supply of drugs through law enforcement measures while the plan provides for the establishment of national ntidrugs coordinator responsibility for implementation of the plan largely resides with m unicipalities with regard to prevention emphasis is on drug education in schools starting early and repeat ing regularly throughout the school curriculum in terms of treatment it is important to not that stated goal of the drug strategy is to rehabilitatetreat drug user rather than to punish himher by way of the criminal justice system for this reason special em phasis is placed on diverting drug users who enter the criminal justice system into drug treatment offenders may be given drugrelated treatment sentence comprising for example probationary s entence combined with institutional treatment finally key finding of the commission on narcotic drugs which the gove rnment established in 1998 to evaluate drug policy in sweden canadian senat special committee on illegal drugs 2002 stressed need for measures to strengthen demand reduction and supply reduction indeed the commission asserted that for preventive meas ures to succeed they must be included in system of measures restricting availability and there must be clear rules which include societys norms and values as well as effective care and treatment law enforcement has to be allocated more resources and so also drugrelated research in order to improve the knowledge base to counter drugrelated problems 49south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis 10 prevention this section focuses on preventive premises noted in south africa part icular attention is given to the premises that have been extracted from south african rese arch on drugcannabis use eg national and sentinel surveillance projects eg parry 2002 rocha silva 1998 in fact the south african researcher parry 2002697 maintains that given the negative health consequences experienced by some cannabis users shift in cannabis policy in south africa would require detailed and adequately resourced public health response focusing on cannabis users at high risk of harm or engaging in harmful patterns of use such an approach would need to include education eg on the dangers of cannabis use and driving and on the relationship between cannabis and mental health and treatment of persons dependent on cannabis parry 2002697 more generallyand in line with the preventive premises noted in the previ ous section in respect of various countriesrochasilva 1998 argues that risk reduction seems to be realistic preventive p hilosophy considering that preventive efforts have as yet not been able to claim risk eli mination and the multifaceted public health approach to risk reduct ion presents itself as viable option in the face of wide disillusionment with unidimensiona l emphases in prevention public health preventive approach furthermore r equires the following emphases rocha silva 1998 world health organization 1980 strategies and actions that are oriented towards go als that are inherently positive and salutary an integrated focus on the individual on the envir onment in which the individual lives and on the use of drugs eg cannabis strategies and actions that reach out to individual s not as objects to be acted upon but as subjects who can contribute ideas and actions on their own who make their history although not as they please strategies and actions that rest on firm support base within the wider community within which they are applied 50south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis balanced combination of demand reduction eg th rough education socioeconomic upliftment and supply reduction eg through control law enforcement special note must be taken that unidimensional preventive efforts in other countries eg the united states of america have not quite borne the expected fruit c ourtwright 1991395 for example states that the uneven and often disappointing res ults of the drug war have led several commentators to question the wisdom of what they ca ll the prohibition policy reservations about the sensibleness of diluted or liberalised law enforcement strategies regarding illicit drugcannabis use namely decriminalisatio n or controlled legalisation have also been voiced from various corners courtwright 1991 mcbride mccoy 1993 indeed expectations that the legalisation of the sale of c ertain substances eg cannabis under certain conditions would neutralise drugcannabis crime connections have been shown to be too optimistic mcbride and mccoy 1993273 fo r example point out that the decriminalisation philosophy seems to ignore psycho pharmacological aspects of the drugs cannabiscrime relationship and findings that criminal behaviour and drugcannabis use arise from similar etiological variables an d act in mutually reinforcing manner multilevel approach to prevention ie an approa ch that operates on primary secondary and tertiary level primary prevention is directed at reduci ng initial individualenvironmental risks of developing drugcannabisrelated problems secondary prevention involves early detection of riskproneness with regard to the deve lopment of drugcannabisrelated problems tertiary prevention usually called trea tment focuses on arresting intensification and perpetuation of drugcannabisrela ted problems in fact the importance of restraining the recruitment of notyetusers while also providing means to encourage existing users to take up treatment options at an earlier stage t han they might otherwise have done is stressed courtwright 19911617 communityoriented or broadbrush approach to pre vention ie an approach that recognises that preventiontreatment involves rge number of very different people with very different problems who need to be attended to in variety of ways by diverse group of therapists indeed that the effectiv reduction of the burden of drug problems cannot realistically be viewed as the sole res ponsibility of specialized programs rather the reduction of drugcannabisrelated problems must be much more broadly disseminated responsibility involving great many di fferent personnel in large number of 51south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis different human service arenas all of whom must arn to recognize such problems and intervene effectively commentaries 1991840 in line with the above premises rochasilva 1998 proposes with regard to demand reduction and in respect of the individual the following preventive goals the promotion of healthy lifestyles through inter lia culturally sensitive and targeted multimedia information campaigns and the provision of generally accessible and appropriate skillstraining programmes for risk avoid ancereduction the promotion of partnerships between preventiv agents in the public and private sector b grassroot representationparticipation including those targeted in programmes in preventive planning c involvement of service providers in as many fields as possible especially those in primary health care in generi c welfare services and in specialised drug related and treatmentpreventive services as well as where feasible those who have recovered from drugrelated problems the targeting of persons of all ages especially histor ically disadvantaged groups the youth offenders and persons experiencing drugrelated probl ems eg persons in treatment with regard to demand reduction on the level of the environment rochasilva 1998 suggests the following preventive goals community developmentwork and in particular th setting upstrengthening of informal social control structures in communities b the setting upstrengthening of non riskyhealthy leisure time activities and c redr essing socioeconomic conditions eg socioeconomic disintegrationdeprivation which are conducive to the development of drug related problems service delivery and in particular specialised alcoholdrugrelated preventiontreatment facilities b drugrelated services at primary he alth clinics eg detoxification services biological psychological and social screening for riskproneness to drugrelated problems and referral system with regard to specialised rvice needs as well as detailed information system that monitors the drinkingdrug taking practices and needs of users of services and c detailed userfriendly and wid ely accessible register of national provincial and municipal drugrelated preventiontre atment services 52south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis in respect of availability reduction rochasilva 1998 suggests the formulation and implementationin collaboration with stakeholders i n the public and private sectorof legal and other control measures that limit access and ex posure to drug use 11 conclusion the following conclusions seem appropriate considering the reviewed literature cannabis is psychoactive drug ie substance that can modify the perce ption mood cognition behaviour or motor function of the person who ingests it cannabis usetrading is public health issue in which the drug its i ndividual user its trader and the context in which it is used or traded are complexly interrelated use of and trade in cannabis can impair the health and socioeconomi c status of individuals communities and regions and impede sustainable local and re gional development initiatives as represented in for example nepad measures against the adverse effects of cannabis usetrade need to be x1comprehensive and integrated eg by attending to cannabis within the wider context of psychoactive substance use and trade b attending to the demand and supply of cannabis and c operating through multisectoraleven multiregionaland we ll coordinated institutional framework x1researchbased as well as rigorously monitored and evaluated x1especially attentive to young people and x1premised on inherently salutary principles eg life of quality for all individuals governments that have instituted or few legal restrictions against pe rsonal or recreational and medical use of cannabis experience difficulties in ensuring that provisions for the medical use of cannabis are realistic instead of theoretical or symbolic gestures and difficulties in preventing the general public and young people in particular from believing that cannabis use is harmless the south african governments national drug master plan ndmp genera lly reflects drug control strategy that takes note of lessons learnt in various other countries with 53south african central drug authority cda position paper on cannabis regard to ways of countering cannabisrelated problems however the follow ing two issues have to be given more attention x1indications in other countries that drug treatment courts lower recidivism and criminal labelling indeed divert offenders with drugrelated problems into appropriate treatment and x1the value of widespread public awareness of the adverse effects of pa rticular patterns of cannabis use and b widespread public participation in effort s at countering cannabisrelated problems finally the following statements of the directorgeneral of the unit ed nations office on drugs and crime in vienna austria underlines key issue to be conside red in the discussion of cannabis policy the priority the international community is attributing to stronger toba cco control legislation is twin to global efforts to maintain strong c ounternarcotics legislation if we apply the spirit of the tobacco control conventi on agreed by 171 member states to cannabis it is clear what we need to do we ne ed to ensure that the centre of our attention is the health and the well being of our people however is there not contrast between efforts by the internation community to negotiate and agree on convention on tobacco because of the lethal consequences of its abuse and the frequently heard calls to liberaliz the production trafficking and abuse of cannabisa substance known to bring about even greate r damage to health 54south african central drug
