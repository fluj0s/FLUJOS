science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32108north slope infrastructure and the anwr debate summary the rich biological re sources and wilderness values of nor theastern alaska have been widely known for about 50 years and the rich energy res ource potential has been suspected for much of that time the future of these resources in the coas tal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr has been debated in congress for over 40 year s one aspect of the debate in recent years has been proposals to limit the footprint of energy development the term footprint has not been formally defi ned and the variety of features it might include varies with observers yet the word is used regularly in discussions regarding impacts of infrastructure on the natural environment w ithout attempting to fix definition or suggest consensus where it may not exist this report catal ogues the range of features of development that various observers might include in their use of th word beginning with features that nearly all parties would consider as part of developments footprint it s hould be emphasized that the report does not give an overview of the anwr devel opmentwilderness controversy as whole the impacts of development the portion of the refuge that might be affected by an acreage limitation or specific provisions of any legislation rather it seeks to provide an understanding of the terms used only in this aspect of the anwr debate as background the report considers current and planned development at the alpine complex the most advanced energy development on the north slope and how its lessons might appl to development in the refuge trends in technology and the emphasis on more compact development could aid in reducing developments footprint over the last two decades the size and number of structures in newly developed areas have gotten sma ller or fewer drill pads are s ubstantially sma ller and support facilities and roads are fewer th an in older areas some of this reduction occurred because of regulation eg to limit wetlands impacts or reduce waste discharge but some also occurred because smaller structures are usually cheaper grav water culverts waste pits and so on can all be costly to build use andor maintain the result is certain degree of incentive to industry to consolidate and to make structures smaller or in the case of waste pits eliminate them even in the absence of regulation on the other hand key distinctions between the co astal plain of the refuge and the coastal plain of currently developed areas are worth noting among these differences are the refuges more rolling terrain with far less standing water and its relatively large distance from much of the existing north slope infrastructure which c ould force the building of additional closer infrastructure to make development more economically pr actical these differences combined with possible constraints on development that might imposed in the 1002 area to limit environmental impacts should congress decide to open the area to development suggest that any genera lization about footprints drawn from modern existing developments such as alpine although instru ctive may be qualified ultimately the presence distribu tion and economic recove rability of an oil will combine with local conditions to determine the significance and imp act of any footprint limita tion for broader treatment of this issu see crs report rl31278 arctic national wildlife refuge background and issues this report will not be

of the web pagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl321081development advocates have proposed to limit the size of this footprint the extent to which such legislation might apply to native lands within the 1002 area is unclear for treatment of this aspect of the debate see crs report rl31115 legal issues related to proposed drilling for oil and gas in the arctic national wildlife refugenorth slope infrastructure and the anwr debate in the debate over energy development in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr key issue has been whether the environmental impacts of development can be limited and if so how much of the recent focus of that debate has been on the footprint of velopment and how to limit the footprint so as to limit the environmental impact of development the term footprint has not been formally defined and the variety of features it might include varies with observers without attempting to fix definition of the word or suggest consensus where it may not exist this report catalogues range of features of development that various observe rs might include in their use of footprint it begins with features that nearly all parties would c onsider as part of developments footprint and concludes with those which fewer parties would include in some cases it provides illustrations of these features1 when congress expanded the boundary of the arc tic national wildlife re fuge anwr in the alaska national interest lands conservation ac t anilca pl 96487 in 1980 it designated about 8 million acres within the earlier boundaries of the refuge as wilderness offlimits to nearly all forms of development however in 1002 of anilca congress required the department of the interior doi to prepare tailed study of the coastal plain of the refuge now also called the 1002 area and to recommend how it should be ma naged in 1003 congress directed that production of oil and gas from th arctic national wildlife refuge is prohibited and leasing or other development leading to production of oil and gas from the range sh all be undertaken until authorized by an act of congress this provi sion effectively postponed decision on development versus wilderness designa tion of 15 million acres of the coastal plain see figure 1 showing anwr and developed areas interior finished its detailed analysis of oil potential wildlife resources impacts and mitigation measures in april 1987 in this report to congress called the final legislative environmental impact statement or fleis doi estimated the chance of recovering economic quantities of oil at 19 figure that is very high by industry sta ndards the report recommended that the entire area be made available for leasing the report and its recommendation generated controversy as have virtually all subsequent reports on this topic in intervening years estimates of oil potential and industrys enthusiasm have va ried but support for anwr oil velopment remains strong among various parties including many alaskans likewise opposition to energy development continues to be strong among many observe rs based on concern for the area s wildlife and wilderness values the specific placement and extent of energy infrastructure would be strongly dependent on the location of any oil discoveries including their distance from other discoveries but within that context the trend in north slope energy deve lopment has been toward compactness reduction in numbers and mileage of roads centralization or reduction of support facilitie s reduction ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32108crs2 2for review of advances

so mewhat modified for clarity in monochrome have gotten smaller or fe wer drill pads are substantially sma ller and support f acilities and roads are fewer than in older areas2 some of this reduction occurred because of regulation eg to limit wetlands impacts or reduce waste discharge but some also occurred because smaller structures are usually cheaper gravel water culverts waste p its and so on can be costly to build use andor maintain the result is certain degree of incentive to industry to consolidate and to make structures smaller or in the case of waste pits eliminate them even in the absence of regulation thus the footprint of development in anw r could be smaller than for co mparable earlier development on the north slope advances in drilling technologies are major fact or in the size and location of the footprint drilling technology has evolved from single hole st raight down into pros pect to directional extended reach horizontal multilateral and designer wells under very fa vorable conditions drill pads can now be located as much as 5 miles in horizontal distance from target the current world record for horizontal drilling is 7 miles at two sites one in china and the other at the wytch farm oil field on the south coast of england mode rn designs permit more efficient production of hydrocarbon reserves and allow easier connection to production f acilities with fewer pipelineshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32108crs3 3for more extensive discussion of these technologies and for illustrations of types of drilling methods see crs report rl31022 previously cited 4while these impacts are not negligible they are subs tantially less than the impacts of development and production 5conocophillips plans five new alpine satellite pads signs mou for eis petroleum news vol 9 9 jan 27 2003they also reduce the number of wellheads cuttings generated during drilling may be reinjected into special wells for waste disposal rather than th more permanent waste pits used in the past3 all of these advances play role in decreasing the acreage covered by gravel however in considering the extent of needed infrastructure two crucial influences are worth noting first the size and location of infrastru cture would depend on where the oil is and how much oil can be economically extracted if oil development were author ized in the 1002 area and if oil were not found in economically fficient quantity or quality only th impacts of exploration would remain4 similarly if oil were found only in one pa rt particularly in the west near existing development the impacts on the eastern portion would be much reduced second distance from other energy development would ffect the requirements for new deve lopments discoveries in the western portion of the 1002 area might be able to re ly on some infrastructure outside of the refuge this infrastructure might be some of the facilities which exist already however since existing facilities including permanent roads are scarce there might be demand for new facilities concentrated just outside of the refuge boundary across the canning river if discoveries were found only farther east in the 1002 area the need for support infrastructure within the refuge rather than 100 or more miles to the west would become more pressing this report begins by examining the alpine complex an oil field at the extreme western edge of current development of ten cited as the north slopes most dvanced oil field the report reviews the most modern compact technologies now in use it is followed by cat alogue of those features that might be considered as part of north slope development infrastructure the description includes all of the oilrelated facilities cited in the fleis p 99 as being associated with full development as well as other features or affected areas that are mentioned in discussions of this issue it refers to issues arising in future reliance on ice tec hnology the report concludes by identifying physical differences between the 1002 area and the devel oped areas on the north slope and discusses how those differences might affect the footprint the alpine complex past and future alpine was originally developed by arcoalaska and is now managed by conocophillips it began production in november 2000 and the surface area of the oil field was initially estimated at 40000 acres it is regarded as an example of environmentally consci entious produc tion and is commonly held as the standard that might be ex pected if the 1002 area were developed at the alpine development the two gr avel pads currently in place are permitted by the army corps of engineers at 363 acres for the main pad also known as cd1 and 101 acres for the satellite pad cd2 in contrast drill pads cons tructed in the 1970s averaged about 44 acres the larger pad is the main production pad and in cludes central processing f acility housing and storage area along with wellheads the secondary pad cont ains only drilling facilities and wellheads workers there commute from the main pad to gether the two pads support 112 wells5 see figure 2 and and figure 3 showing initial phases of alpine development third pad cd3 of

to total about 41 acres6 see figure 4 showing plans for alpine complex expansion three additiona l pads are planned west of this area in the national petroleum reservealaska npra the current airfield for the alpine complex permitted at 3 57 acres and about 1 mile long doubles as part of the road connecting the first two drill pads in summer access to alpine is by aircraft only with 6 to 8 aircraft incl uding large cargo planes arriving daily7 second airfield is planned as part of cd3 it is expect ed to be 11 miles long and occupy 171 acres8 since there would be dormitory facilities at this pad workers would be based at the main alpine pad and would use ice roads or small planes for daily operational access reliance on aircraft for summer transport reduces or so metimes eliminates the need for connecting roads the current connector road in the alpine complex is over 2 miles long and covers 146 acres along with the airfield it links the first two pads in the complex howeve r the frequency of air traffic is higher than was anticipated during the permitting of alpine and th safe joint use of the airstrip has become increasingly difficult9 added development would place increased demands on the airfield the conflict with increasing vehicular traffic means that any alternative that increases use across this section of road may require separate road that would allow separate and discrete use by rolling stock and fixed wing traffic10 road is planned at this time to connect the main alpine pad to cd3 althoug h 01 mile road 06 acres would connect the drill pad to its own airstrip and raised pipeline would transport oil from the pad to the processing facility on the main pad11 second road of 38 miles with 32 foot wi driving surface is being planned to connect cd4 south

until march 2000 when they were transported via ice road15 on the frozen beaufort sea and then inland via ice road to the alpine development16 fresh water used for ice constr uction at alpine comes from lake s accessed with state permits and is hauled by truck to the appropriate site these specially designed trucks hold 4200 to 10500 gallons water for human use comes via pipe s from lakes near the main pad currently conocophillips has plans to change the current processes for water withdrawal or ice road construction for cd3 or cd4 or any of the pr oposed national petroleum reserve alaska npra satellites17 another important factor affecting footprint at the alpine complex is the ability to use extended reach drilling erd or horizontal drilling to r each oil at some distance from the wellhead18 all of alpines wells both producers and injector s are horizontal with the well angled to pass horizontally through the producing re servoir horizontal footages within the reservoir range from 3000 feet to 6000 feet with one 6000 foot horiz ontal section and three wells with horizontal sections more than 5000 feet in length from the wellhead19 in sum the initial phases of development of field whose surface extent was estimated at 40000 acres directly disturbed about 250 acres plus an undetermined area indirectly affected see discussion below developers we re also able to rely on some support from facilities for staging in the kuparuk field as oil prospects nearby have improved the size of velopment infrastructure has continued to increase recent developments in alaska suggest that for economic reasons access to the alpine area may not remain roadless indefinitely the alaska department of transportation and public facilities is beginning to study project to build industrial roads to support the states oil gas and mining industries where lack of adequate transportation in remote areas is significant handicap to development department spoke sman said that it found the best

infrastructure this section catalogues features which have been considered in discussions on the footprint of development it is primarily description of the features per rather than their environmental impacts features at the beginning of the catal ogue tend to be menti oned as forming part of developments footprint more frequently than features at the end gravel structures gravel drill pads in 1987 the fleis in its full development scenario assumed that 50 to 60 pads averaging 2032 acres each would be bu ilt these would cover 1200 to 1600 acres fleis p 99 now 26 years later the projected average pad size compares well with the 29 acre average of the first 4 alpine pads but it seems unlikely that as many as 50 to 60 pads would be needed in contemporary scenario the fleis p 86 noted that the maximum extended reach for drilling then was somewhat over 2 miles if the oil reservoir was deep enough in contrast modern extended reach drilling erd under optimum conditions can r each more than twice that distance and in actual practice on the north slope has reached 378 miles at one wellhead consequently assuming the same full development scenario posited in the fl eis fewer than 50 pads might be needed see modern drill pads in figure 3 airfields two large 130 acres each and two small 30 acres each airfields were contemplated in the fleis p 99 in full deve lopment scenario under the alpine model with its airfield that would have been considered small in the fleis for equivalent discoveries more airfields would be likely to be built than the four that were envisaged in the full development scenario in the fleis since each complex would need its own airfields see airfield in figure 2 and figure 3 the reliance on multiple airfields could be reduced but at the cost of additional roads linking more pads to fewer airfields connector roads in drill site complex gravel roads connect drill pads in complex these roads may be as thick as 65 feet of gravel above the surface of the tundra22 gravel connector roads could lower costs over the long haul once production begins though development may be continuing on the same pad since they would obvi ate the need for annual construction of some of the ice roads used for winter transport of heav equipment and might redu ce the number of airfields that would be needed for summer travel see connector road in figure 2 and figure 3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32108crs10 23state and industry planning for remo fields west of prudhoe bay ggest that for marginal fields proximity to allweather gravel roads can help in ma king marginally profitable lease more profitable by lowering long term access costs this factor coul d be important in anwr since the westernmost boundary of the 1002 area is roughly 30 miles east of badami th easternmost producing field to date and which was recently shut down for its marginal economics see map figure 1 thus gravel roads may be factor in deciding whether to deve lop some marginal fields 24alaska department of natural resources division of oil and gas chapter 7 mitigation measures north continuedstream crossings culverts and bridges variety of structures must be built to manage water or to cross streams in the arctic environment in th arctic spring as rivers and ponds swell with melting runoff and water drains slowly across the tundr culverts are needed to prevent the creation of impoundments on the upper side of the road that might threaten the road itself in addition main pipelines must be designed to cross over or under st reams and rivers and bridges may be needed to carry traffic across major rivers in its full development scenario the fleis p 99 estimated that maximum of 25 major river or stream crossings could be required it noted p 92 that bridges and culverts would be designed and constructed to provide cross drainage for road s in manner that prevents erosion or adverse effects on the fisheries for similar discoveries modern scenario would require similar precautions but to the extent that fewer miles of roads are constructed then fewer bridges and culverts would need to be constr ucted the number of stream crossi ngs for main pipeline carrying crude oil from all of the 1002 area fields to taps could be expected to be similar in modern scenario but assuming the same hypothetical di scoveries the infield pipelines would likely be reduced because fewer drill pads are needed in modern scenario to produce the same amount of oil major roads connecting complexes or existing developments in the exploration and development phases ice roads not only reduce environmental impacts they also reduce costs relative to building gravel roads and pads at each new prospect which may or may not contain oil however once find is confirmed gravel drill pads are put in place and as is occurring at the alpine complex gravel roads may also be put in place to link some if not all of the gravel pads if pad in complex is not linked by road to other facilities in the same complex an airfield may be required at the unlinked pads as at cd3 in the nor thern part of the alpine complex allweather gravel roads serve to reduce the number of flights as well as demands on fresh water for ice roads each winter when heavy equipment must be transported23 see figure 6 showing road with 2 trucks exploration roads ice roads and ice pads are the nor m in current exploration technology although in some cases gravel structures must be used for example in the state lands south of current developments between the colville and canning rivers new area is being opened for lease sales by the alaska department of natural resources this area is in the foothills of the brooks range and has topography more similar to the rolling hills common in the 1002 area than to the areas that have been developed to date near the coast among these hills ice roads and ice pads have proven potentially unsafe or difficu lt to construct state regulations for the area require that exploration activities must use ice roads and ice pads but exceptions including the use of gravel may also be granted on site specific basis if it is determined after consulting with the alaska department of fish and game that feasible and prudent alternatives exist for constructing an exploration road or pad24 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32108crs11 24continued slope foothills

their supports would link devel opment complexes to larger main pipeline see below which would carry crude oil over much longer dist ances from within the 1002 area to existing main pipelines and ultimately to taps whether for infield lines or for main lines the very small cross sectional areas of the bases for the support arms would take up only sma ll fraction of the total gravel footprint that might be expected from anwr development as well as small fraction of the area under the pipeline main pipelines in 1987 the fleis full development s cenario p 99 assumed that the main oil pipeline that would collect oil from the vari ous fields in the 1002 area for shipment to taps would be elevated for caribou passage run ge nerally eastwest exte nd 100 miles inside the 1002 area and occupy about 610 acres within the 1002 ar ea based on 50 foot width for right of way29 it would include two to three pump stations with one or two stations insi the refuge and the others between the refuge boundary and the start of the taps pipeline each pump station was expected to require roughly 7acre gravel pad fo r pumping oil storage power pipeline equipment and repair and communications f acilities as well as living qua rters for about 30 people and environmental support systems fleis p 91 th extent to which the pump station pads or the right of way could be reduced with modern technology is unclear si nce the size of pipeline itself would be partly function of the volume of oil flowing through it however it is possible that the 50 foot right of way for the pipe line would longer be necessary gravel mines gravel whether for pads airfields causeways or roads is mined from nearby sources such as river beds and more recently upland sites in 2001 24 open pit gravel mines occupied 6364 acres average pit 265 acres on the north slope30 about 10 to 15 gravel mines were considered necessary for fu ll development in the fleis th ey were estimated to occupy 500 750 acres total the mine at the alpine complex figure 5 above occupies 150 acres falling between the current average size and the smaller gravel mines contemplated in the fleis some portion of the gravel from this mine was to meet need s in the village of nuiqsut and the size of the permitted mine may have been designed to allow the expansion of the alpine development to some of the additional satellite

gravel excavated in this pro cess would be used for construction elsewhereknown what size of gravel mine would have been required to construct onl the original two pads at alpine in the 1002 area consolidation of gravel mines might be considered desirable this might be accomplished by digging fewer or deeper pits as at alpine however consolidation would result in hauling gravel over longer distances and po ssibly constructing more roads the fleis p111 noted that effects of gravel ex traction can be reduced by using gravel from exposed and unvegetated bars along streams that are not fishbearing or from gravel terraces adjacent to river beds water impoundments in 1987 the fleis stated that the use of desalinated seawater might not be economically feasible for ice roads and airstrips p 88 to avoid construction of gravel roads during most exploration operations using ice technology have expanded since 1987 and exploration requires far more wa ter than was contemplated then years supply of fresh water for exploration camp use would typically be about 360000 gallons in addition 1 to 15 million gallons are needed for an ice road 1 mile long 3035 feet wide and 6 inches thick32 in the winter of 20012002 conocophillips alone built more than 100 miles of ice roads for exploration on the north slope33 this effort would have required over 100 million gallons of fresh water in the past when freshwater has been needed for ice construction or for camp use in some of the developed areas and could not be readily obtained from deep lakes water impoundments were sometimes created in the tundra to supply add itional water one method for creating these impoundments is to excavate gravel mines in the flood plain of str eam or river and then to wait for spring floods to overflow the stream fill the ex cavated pits and recede leaving an artificial deep lake34 while an attempt is made to avoid fishbearing streams or to use higher ground these artificial deep lakes ma provide overwintering fish hab itat where none existed and become attractive to food fish such as gr ayling or arctic char an effect some would consider beneficial other types of affected areas in this category are features which were not mentioned in the fleis list of oilrelated facilites p 99 in one case the technology did not exist in 1987 in other cases th features are described here because environmental scie ntific or native groups have argu ed that developments footprint should include not only areas covered by gravel or the features described bove but also other areas that may be affected by development at this point the term shades into the environmental effects of development taken as whole the most commonly mentioned of these affected areas are included below multiseason insulated ice pads tundra vegetation which has been covered by ice roads or pads generally recovers within season or two if the ice is allowed to melt and the area is not subsequently covered with gravel structure as result ice covered areas are rarely considered to be part of developments footprint however to prolong the season for drilling and eliminate the time required for

the footprint debate the relative significance of the visual effect including its human impacts constitutes major bone of contenti on between development opponents and advocates development advocates st ress the decreasing size of some of the items described above growth in cari bou herd in the developed area responses to cleaning up any oil spills and other environmental protections they particularly argue that future development effects cannot be judged in terms of the effects of past development now over 30 years old in some places because advances in tec hnology are reducing environmental impacts and many structures are smaller or less numerous than they would have been with older technology implicitly they define footprint as much narrower term that doe s not include visual impacts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32108crs16 38the website of the alaska wilderness league httpwwwalaskawildorgpressroomhtml viewed on october 6 2003 for example describes this approach to the

in dense ne tworks of trails producing serious accumulating visual effect39 the nrc p 239 commented the common practice of describing the effects of pa rticular projects in terms of the area directly disturbed by roads pads pipelines and other facilities ignores the spreading character of oil development on the north slope and the consequences of this to wildland values all of these effects result in the erosion of wildland values over an area far exceeding the area directly affected look to the future reliance on ice technology current north slope exploration and development rely on ice t echnology as described above but if current warming trends tinue use of this technology app ears to be at risk in northern alaska whether in anwr or elsewhere the state now permits i ndustry to engage in oil exploration and ice construction on the north slope when the t op 12 inches of tundra are frozen and snow cover reaches 6 inches crosstundra tr avel and ice construction must cease once these conditions longer prevail in spring40 warmer winters have caused ice road use to drop from 200 days 20 years ago to the 2002 leve l of 103 days per year41 as result of the constraint on exploration the us department of energy the state of alaska three petroleum companies and yale university will fund study to develop model that might result in this standard being modified to determine whether

limitation might apply to native lands in the refuge if there were such limitation worded to apply only to federal lands but not native lands infrastructure might be preferentially located on nativ

and 15 cm 6 in of snow is not sufficient to protect the tundra in many areas of the north slope distinct aspects of the 1002 area with respect to infrastructure needs the 1002 ar ea is distinct in two important respects from current development the first is its terrain the 1002 area is ma up largely of low rolling hills with braided rivers containing gravel bars while the terrain per would present unusual difficulties for oil development it presents some relatively new challenges due the natural environment of the north slope modern arctic exploration and development methods rely heavily on ice technologies not only in the exploration pha but also in the velopment nd pr oduction phases when winter ice roads substitute for gr avel roads under certain conditions freshwater supplies are essential to this technology however the flat terrain of developed areas to the west where there are numerous ponds to serve as water sources is charact eristic of only part of the 1002 ar ea chiefly south of kaktovik and to lesser extent near the mouth of the canni ng river elsewhere in the 1002 area the topography is more rolling small thaw lakes like those that are nearly ubiquitous in developed areas to the west are concentrated only in thos very flat areas nearly all of the lakes are less than 640 acres and most are less than 6 feet deep and freeze solid during winter making them impractical as resources for ice road construction43 consequently fresh water is not as readily available as in currently developed areas although impoundments might be constructed moreover regardless of water supply ice tec hnology is reportedly cons idered impractical in hilly terrain common condition in the 1002 area44 reduced water supplies together with hilly terrain less favorable to ice tec hnology pose problem if industry were to rely on ice technology to reduce developments footprint in the 1002 area the second distinctive characteristic is th distance of the 1002 area from major existing infrastructure45 the need for new infrastructure woul d depend substantially on whether existing facilities could serve new areas or whether operational costs were best controlled by building new facilities close by for example the nearest doc k serving industry is at endicott roughly 40 miles west of the far western edge of the 1002 area the closest current onshore oil field with gravel road is over 20 miles west of the boundary at bada field that was recently closed due to poor economics in contrast the alpine complex was able to use west dock and the large kuparuk development as staging area and for some of its support needs additiona lly as described above permanent road into the general area if not to the main pad at alpine has drawn support as means of improving economic prospects for the npra
