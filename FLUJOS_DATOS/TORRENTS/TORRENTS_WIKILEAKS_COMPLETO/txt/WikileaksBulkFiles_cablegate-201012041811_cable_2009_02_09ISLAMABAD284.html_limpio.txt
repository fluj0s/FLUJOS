release ref islamabad 267 b islamabad 280 classified by anne w patterson for reasons 14 b and d 1 s summary president zardari assured the ambassador on february 8 that aq khan would remain under house arrest and not engage with the media minister of interior rehman malik also insisted that khan would be prohibited from talking to the press and politicians and his movements would be curtailed zardari and malik speculated to the ambassador that pakistan muslim leaguen pmln party leader nawaz sharif was about to run aq khan for the senate on his partys slate the pakistani government claims that they were trying to establish legal basis for khans detention as he had been restrained previously by the ministry of defense for his own security however the timinig of the court decision obviously took zardari by surprise reflecting the gops persistent lack of coordination and message control now the government is trying to catch up end summary 2 s president zardari assured the ambassador on february 8 that aq khan would not talk to the press and would remain under strict control ambassador conveyed that the release of aq khan the worlds most serious nuclear proliferator aggravated by khans press conference on his front lawn thanking zardari and interior minister rehman malik for his release was very unfortunate signal to send to the world for the united states it was particularly unsettling coming on the eve of ambassador holbrookes visit and as the us congress considered assistance and trade bills for pakistan the us was seeking commitment that aq khan would stay out of the press and his movements would be restricted as before zardari argued that referring khans detention to the islamabad high court was designed to prevent khan from receiving senate ticket from pmln leader nawaz sharif where would i have been then zardari said zardari said he would be sure that the police who were stationed at khans house would not pamper him 3 s minister of interior rehman malik also reassured the ambassador and dcm in several phone calls and meetings that aq khan would be kept under wraps he would not talk to reporters or politicians and his movements would be strictly controlled malik reported that president zardari who heard about the court decision from the ambassador and then pakistani ambassador to the us haqqani and not his own ministers had been annoyed about being blindsided malik told us that there had been previous legal basis for the khan detention note this is true the head of pakistans nuclear strategic plans division lt general kidwai has often told us that there was legal basis for the khan detention except to provide for his own security end note malik said repeatedly that the press conference had gotten out of hand and the press had rushed to khans house even before the decision was announced xxxxx end note media reaction 4 u unsurprisingly khans press conference was widely covered by the electronic and print media all papers ran dr khans triumphant photograph above the fold showing him waving to the media and public supporters at his residence stories included the international reaction with particular emphasis on the us uk france and india expressing concern about the decision and declaring khan danger for world peace articles and editorials questioned how free khan actually was and speculated on the contents of the secret annex the urdu press noted that people came out on the roads raised slogans in favor of dr khan and distributed sweatmeats urdu editorials unanimously praised the decision and protested the hue and cry over release of dr khan islam pakistans rejection of charges of nuclear cooperation jang and maltreatment of dr aq khan at us behest does not befit us jang dr khans gratitude toward the government of pakistan was underscored in widely reported quote that he is grateful to the president the prime minister and the interior advisor rehman malik islamabad 00000284 002 of 002 5 u fm qureshi and the mfa issued the official reaction for the gop their remarks were aimed at minimizing foreign reaction by repeating all that pakistan has done to recover from khans misdeeds dismantle his network assist the iaea build up its export controls and strengthen its nuclear security qureshi noted that the government maintains the right to appeal the courts decision the english daily times editorial on sunday argued that khans release will not make the government more popular and may cause problems with the international community english language dawn suggested the real proliferation problem was not khans network but the discriminatory nature of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 6 s comment the islamabad high court is firmly under the control of the government so it would appear that this was planned move by some government element probably rehman malik in too clever by half move that was not coordinated with zardari malik who has aspirations to become deputy prime minister or even prime minister often has good political judgment but he failed badly this time there was not even hint publicly that nawaz sharif ever intended to nominate aq khan for senate seat moreover the new court decision would not make khans nomination any less probable this fiasco demonstrated yet another example of amateur uncoordinated governance in islamabad and nawaz will waste time in exploiting this misstep we will continue to monitor khans freedoms to determine if the gop is implementing the restrictions that they promised to continue imposing on khan patterson
