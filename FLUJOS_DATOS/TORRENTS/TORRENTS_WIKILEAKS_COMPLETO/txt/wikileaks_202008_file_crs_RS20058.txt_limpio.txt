summarized keith bea and richard s beth specialists in american national government government and finance division summary this summary of the unfunded mandates reform act umra of 1995 will assist members of congress and staff seeking succinct information on the statute the term unfunded mandates generally refers to requirements that unit of government imposes without providing funds to pay for costs of compliance umra establishes mechanisms to limit federal imposition of unfunded mandates on other levels of government intergovernmental mandates and on the private sector the act establishes points of order against proposed legislation containing an unfunded intergovernmental mandate requires executive agencies to seek comment on regulations that would constitute mandate and establishes means for judicial enforcement this report will be updated if the act is amended overview of umra history of the act enactment of the unfunded mandates reform act of 19951 umra culminated years of effort by nonfederal government officials and their advocates to control if not eliminate the federal imposition of unfunded mandates supporters contend that the statute is needed to forestall federal legislation and regulations that impose questionable or unnecessary burdens and have resulted in high costs and inefficiencies opponents argue that mandates may be necessary to achieve results in areas in which voluntary action may be insufficient or state actions have not achieved intended goals since the mid1980s congress debated legislation to slow or prohibit the enactment of unfunded federal mandates the inclusion of the issue in the contract with america the blueprint of legislative action developed by the house republican leadership when it gained the majority practically guaranteed that action would be taken umra was signed into law early in the 104th congress on march 22 1995 1 pl 1044 109 stat 48 et seq congressional research service the library of congress crs2 coverage of the act under umra federal mandates include provisions of law or regulation that impose enforceable duties including taxes2 they also include provisions that reduce or eliminate federal financial assistance available for carrying out an existing duty umra distinguishes between intergovernmental mandates imposed on state local or tribal governments and private sector mandates3 intergovernmental mandates include legislation or regulations that would 1 reduce certain federal services to state local and tribal governments such as border control or reimbursement for services to illegal aliens and 2 tighten conditions of assistance or reduce federal funding for existing intergovernmental assistance programs with entitlement authority of 500 million or more exclusions and exemptions outside the reach of the statute are discussed later in this report under umra an intergovernmental mandate is considered unfunded unless the legislation authorizing the mandate meets its costs by either 1 providing new budget authority direct spending authority or entitlement authority or 2 authorizing appropriations if appropriations are authorized the mandate is considered unfunded unless the legislation ensures that in any fiscal year 1 the actual costs of the mandate will not exceed the appropriations actually provided 2 the terms of the mandate will be revised so that it can be carried out with the funds appropriated 3 the mandate will be abolished or 4 congress will enact new legislation to continue the mandate as an unfunded mandate4 contents of the act the act consists of five prefatory sections and four titles the prefatory sections address matters such as the purpose short title and exclusions from coverage of the act title i amends the congressional budget and impoundment control act as amended to permit congress to 1 identify legislation proposing mandates and 2 decline to consider legislation proposing unfunded intergovernmental mandates title i also sets forth thresholds for action authorizations and definitions title ii requires that federal agencies assess the financial impact of proposed rules on nonfederal entities determine whether federal resources exist to pay those costs solicit and consider input from affected entities and generally select the least costly or burdensome regulatory option title iii called for review of federal mandates to be completed within 18 months of enactment this statutory requirement was not completed umra assigned the study to the advisory commission on intergovernmental relations acir which longer exists the acir completed preliminary report in january 1996 but the final report was not released5 title iv authorizes judicial review of federal agency compliance with title ii provisions the

fy1995 crs3 review of proposed legislation title i referred to as legislative accountability and reform title i establishes requirements for committees and the congressional budget office cbo to study and report on the magnitude and impact of mandates in proposed legislation title i also creates pointoforder procedures through which these requirements can be enforced and the consideration of measures containing unfunded intergovernmental mandates can be blocked information requirements under umra congressional committees have the initial responsibility to identify federal mandates in measures under consideration committees may have cbo study whether proposed legislation could have significant budgetary impact on nonfederal governments or financial or employment impact on the private sector6 also committee chairs and ranking minority members may have cbo study any legislation containing federal mandate7 when an authorizing committee orders reported public bill or joint resolution containing federal mandate it must provide the measure to cbo8 cbo must report to the committee an estimate of mandate costs the office must prepare full quantitative estimates if costs are estimated to exceed 59 million for intergovernmental mandates or 117 million for private sector mandates in any of the first five fiscal years the legislation would be in effect9 below these thresholds cbo must prepare brief statements of cost estimates10 for each reported measure with costs over the thresholds cbo is to submit to the committee an estimate of the direct costs of federal mandates contained in it or in any necessary implementing regulations11 and the amount of new or existing federal funding the legislation authorizes to pay these costs12 if reported legislation authorizes appropriations to meet the estimated costs of an intergovernmental mandate the cbo report must include statement on the new budget authority needed for up to 10 years to meet these costs13 for measure that reauthorizes or amends an existing statute the direct costs of any mandate it contains are to be measured by the projected increase over those costs required by existing law the 6 2

the initial levels were 50 million and 100 million respectively 10 2 usc 658cc sec 424 of cba 11 2 usc 658ca1 658cb1 sec 424 of cba 12 2 usc 658ca2a and c 658cb2 sec 424 of cba 13 2 usc 658ca2b sec 424 of cba crs4 calculation of increased costs must include any projected decrease in existing federal aid that provides assistance to nonfederal entities14 the committee is to include the cbo estimate in its report or publish it in the congressional record15 the committees report on the measure must also identify the direct costs to the entities that must carry out the mandate assess likely costs and benefits describe how the mandate affects the competitive balance between the public and private sectors and state the extent to which the legislation would preempt state local or tribal law and explain the effect of any preemption16 these requirements apply to all proposed mandates both intergovernmental and private sector for intergovernmental mandates alone the committee is to describe in its report the extent to which the legislation authorizes federal funding for the direct costs and details on whether and how funding is to be provided17 points of order for initial consideration umra establishes that when any measure is taken up for consideration in either house point of order may be raised that the measure contains unfunded intergovernmental mandates exceeding the 59 million threshold18 this point of order applies to the measure as reported including for example committee amendment in the nature of substitute the point of order may also be raised if cbo reported that reasonable estimate of the cost of intergovernmental mandates was feasible19 point of order also may be raised against consideration of measure reported from committee if the committee has not published cbo estimate of mandate costs this point of order applies to both intergovernmental and private sector mandates in the senate either point of order may be waived by majority vote20 otherwise if the chair sustains the point of order the measure may not be considered21 in ruling on these points of order the chair is to consult with the committee on governmental affairs on whether the measure contains intergovernmental mandates also the unfunded costs 14 2 usc 658g sec 428 of cba 15 2 usc 658bf sec 423 of cba 16 2 usc 658bc and sec 423 of cba the term direct costs is defined at 2 usc 6583 sec 421 of cba 17 2 usc 658bd sec 423 of cba 18 2 usc 658da2 sec 425 of cba 19 2 usc 658da1 658ca3 658cb3 sec 425 of cba 20 sec 904 of cba see 2 usc 621 historical and statutory notes 21 2 usc 658da sec 425 of cba crs5 of the mandate are to be determined based on estimates by the committee on the budget which may draw for this purpose on the cbo estimate22 for the house umra provides that if either point of order is raised the chair does not rule on it instead the house votes on whether to consider the measure despite the point of order to prevent dilatory use of the point of order the chair need not put the question of consideration to vote unless the member making the point of order meets the threshold burden of identifying specific language that is claimed to contain the unfunded mandate23 also if several points of order could be raised against the same measure house practices under umra afford means for all to be consolidated in single vote on consideration finally if the committee on rules proposes special rule for considering the measure that waives the point of order umra subjects the special rule itself to point of order which is disposed of by the same mechanism24 these procedures are intended to insure that the house like the senate will always have an opportunity to determine by vote whether to consider measure that may contain an unfunded mandate also if the house votes to consider measure in spite of the point of order umra protects the ability of members to offer amendments in the committee of the whole to strike out unfunded intergovernmental mandates unless the special rule specifically prohibits such amendments25 additional enforcement mechanisms point of order under the umra mechanism may be raised not only against initial consideration of bill or resolution but also against consideration of an amendment conference report or motion eg motion to recommit with instructions or motion to concur in an amendment of the other house with an amendment that would cause the unfunded costs of intergovernmental mandates in measure to exceed the specified threshold26 umra does not require amendments or motions to be accompanied by cbo mandate cost estimates but senator may request cbo to estimate the costs of mandates in an amendment he or she prepares27 if an amended bill or resolution or conference report contains new mandate or other new increases in mandate costs the conferees are to request supplemental estimate which cbo is to attempt to provide28 umra requires publication of these supplemental estimates the umra points of order are not applicable against consideration of appropriations bills however if an appropriation bill contains legislative provisions that would create unfunded intergovernmental mandates in excess of the threshold the umra point of 22 2 usc 658dd and sec 425 of cba 23 2 usc 658e sec 426 of cba 24 2 usc 658ea 658eb3 secs 426a and 426b3 of cba 25 2 usc 1514

this point of order is sustained the provisions are stricken from the bill29 exclusions and exemptions legislation pertinent to the following subject matters remains exempt from the umra pointoforder procedures individual constitutional rights discrimination prohibitions auditing compliance emergency assistance requested by nonfederal government officials national security or treaty obligations emergencies as designated by the president and the congress and social security30 the provisions of title i pertinent to federal agencies for example the requirement that agencies determine whether sufficient appropriations exist to provide for proposed costs do not apply to federal regulatory agencies31 also provisions establishing conditions of federal assistance or duties stemming from participation in voluntary federal programs are not mandates32 assessment of mandates in regulations title ii title ii requires that federal agencies prepare written statements that identify costs and benefits of federal mandate to be imposed through the rulemaking process the requirement applies to regulatory actions determined to result in costs of 117 million or more in any one year 2003 figure as adjusted for inflation the written assessments to be prepared by federal agencies must identify the law authorizing the rule anticipated costs and benefits the share of costs to be borne by the federal government and the disproportionate costs on individual regions or components of the private sector assessments must also include estimates of the effect on the national economy descriptions of consultations with nonfederal government officials and summary of the evaluation of comments and concerns obtained throughout the promulgation process33 impacts of any regulatory requirements on small governments must be identified notice must be given to those governments and technical assistance must be provided also umra requires that federal agencies consider reasonable number of policy options and select the most costeffective or least burdensome alternative34 judicial review title iv the requirements in title ii pertaining to the preparation of mandate assessment statement and notification of impact on small governments remain subject to judicial review federal court may compel federal agency to comply with these requirements but such court order cannot be used to stay or invalidate the rule35 29 2 usc 658dc sec 425 of cba 30 2 usc 658a sec 422 of cba see also 2 usc 1503 31 2 usc 6581 sec 4211 of cba 32 2 usc 6585aii and ii 6587ai and ii sec 421 of cba 33 2 usc
