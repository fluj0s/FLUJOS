implications for us economic interests wayne m morrison specialist in international trade and finance economics division summary since 1997 several east asian economies notably indonesia thailand and south korea and since 1998 russia and brazil have experienced significant financial difficulties including sharp currency depreciations plunging stock market prices and declining economic growth the global financial crisis contributed to slowdown in the growth of the chinese economy in 1998 especially its export sector although it fared better than most of its east asian neighbors many of whom fell into recession however many analysts have expressed concern that deepening of the global financial crisis may induce china to devalue its currency the yuan in order to stimulate export growth such move could lead to new destabilizing round of currency devaluations throughout east asia which would further depress us exports to the region in addition it would make chinese products cheaper in us markets and thus exacerbate the us trade deficit with china another concern is that china might also choose to respond to the financial crisis by putting hold on its plans to liberalize its economy and lower trade barriers this could further complicate chinas attempt to join the world trade organization and further strain uschina economic relations the global financial crisis and chinas response to date since 1997 several east asian economies notably south korea thailand and indonesia have experienced significant financial difficulties in their economies as have russia and brazil since 1998 such difficulties have included substantial currency devaluations as investors have transferred funds overseas and significant declines in stock market prices1 most of the other east asian economies including japan hong kong singapore the philippines and malaysia have also experienced varying degrees of financial difficulties falling stock market prices andor currency depreciation the global 1

the library of congress crs2 financial crisis has also seriously weakened or exposed weaknesses in the financial institutions such as banks of several east asian economies the financial crisis has contributed to sharp economic slowdown throughout much of the region2 chinas economy does not appear to have been as severely affected by the global financial crisis as most of its asian neighbors this is likely due to number of factors chinas currency the yuan is not fully convertible china maintains over 145 billion in foreign exchange reserves its foreign debt is relatively small compared to other asian nations its financial institutions banks stock markets etc are tightly controlled by the central government and foreign involvement is relatively minor and most foreign investment in china is direct such as joint ventures in china rather than portfolio such as stocks and bonds investment over the past year or so chinese government officials have made number of statements publicly through the press and in meetings with us officials and have implemented various policies in response to the global financial crisis first chinese officials have pledged not to devalue their currency during the crisis second china has offered standby loans as part of the international monetary fund imf financial assistance packages for indonesia and thailand to help stabilize their economies third chinese officials have pledged that their government will spend 12 trillion over three years on infrastructure development which may have been meant as signal that china would use domestic spending rather than increased exports to promote future economic growth3 fourth several officials have stated that the crisis will not deter china from making further economic reforms fifth the government has attempted to clamp down on illegal smuggling and foreign exchange transfers finally the chinese government has expanded export credits and tax rebates to exportoriented industries which have been hit the hardest by drop in demand such as textiles concerns over possible future chinese reactions to the financial crisis while chinas economy to date has been relatively insulated from the effects of the global financial crisis many analysts believe that the crisis could continue over the next few years and possibly deepen which might seriously weaken the chinese economy in 1999 due to number of factors much of chinas economic growth has been fueled by exports which according to chinese government data grew at an average annual rate of 16 from 1979 to 1997 in 1998 exports grew by only 05 chinese exports to asia fell by 10 while exports to the united states and the european union eu rose by 161 and 172 respectively an economic slowdown in the united states and eu in 1999 could result in negative export growth for china in 1999 many analysts estimate that chinas real gdp was significantly below the governments 78 estimate for example standard poors dri estimates chinas real 1998 gdp growth at 53 the slowest annual growth since 1990 2 in 1998 the economies of japan hong kong south korea indonesia malaysia and thailand were in recession 3 in 1998 the chinese government issued 12 billion in bonds to fund new infrastructure projects crs3 and projects that it will slow to 43 in 19994 this indicates that chinas economy may have slowed considerably and that domestic spending alone may not be enough to achieve the governments gdp growth target of 70 in 1999 major factor in the chinese governments decision not to devalue the yuan in 1998 appears to have been the decline in chinese imports due in part to weak domestic demand as result the sharp slowdown in chinas export growth did not result in deterioration in chinas merchandise balance of trade chinese trade data indicate that china incurred 436 billion trade surplus in 1998 up 77 from the previous year this enabled china to maintain high level of foreign exchange reserves estimated to have totaled 145 billion at the end of 1998 chinese officials believe maintaining high foreign exchange levels is critical to maintaining the stability of the yuan deterioration in chinas trade balance might occur in 1999 if demand for imports outpaces exports further major east asian currency devaluations should they occur could make many of their exports cheaper in foreign markets visavis chinese products which could displace many chinese exports to the united states and other markets5 in addition east asian currency devaluations would further depress their demand for chinese products6 east asian currency devaluations have made many of their exports to china cheaper to some extent this has likely benefitted some chinese firms which rely on imports from asia of raw materials and machinery used to make products for export on the other hand cheaper imports from east asia have put competitive pressure on many chinese firms raising demand from chinese industries for greater restraints on imports such as steel according to chinese data foreign direct investment fdi in china which has been major factor in chinas economic development over the past several years fell slightly in 1998 from 453 billion in 1997 to 450 billion further decline in fdi could impede chinas ability to raise capital in the near term for infrastructure development and economic modernization chinese officials are deeply sensitive to the prospects of an economic downturn due to concerns that if unemployment in china rises too quickly social unrest will result condition the government strongly wants to avoid many analysts argue that sharp downturn in economic growth andor sharp deterioration in chinas balance of trade could cause the chinese government to devalue its currency andor delay the implementation of economic and trade reforms 4 standard poors driworld markets report china december 1998 p 3 5 it is not clear whether or not devaluations of east asian currencies have yet displaced chinese exports to the united states and other third markets however such devaluations have likely forced chinese manufactures to lower prices on many items in which direct competition from east asia exists 6 chinese exports to east asian economies which account for about half of chinas exports fell sharply in 1998 over 1997 levels including those to hong kong 115 indonesia 363 singapore 91 japan 67 south korea 313 and thailand 235 crs4 chinese currency devaluation given the current shaky economic state of many east asian economies most analysts contend that chinese currency devaluation in the near term would likely further destabilize the economies of the region7 chinese currency devaluation in 1999 would also likely entail economic and political costs for china first chinese imports would become more expensive increasing inflationary pressures as well as raising costs for many inputs second devaluation might be interpreted in world markets as sign that china would not defend hong kongs pegging of its currency to the us dollar which could significantly undermine investor confidence in hong kongs economy8 third it would likely increase the level of chinese exports to the united states thus boosting the size of the uschina trade imbalance which reached about 57 billion in 1998 politically sensitive issue in uschina trade relations finally devaluation would undermine chinas current image as stable and responsible economic power in the region and could adversely affect its relations with other east asian nations analysts differ on whether china will devalue its currency in 1999 for example standard poors dri estimates that competitive pressures from currency devaluations from the other east asian economies will force china to devalue its currency by 20 against the us dollar in late 1999 but only if the financial crisis in asia has stabilized so that the shock of devaluation will be minor9 the wefa group projects that the chances of chinese devaluation in 1999 are low due to chinese concerns that such move would further strain uschina economic relations10 effects on chinas economic reforms second major issue is how the asian financial crisis will affect the future course of chinese economic reforms most economists argue that china needs to make several major economic reforms in order to maintain rapid economic growth including reform of its stateowned enterprises and financial institutions the asian financial crisis could complicate chinas efforts to reform these sectors reform of stateowned enterprises stateowned enterprises soes which account for about onethird of chinese industrial production place heavy strain on chinas economy it is estimated that 75 of chinas largest 100000 soes lose money and must be supported by state subsidies11 many of the tariff and nontariff trade barriers imposed by china on imports are intended to protect the soes from foreign competition in the past the chinese government has been reluctant to cut off financial support to the soes out of concern that it would lead to widespread bankruptcies and significant employment disruptions that could cause social unrest however in recent years the 7 for example the wefa group an economic forecasting firm states that chinese devaluation could spark new and possibly catastrophic round of currency devaluation see the wefa group asia economic outlook february 1998 p 4 8 maintaining hong kongs economic stability since its reunion with china in july 1997 has been major priority of the chinese government 9 standard poors dri international financial bulletin december 1999 p 1 10 the wefa group china first quarter 1999 p 10 11 wefa group asian economic outlook february 1997 p 49 crs5 government has admitted that it cannot afford to support the soes indefinitely in march 1998 the chinese government announced that it would in effect privatize all but 1000 key industries over the next three years the government contends that exposing the soes to competition will make them more efficient and able to compete without government assistance thus freeing resources for more productive uses the global financial crisis may complicate chinas planned reforms of the soes in variety of ways first the chinese government is counting on rapid economic growth to help find new jobs for workers displaced by soe reforms slower economic growth would make it much more difficult for displaced workers to find jobs in other sectors of the economy and hence raises the prospects for possible social unrest second it is likely that chinese officials are counting on foreign investors to play major role in restructuring the soes by becoming joint owners and thereby providing financing and management assistance to such firms however the global financial crisis could slow down the level of foreign investment in china especially from asian countries most affected by the crisis as result less capital would be available for restructuring the soes slowing economic growth less foreign investment and sharp increase in imports may prompt the chinese to slow or delay reforms to open its markets to foreign imports in order to maintain protection of the soes financial institutions chinas banking system faces several major difficulties due largely to its financial support of soes and failure to operate sufficiently on marketbased principles the central government uses the banking system to keep moneylosing soes afloat by pressuring state banks to provide low interest loans without these loans large share of the soes would likely go bankrupt currently about 70 of stateowned bank loans now go to the soes large share of those loans are not repaid the high volume of bad loans now held by chinese banks estimated to total more than 20 of chinas gdp poses serious threat to chinas banking system12 to large extent chinas state banks make loans on the basis of political not commercial considerations this promotes widespread inefficiencies in the economy however in january 1998 the chinese government announced plans to implement new reforms that would attempt to reduce the ability of local and provincial officials to use connections to obtain questionable loans the global financial crisis may complicate chinas plans to further reform the banking system china needs growing economy to help the chinese state banks reduce their debt in addition many analysts argue that chinas banking system cannot become purely commercial operation until it stops subsidizing the soes factor that becomes more uncertain due to the recent slowdown in economic growth implications of chinas response to the asian financial crisis for us china economic relations chinas response to the global financial crisis has widespread ramifications for us china economic relations as well as for us economic ties with other asian nations to date us officials have generally praised chinas response to the crisis especially its pledge not to devalue its currency noting that it has helped to stabilize the effects of the 12 far eastern economic review world wide web page december 11 1997 crs6 crisis13 however should china later reverse this policy it could lead to extensive devaluations throughout east asia which could further undermine the economies of the region should this occur us exports to the region would probably fall further while imports would rise and the us trade deficit with china and other east asian economies probably would increase sharply it is difficult to predict whether the global financial crisis will slow or accelerate the pace of chinas economic reforms on the one hand the crisis may cause the chinese leadership to approach further reforms with greater caution in the belief that it was the openness of the east asian economies that made them susceptible to financial crisis chinese leaders may fear that chinas economy if reformed too quickly or extensively could make its currency and stock markets susceptible to disruptive speculative forces outside of china on the other hand the global financial crisis may cause the chinese leadership to move ahead with planned economic reforms especially if it is perceived that many of the causes of the financial crisis such as government industrial policies weak financial systems and closed markets are also indicative of weaknesses within the chinese economy the crisis may also affect the way china approaches its goals of modernizing its economy such as whether to try to emulate japanese and south korean business conglomerates keiretsu and chaebols to promote the growth of advanced and hightech industries the pace of chinese economic reforms in the wake of the global financial crisis will likely have major impact on chinas attempt to join the world trade organization wto the international body that sets rules for most trade the united states views chinas wto accession under commercially viable terms critical factor in expanding market access for us goods and services in china chinese officials have stated that they will continue to reform chinas trade regime in order to gain wto membership despite the effects of the global financial crisis on chinas economy however us officials have raised concerns that china has recently imposed several new trade barriers such as quotas registration requirements restrictions on foreign investment on variety of sectors including agriculture telecommunications equipment and various services in addition new financial controls on trade imposed in july 1998 in order to crack down on illegal foreign exchange transfers have made it more difficult to export products to china should china continue to impose new barriers in 1999 or thereafter andor fail to make substantial new offers to liberalize trade its accession to the wto will likely be opposed by the united states and other wto members failure on the part of china to make progress on its wto application could also prompt the united states to use its trade laws such as section 301 of the 1974 trade act as amended to force china under the threat of sanctions to open its markets chinas response to the global financial crisis will also likely affect congressional action on uschina economic relations for example chinese currency devaluation or delay in economic reforms could increase congressional opposition to renewing chinas normal trade relations ntr status 13 however us officials have been critical of chinas increasing use of export credits and tax rebates arguing that such policies constitute facto devaluation for other versions of
