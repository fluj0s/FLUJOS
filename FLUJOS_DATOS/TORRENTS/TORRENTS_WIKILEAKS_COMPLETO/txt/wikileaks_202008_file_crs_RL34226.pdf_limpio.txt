fwoolf foreign aﬀairs defense and trade division december 30 2008 abstract this report highlights the diﬀerences between the construct of tailored deterrence and the more general concept of strategic deterrence that guided us nuclear policy during the cold war it then identiﬁes number of issues that congress might address when it reviews these diﬀerences including the question of whether detailed and tailored attack plans are more likely to enhance deterrence or more likely to lead to the early use of nuclear weapons and the question of whether tailored deterrence provides any guidance about the future size and structure of us nuclear forceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34226g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and

tailored deterrence to define the role that nuclear weapons play in us national security policy there has been little discussion of this concept either in congress or in the public at large this leaves unanswered questions about how this strategy differs from us nuclear strategy during the cold war and how it might advise decisions about the size and structure of the us nuclear arsenal throughout the cold war the united states relied on nuclear weapons to deter an attack by the soviet union and its allies and to forestall the outbreak of global war between the united states and the soviet union however the broad cold warera agreement about the role of nuclear weapons in us security policy began to dissolve during the 1990s after the demise of the soviet union further in response to emerging threats to us national security the bush administration has argued that the united states must alter its deterrence strategy from one size fits all deterrence to tailored deterrence for rogue powers terrorist networks and nearpeer competitors during the cold war the united states often modified or tailored its nuclear targeting doctrine its nuclear weapons employment policy and its nuclear force structure to enhance or maintain the credibility of its nuclear deterrent posture in some ways the bush administrations concept of tailored deterrence follows the same pattern using assessments of an adversarys society and values to identify range of targets that might be threatened and adjusting us war plans and force structure to enhance the credibility of us threats to destroy these targets however tailored deterrence differs from cold war deterrence in that it explicitly notes that us nuclear weapons could be used in attacks against number of nations that might have developed and deployed chemical and biological weapons even if they did not possess nuclear weapons hence the new policy seems more of change in who we will deter than it is change in how we will deter congress may review the concept of tailored deterrence either as part of its oversight of nuclear weapons policies and programs or as part of broader debate about the role of nuclear weapons in us national security policy issues that ght come up in such review are questions about how much us nuclear strategy and weapons employment policy have changed in recent years questions about whether the new capabilities and war plans will enhance the credibility of us deterrent threats or conversely make the use of nuclear weapons more likely questions about whether the united states must develop new weapons capabilities to meet the demands of tailored deterrence or whether it must retain force structure with thousands of deployed warheads if it longer uses the russian threat as the metric for sizing the us force and questions about whether the new concepts and war plans expand or restrict the role of nuclear weapons in us national security strategy this report will be updated as needed

administration described the strategy of tailored deterrence to define the role that nuclear weapons might play in us national security policy yet there has been little discussion of this concept either in congress or in the public at large that would allow this concept to serve as mechanism to help determine the size and structure of the us nuclear force this absence of discussion has also made it difficult to identify the ways in which tailored deterrence differs if at all from the cold war concept of strategic deterrence and how it might alter the role of nuclear weapons in us national security strategy this report highlights the differences between the construct of tailored deterrence and the more general concept of strategic deterrence that guided us nuclear policy during the cold war it then identifies number of issues that congress might address when it reviews these differences including the question of whether detailed and tailored attack plans are more likely to enhance deterrence or more likely to lead to the early use of nuclear weapons and the question of whether tailored deterrence provides any guidance about the future size and structure of us nuclear

security policy for more than 50 years from the end of world war ii and particularly from the first explosion of soviet nuclear weapon in 1949 until the end of the cold war in 1991 the united states relied on nuclear weapons to deter soviet aggression and forestall the outbreak of global war between the united states and the soviet union generally the united states sought to maintain nuclear and conventional capabilities sufficient to convince any potential aggressor that the costs of aggression would exceed any potential gains that he might achieve 1 but the soviet union was and russia remains the only nation that could pose global challenge to us allies and interests and threaten to cause massive destruction in the united states other nations such as china and soviet allies in eastern europe were included in the us nuclear war plans but the soviet threat dominated us defense planning nuclear forces were sized to deter the soviet threat these were then thought to be sufficient to deter or respond to the lesser included cases of threats from other nations although there were often debates about the numbers and types of weapons that the united states should deploy in its nuclear arsenal there was little doubt or debate among analysts experts and government officials about the need for the united states to deter the soviet threat this widespread consensus about the nature of the threat to the united states and its allies and the need for nuclear weapons to deter and respo nd to this threat began to dissolve during the 1990s after the demise of the soviet union some began to argue that in the absence of the 1 us department of defense annual report to congress fiscal year 1985 by caspar weinberger secretary of defense february 1 1984 washington 1984 p

nuclear weapons would serve only as weapons of last resort to deter nuclear attacks or possibly other catastrophic attacks against the united states itself2 others argued that the united states needed to maintain credible nuclear deterrent to hedge against the possibility of resurgence of the russian threat3 still others argued that the united states should craft nuclear policy and force posture that would allow it deter andor respond to the threat of nuclear chemical or biological attacks from growing number of potential adversaries although many analysts outside government hoped the united states would sharply limit the role of nuclear weapons after the end of the cold war the clinton administration did not adopt more restrictive or last resort posture for us nuclear weapons throughout the 1990s the clinton administration argued that in addition to serving as hedge against the potential resurgence of russian threat nuclear weapons remained important to deter the range of threats faced by the united states it highlighted in its 1999 national security strategy that the united states must continue to maintain robust triad of strategic forces sufficient to deter any hostile foreign leadership with access to nuclear forc and to convince it that seeking nuclear advantage would be futile furthermore nuclear deterrence would not necessarily be limited to potential aggressors with nuclear weapons although the united states did not explicitly threaten the use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear st ates assistant secretary of defense edward warner did indicate in testimony before congress that the very existence of us strategic and theater nuclear forces backed by highly capable conventional forces should certainly give pause to any rogue leader contemplating the use of wmd weapons of mass destruction ie nuclear chemical and biological weapons against the united states its overseas deployed forces or its allies 4 the bush administration shifted us nuclear doctrine at least rhetorically away from concerns about resurgent russian threat it declared that the united states and russia longer view each other as adversaries and it stated when releasing the results of its nuclear posture review npr in early 2002 that the united states will longer plan size or sustain its nuclear forces as though russia presented merely smaller version of the threat posed by the former soviet union 5 it has instead emphasized that nuclear weapons provide credible capabilities to deter wide range of threats including weapons of mass destruction and largescale conventional military force6 some analysts consider this shift to be more rhetorical than real as the united 2 this debate mirrored one that had occurred with respect to the role of nuclear ewapons in nato policy for description of this concept see bundy mcgeorge william j crowe jr and sidney drell reducing nuclear danger foreign affairs spring 1993 pp 143146 these authors all with years of experience in us nuclear weapons strategy and doctrine advocated doctrine of defensive last resort where nuclear weapons would be reserved for use in only the most dire circumstances 3 this concept was underscored as part of the results of the 1994 nuclear posture review where secretary of defense perry indicated that the united states would alter its nuclear forces so that it could both lead to further reductions in nuclear weapons and hedge against an unexpected developments in russia see for example us department of defense office of the assistant secretary of defense public affairs remarks prepared for

it did during the 1990s7 nevertheless the bush administration has conti nued to emphasize the need to size and shape us nuclear forces to deter emerging threats from growing number of potential adversaries specifically the bush administration has indicated that the united states would employ strategy of tailored deterrence where the weapons and attack strategies guiding us nuclear forces would be tailored to address the specific capabilities and goals of emerging adversaries8 g16g142g142g141g561g143g152g155g561g138g561g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g6g142g139g138g157g142g501g561 most discussions about us nuclear weapons poli cy whether they occur in congress or in the public and academic literature focus on how many and what types of weapons the united states should deploy to implement its nuclear doctrine and deterrent strategy9 the discussions have also addressed questions about whether the united st ates should pursue the design and development of new types of nuclear warheads either to extend us nuclear capabilities or to provide an alternative means of maintaining the us arsenal and us nuclear capabilities into the future10 but growing number of analysts and officials agree that it will be difficult to answer questions about the future size and structure of the us nuclear arsenal without at least some agreement about the role this arsenal should play in us national security policy11 the former director of the national nuclear security administration nnsa ambassador linton brooks noted this development during remarks he made to conference in january 2007 when he stated that we are increasingly hearing from thoughtful observers that political support for the reliable replacement warhead rrw will not be possible without greater consensus on the future role of nuclear weapons 12 several committees in congress have also requested reports from the administration that would link us nuclear wea pons strategy to plans for us nuclear weapons and the nuclear weapons infrastructure13 this perspective has led to calls for national debate on the future role of nuclear weapons in us national security strategy it has also served as the backdrop for numerous studies completed in 2008 in anticipation of the presidential transition that reviewed the us nuclear posture and offered recommendations for changes in the size and structure of the us nuclear force although the specific recommendations vary most of these studies recommend that the united states 7 see for example sidney d drell and james goodby what are nuclear weapons for

emphasize how much the national security environment for the united states has changed since the demise of the soviet union in 1991 and the terrorist attacks in 2001 the report of the 2006 quadrennial review for example notes that the united states now faces an international security environment characterized by uncertainty and surprise and that it must transform its national security strategy in response to this new environment 15 specifically and of interest for this report the defense department has identified the need to shift from one size fits all deterrence to tailored deterrence for rogue powers terrorist networks and nearpeer competitors 16 the pentagons emphasis on the distinction between one size fits all deterrence and tailored deterrence is designed to evoke an understanding of just how much the nature of the threat and the number of us adversaries have changed since the end of the cold war but even during the cold war the united states tailored its nuclear targeting doctrine its nuclear weapons employment policy and its nuclear force structure to enhance or maintain the credibility of its nuclear deterrent posture therefore this shift raises questions about the ways in which tailored deterrence differs from classic cold warera strategic deterrence this section discusses the differences between these two conc epts in an effort to clarify how tailored deterrence might alter us nuclear weapons employment policy and targeting doctrine g6g142g157g142g155g155g142g151g140g142g496g561g146g151g561g22g145g142g152g155g162g561 deterrence or more precisely the theoretical construct of strategic deterrence describes an ongoing interaction between two parties in deterrent relationship one or both parties seek to persuade the other to refrain from harmful or dangerous actions by threatening or promising the other nation that the costs of acting will far outweigh the benefits this can be done by threatening to impose high costs on the acting nation threatening to deny the benefits the other nation may seek through its actions and promising to withhold the costs if the nation forgoes the expected action because it affects the perceptions and chosen actions of nations with multiple goals and interests deterrence is difficult to implement or measure with any precision further in spite of the common shorthand of the cold war era deterrence and the threat of nuclear destruction are not interchangeable concepts nation could for example threaten to use 14 see for example nuclear weapons in 21st century us national security report by joint

threatening to resort to nuclear weapons if the adversary perceived those forces to be sufficient to achieve an unacceptable level of destruction nevertheless many analysts agree that during the cold war the threat of nuclear retaliation generated the promise of high costs and therefore lent some stability to the us soviet deterrent relationship questions about the credibility of the us deterrent posture persisted throughout the cold war with the united states adjusting its doctrine targeting strategy and force structure periodically in an effort to bolster its credibility and enhance deterrence it did not maintain one size fits all deterrent but sought to tailor its forces and attack strategies to affect the perceptions of the soviet union and other potential adversaries by convincing them that the united states had the will the weapons and the plans needed to ensure that it would respond if attacked and that the level of destruction would be unacceptable to the adversary the bush administrations focus on tailored deterrence appears to follow the same logic with the focus on tailoring attack strategies and weapons to create credible deterrent threat however the bush administrations concept of tailored deterrence appears to differ from classic strategic deterrence in at least two ways first the bush administration has argued that the united states must prepare to deter wider range of threats from greater number of potential adversaries so it is seeking to tailor weapons capabilities operational plans and targeting strategies to counter the capabilities of advanced military powers regional wmd states and nonstate terrorists second tailored deterrence focuses less on maintaining deterrent relationship with any specific nation than it does on acquiring the capabilities to attack and destroy valued targets in another nation this capability may be necessary for deterrent threat to be credible but it is not sufficient to establish or presume the broader conditions of strategic deterrence because strategic deterrent relationship presumes that both nations know the costs and consequences of acting and each may believe that it will not suffer the costs or consequences if it does not act the communication between the two parties may be indirect or even ambiguous but it is presumed that both parties know the stakes and risks associated with their possible actions g6g142g157g142g155g155g142g151g140g142g496g561g6g158g155g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g5g152g149g141g561g25g138g155g561 throughout the cold war the challenge for us nuclear policy was to make the threat of nuclear retaliation and therefore the us deterrent posture credible towards this end the united states repeatedly sought to modify and adjust its forces and targeting strategy so that the soviet union would believe and heed the us threat to retaliate with nuclear weapons the 1950s doctrine known as massive retaliation envisioned simultaneous massive integrated us nuclear strike against targets in the soviet union eastern europe and china if the soviet union or its allies initiated any nuclear or conventional attack against the united states or its allies 17 in the late 1950s many began to question whether the soviet union would believe that the united states would launch massive nuclear attack against the soviet union in response to any level of aggression against western europe particularly when it became evident that the 17 there was calculated strategy for war winning or termination beyond that of producing as much destruction as

cities consequently in the early 1960s secretary of defense robert mcnamara outlined doctrine of damage limitation which called for attacks against soviet conventional and nuclear military forces this became known as counterforce strategy because it explicitly excluded attacks designed to destroy cities and focused instead on attacks that would impede the soviet unions warfighting capability18 in particular it sought to destroy those weapons that the soviet union might use to attack us cities nevertheless because many of the targets were located near cities and the attack would have been very large analysts agree that it would still have produced massive casualties by the mid1960s secretary mcnamara posited the doctrine of assured destruction 19 where the united states sought to persuade the soviet leadership that soviet society would be destroyed if the soviet union launched an attack on the united states or its allies but by the early 1970s many again questioned the credibility of doctrine that called for massive strikes against soviet society particularly if the soviet union could threaten to strike back against us cities therefore the united states shifted its doctrine again to flexible response in the mid1970s and countervailing strategy in the late 1970s these policies emphasized retaliatory strikes on soviet military forces and warmaking capabilities as opposed to attacks on civilian and industrial targets and they called for limited focused attacks on specified military targets instead of largescale attacks on greater number of sites the 1988 version of the national security strategy of the united states summarized the us approach to targeting by noting that targeting those assets which are essential to soviet warmaking capability and political control has been an integral part of the us strategy for many years 20 the attack options that were designed to implement this approach were contained in the highly classified strategic integrated operational plan the siop according to scholarly reports and articles the siop evolved over the years in response to changes in the number and capabilities of us nuclear forces changes in the soviet force structure and the evolution of theories about how to deter the soviet union the siop reportedly provided the president with number of attack options that varied in terms of the numbers and types of targets to be attacked and varied according to the number and types of us warheads available when the conflict began 21 further according to unclassified reports the target categories included in the siop included soviet strategic nuclear forces other military forces military and political leadership and industrial facilities22 the united states sought the capability to destroy thousands of sites in these target categories even if the soviet union destroyed many us weapons in first strike leading to the requirement for large numbers of us strategic nuclear weapons to meet these targeting requirements by the latter half of the 1980s the united states deployed nearly 12000 warheads on its landbased missiles icbms submarinelaunched ballistic 18 desmond ball the development of the siop

multiple basing modes for us nuclear weapons would enhance deterrence and discourage soviet first strike because they complicated soviet attack planning and ensured the survivability of significant portion of the us force in the event of soviet first strike24 the different characteristics of each weapon system might also strengthen the credibility of us targeting strategy icbms had the accuracy and prompt responsiveness needed to attack hard ened targets such as soviet command posts and icbm silos slbms had the survivability needed to complicate soviet efforts to launch disarming first strike and heavy bombers could be dispersed quickly and launched to enhance their survivability and could be recalled to their bases if crisis did not escalate into conflict taken together this diverse and numerous force was thought to have the capability to persuade the soviet union that any attack it launched would be met with an overwhelming response and an unacceptable amount of damage it was the sum total of this force as much as the details of the specific targets that could be destroyed in an attack option that provided the united states with robust strategic deterrent

remained important to deter the range of threats faced by the united states in his annual report to congress in 1995 secretary of defense perry noted recent international upheavals have not changed the calculation that nuclear weapons remain an essential part of american military power concepts of deterrence continue to be central to the us nuclear posture thus the united states will continue to threaten retaliation including nuclear retaliation to deter aggression against the united states us forces and allies 25 nevertheless the clinton administration argued that the dissolution of the soviet empire had radically transformed the security environment facing the united states and our allies the primary security imperative of the past half centurycontaining communist expansion while preventing nuclear waris gone26 russia could potentially pose threat to the united states again in the future because it controls the only nuclear arsenal that can physically threaten the survivability of us nuclear forces 27 but the united states also faced growing threats from number of emerging adversaries in its national security strategy report for 1998 the administration noted that number of states still have the capabilities and the desire to threaten our vital interests and that in many cases these states are also actively improving their 23 crs report rl33640 us

nuclear biological or chemical weapons and in some cases longrange delivery systems28 after the collapse of the soviet union the department of defense conducted several studies to review us nuclear targeting strategy and w eapons employment policy according to published reports these reviews revised and greatly reduced the length of the target list within the siop but left the basic tenets of the strategy untouched according to 1995 article in the washington post the united states primary nuclear war plan still targets russia and provides the president an option for counterattack within 30 minutes of confirmed enemy launch29 in 1997 however the clinton administration altered the us strategy from seeking to win protracted nuclear war strategy identified during the reagan administration to seeking to deter nuclear war in practice this probably meant the united states would not seek to cause as much damage against as wide range of targets as it had planned on attacking in previous war plans consequently the united states would not need as large an arsenal of nuclear weapons as it had needed during the cold war but these changes did not alter the core objectives of us nuclear policy the united states reportedly continued to prepare range of attack options from limited attacks involving small numbers of weapons to major attacks involving thousands of warheads and to plan attacks against military targets nuclear forces and civilian leadership sites in russia 30 at the same time reports indicated that the us strategic command stratcom had begun to expand the focus of the siop and include plans for possible attacks against wider range of adversaries according to some reports in 1992 general lee butler the commanderinchief of the strategic command proposed changing the name of the siop to the national strategic response plans to accommodate the fact that the siop itself was evolving to collection of far more differentiated retaliatory choices tailored to threat environment of greater nuance and complexity 31 the clinton administration argued that the flexibility offered by this range of options would enhance deterrence by providing the united states with more credible responses to range of crises and attack scenarios the clinton administration also did not rule ou t the possible use of nuclear weapons against nations that were not armed with nuclear weapons themselves specifically it maintained the longstanding us policy of reserving the right to use nuclear weapons first in crisis or conflict if state is not state in good standing under the nuclearnonproliferation treaty npt or an equivalent international convention32 furthermore the united states did not rule out the 28 national security strategy for new century the white house october 1998 washington dc p 6 29 secretary cheney and general powell and their aides threw thousands of targets out of the siop single integrated operational plan helping to reduce it from its cold war peak of more than 40000 to about 10000 by 1991 in addition general butler reviewed each target onebyone tossing many out one day he eliminated 1000 targets in newly liberated eastern europe by 1994 general

the united states or us forces with weapons of mass destruction wmd33 the united states did not however directly threaten to use nuclear weapons in retaliation for nonnuclear attacks its policy consistent with the longstanding us approach was one of studi ed ambiguity neither ruling in nor ruling out the possible use of nuclear weapons in any given circumstance the united states did however reduce the size of its nuclear arsenal to around 6000 warheads deployed on strategic delivery vehicles according to the provisions outlined in the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty start even with these reductions however the united states continued to maintain triad of strategic nuclear forces with warheads deployed on landbased icbms submarinelaunched slbms and heavy bombers according to the department of defense this mix of forces not only offered the united states range of capabilities and flexibility in nuclear planning that complicated an adversarys attack planning but also hedged against unexpected problems in any single delivery system moreover the united states still maintained detailed tailored attack plans that were intended to enhance the credibility of the us deterrent posture g6g142g157g142g155g155g142g151g140g142g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g344g343g156g157g561g5g142g151g157g158g155g162g561 the bush administration emphasized that nuclear weapons continue to be essential to our security and that of our friends and allies34 it argued that nuclear weapons remain the only weapons in the us arsenal that can hold at risk the full range of targets valued by an adversary as result they provide credible capabilities to deter wide range of threats including weapons of mass destruction and largescale conventional military force35 in many ways the bush administrations statements about the role that nuclear weapons play in deterring potential opponents echo the cold war and postcold war concepts described above in document prepared in february 2004 stratcom noted that nuclear weapons cast lengthy shadow over rational adversarys decision calculus when considering coercion aggression wmd employment and escalatory courses of action nuclear weapons threaten destruction of an adversarys most highly valued targets this includes destruction of targets otherwise invulnerable to conventional attack 36 further according to the report of the quadrennial defense review the aim is to possess sufficient capability to convince any potential adversary that it cannot prevail in conflict and that engaging in conflict entails substantial strategic risks beyond military defeat37 at the same time though the bush administration has indicated that the cold war concept of strategic deterrence would not be sufficient to generate the

assistant secretary of defense during the 2001 nuclear posture review noted that deterrence threats based on the generally high nuclear yields of the cold war arsenal may not appear credible given the excessive civilian destruction likely to occur clearly some reasonable and much needed steps to better align us deterrence policy to the realities of the new era include broadening us deterrent threat options seeking an understanding of the opponents intentions and the flexibility to tailor deterrence to specific requirements of foe time and place 38 this is the mandate for tailored deterrence according to ryan henry the principal deputy secretary of defense for policy when pursuing the concept of tailored deterrence the united states must have the means to determine what assets an adversary holds dear and wants to protect an ability to identify which military tools can be used to threaten those assets and an effective means of communicating to adversaries that the military can target their most important assets and destroy them 39 payne made similar points in testimony before the house armed services committees subcommittee on strategic forces in july 2007 when he noted that central feature of the us ability to tailor deterrence to meet emerging threats was the ability to understand the specific opponents mindset and behavioral style and the different ways opponents can perceive and respond to our deterrence threats40 the bush administration asserts that nuclear weapons have role to play in deterring threats and challenges from potential adversaries armed with weapons of mass destruction during news conference on march 14 2002 president bush stated that we want to make it very clear to nations that you will not threaten the united states or use weapons of mass destruction against us or our allies i view our nuclear arsenal as deterrent as way to say to people that would harm america that there is consequence and the president must have all the options available to make that deterrent have meaning 41 further some outside reports indicate that in june 2002 president bush signed new nuclear weapons planning guidance national security presidential directive nspd 14 that explicitly stated that the united states may use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks against us forces or allies42 the united states has never ruled out the use of nuclear weapons in response to attacks by nations with chemical or biological weapons in other words the united states has never adopted first use policy for its nuclear weapons even though many analysts argue that such policy would better serve us national security interests nonetheless some view the bush administrations explicit inclusion of these types of attacks in nuclear weapons planning guidance as further indicator of an expanding role for nuclear weapons the pentagon has outlined changes in the us strategy for targeting nuclear weapons shifting from threatbased targeting to capabilitiesbased targeting instead of focusing on the forces and attack plans needed to defeat the soviet threat when planning for the possible use of nuclear weapons the united states would look more at broad range of capabilities and contingencies that the united states may confront and tailor us military capabilities to address this wide 38 keith payne letter to the editor

the pentagon the united states would identify potential future conflicts review the capabilities of its possible adversaries identify those capabilities that the united states might need to attack or threaten with nuclear weapons and develop force posture and nucle ar weapons employment strategy that would allow it to attack those capabilities the bush administration never specified in public the full range of capabilities or types of targets that the united states would want to threaten under this strategy however it has highlighted the threat posed by hardened and deeply buried targets and has also noted that the united states may need to improve its capabilities against mobile or fleeting targets perhaps by enhancing its ability to attack promptly or perhaps preemptively at the start of conflict the desire to acquire this capability is central to the focus of the new prompt global strike mission and the pentagons interest in pursuing the deployment of conventional warheads on some of air force or navy longrange ballistic missiles one list of possible targets for nuclear weapons appears in dods publication deterrence operations joint operating concepts this document indicates that nuclear weapons threaten destruction of an adversarys most highly valued assets including adversary wmd capabilities critical industries key resources and means of political organization and control including the adversary leadership itself this includes destruction of targets otherwise invulnerable to conven tional attack eg hard and deeply buried facilities location uncertainty targets etc 44 as it did during the cold war the pentagon continues to maintain detailed war plan that contains the numerous nuclear attack options that would be available to the president in the event of conflict the siop of the cold war era has however been replaced with new war plan known as oplan operations plan 8044 this docume nt may contain many of the same types of major strike options and contingency plans for potential conflicts with russia that had been included in the siop although reports indicate that it longer considers russia to be an immediate contingency that the united states must plan to address 45 it also reportedly contains options that would be available for use in conflicts with other potential adversaries at the same time officials from stratcom have indicated that the structure and purpose of the siopoplan has changed as it has expanded to include wider range of contingencies and potential adversaries in 2003 the commanderinchief of stratcom admiral james ellis noted as had his predecessor general butler in 1992 that the war plan was changing from single large integrated plan to family of plans applicable to wider range of scenarios 46 as the plan continued to evolve in response to guidance that emerged after the 2001 nuclear posture review it underwent what general richard myers then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff referred to as major revamping

defeat adversaries in wider range of contingencies47 hence as the us nuclear war plan has evolved it has changed from single integrated plan that contained growing number of options for ttacks against the soviet union to more diverse document that has been described as family of plans with options for attacks against wider range of contingencies the bush administration has identified three types of contingencies that these plans must address 48 immediate contingencies include wellrecognized current dangers the soviet threat was an immediate contingency in the past current examples include wmd attack on us forces or allies in the middle east or asia potential contingencies are plausible but not immediate dangers this might include the emergence of new adversarial military coalitions or the re emergence of hostile peer competitor according to the bush administration the united states would probably have sufficient warning of the emergence of these threats to modify or adjust its nuclear posture unexpected contingencies are sudden and unpredicted security challenges this might include sudden regime change causing an existing nuclear arsenal to be transferred to the control of hostile leadership or an adversarys sudden acquisition of wmd these three types of contingencies would place different demands on us nuclear war planners because the united states can understand and anticipate immediate contingencies it can size structure and plan in advance for the use of its nuclear arsenal to address these contingencies the united states can also plan in advance for the possible use of nuclear weapons in potential contingencies even if it does not maintain the needed force structure on daytoday basis these contingencies are one possible source of the family of plans contained in oplan 8044 further these plans may include many of the same types of targets as the united states planned to attack during the cold war because the ability to destroy these types of facilities is likely to remain important to the us ability to defeat an enemy and limit damage to itself during conflict these targets could include deployed and nondeployed stocks of weapons of mass destruction other military facilities leadership facilities and possibly other economic targets the united states cannot however prepare preplanned attack options for unexpected contingencies because it does not know when or where these threats may emerge this has given rise to growing emphasis on the need for adaptive planning capabilities stratcom which develops the operational plans for us strategic nuclear weapons has been pursuing this capability since at least 1992 when it sought to develop flexible globally focused war planning process along with living siop nuclear war plan able to respond almost instantaneously to new requirements 49 now stra tcom is in the process of developing more flexible and adaptive planning system that employs modern computing techniques and 47 us

capability for rapid flexible crisis response50 the bush administration emphasized the increasing importance of adaptive planning and waning relevance of preplanned attack options to highlight the fact that its nuclear doctrine and targeting strategy focus on emerging threats ra ther than on smaller version of the cold war threat from the soviet union however some stat ements indicate that concerns about russia and possibly china have continued to play role in determining the size and structure of the us nuclear arsenal in brief statement on national security and nuclear weapons released in late july 2007 the secretaries of energy defense and state indicated that the future direction that any number of states may take including some established nuclear powers with aggressive nuclear force modernization programs could have dramatic effect on us security and the security of our allies 51 according to steve henry an assistant secretary of defense both russia and china qualify as established nuclear powers with aggressive nuclear force modernization programs52 under the terms of the 2002 strategic offens ive reductions treaty known as the moscow treaty the united states will reduce the size of its nuclear arsenal to 17002200 operationally deployed warheads by the end of 201253 hence the united states still plans to maintain sizeable and varied force of strategic offensive nuclear warheads the bush administration has stated that this force is not determined by need to counter russian threat but to provide the united states with the capability to assure its alli of its commitments to their security dissuade potential adversaries from seeking to challenge or compete with the united states deter conflict with adversaries and defeat an adversary if deterrence should fail 54 moreover some who support the bush administrations approach have argued that the remaining us nuclear force structure may not be sufficient to meet the security challenges of the future the new nations challenging the united states may not possess nuclear weapons at all and certainly will not possess the capability to destroy the united states as functioning society therefore threat to impose overwhelming levels of damage in these nations with weapons that have relatively high yield and modest accuracy may not seem credible55 instead they argue the united states should seek the ability to attack promptly at great range with focused intent and with less destructive force than it would have used in attacks against the soviet union to achieve these objectives it would need not only nuclear weapons but also precision conventional weapons longrange strike capabilities with its conventional weapons and missile defense 50 us senate committee on armed services

attack options that may be included in the new operational plans described above form the core of the capabilities needed to implement the strategy of tailored deterrence others however have questioned whether tailored deterrence is just an excuse for the united states to deploy new generation of nuclear weapons and develop new war plans that include targets in longer list of nations these differing perspectives on both the substance and the rationale for tailored deterrence give rise to several specific issues addressed in the remainder of this report that might be part of congressional or even national debate on the future role of nuclear weapons in us national security policy g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 congress has the opportunity to review us nuclear weapons programs and policies during the annual authorization and appropriations process each year the administrations budget contains funding requests for programs that are designed to maintain both the warheads and the delivery vehicles that make up the us nuclear arsenal during its debates about the funding levels for these programs as congress can and often does address broader discussions about the role of nuclear weapons in us national security strategy as was noted early in this report the bush administrations request for funding for new reliable replacement warhead has served this purpose in recent years this section reviews number of topics that might be addressed in such discussion g10g152g160g561g15g158g140g145g561g10g138g156g561g16g158g140g149g142g138g155g561g21g157g155g138g157g142g144g162g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g141g501g561 there is question that the bush administration changed the rhetoric about us deterrent strategy and the role of nuclear weapons in that strategy substantially when it released the nuclear posture review in late 2001 the administration has spoken often about how the united states longer views russia as an enemy and how the united states will now focus its nuclear deterrent on emerging threats in other nations but changes in war plans and employment policy have evolved since the end of the cold war with few sharp distinctions unique to the policies that appeared under the bush administration us military planners began to include nations other than russia in the siop and to consider the siop to be family of plans in the early 1990s as the united states adjusted to the postcold war security environment it also began to emphasize adaptive planning and to focus on the need to deter nations armed with weapons of mass destruction during that same time period further in spite of the changing rhetoric about the russian threat russia probably still holds unique position in the us war plans many analysts believe it is the only contingency that can account for the us plan to retain 2200 nuclear warheads in its arsenal contingencies with other nations are likely to require far smaller number of warheads moreover there are similarities between tailored deterrence and cold war deterrence strategy for example both are based on the precept that it is necessary to know what your adversary 56 us congress house committee on armed services subcommittee on strategic forces hearing on united states nuclear weapons policy

target those valued assets during the cold war the united states developed number of attack plans that were tailored to address the values interests and capabilities of its primary adversary and some smaller plans to address threats from other adversaries such as china and the warsaw pact nations57 as was noted above ryan henry and keith payne have both noted the need for this kind of analysis in support of tailored deterrence further just as us war plans evolved during the cold war to accommodate changes in weapons capabilities and threat assessments the bush administrations supporters argued that tailored deterrence would allow for similar ongoing modifications to us war plans the key difference in the current security environment however is the fact that the united states may now face longer list of potential adversaries when planning its nuclear policy and force structure the bush administration argued that the united states now faces threats from multiple potential opponents sources of conflict and unprecedented challenges 58 considering both these similarities and differences it seems then that the change from strategic deterrence to tailored deterrence is less of change in how to deter then there is in whom to deter there is however one element of strategic deterrence missing from the bush administrations description of tailored deterrence deterrent relationship where one nation seeks to stop another from pursuing actions by threatening to impose high costs if the action occurs presumes that both sides are aware of the threats and possible responses this requires that the party making the deterrent threat communicate that threat to the other party either explicitly or implicitly the existence of workable attack plan does not necessarily translate into the communication of credible deterrent threat 59 in future crises the united states may not have the time or the channels to inform potential adversary of the types of actions that might result in nuclear or conventional response from the united states further the bush administration seemed to place high priority on developing the capability to react promptly with little or warning at the start of conflict either to preempt the adversarys use of weapons of mass destruction or to undermine the adversarys ability to prosecute the conflict on its own terms this presumes that the united states would act before the adversary had taken the actions that the united states had sought to deter there is promise that the adversary would not suffer the consequences and costs of its attack if it refrained from action if anything the adversary may feel pressured to act even more quickly before the united states launched its preemptive attack

argued that one size fits all set of war plans and nuclear arsenal consisting of cold warera weapons would not meet this need because the weapons have yields that are too large and the war plans presume the use of too many weapons therefore the adversary would not believ that the united states would follow through on its deterrent threats and the united states would be selfdeterred from implementing its war plans because it would know that an attack w ould be too large and cause too much collateral damage60 critics of the bush administrations nuclear policy in contrast believe that the concept of tailored deterrence is less likely to enhance deterrence than it is to make the use of nuclear weapons more likely in regional conflicts they vi ew the expansion of the us nuclear war plans to include wider range of potential attack options against growing number of potential adversaries to be an indication of the growing willingness of the united states to resort to nuclear weapons use before other meansincluding diplomacy and conventional forcehave been employed and exhausted 61 if such plans were not in place the united states would be less likely to use them in crisis this debate derives from the longstanding theoretical debate about what it takes to make deterrent threat credible bush administration officials argued that to be credible deterrent threats must be precise detailed and specific so that an adversary will accept that the united states is both willing and able to implement the plans some analysts have argued that such precision is not key to credibility some have argued that threats to use nuclear weapons matter how specific or limited would be credible because such an attack would produce disproportionate and unacceptable collateral destruction and severe political fallout 62 because such use would be so horrific adversary would believe the united states would be willing to launch nuclear attack unless its very national survival were at stake others have argued that such precision is unnecessary because the mere existence of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them could serve as sufficient deterrent adversaries do not need to understand the specifics of us nuclear policy to understand that they might be on the receiving end of an attack with nuclear weapons while us military and civilian leaders might be more willing to use nuclear weapons if they believe the specific plans and weapons in the us arsenal are less likely to produce catastrophic levels of destruction it is not clear that this would be the only or even primary factor in their decisionmaking process some us leaders might be deterred from launching such an attack because they feel constrained by generally accepted nuclear taboo 63 others may in contrast be more inclined to use nuclear weapons if knowing not only that such use would not lead to global nuclear war but also that the adversary could not retaliate against the us with nuclear 60 according to the defense science board credible deterrence requires that the adversary believe that us capabilities will be used if the adversary takes the course of action we seek to deter

administration indicated that as the united states tailors its nuclear attack plans and weapons capabilities to address the challenges and capabilities of potential adversaries it will need nuclear force structure that differs in many ways from the cold warera arsenal they have noted that the united states will need weapons with the capabilities to attack and destroy hardened or deeply buried targets and that it may need warheads that can produce tailored effects perhaps to destroy stocks of chemical or biological weapons they also noted that the united states may need greater number of loweryield weapons so that it could minimize collateral damage while destroying these types of targets 64 but they offered few if any descriptions of how concept of ta ilored deterrence would affect the required numbers of warheads in the us arsenal throughout the cold war the united states determined the size and structure of its nuclear arsenal in part through an analysis of the numbers and types of weapons it would need to deter soviet attack on the united states and its allies although number of factors affected this determination the numbers and types of weapons ong with the plans that would guide their use reflected an assessment of the numbers and types of targets that would need to be destroyed in the former soviet union when the target base began to decline after the end of the cold war the number of weapons needed in the us arsenal began to decline and the united states began to reduce the size of its deployed forces under the moscow treaty of 2002 the united states pledged to reduce its strategic nuclear forces to more than 2200 operationally deployed warheads by the end of 2012 but many analysts have questioned why the united states needs to retain that many warheads and why it cannot reduce its forces much further if it is not sizing and structuring its forces to meet the russian threat few can imagine contingencies or conflicts that would require the united states employ more than few or even few dozen nuclear weapons the only contingencies where the united states would need to employ thousands or even hundreds of weapons would be one where the united states sought to destroy large numbers of weapons and facilities in russia or possibly in china 65 the bush administration has countered this calculation by noting that there are number of objectives for us nuclear forces that go beyond just deterring attacks by russia or other nations nuclear weapons along with missile defenses and other elements of the us military establishment can also assure allies and friends of the us commitment to their security by providing an extended deterrent dissuade potential adversaries from challenging the united 64 keith b payne the nuclear posture

convincing them that they can never negate the us nuclear deterrent and defeat enemies by holding at risk those targets that could not be destroyed with other types of weapons66 according to the bush administration the size nd structure of the us arsenal should reflect all of these goals or combination of these goals however it never indicated which goal would required force as large as 2200 operationally deployed warheads moreover these goals do not offer formula that can be used to calculate the size of the us arsenal for example the us ability to assure its allies of its commitment to their defense need not rest only on the size of the us nuclear force other factors such as the capabilities and reliability of us warheads and delivery vehicles the attention paid to maintaining the nuclear establishment and us conventional capabilities might also affect the calculation it may also be difficult to quantify how many warheads are needed to achieve dissuasio n because there is way to know what if any relationship exists between the size of the us nuclear arsenal and size and scope of other nations nuclear programs

tailored deterrence and the size and structure of the us nuclear arsenal raises questions about the actual future role of nuclear weapons in us national security if the goal is simply to be able to threaten small numbers of targets in large numbers of countries than much smaller force may be sufficient at the same time though many analysts are wary of posture that calls for the use of us nuclear weapons against nations that do not have nuclear weapons themselves they believe that us national security interests can be served well with smaller number of nuclear weapons because they believe that the role of nuclear weapons can and should be sharply limited to deterring nuclear or other catastrophic attacks on the united states 67 in recent years the debate about the future role of nuclear weapons in us national security strategy has become closely linked to the debates about the relationship between us nuclear weapons programs and policy and us nonproliferation policy there is widespread agreement both inside and outside government that the greatest threat to the united states comes not from the nuclear challenge posed by single adversary as it did in the cold war but from the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons to an increasing number of nations and possibly terrorist groups but there is little agreement about whether the continued us reliance on nuclear weapons stems proliferation by reminding nations of the risks they face if they challenge us security with their own weapons of mass destruction or spurs proliferation by demonstrating that nuclear weapons can play significant role in enhancing nations security as result most discussions of us nuclear policy now focus on the question of whether or how the size structure and role of the us nuclear arsenal can affect the emergence of or deterrence of nuclear threats in other nations 66 us department of defense special briefing on the nuclear posture review news transcript january 9 2002 these

along with the growing integration of missile defenses and conventional force capabilities into the us deterrent posture as response to the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction they believe the capabilities and attack plans generated under this strategy will enhance the us ability to deter and if necessary defeat these emerging threats to us national security further they also argue that robust us nuclear deterrent can further us nonproliferation objectives by strengthening the us extended deterrent in response to questions submitted prior to his nomination hearing to be commander in chief of us strategic command general kevin chilton noted that credible us nuclear deterrent assures allies that the us will deter prevent or limit damage to them from adversary attacks this removes incentives for many of them to develop and deploy their own nuclear forces thereby encouraging nonproliferation 68 further those who support the bush administrations position argue that amount of restraint in us nuclear weapons policieseither through reductions in deployed warheads restraints on modernization or maintenance plans or restrictions in the declared role of nuclear weaponsis likely to deter or discourage the acquisition of nuclear weapons by nations who want them they note that these nations generally seek nuclear weapon to meet their own regional security concerns and not in response to us nuclear weapons programs few analysts who disagree with the bush administrations approach would argue that reductions or the elimination of us nuclear weapons programs would alter the decision to acquire nuclear weapons in nations seeking nuclear weapons to meet their own security concerns at the same time though they argue that the continued pursuit of these programs and the continued retention of thousands of deployed warheads when combined with doctrine that has longer list of nations that might be targets of nuclear attack can undermine us nonproliferation goals they argue that the united states is likely to find it more difficult to persuade other countries to abandon or reject nuclear programs if the united states through its own efforts is reinforcing the view that nuclear weapons can play crit ical role in nations security policies 69 some have also noted that by pursuing programs to maintain or ex pand its own nuclear arsenal the united states could find it more difficult to persuade other countries to work with it and share its objectives when trying to constrain nuclear programs in problem countries several prominent current and former government officials have highlighted this linkage and proposed that the united states adopt number of policies that over time may demonstrate that it has reduced its own reliance on nuclear weapons and strengthen its case against nations seeking nuclear weapons these include among other things the ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty the reaffirmation of the pledge in article vi of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty that embraces the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons and further deep reductions in the numbers of deployed nuclear weapons 70 68 us senate committee on armed services advanced questions for general kevin p chilton usaf nominee for commander of us strategic command september 27 2007 p 17 see also dr keith b

national security policy has been brewing since 2007 and grew louder in 2008 as the presidential election approached congress has already indicated that it would like the next president to reevaluate us nuclear policy and posture and it has indicated that future nuclear weapons initiatives may hinge on the results of this review for example the fy2008 defense authorization bill establishes congressional commission on the strategic posture of the united states hr 1585 sec 1062 this commission with 12 members appointed by the chairmen and ranking members of the house and senate armed services committees is charged with assessing the benefits and risks associated with the current strategic posture and nuclear weapons policies of the united states its report is supposed to make recommendations about 1 the military capabilities and force structure necessary to support the recommended strategy 2 the number of nuclear weapons and number of replacement warheads required 3 the appropriate qualitative analysis including forceonforce exchange modeling to calculate the effectiveness of the strategy under various scenarios 4 the nuclear infrastructure required to support the strategy 5 an assessment of the role of missile defenses in the strategy 6 an assessment of the role of nonproliferation programs in the strategy 7 the political and military implications of the strategy for the united states and its allies and 8 any other information or recommendations relating to the strategy or to the strategic posture that the commission considers appropriate congress has also mandated that the secretary of defense under the next administration conduct comprehensive review of the nuclear posture of the united states for the next 5 to 10 years hr 1585 sec 1070 this review which is to be submitted to congress along with the next quadrennial defense review in 2010 is to include assessments of the following 1 the role of nuclear forces in united states military strategy planning and programming 2 the policy requirements and objectives for the united states to maintain safe reliable and credible nuclear deterrence posture 3 the relationship among united states nuclear deterrence policy targeting strategy and arms control objectives 4 the role that missile defense capabilities and conventional strike forces play in determining the role and size of nuclear forces 5 the levels and composition of the nuclear delivery systems that will be required for implementing the united states national and military strategy including any plans for replacing or modifying existing systems
