addressing and oios would like to thank unccd for the thoughtful consideration given to its report and the findings therein governance the need to put in place arrangem ents for governance of it which are compliant with stsgb200317 in particular either establishing local steering committee for it or delegating the roles and responsibilities to an existing com mittee given the sm all size of unccd b

introduction 1 this report discusses the results of an oios audit of unccd information technology it management which was carri ed out in september 2005 in accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 an it sub unit of external relations and public information unit erpi is responsible for unccds it activities th it sub unit comprises one information systems officer p3 supported by two ssociate computer information systems officers p2 and one computer information systems assistant gs4 the it sub unit provides range of it services including network maintenance email help desk development and support of applications and management of both web and intranet for approximately 80 staff 3 unccd informed oios that the tota l amount expended on it activities in 2004 nonstaff was approximately us100000 4 this area had not been previously audited by oios 5 the draft of the audit report was shar ed with the coordinator erpi on 30 november 2005 whose comments which were received on 22 december 2005 have been reflected in this final report in italics unccd has accepted most of the recommendations made and is in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 6 the overall objective of the audit wa s to provide the executive secretary unccd with an assessment of the ad equacy of unccds arrangements for management of its information technology this included assessing the it governance and planning framework b it activities undertaken by unccd and the adequacy of the arrangements for identification and oversight of these activities and c whether unccd it activities were be ing carried out in compliance with applicable regulations and rules iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit focused on it activities in 2004 and 2005 excluding communications and the work of other units where it is programmatic activity in its own right and is an output of unccd 8 the audit activities included review and assessment of risks and internal control systems interviews with staff and management including analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations governance 9 stsgb200317 dealing with the inform ation and com munications technology board ictb directed that ll departm ents and offices away from headquarters create internal or local info rmation and technology groups or com mittees following the pattern of the ictb whose responsibilities would be to ensure departm ental strategies are aligned with the overall objectives of the secretariat b inform ation on departm ental system s resources and assets is m aintained and updated on regular basis c existing system s are reviewed to confirm their cost effectiveness and d standard m ethodologies are developed and consistently used for ict projects 10 while unccd appeared to have intern coordination m echanism s such as senior m anagem ent coordination m eetings and interunit m eetings it had effective mechanism for oversight or coordinati on of it program matic and adm inistrative activities and consequently unccd lacked an appropriate f orum to discuss and establish program matic and adm inistrative needs and ensure that unccd is m aking effective and efficient use of its it investm ent b discuss and determ ine what level of resources are required for it to support unccd activities and to def end requests f or it resources c discuss and recom mend appropriate it policies and procedures for both administrative and program matic it such as business continuity plans for mission critical system s security asset replacem ent and system s developm ent policies which are in line with the overall standards d oversee the developm ent of adm inistrative and program matic it system s act as focal point for the ictb and ensure that all relevant directives are dissem inated to staff f discuss whether the it needs of individual unccd units are being m et 11 unccd com mented that the it issues could be discussed in the senior managem ent meeting as necessary rather than creating separate com mittee taking into consideration the size of the unccd secretar iat oios is of the opinion that there needs to be some form of an it committee which would provide advice to senior managem ent recommendation to ensure effective oversight of its inform ation technology it in line with stsgb200317 inform ation and com munications technology board to the extent app licable to unccd and is able to ensure that its it contributes to the im provem ent of the ef fectiveness and efficiency of program delivery and adm inistration unccd should establish an appropriate m echanism which fulfils the functions of local inform ation and com munications technology com mittee rec 01 12 unccd accepted the recommendation and expected implementation by 2 february 2006 unccd also commented that the unccd secretariats sees the merit and advantages of establishing mechanism for the operation of local information and communication technology committee in c onformity with secretary generals bulletin stsgb200317 13 bearing in mind the operating structure of the unccd secretariat as well as objective requirements pertaining to its flexi bility and effectiveness the secretariat believes that such an ictc could be c onstituted of selected senior management representatives and may serve as focal point for the ictb while increasing interactivity with staff both in terms of input management and dissemination of relevant information and it development in the united nations accordingly to maximize efficiency while avoiding overlapping duties the unccd secretariat further believes that such responsibility could be entruste d to its recently established internal management committee imc which would ssume the mandate and act in lieu of the ictc as such it will be advising th executive secretary on it policies and procedures and the effectiveness of it in addressing the needs of the secretariat it should however be pointed out that owing to the small size of the unccd secretariats overall operating structure ve always provided an enabling environment that is highly conducive to the discussion and assessment of diverse agenda items requirements and proposals through the established consultation and coordination mechanisms including unit meetings senior management meetings and general staff meetings 14 against this operating background it overall strategy and business plan including asset replacement and systems development programmatic and administrative requirements as well as it re source requirements are defined at the it group level through feedback chain involving other units and communicated to the erpi coordinator for final consideration by management and ultimate action by administration after proper clearance by management procurement and asset management including inventory of it quipment and software is undertaken by unccd administration in close coordination with the it group in order to ensure proper follow up of united nations rules and regulations and guarantee the required cost effectiveness 15 oios appreciates the com ments and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of docum entary evidence supporting the blishm ent of an appropriate m echanism which fulfils the functions of local inform ation and com munications technology com mittee b planning it strategy 16 general assem bly ga resoluti on 57304 of 16 may 2003 welcom ed the significant step the united nations it strategy a57620 dated 20 novem ber 2002 represented in developing strategic fram ework to further guide the developm ent of ict within the united nations and requested that the it requirem ents for the various duty stations be fully integrated into the strategy 17 in the opinion of oios the above m eant that unccd needed to create its own it strategy docum ent which included those elem ents of the united nations it strategy 3 applicable to unccd and included any unccd specific it issues not covered by the united nations it strategy such docum ent is also im portant for senior m anagem ent to dem onstrate the part it can play in suring effective and efficient delivery of the mandate the need for strategy docum ent wa s also highlighted in the joint inspection unit jiu review on unccd carried out in the first half of 2005 jiurep20055 review of the managem ent adm inistration and activities of the secretariat of the united nations convention to com bat desertification unccd 18 the it sub unit had developed an intern docum ent setting out its vision for it within unccd including such im portant cepts as the it services it considered should be delivered the need for service level agreem ents and it policies the docum ent however did not dem onstrate the link between the it services and delivery of program matic and adm inistrative functions under the m andate the extent to which unccd needed to be com pliant with unite d nations system s such as imis and had not been prepared in consultation with other unccd units recommendation to ensure com pliance with a57620 the united nations ict strategy to the extent applicable to unccd and to assist in optim ising use of its it resources in delivery of its m andate unccd should establish task force to velop it strategy which builds on the existing docum ent setting out its vision for it but includes participation of all units and ensures that all elem ents currently in the united nations strategy that m ight be relevant to unccd and all unccd m andated it activities are take n into consideration the it strategy should then be form ally adopted by unccd local inform ation and com munications technology com mittee rec 02 19 unccd accepted the recommendation and exp ected implementation by end of march 2006 it further explained that the secretariat further agrees with the fact that the ict strategy a57620 dated 20 november 2002 provides an enhanced opportunity for further developing its strategic framework the secretariat therefore agrees with the need to extend consultati ons on it matters to other units of the secretariat particularly but not limited to the substantive ones so as to ensure that input and feedback on the it are initialized not only upstream but also downstream of its policy formulation process to this specific effect the secretariat will establish an it strategy task force with membership extended to other unccd units based on the size of the secretariat its workload and ope rational requirements such membership will be established in consultation with the imc referred to in recommendation 1 above 20 currently unccd has an it strategy document which was developed taking into account variety of parameters in cluding but not limited to the operational requirements of the unccd secretariat ssessment of users feedback and prospective it developments the document as subsequen tly reviewed with the assistance of the unccd legal advisor and covered the various areas of it operations including such important areas as the need of service l evel agreements and it policies the document further covered the definition of service required at the unccd secretariat 4 legal risks and requirements best practices system monitoring confidentiality and personal use electronic data protections and password policies 21 oios appreciates the clarification and the efforts m ade to date in the creation of an it strategy the recom mendation will be closed upon receipt of the approved unccd it strategy which includes participa tion of all units and ensures that all elem ents currently in the united nations strategy that m ight be relevant to unccd and all m andated it activities are taken into consideration b long and shortterm it plans 22 long and short term it plans set out the it tasks required to m eet the strategy and satisfy unccd needs such plans are important as they provide basis for allocating and m onitoring use of resources co mmunicating to interested parties how the it strategy will be delivered and dem onstra ting how it activities have been prioritised to meet unccd needs such plans should be costed to facilitate investm ent analysis of the use of it 23 in the absence of such plans and read ily available list of initiatives to support the pas process oios determ ined that ccd could not clearly dem onstrate how it resources were being effectively used as consequence schedules of ict activities which in cluded deadlines and details of personnel responsible for task perform ance were termined internally within the it sub unit but lacked visibility within the unccd secretariat b decisions on it service provision were determ ined on an ad hoc basis w hilst this ref lected f inancial constraints it m eant that unccd did not have comprehensive picture of the it required to m eet its overall business needs c check points existed to ensure th at it objectives and long and short range plans m et organizational objectives and plans and d there was form mechanism to asse ss existing inf ormation system s in term s of degree of business autom ation functi onality stability com plexity costs and strengths and weaknesses recommendation to dem onstrate how inform ation technology it resources are being utilised to m eet unccd needs unccd should develop mechanism for the creation approval and m onitoring of costed it short and long term plans based on the it strategy rec 03 24 unccd commented that committee be ing established under recommendation one would have responsibility for reviewing and approving it plans it also commented that compared to similar bodies and s ecretariats the unccd it group was of rather limited size during the biennium 2004 2005 it was then composed of only two junior professionals p3 p2 on th core budget and supported by an additional professional p2 and one general service g5 from programme support costs thereafter the staffing situation of the it group has been further aggravated by the 5 financial implications of the budget decision adopted at the seventh session of the cop please refer to the comment on rec 4 below despite these inherent and objective limitations the it group must continue to address and follow up the it requirements of all unccd staff members as well as numerous consultants and interns 25 under an operating scenario marked by recurrent financial constraints and budget limitations that have substantially ham pered its ability to address the multiple nature of the unccd it service provision including hardware replacement software update and training the it group has endeavoured to develop priority based approach aiming at addressing in selective but rational manner strategic unccd requirements these requirements are est ablished on the basis of feedback received from units directions provided by its go verning bodies and relevant instructions from management 26 in that regard schedules of it activitie s to be performed including deadlines and personnel responsible for the performance of the tasks are available they are established on the basis of the secretariats overall requirements and not its own priorities but can be hindered by the seri ous financial constraints and increasing client requests 27 despite these constraints and based on its work plan the it group has been able to service the numerous requests from the secretariats units and develop various indispensable operating tools including intranet and several databases amongst which is the unccd registration system whic h is highly regarded by parties and was commended as such in the recent report of the united nations joint inspection unit 28 the secretariat acknowledges however that beyond the objective constraints referred to above the problems encountered c ould also be explained in part by the internal nature of the it work plan concep tion the secretariat further believes that integrating those workplans into standing agenda of its future ict task force will guarantee as increased involvement by other units and ensure their overall sustainability 29 oios appreciates the additional inform ation on the planning practice of the it group and the related constraints oios is also pleased to note the actions proposed in terms of establishing an approval and m onitori ng m echanism for the plans to close the recom mendation oios requires copy of th docum entation explaining how the plans will be created c organiz ation and roles and responsibilities for it organizational structure 30 at the tim of the audit the it sub unit fell under the responsibility of erpi however there was evidence that the current structure was based upon sufficient analysis of the nature of re quired it services staffing and financial resource needs and required supervisory com petency oios was not provided with any official docum entation describing the establishm ent structure and f unctions of the it sub unit b clarifying the reporting lines roles and responsibilities of the staff within the it 6 sub unit c explaining how the current staffing resources were determ ined recommendation to f acilitate having an ef fective structure f or delivery of inform ation technology it services and to better define and codify operating links between it and th rest of unccd unccd should commission task f orce to establish the level and nature of it services it requires the level of resources required and how these services should be delivered whic h should also consider outsourcing this should also include considering the need for designating senior official as chief inform ation officer rec 04 31 unccd commented that the secretariat is fully committed to ensuring that functions of it are efficient and effectively dispensed and in this regard the secretariat sees the merits of commissioning an external r eview to carry out need assessments of it services to this effect the secr etariat hopes to collaborate with oios in undertaking this review 32 for ease of clarity it would also be important to give brief explanation of the current structure establishment of it with in unccd when the secretariat was still operating as an interim secretariat to convention and servicing the international negotiating committee on desertification i ncd the it group was hosted under the secretariats administration and finance unit the it group was then staffed by two shortterm resource persons one p and one gs this organization structure was justified by the high prevalence of administrative it requirements the substantive requirements of it were then marginal due to the uncertain nature of negotiation outcomes regarding the envisaged final mandate of the convention and thus the subsequent fields of competence of its secretariat 33 after the adoption and entry into force of the convention the establishment of all the secretariats units including external relations and public information erpi were set after careful review by management of various parameters including substantive and strategic planning considerations m andate and expected output based on these considerations it was entrusted to erpi owing to the information communication and external liaison nature of this units core mandate 34 the it group does however maintain numerous functional links with administrative services to efficiently deli ver its output and ensure that operations are undertaken in conformity with prevaili ng rules and regulations this includes procurement and asset management including inventory of it equipment and software as well as local support of integrated management information system imis 35 while the unccd secretariat sees the rationale behind and potential benefits deriving from the establishment of chief info rmation officer at senior level to act as focal point for both administrative and programmatic it it does not see this option as being possible within the 20062007 bie nnium given the very severe budgetary constrains faced by the secretariat in the light of the budget decision 23cop7 whereby the secretariat received only 5 percent nominal increase in its budget thereby resulting in unavoidable staff reductions the erpi unit like other units of the 7 secretariat was severely affected by this decision which resulted in inability to fill three posts out of which two were from the it group 36 under the present circumstances the u nccd secretariat believes that proper coordination of it operations can be assume d by the erpi coordinator provided that necessary steps are taken to further clar ify and enhance the managerial framework of the it group along the lines of the discussi ons held with oios which specifically underlined the need to take into consideration structure and functions of the it group direct and individual supervision of all current it staff by the erpi coordinator clarification of roles and responsibilities of the staff within the it group 37 in the same context the secretariat furt her believes that the identification of the level and nature of it services the level of resources required and how these services should be delivered can be accurately established within the secretariat upon implementation of recommendations 1 and 2 abo ve pertaining to the establishment of its future ict and task force the secretariat would dispose of the required internal visibility as well as enabling policy and decision making frameworks to allow it to accurately and cost efficiently determine these needs 38 finally the secretariat fully recognizes the benefits arising from outsourcing options and partnerships bearing in mind efficiency colocation and cost effectiveness criteria it has initiated consultations with the unfccc secretariat pertaining to wide range of areas of potential cooperation including selected joint administrative services however due to th different sizes of both secretariats systematic concern in that regard remains the need to ensure the critical level of ownership indispensable to deliver unccds own mandate furthermore given the strategic aspects involved further guidance from governing bodies might be required in this regard accordingly outsourcing options may only be envisaged in the framework of an overall agreement with the unf ccc on possible levels and fields of joint management 39 oios thanks for the detailed explanation and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of the result of the work of the ta sk force to establish the level and nature of it services required the level of res ources required and how these services should be delivered which should also consider outsourcing b chief inform ation officer 40 in the sam way that an organisati on benefits from having finance and human resources m anager there are benefits in having an individual at senior level with knowledge of both technology and busine ss processes who could act as focal point f or both adm inistrative and program matic it activities and have range of managem ent responsibilities including policy standards strategy planning analysis of organisational requirem ents and m onitoring as well as m aintenance and support oios expected that the coordinator of erpi woul d be the chief inform ation officer and have responsibilities along the lines of those described above this was not the case and in the opinion of oios there was one within unccd at the tim of the audit who could be held accountable for ensuring th at it decisions were im plem ented and unccd had an effective it infrastructure to support delivery of its m andate this 8 issue was addressed in recom mendation 04 above and further action is proposed d policies and procedures 41 the united nations is em barking on standardisation of software and applications throughout the secretariat ccd policies and procedures are therefore important to determ ine whether and in wh at circum stances united nations standards will be followed to provide guidance on service provision and to ensure that standardization is not im posed in the wrong places for the wrong reasons in addition policies and procedures are necessary to com municate m anagem ent aim s and direction to ensure that it activities take place in uniform manner and to provide m anagem ent with the tools to m onitor it activities 42 whilst there was evidence that the it sub unit had considered the need for policies in such areas as internet usage nd data protection they were not form ally adopted and there was evidence that these took account of developm ents in the united nations and that they were part of cohesive approach towards control of it within unccd further the it sub unit wa s unaware of it developm ents within the united nations and how they m ight im pact on unccd recommendation to ensure that inform ation technology it activities occur in uniform manner and to provide managem ent with the tools to monitor it unccd should com pile and assess the current practices for it activities and bench m ark agai nst industry best practices such as cobit or united nations standards which should result in establishing set of form ally adopt ed com prehensive it policies and procedures for this unccd should ensure that it sub unit staffs participate in the various it f orums including regular discussion with it staff from other united nations organizations in bonn geneva and new york rec 05 43 unccd commented that the secretar iat acknowledges the added value of extending its it assessments and reference to industry best practices such as cobit and other standards in this regard the secretariat would ensure that it group staff participates in the various it forums including regular discussion with the it staff from other organizations in bonn geneva and new york efforts are also underway for connectivity of easset system 44 furthermore the secretariat would endeavour whenever practicable to involve itself in more joint ventures with other s ecretariats so as to enable further data exchanges and the expansion of the data visibility 45 as already stated elsewhere in this document budgetary constraints that have been facing the secretariat resulted in majo r reductions of staff travel and training and therefore staff of the secretariat it in cluded could not benefit from various training opportunities organised by the 46 as per the comments provided under r ecommendation 3 above the it group has addressed the need for policies in such areas as internet usage system monitoring 9 confidentiality personal use and electronic data this policy was conceived as an additional means of enhancing it service qua lity and clarifying internal procedures and legal frameworks as such it was based on general business standards and practices adapted to the particular needs of the secretariat the it group has also engaged on regular consultations with the unfccc it team on several range of issues particularly the development of the interoperability system for database sharing the secretariat is contemplating the institu tionalization of such liaison and consultation procedures 47 oios appreciated the com ments and acti ons taken to date and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of the it policie s and procedures adopted by unccd for undertaking it activities provision of services and monitoring delivery need for service standard service level agreem ent 48 unccd it sub unit had produced an internal docum ent entitled service level initiative which provided the basis f or estab lishing service standard however the docum ent was never form ally adopted by unccd and did not system atically take into account other unccd units own it requi rements and agreem ent on perform ance indictors for m onitoring delivery there wa s in addition evidence of m anagem ent requiring any inform ation to assess perform ance recommendation to ensure the ability to determ ine whether inf ormation technology it services are m eeting its needs unccd should further develop its service level initiative by engaging other unccd units and clarifying with them the services required developing standards for delivery of these services and creation of mechanism to m onitor delivery against the standard this should include custom er satisfaction rveys and how nonperform ance will be tackled rec 06 49 unccd commented that the it group produced an internal document entitled service level initiative which provided the basis for establishing service standard as per the formulation of other aspects of its overall policy framework the secretariat relied on different parameters referred in recommendation 2 above such as the operational requirements of the secretar iat assessment of users feedback and prospective it developments 50 other units it requirements have systema tically been internalised in such assessments but may have been hampered by resource shortfalls particularly regarding provision of specific hardware servers pcs laptops or customized services additional website development and administration technical assistance for outsourced offices such as the rcus furthermore the development of the unccd intranet has provided an enhanced framewor k for interaction with users regarding problem categorization and survey 51 the secretariat acknowledges the need to further extend internal consultations 10 for conception development and decisionma king in this important field the secretariat further believes that its future it strategy task force will be instrumental in that regard 52 oios recognizes the efforts undertaken so far to establish user requirem ents which will be f urther enhanced by the creation of formal agreem ents work plans with units oios will close the recom mendation upon r eceipt of the agreem ents work plans form ulated with unccd units b helpdesk service 53 oios appreciated that unccd has dicated staff for provision of helpdesk services including troubleshooting and installa tion of hardware and software although record was kept of helpdesk request s received by em ail unccd lacked an appropriate m echanism to record and an alyse requests received by telephone including calls per day and nature of request as such unccd could not develop comprehensive list of problem equipm ent and applications or produce list of frequently asked questions and establish linkage to staff training need which could have contributed to strengthening the it com petency of unccd staff in general the it sub unit recently developed procedur to report problem s through its intranet which would f acilitate easier tracking of help requests recommendation to ensure that the helpdesk service contributes to building better knowledge about perform ance of purchased equipm ent and applications and capacity of staff for it activities unccd should establish an system atic m echanism to record analyze and report the types of request solutions offere d and their im plication for it maintenance purchasing decisions and training rec 07 54 unccd commented that despite its alre ady considerable limitation in terms of staffing visàvis the important workload of the it group during the current biennium one full time staff was dedicated to the prov ision of helpdesk services including email maintenance troubleshooting and installa tion of hardware and software this translates the priority attached by the it group to the promotion of an enabling and an efficient work environment for unccd sta ff and the importance ascribed to customer satisfaction 55 although telephone log was used to r ecord the number of calls per day and nature of requests the it help desk has c onsistently kept on file email requests in that regard staff meetings and inter unit staff meeting minutes also referred to reported problems when addressed by their respec tive agendas furthermore the intranet based procedure recently developed and launc hed for problem reporting would also highly facilitate easier tracking and further ssessment of help request accordingly the it group has dependable knowledge of the main it helpdesk requirements which has ensured the provision of proper and tim ely helpdesk service to users 56 the secretariat acknowledges however that in order to maximize its potential in terms of help desk service provision such knowledge needs to be further supported by standard codification and increased interactivity with secretariat staff in that 11 regard the it group will develop faq freque ntly asked questions to be posted on the unccd intranet such posting should also establish linkage to staff training needs 57 oios appreciates the initiatives outlined and the efforts underway by unccd to enhance this area and it will close th recom mendation upon receipt of docum entary evidence explaining the m echanism to recor d analyze and report the types of request solutions offered and their im plication for it m aintenance purchasing decisions and training c system s developm ent 58 whilst oios was pleased to note the fforts already underway to ensure it assisted users such as the system develope d for the efficient m anagem ent of participant registration at unccd conferences unccd did not have an established policy for developm ent standards to ensure that app lications developed were required and did meet its needs cost benefit analysis was undertaken only on an ad hoc basis and not properly docum ented hence there was assuran ce that the projects developed were those that generated the best returns b m echanism was established to sure that sim ilar needs or opportunities within unccd and other agencies were identified and reconciled notable exception to this which oios is pleased to note is an ongoing project among the secretariats of unccd unfccc united nations fram ework convention for clim ate change and cbd convention on bio diversity to share certain data c there was docum entary evidence for postim plem entation review of applications to determ ine if the projects delivered the expected benefits d actual tim and resources expended on the projects were not m onitored to assist in identifying whether projects were managed in an efficient and effective manner or projects experienced tim and cost overruns the respective roles and responsibilities between it sub unit as custodian and system owner were not properly clarifie d for key applications system s including the registration system and databases and f consideration of developm ents in other entities f or exam

technology it developm ent is carried out in system atic and consistent m anner unccd should docum ent an it system developm ent policy and procedure taking into account the united nations high level business case m odel this policy should include the need to m aintain com prehensive and appropriate technical and operational docum entation of existing applications rec 08 59 unccd commented that software devel opment at unccd is done based on number of factors including but not limited to proper cost analysis this was also the 12 case for the development of its registration system quotations were acquired from different vendors and sister organisations and thorough cost analysis was made keeping in mind some important parameters such as future requirements of the system cost involved in the support and helpdesk current inhouse requirements and future projections further development of the system costs involved in customisation of the system if bought from sister organizations 60 keeping in mind all the abovementi oned points thorough analysis was undertaken and some of the major findings were if an application was bought from any 3rd party vendor it would have presented very limited functionality and would have not operated in parallel with other unccd registration requirements especially for digital photography enhanced security features and the generation of list of participants the cost of customisation of 3rd party software was too high and involved constant support contracts from the vendor company the same problems in terms of recurrent costs of customisation and support would have been faced if the application had been purchased from sister organization looking at the overall requirements and future extensions of the software the secretariat decided to develop the system in house 61 although the easset system was not c onsidered the development of this software has been made possible only thr ough thorough study of the market and other available options together with methodical assessment of system requirements and functionalities as well as extensive exchangesdiscussions with colleagues from other organizations accordingly the development standards were fully achieved in terms of cross platform independence b ease of data exchange c interoperability 62 post implementation reviews are const ant and are achieved by regular staff meetings exchanges of emails concerning registration the jasmine system the intranet and use of databases with technical staff 63 as mentioned in point b of the dr aft discussion report regarding the ongoing cooperation between the unccd cbd and fccc secretariats it should be noted that the exchange of data which is the main objective of the project was only possible because unccd it despite its much sm aller size and resources established corporate database client server architect ure and data standards based on generic standards as explained above by taking some concrete steps toward the development of corporate systems like jasmine and the registration system 64 furthermore it should be noted that all the systems developed inhouse have supporting documentation which is merged into the system as part of the system and which is fully accessible to anyone using the system 13 65 whilst appreciating the additional info rmation outlining unccd practices and the efforts undertaken to date to close th recom mendation oios would require receipt of form ally adopted docum ented it system developm ent policy and procedure taking into account the united nations high level business case m odel and include the need to m aintain com prehensive and appropria technical and operational docum entation of existing applications d business continuity planning 66 oios appreciated that unccd establis hed regular back up procedures for its files and data however oios noted that the server room although secure was not properly protected from that fire and the si x sets of backup tapes one set for each week were stored on site in the server r oom or library without securing an offsite storage in addition unccd did not yet have business continuity plan including disaster recovery arrangem ents recommendation to ensure inform ation technology it assets are properly protected unccd should prepare business continuity plan including appropriate back up proce dures taking into consideration industry best practice rec 09 67 unccd responded that this recommendati on would be implemented by end of 2006 it further commented that as noted by oios the it group has established regular back up procedures for its files and data given the present physical configuration of the building and space limitations all measures were taken to guarantee to major extent the security and protection of data th is includes restricted and secure access mode to the server room and diversification of in situ storage of back up tapes server room and library to decrease risk of data loss due to hazards 68 the secretariat believes that further asures can be taken to enhance current back up procedures namely ex situ storage ho wever the secretariat further notes that such storage facilities would inevitably imply financial costs that cannot be contemplated under the present financial situation of the secretariat 69 the secretariat has also indicated that the scheduled move to new location in the second quarter of 2006 would provide enhanced options in this regard recovery business plan will then be established on th basis of the secretariats new physical environment meanwhile and owing to the impor tance of the issue measures were also taken to ensure storage of back up tapes in the administration safe so as to further decrease risks 70 oios appreciates the com ments and the inform ation on planned relocation the recom mendation will be closed upon receipt of form ally adopted business continuity plan including appropriate back up procedures taking into consideration industry best practice f management of resources 14 financial resources m anagem ent 71 unccd inform ed oios that the lack of financial resources for it activities limited the upgrade of equipm ent and technol ogy however accurate inform ation on how m uch unccd was spending on it was not available because it had policies and procedures in place to ensure that it expenditure was reflected in its budgets in consistent m anner oios is of the opinion th at this inf ormation is essential to enable unccd to explain and justify to its conferen ce of the parties how m uch investm ent in it is needed to support its m andate and to demonstrate how it has m ade effective use of it funds in adm inistering its activities and in supporting program delivery the recent jiu review on unccd recom mended dedicated ict fund preferably within the fram ework of the core budget oios supports the idea which would help in collection and reporting of it expenditure to f acilitate investm ent analysis of the use of it and support requests for additional funding recommendation to f acilitate ef ficient collecting and m onitoring of expenditures on inform ation technology it unccd should explore ways of establishing separate it budget within the core budget fram ework rec 10 72 unccd accepted the recommendation and commented that as stated in recommendation 2 above in matters of procur ement of it equipment and software the it group works in close coordination with administrative services the it group defines the technical specifications which nables administrative services to commence the procurement process this separati on of duties not only guarantees adherence to rules and regulations but also ensures the best human resources management for secretariat of unccds size 73 based therefore on the current allocation of functions the secretariat has always had detailed and accurate and uptodate knowledge of its it expenditures in administrative services 74 furthermore the unccd budget request structure follows clear management guidance and reflects the diverse substantive and logistical requirements of the secretariat it requirements are review ed within that perspective and included under supplies and equipment notwithstanding the severe budgetary constraints of the secretariat its budget submissions have consistently endeavoured to cover what its it group considers as the minimum operating re quirements to ensure adequate delivery of its mandate in that regard its budget s ubmission for the forthcoming biennium specifically foresaw computer replacement programme about one third of all unccd computers each year and software upgrade programme given the fact that much of the unccd software would longe r be supported by the manufacturers after 2006 75 the unccd secretariat fully recognizes however the added value arising from the establishment of dedicated ict funds w ithin the framework of the core budget in line with the recommendations of the jiu report as supported by the oios the secretariat will therefore incorporate th is proposal into the budget submission for consideration by the eighth session of the conference of parties 15 76 oios appreciated the com ments on and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of docum entation covering the establishm ent of the it budget b use of general tem porary assistance gta 77 the associate database adm inistrator and the inform ation system s assistant have been on shortterm contracts funded by the general tem porary assistant gta budget since they joined unccd in 2001 nd 2003 respectively according to the budgetary policy stated in stai295 tem porar staff m ay be appointed against funds authorized for the purpose of tem porary assi stance unccd confirm ed that the works that have been carried out by these staff are of perm anent nature and therefore unccd should consider whether gta is appropriate recommendation to ensure secure work envir onment and also to com ply with the budgetary policy stated in stai295 unccd should consider the nature of the works carried out by two it sub unit staff on gta and should explore ways of regularizing rec 11 78 unccd commented that as indicate d under recommendation 3 above the it group consists of two p posts charge d to its core budget in 2001 and 2003 respectively two additional it unit staff members associate database administrator and information systems assistant were recruited on shortterm contracts funded by gta to address the increasing workload of the it group 79 although the functions and tasks assigned to the concerned staff are of permanent nature the secretariat has not been able to have these posts approved as part of its core budget 80 bearing in mind budgetary policy stated in stai295 the secretariat fully acknowledges however the need to address this matter with the view to explore additional options including possible use of the available funds under administrative support budget 81 oios welcom ed the com ments and will close the recom mendation upon notification of the regularization of the two it sub unit staff on gta c electronic perform ance appraisal system epas 82 none of the pas plans 2004 2005 cycl for it sub unit staff had been discussed reviewed in m idyear and com pleted as of audit date oios concluded that epas was not being conducted in acco rdance with stai20023 perform ance appraisal system and there was effec tive evaluation of staff perform ance taking place recommendation 16 to ensure that pas serves as effective planning m onitoring and evaluation tool for perform ance unccd should establish plan of action with clear tim eframe for tim ely and effective implem entation of pas rec 12 83 unccd commented that as referred to in recommendation 3 above the it work plan is defined on the basis of secretaria ts internal requirements assessment and is delivered on the basis of schedule of ic t activities which includes deadlines and clear function assignments 84 the proper completion of the pas review s midyear final is unquestionably very important process that may have b een hampered by the heavy workload and further complicated by the two level repor ting then prevailing in the it group in conformity with the line of action suggested with oios in bonn and as referred to in recommendation 4 above the secretariat be lieves that the noted weakness will be efficiently addressed and corrected through the projected direct and individual supervision of it group staff by the erpi coordinator 85 oios notes the com ments and will cl ose the recom mendation upon receipt of plan of action with clear tim efram for timely and effective im plem entation of pas d it equipm ent m anagem ent need for complete and accurate inventory list 86 although the procurem ent assistant had m aintained an it inventory list there was assurance that the list was com plete and accurate many of the item s did not have basic inform ation on tim of purchase nd value further oios was inform ed that certain old m achines were donated in 2003 which was not updated in the list 87 physical inventory took place in july 2005 for the first tim in three years though its effectiveness was im paired due to the absence of an inventory record to compare against oios noted that the physi cal inventory did find various exceptions including different inventory codes different items missing item s or different locations at the tim of this report the results of the physical inventory had not yet been compiled into docum ent showing all the ex ceptions with explanations of the causes and follow up actions required need to clarify the role of it sub unit in it asset management 88 the respective roles of the it sub it and of the adm inistration and finance unit with respect to control and m anagem ent of it equipm ent were unclear and in need of review the it sub unit had not been involved in setting policy and procedure for classification of it equipm ent to be recorded and m aintained in the asset database and the strategy developm ent for tim ely and ppropriate replacem ent and disposal of obsolete and excessive equipm ent furthe rmore while the it sub unit controlled the movem ent of it equipm ent it did not have an appropriate system to m onitor and record the m ovem ents and inform the procurem ent assistant of such m ovem ent as such unccd did not always have accurate inform ation on where it assets were located and had difficulties in conducting the physical inventor im portant expertise in this area is theref ore not being utilised with conseque nces such as untim ely disposal of it equipm ent and inadequate inventory control application at the tim of issuing this report oios understood that the it sub unit d initiated action to establish an internal 17 system to facilitate m onitoring and recording of it asset m ovem ents policy on it asset replacement and disposal 89 unccd inform ed oios that it planne d to im plem ent policy to replace software and hardware roughly every three ears which could not be fully im plem ented due the lack of financial resources oi however is of the opinion that unccd firstly needed to establish sound asset m anagem ent arrangem ent before creating the it asset replacem ent policy recommendations to ensure having com plete and accurate it inventory list and those assets are properly prot ected unccd should review its procurem ent related files to reconcile with current inventory list once the inventory list has been tablished the reconciliation with the recent physical inventory should be carried out to sum marise and investigate any exceptions or discrepancies rec 13 to ensure that inform ation technology it expertise is properly utilised in it asset m anagem ent unccd should clarify the respective roles and responsibilities of the it sub unit and of the adm inistration and finance unit for control and m anagem ent of it equipm ent through out its lifecycle rec 14 to facilitate the establishm ent of an inform ation technology it asset replacem ent policy unccd should establish it asset managem ent arrangem ents that include developing it asset standards by functions and needs m aintaining com plete asset records to help identify those to be replaced and strategy for the disposal of the assets replaced rec 15 90 for the above three recommendations u nccd commented that based on the bonn headquarters policy selected secretariat activities are delegated to the common premises unit in liaison with administrative services and in close consultation with the relevant substantive it under this arrangement the it group is not in charge of defining current inven tory systems and cataloguing procedures including references to dates of purchase and values of inventory items 91 the it group therefore followed established inhouse procedures for inventory and assisted with staff member during the co mpletion of the last inventory the it group may in the future assume more pr oactive role in the inventory process particularly on issues related to informa tion on the time of purchase and asset values but this might entail the revision of current function attributes and relevant delegations to administrative services or the common premises unit 92 bearing in mind oios recommendati ons the unccd it group has now developed in house an online inventory sy stem accessible through unccd intranet web portal the system is being currently tested with full implementation programmed before the end of the year meanwhile th it group carried out the physical inventory in order to populate the new system with data some of the standard features of the system are 18 recording physical inventory data entry with barcode scanners generation of reports based on different criteria maintaining of historical and current costs of inventory taking into account the usd exchange rate used as compared to euro while generating reports flexible tracking of the equipment ie what is where and with whom at any point of time facilitating online request by unccd staff of mobile type equipments like laptops beamers etc via unccd intranet portal and making adjustments to the inventory stock automatically by the inventory system keeping logs of all the transactions with time stamps 93 moreover in order to ensure completeness and integrity of this new system erpiit has been working closely with the administrative services with view to establishing clear lines of responsibilities in connection to the data entry whereby administrative services will be responsible for the data entry and monitoring aspect of it equipment while the it group will rema in in charge for data entry of standard equipment details such as name serial number location asset tag present owner etc 94 finally it is important to note that re garding the issue of old machines donated in the course of 2003 the secretariat endeav oured to follow all established procedures in that regard the secretariat obtained the approval of the joint local property survey board for the donation the board approved the donation and referred the secretariat to unog and the controller for their approvals unog approved the matter and forwarded it to the controller according to the controller the specific status of the unccd did not allow the controller to take decision on the matter accordingly the problems faced with the donation of these old computers rise from the legal and administrative complexities linked to th special status of the unccd and its administrative linkages with the rath er than improper followup of established procedures in order to avoid such issues in the future unccd is considering proposing to the undersecretarygeneral department of management change in the delegation of authority to the executive secretary 95 in line with the use of the inventory system to record and maintain assets as part of the ict strategy hardware and softw are replacement has been developed and is in the process of implementation the hardware and software replacement policy has been developed after proper considerati on of united nations ict product standards itsdosoo2l8 and keeping in mind the secretariat needs 96 oios appreciates the detailed explan ation on the recent developm ents on it

ented investigation into how the incident occurred and what could be done to prevent reoccurrence was not available recommendation to m inimise the possibility of future loss of equipm ent and to determ ine accountability for loss of the m issing com puter equipm ent unccd should conduct an inves tigation and produce report detailing what actually happened to the m issing com puters what actions have been taken by related staff and m anagem ent to prevent reoccurrence and whether any staff need to be held accountable for the loss rec 16 98 unccd accepted the recommendation and co

99 as soon as notified the coordinator erpi informed management and administration please refer to the various mails provided with the view to explore available options including insurance for the timely replacement of the missing hardware as an urgent first step to safeguard the united nations and unccd credibility visàvis its traditional and major sponsors to follow the standard administrative procedures established in the case of loss or theft of property and materials 100 as follow up to this several meetings were convened between senior managers of the unccd including the head of administration and finance and the erpi coordinator security was also contacted and fully informed as was the management of ikbb the inquiry process into the disappearance of the three computers is still ongoing with the intent of clarifying the exact circumstances that lead to the loss and establishing what actually happened including if possible ascertaining any responsibilities for the equipment losses meanwhile and to the extent possible unccd will take all measures necessary to avoid any reoccurrence of material losses or theft the secretariat will request incr eased security measures for it equipment during meetings outside of its headquarters and will instruct it staff to exercise all required controls and caution when dealing with expensive it equipment 101
