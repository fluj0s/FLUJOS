clear enforceable credit policy sms has contacted by telephone agents with overdue accounts focusing on major accounts and have also sent out written reminders until recently formal agreements were entered in to with agencies outlining the terms and conditions of working with sms letter of agreeme nt was loa forwarded to agents for signature in october 2005 but in january 2006 many of them had

performed neither an annual inventory nor p erpetual stock count of publications in recent years there was assurance therefore that the inventory records kept by sms are accurate and complete oios appreciates that due to the nature type and quantity of stock this is long and labourintensive exercise nonetheles s proper stock controls should be established to identify any losses and publications that have been damaged or are outdated in the opinion of sms the introduction of the perpetu stock counting system would be the most efficient book and gift shop activities the bookshop operation in

the period under review the contract for the bookshop contractor was renewe d in october 2005 with the winning offer given to the company managing the operation since 2 002 there were delays in the procurement process meaning that the previous cont ract had to be extended on june 2005 sms started to apply the provisions of the new cont ract ie five months before the contract was awarded oios acknowledged that the contractor started to fulfill its responsibilities from the initial planned date of the new contract but w ould highlight that this was an unusual practice and could have had potential legal risks attached sms stated that the possible risks involved had to be balanced against the fact that w ithout contract the bookshop would have had to close not only losing income but creating t he potential for the situation to be brought to the attention of the local press personnel matters the warehousing space that is used exclusively by s ms is administratively the responsibility of the distribution section conference services di vision in oios opinion the warehousing function should be reviewed with consideration give n to assigning administrative

annually 3 the last oios audit of sms was conducted in 1 999 and revealed that internal controls required strengthening particular in the areas of the promotion of publications and inventory controls action was taken by sms to imp lement oios recommendations 4 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed during the exit conference held on 22 december 2005 with the chief geneva office of publications sales and marketing section and the ch ief publications sales and marketing section outreach division department of public information new york draft report was shared with the chief publications s ales and marketing section in february 2006 and reply was received from him on 18 april 2006 the comments received in april 2006 are reflected as appropriate in the report sms has accepted all of the recommendations and is in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to evalua the adequacy effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls to ensure the reliability and integrity of financial and othe r information the effectiveness and efficiency of its activities safeguarding of assets and compliance with regulations rules and other pro cedures iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on the two main activities of sms namely the distribution of publications and the book and gift shop operatio n the audit covered the years 2004 and 2005 oios reviewed and assessed the adequacy of t he arrangements established by sms over the safeguarding distribution invoicing and payment of publications as well as the 2 agreementscontracts with agents oios also reviewe d how sms managed the book and gift shop in geneva and assessed the level of compl iance with the terms and conditions of the current and proposed new contract in light of the xpansion of the book shop operation 7 the audit activities included review and as sessment of sms systems and procedures and its compliance thereof oios intervi ewed various staff analyzed applicable data and reviewed available documents and other rel evant records iv audit findings and recommendations distribution of publications 8 sms deals mainly with agents for the distributi on of publications an agent requests publications by placing an order and upon receipt of this sms releases them from stock packs them and ships them to the agent the agent pays the shipping and handling charges 9 oios found that in general sms had established system for the distribution of publications albeit some improvement was still req uired to strengthen internal controls as outlined below once this is done oios was of the opinion that sms activities could be more efficient accountabilities more clearly defin ed and potential financial losses reduced throughout the audit oios suggested enhancements t internal controls and was pleased to note that sms responded positively in most cases i mmediate action was initiated 10 moreover as noted below many procedures were done on an ad hoc basis while in most cases the actions taken were justified when ex plained to oios with the recent retirement of the head of sms in geneva the lack f adequately documented systems established criteria and procedures poses risk to the smooth handover of operations and relations with agents sms stated that thorough review will be undertake n by the new head of sms in geneva in order to document key procedure s and policies accounts receivable 11 as of 29 september 2005 the accounts receiv able of sms amounts invoiced to agents was us 123 million of which about us 58 0000 related to balances outstanding for more than two years some of the debts dated as far back as 1996 and few even earlier as follows period amount of accounts receivable us 1996 and earlier 54400 1997 2000 109800 2001 2003 414500 2004 2005 649100 total as at 290905 1227800 3 12 in oios opinion it is extremely unlikely t hat the amounts of over us 150000 will be recovered 2000 and earlier and unlikely that all of those of more than two years old will be fully received there is situation therefore that considerable income may be lost to the due to the nonrecovery of these debts moreover if more positive action is not taken or more aggressive followup policy introduced the vel of old unpaid debt is likely to increase 13 the issue was discussed with both the chief of sms in geneva and his immediate supervisor the chief of publications sales and mar keting section psms of dpi in new york oios was informed that prior to 2002 the office of programme planning budget and accounts oppba was responsible for collecting pay ments and tracking accounts receivable in 2002 the balance of the accounts re ceivable us 18 million was transferred to sms geneva it was also their opinion that som payments may have been received but not correctly matched and cleared against the appro priate invoice the chief sms was of the opinion that amounts due from current agents we re collectible matter how old the outstanding invoices were oios appreciates that from geneva perspective pa rticularly as prior to 2002 oppba with the assistance of dpi wa s responsible for receipt of payments and monitoring the accounts it may be difficult to determine the current status of unpaid invoices however the nonclearance of these debts cannot continue indefinitely and balances should not be carried forward from year to year without any concrete action being taken or evidence obtained that the amounts are act ually recoverable sms in conjunction with psms and oppba needs to resolve the issue eith er by clearing the receivable against payment made or by writing off amounts identified s nonrecoverable 14 sms stated that during 2005 considerable efforts we re made to resolve many of these outstanding accounts sms further stated that as f the date of the response the balances outstanding for more than 2 years have been reduced to us 313000 oios is pleased to note that older debts are being cleared 15 sms procedures for followingup on outstand ing receivables were not fully effective efforts were limited to the monthly printing and is suance of statement of account to agents and oral reminders during meetings with age nts at various book fairs this is not sufficient and oios suggested that more rigid fo llowup system be introduced this could include regular formal reminders and the establishm ent of preventive controls such as enforcing credit policy that includes accounts f our months in arrears will not receive further shipments 16 oios also noted that evaluation of the per formance of agents was conducted or documented regular evaluation would have allowed sms to draw conclusions on the patterns of performance of an agent including its credit history this would be sound basis for continuing business with them recommendations head2right the geneva office of publications sales and mark eting section department of public information with the assistance of the department of public information in new york sh ould ensure that receivables are reviewed and analysed for the accounts 4 receivable prior to 2002 with the assistance of op pba to determine if payment has been made if not appropr iate procedures should be initiated for the writeoff of nonrecove rable amounts rec 01 head2right the geneva office of publications sales and mark eting section department of public information should in troduce more rigid system for the followup of unpaid invoices and as first step issue formal written reminders to all agents with debts of four months or more outstanding sms should also review and analyse all debts which were incurred under its responsibi lity to determine if they are recoverable if not appropriate action should be taken to write them off rec02 17 sms agreed with the recommendations for recommend ation 01 sms stated it will take the matter up with oppba to write off accounts prior to 2002 that are not collectible for recommendation 02 sms confirmed that it had st arted to send out the written reminders and this would be extended further in 2006 as staf f issues are resolved in the interim sms has focused on major accounts and agents are being contacted by telephone when accounts are overdue to attempt to resolve issues in timel fashion b letters of agreement 18 oios was pleased to note that by october 200 5 sms had developed formal letter of agreement loa and had forwarded it to its agen ts for signature as of january 2006 however it appears that many of the loas had not b een signed by agents and returned to sms it means therefore that there was still for mal agreement with agents to ensure that terms and conditions of working with the are cle ar and consistently applied as before business was simply conducted under gentlemans agreement for example sms should ensure that agents comply with dpis credit policy but formal arrangement or policy had been systematically shared or signed by agents as result there had been mechanism to ensure compliance with dpis established credit pol icy this informal approach may have contributed in part to the significant outstanding receivables as referred to above there was similar situation with regard to the policy on retu rns of publications and the discounts given as outlined in more detail below c credit policy 19 the loa was developed by sms taking into sideration the uns general terms and conditions oios noted however that it still di d not contain dpis credit policy for non payment or late payment policy that was approved by dpis publications board sms was of the opinion that dpis policy required to be cus tomized for the european market oios understands that sms was instrumental in revising t he policy which was subsequently approved for use in 2002 it contained conditions s uch as an agent whose account is four months in arrears will not receive further shipment s despite its approval and of the conditions therein that would safeguard andor miti gate the risk of large outstanding debts arising sms did not include the policy in the loa it was sms view that the provisions might still not yet be suitable in particular the establishment of credit limit to the specific 5 market realities in oios view sms should have further communicated this to dpi new york to ensure it was amended accordingly instead f facto noncompliance recommendations head2right the geneva office of publications sales and mark eting section department of public information should sure all business with agents is done under formal loa fu rther efforts should be made to ensure all loas are signed by age nts and returned to sms rec 03 head2right the geneva office of publications sales and mark eting section department of public information assisted by the publications sales and marketing section new york should review the revised current credit policy and determ ine the applicability of its provisions to the current mark et realities in europe and africa rec 04 20 sms agreed with the recommendations for recommend ation 03 sms stated that 25 letters of agreement for all major agents were issu ed in september 2005 as of april 2006 10 have been returned signed covering the top ten distributors reminders were sent in october 2005 and april 2006 for recommendation 04 new policy was drafted and will be submitted for the approval of dpi additionally t he credit policy would be included as an attachment to the new form of the loa sms confirm ed that the revised policy will be reviewed between new york and unog to confirm its pplicability to the european and african markets sms has included the credit terms specific to an agent in their loas the general credit policy for all other customers wil l be posted online and publicized once the review has been undertaken discount policy 21 the procedure for discounts given to agents on the sale of publications was not clearly documented nor was there systematic formula appli ed sms explained that number of factors were considered including the following vo lume of sales involvement in promotion activities and the geographical location develop ing countries receive larger discount oioss review of sales records showed however that these criteria were not applied consistently the variations could not be easily ex plained and the rationale for awarding particular level of discount was not documented 22 oios highlighted that an established discount policy is essential to ensure transparency and that agents are treated fairly and consistently the discount granted to the agent should be documented and reflected in the loa with the agent recommendation head2right the geneva office of publications sales and mark eting section department of public information should ma intain records of the discounts given to agents and document justi fications of any 6 noncompliance andor variations to the policy thi s information should be appropriately filed either centrally or b agent rec 05 23 sms agreed with this recommendation new discoun t policy has been incorporated into the loas further review will take place be tween unog and new york sales offices to harmonize the discount policy where possible howe ver in the opinion of sms given the wide disparity in market conditions in different co untries implementation of single unified policy is impossible without some exceptions sms agreed that such cases should be documented and the justification recorded to mainta in transparency f return of publications 24 sms has policy whereby agents can return pub lications that are not sold sms accepts returns upon the fulfillment of several cri teria and conditions oios was informed that this included preapproval of returns by sms an assessment of the most efficient way of return the entire publication if it can be reso ld or only its cover page if resale is possible and an assessment of the capacity of the agent to sell this type of publications in future oios assessed these criteria and condition s and found them justified however documented policy was established and it was found that the criteria and conditions were not applied consistently 25 oios was informed that in general agents wer given oneyear return period it was noted however that the newly introduced letter of greement with agents stated the return period as two years in practice oios noted that agents were returning publications which they had kept in stock for more than two years eve n before the new loa form was developed these returns were accepted by sms sms stated that it was its policy to maintain small stock of publications with major gents for extended periods of time and to eventually accept returns of unsold publications sms also stated that the return rate in general was quite low and did not exceed 10 to 15 per cent 26 in oios opinion the returns should be governe d by the preestablished timeframe to minimize financial losses for the should there be necessity to extend the return period on an exceptional basis it should be done in advan ce and be properly documented recommendation head2right the geneva office of publications sales and mark eting section department of public information should force the provision of the return period and establish crite ria for exceptionally granting extensions to it rec 06 27 sms agreed with this recommendation sms agreed th at the issue of the treatment of returns from certain large sales agents needed to b better documented the loas will be used to specify terms for each individual customer where they depart from the normal policy sms stated that that this policy once set will be enforced furthermore set of criteria will be developed to guide the granting of exceptions 7 f annual inventory of publications 28 sms stored the publications in six different cations in the palais des nations for the main location where most of the new publicatio ns were stored oios observed that the conditions were satisfactory publications were ke pt in dry environment and were properly stacked on shelves andor palettes two locations situated in the corridors near the main storage and near the garage were found to be insec ure enabling easy unauthorized access the location near door 13 contained publications da ting back as early as 1957 some of the material was visibly damaged oios suggested that the locations and conditions of storage be assessed the lack of security poses higher risk of loss and theft as well as the threat of fire 29 oios discussions revealed that neither an annua l inventory nor perpetual stock counts had been performed in recent years this i n oios opinion is weakness in internal control that needs to be addressed while apprecia ting that due to the type and quantity of stock this is long and labourintensive exercise proper stock controls need to be established it will help to identify any losses that may have occurred as well as identify any publications that have been damaged or become obsolete oios wo uld suggest that perpetual stock counting inventory system be introduced to provide management with assurance that stock balances match inventory records recommendation head2right the geneva office of publications sales and mark eting section department of public information should as sess the locations and conditions of storage of publications sms should also strengthen its internal controls over inventor management by conducting periodic physical counts considering th nature and type of stock perpetual stock counting system may be the most efficient consideration needs to be given to dispo sing of damaged publications rec 07 30 sms agreed with this recommendation sms stated th at the need for the additional storage at the palais des nations was acute and thi s has resulted in stock having to be stored in the corridor areas over the years sms has att empted to gain more storage to solve this also the situation may get worse when the new books hop opens sms will assess what options are available to resolve the situation 31 sms stated that the disposing of the damaged and ol d stock will be undertaken in conjunction with programme of inventory managemen t sms agreed that the introduction of the perpetual stock counting system would be the mo st efficient and move to initiate this was started at the beginning of 2006 through cooper ation with publishing service csd however an implementation has been delayed due to s taffing constraints sms agreed to address the issue g informal practice for destruction of publicatio ns 32 currently sms has coherent policy on the ret ention of publications the decision 8 to reduce stock is taken on an ad hoc basis usuall when extra space is needed for new publications 33 the decisionmaking process and the rationale f or the stock reduction was explained to oios however the reasons for destruction as we ll as the authorization and verification of the destroyed material were not properly documented recommendation head2right the geneva office of publications sales and mark eting section department of public information should tablish appropriate procedures for the destruction of publi cations rec 08 34 sms agreed with this recommendation and stated tha t the internal guidelines established by psms new york will be used as bas is establishing its policy sms further stated that as space requirements differ at each cation some local modification might be expected b book and gift shop activities contract for the book and gift shop 35 the book and gift shop has been managed by deco editions van diermen switzerland since 2002 the first contract expir ed on 31 march 2005 and was renewed for three years in october 2005 with optional extensio ns for maximum cost of us 1758000 oios reviewed the procurement process for the new contract including the request for proposals rfp terms of reference and the evalua tion of submitted proposals oios noted that the terms and conditions of rfp were adequate to sms scope of work and that the proposals were evaluated fairly 36 while the procurement process was assessed as dequate it took an exceedingly long time to complete 15 months oios noted that alt hough the procurement action was initiated well in advance the various delays led t the vendor operating on monthly extensions between march and october 2005 all ins tances of delays were explained by unog purchasing and transport section pts and sms however in oioss opinion better cooperation between the two offices could ve reduced the inordinately long lead time b independent verification of bookshop sales 37 in oios opinion the bookshop operation in ge neral was well established and properly organized by the contractor oios reviewe d the systems and procedures over sales recording and reporting as well as the computerize d inventory system the spot test checks conducted of sales items showed exceptions and overall oios assessed systems and procedures were satisfactory and operating effecti vely during the period under review 38 at the same time while acknowledging the staff ing constraints of sms extended sick leave of the bookshop liaison officer oios noted that sms supervision and management 9 of the bookshop operation could be strengthened in particular in respect to the accountability of the contractor 39 at the time of the audit sms relied on the cont ractor for information on sales the sole source of data for the reporting of sales proc eeds were the daily printouts of the cash registers and the credit card readers submitted by the contractor to sms in oios view this reliance without an independent verification pose d risk of data manipulation and possible financial losses 40 oios verified selection of daily printouts an d found them accurate oios also reviewed the cash register and credit card reader p rocedures and concluded that the internal controls over report generating by the contractor w ere adequate and the information provided to sms was reliable at the same time oios noted that the data still could be changed manually in the contractors inventory database t his fact by itself does not render the data unreliable nor does it indicate any wrongdoing ho wever it implies that smss controls over what have been released to the bookshop should be t ightened 41 upon oios inquiry it transpired that sms does not perform reconciliation of what was issued to the bookshop from the warehouse again st the reported sales of the bookshop while to conduct complete inventory may not be co steffective the periodic spot checks of high value items would provide an effective risk tigating control recommendation head2right the geneva office of publications sales and mark eting section department of public information should st rengthen supervision and management of the bookshop activiti periodic verifications and independent spot checks should be conducted to provide assurance systems and procedures are in pla ce and operating effectively rec 09 42 sms agreed with this recommendation and stated that its ability to manage this aspect of the operation has been adversely affected by the longterm sickness of the responsible staff member another staff member has now been trained to take over many of the functions sms stated that the spot checks would best be under taken by someone other than the bookshop coordinator and will assign such responsib ility accordingly c application of the provisions of the new ct before its award 43 the oios noted that sms started to apply the pr ovisions of the new contract in particular with regard to the new scheme of additio nal incentive fees in june 2005 ie five months before it was awarded 44 oios acknowledges that the contractor started t fulfill its responsibilities starting from the initial planned date of the new contract which due to various rea sons was presented to the committee on contracts with delay of at ast five months while formal audit recommendation has been issued on the matter oios would like to highlight this unusual practice to dpi new york and the resulting potenti legal risks such an informal 10 arrangement may have had 45 sms stated that the possible risks involved had to be balanced against the fact that without contract the bookshop would have had to c lose not only losing income but creating the potential for the situation to be brou ght to the attention of the local press c personnel matters 46 the warehousing space that is used exclusively by sms is administratively the responsibility of the distribution section confere nce services division ds one of the two staff working there was on post belonging to ds the responsibilities of the mentioned staff member included the receipt handling and dispatch of books and publications to agents though this staff member administratively was on th staffing table of ds functionally she reported to and got instructions from sms her du ties were fully within the scope of work of sms 47 it should be noted that similar situation exi sts in the publications sales and marketing section department of public information new york psmsdpi where the sales dispatch unit though servicing exclusively psms b elongs to the publishing section department of general assembly and conference manag ement dgacm at the request of dpi and dgacm oios had reviewed the arrangement in may 2005 oios recommended among other things that the functions of the sales dispatch unit be transferred to dpi 48 in oioss opinion the warehousing function sho uld be made administratively the responsibility of sms in order to reflect the exis ting arrangements and be in line with the reorganization in psms recommendation head2right the geneva office of publications sales and mark eting section department of public information should re quest the department of public information new york to initi ate discussions with conference services division unog on the tran sfer of the warehousing function to sms rec 10 49 publications sales and marketing section dpi unhq has already had initial discussions with conference services division unog on this matter it has been agreed to include the responsibility for the warehousing acti vities under smss scope of work as part of the next budget plans it should be noted that psm s is not necessarily agreeing to the transfer of posts rather just the responsibility f or the activity sms will propose as was done with transfer that took place in new york the mo st costeffective option available to it including the feasibility of outsourcing the comple warehouse operation or use of contract staff similar to the situation in the bookshop 50 in july december 2005 sms employed two staff on an hourly basis as follows staff secretarial duties and assistance to vario us sms staff accounting bookshop matters shipping of publications staff b software development and it support main tenance of the sms database and 11 developing additional functionalities of this datab ase 51 both staff were employed on the basis of an agr eement developed by sms contrat dengagement temporaire à lheure sms stated that it had taken the form used by the visitors service as an example and modified it fo r the needs of sms oios review of the agreement showed that it contained several clauses that in oioss opinion are not applicable for the staff on hourly pay for example the agre ement stated that the incumbent is entitled to sick leave which is accumulated at rate of tw days per month up to 24 sick leave days annex clause conge maladie 52 oios inquiry with hrms revealed that the unite d nations office in geneva does not normally hire staff on an hourly basis with the sole exception of the visitors service where it is being used for employing guides the r ationale for hourly payments to guides was that their services are only needed for the actual time of guided tours and may not cover the whole working day hrms further stated that there is standard form of hourly engagement and in case of the visitors service the hiring is done entirely by the service without hrmss involvement 53 in the view of hrms the employment of an administr ative assistant or an it specialist on an hourly arrangement was improper nd should have been done through the regular hrms procedures following oioss discussions with sms and hrms n hourly staff sms initiated the conversion of these staff to individual contractors 54 sms stated that the hiring of the temporary staff d escribed by the audit arose as the result of misinterpretation from discussion wit h hrms which led the management of sms to believe that they could hire under the same terms as the visitors service v further actions required on recommendations 55 oios monitors the implementation of its audit recommendations for reporting to the secretarygeneral and to the general assembly the responses received on the
