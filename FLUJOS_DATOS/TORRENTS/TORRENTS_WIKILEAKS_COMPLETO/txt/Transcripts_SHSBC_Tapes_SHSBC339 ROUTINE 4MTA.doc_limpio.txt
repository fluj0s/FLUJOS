routine 4mta lecture given on 19 september 1963 well youre very lucky to be at saint hill at this particular time very lucky in times to come why probably this will be old hatall be old hat whats the date audience nineteen september nineteen september ad 13 saint hill special briefing course running the pcs actual gpm full and complete rundown thereof including the new development of finding ris by tone arm action1 once upon time there was pc and he was lucky because he was going to get out of it but hed been very foolish thetan for long time he kept postulating goals and he says the way to handle life is to get very broad datum big broad datum and then i dont have to be there and handle life see which is your ultimate in confront dont want to handle life anymore dont want to confront life anymore so im going to postulate goal to be schnook and he was if he wasnt one before he postulated the goal he was afterwards now i dont mean to be too hard on us because it would be equally selfaccusative but the mechanism which is in operation and which is the broad basic mechanism is just about the simplest thing you could possibly state youll have to probably do lot of work on green scientologists and so forth trying to get them to understand what confusion and stable datum is there were lot of examples on this dozen yearsten years eight years seven years ten five years ago theres been lot of examples of this kind of thing but i found it was relatively difficult to teach as graphic analysis of the situation i remember trying to teach it to hgc auditors at london hasi and they had an awful timethey had an awful time trying to embrace the idea of confusion and stable datum well it goes like this you in actual fact get less confusion by adopting one point of confusion as stable datum if you want to enter this thing of confusion and the stable datumlet us say we tear apartand this is graphic experiment which you can doi mean you can show somebody this you can tear apart piece of paper and make lot of scraps of paper theyre fairly light and float and take this handful of bits of paper and throw it up in the air and when youve thrown it up in the air it of course all exists one to the next as confusion dont you see and then you say to the person you are demonstrating it topretend youre one of those pieces of paper you see and then that will appear to be motionless and everything else will appear to be in motion do you see how that would be so you can have lot of motions going on and even the stable datum itself could be in motion dont you see but by adopting one of these scraps of paper thats floating through the air as the point of view of seeing the other scraps of paper then of course youve reduced the situation by one scrap of paper which you at that moment of course pretend to be motionless do you see this do you see this so it all starts with lie stable datum in actual fact is in motion when its fixed up like that you see now you say youre motionless here on this planet now i can count out to you by advanced physicsnot as taught in universities but by real advanced physicsthat there are at least dozen motions to which you are subject while you are busy standing still you are going through dozen motions thisthis way earth is going in two different motionsjust in the orbit and its own rotationand its undergoing slight tilt all the time which precesses slightly and then the solar system is in tilt and then its tilting and at the same time it is moving and you start adding this upnot trying to make you dizzy but its considerable rate of motion you start in with the grossest motion is the rotation of earth and actually youre traveling at the ratejust this very instantyoure traveling at the rate of one thousand miles an hour approximately just by reason of the rotation of earth and yet you appear to be motionless so we dont then care about whether the stable datum is motionless or not motionless you see or factual or not factual see we care nothing about that but we do care that it is considered to be the one point which one presumes to be motionless now thats very crude example which ive given you and its totally applicable to the field of physics now to go into what thetan does and little bit further than this you get some more very complicated ramifications this is all under the definition of space actually space and then change which is time and so forth and space of course is viewpoint of dimension that is what space is and that is all it is now the point from which youre viewing naturally then establishes perimeter of space and if you want to give somebody high old time just conduct some of those ancient old scientology experiments on the basis of space is viewpoint of dimension you can really turn on the winds of space and the whirr around him say get the idea of planting two i did this to an architect not too long ago hes used to working in twodimensional plane you see and it upset him end get the ideayou know these flags that they put in golf holesthe cup you know well get the idea of taking two of those flags and putting them out there in front of you you see thats one of the old experiments you see now take two more and put them in back of you of course this just about tears the bank into ribbons you see because youve put this individual who is used to viewing sort of flat perimeter you seehe sort of doesnt confront it at all and you have given him viewpoint of dimension of course he immediately gets motion he immediately gets motion ceasing to viewgetting very very technical on youceasing to view develops the potential of motion why now lets go over this again slowly space is the viewpoint of dimension if you sit at one end of the room and look at the four corners at the other end of the room youre going to develop yourself sort of pyramid of space from where youre looking at those four opposite corners of the room see well just doing that will develop motion why because you dont do it that is why and in actual fact the entirety of the bank is nospace propositionas anybody who is busy listing with the mass coming in on him and the thundering thuds and so forth will convince himself of very rapidly its nospace proposition because there is viewpoint follow thisthis is very actually very comprehensible youre making much more out of it than is really there now lets have the pc sit in room and look at the four corners of the wall at the far end of the room well thats going to be very dizzying thing hes going to feel things move well why does he feel things move why does he feel his bank shifting around because he will if you dont believe it make the experiment yourself this evening and youll find out you dont have to go to the extreme of taking two golf flags and mocking them up out in front of you and trying to hold them there and then two more golf flags and put them behind you put yourself in cube of spaceputting yourself in cube of space is wow zzzzzz boy the motion really starts going so supposingsupposing we put in this room the person looking at the four corners of the far wall that makes sort of pyramid of space between the far wall and himself see all right now lets take him away lets take the person away and lets have this piece of paper look at it well you say well the piece of paper wont see itthats nonsense thats rightthats nonsense and thats what the pcs been doing all these years now anything then that develops in front of this piece of paper in its pyramid which comes from the far wall to the piece of paper is then uninspected motion in uncreated space see he said the space was there and then he is longer making the space so anything happens in the space of course is not confronted because hes got stable datum confronting that space for him now we take the piece of paper out and we put the pc back in because hes been gone motion has beenpotential has been developed in that area and the second we put him back in again it will start to move and right itself one way or the other back to space as viewpoint of dimension you see he recreates the space so therefore the potential motion in that space goes bzzzzz do you see see how this is because of course when we put piece of paper there to keep the space for him it didnt and anything that happened in that area was uninspected and it was mess so the second we put stable datum in there to keep the space straight for him naturally it apparently does so because it actually isnt creating any space and this is somewhat comfortable state of mind he doesnt have to worry about this now hes got lot of subterfuges of one kind or another that he can lie to himself about dont you see at the same time he holds that piece of paper in there confronting that space for himand of course it doesnt confrontand therefore anything that happens in the immediate vicinity of that thing is uninspected unaligned unhandled everything that goes on theres nothing looking at it theres space for it to happen in theres rationale of occurrence but there is occurrence dont you see because there is some space there because he made it originally you see the mess that is coming up now we take our thumb and index finger in the form of one auditor with one emeter and we pluck out of that position that piece of paper and we put the pc in it instead of the paper he recreates the space all motion which was held in abeyance or stored in that area immediately starts occurring we recreated the space of that situation and that time see this well therefore the idea of just throwing some papers up in the air and assuming the position of one of the papers and noticing if the rest of them then move in relationship to it and all that sort of thing thats too simplemuch much too simple description of confusion and the stable datum see too simple in actual fact the space tends to collapse when we put thatassume that point of view dont you see because in actual fact with the stable datum we longer have point of view so the thetan as hes gone along the line has put in false point of view called stable datum which he hopes will keep the space and take care of that immediate area and of course it naturally by the rules of gpms and problems and confusions dont you see hes here and this stable datum is supposed to confront that confusion dont you see and you get your ris your terminal and your oppterm situation occur and this thing all gums up and the next thing you know its solid black mass and its that which you think the pc is finding very uncomfortable and that which the pc is finding very uncomfortable that is what is happening that is the situation now youll see this the pc starts going vrrrrrr and your emeter starts going up and gets sticky and goes up rrrrrrk and well what are you doing see well you actually areyou got piece of mass but you havent found the position from which that space is being created see has been created in the past and you havent got him in toward the center of this thing see you havent got the exact wording of it you see and that sort of thing so you dont know what that stable datum is but youre moving him in toward it and of course hes now viewing himself so the fact that he is viewing that zone and area of space regenerates the potential mass of that old confusion and it doesnt discharge of course because he isnt viewing it from the right position hes viewing it from over here see hes looking at it from over here of course that isnt where its being created from theres datum in there which is making all that for him dont you see and hehes over here way over here on the right of theyou see of the area see hes way over here and the datum is way over here see down toward the center of the thing and so you get stuck tone arm why well of course theres nothing the space isnt being recreated so therefore there is discharge of what it contains its just ruummm now we move him back into the area and we say hey fella once upon time long time ago for reasons best known to you you deserted an area in here which had an awful lot of confusion and you left sentinel or something in there to create all the space for you and it didnt when we get your attention back in there it reactivates the sentinel weve got to get you over here to the point which you occupied originally the second we get him to the point he reoccupied originally we get crreaaakk brrrrrr mmeeeek zzuurrp zip zip why the space is being recreated and the energy potential stored in that space of course can now discharge so we can conclude that so long as you do not have the stable datum for any extant mass of confusion but have the pc somewhere in its vicinity youre going to get motionless tone arm and when you move the pc over into the point of view from which it is being created it is going to produce tone arm action elementary if he isnt in the point of view from which it is created see tone arm action but youre going to get stuck tone arm because youre reactivating the area see youre reactivating it but you havent got the point from which its being recreated so it goes crreaaakk and stuck see nothing is going to happen and then you move him over and you get little bit of happeninga little bit of happening and when you get him over into the center of this area where he is really creatwas really creating that space originally and substitute the pc for the stable datum seemake him go back and take look at this thing you seethe second he reoccupies that point of view he gets promptly and immediately tone arm action the whole thing blows up tone arm action will keep on going then going then going then until the confusion is discharged from that immediate area well now part of the discharge of the confusion of the area is finding out what the stable datum was erected to confront and thats the other ri so theres another stable datum over there but mostly confusion called the enemy thats the oppterm the opposition terminal the enemy and he conceives it to have point of view he conceives it to be confusion he has lot of ideas about it and so it is all part of this space but it he thinks is creating its own space and youll have then two interlocked spaces because they are exactly and precisely interlocked they float in time because there is motion involved in it you have the stable datum of the oppterm you have the stable datum of the pc those two points are staring at each other and have been staring at each other for very long time you move the pc into their vicinity he reactivates some of this space he becomes aware then that there quote is something there he is not looking at it from either the point of view of the enemy or his own point of view dont you see and because he knows there is something there you get your tone arm going up now your next actionyour next immediate action after this occursif you are moving the pc toward either his own point of view or the point of view of the enemyhis fancied point of view of where the enemy looked from you seewere moving him in right straight on top of where he had that idea originallyhis recognition of the idea tends to give him resumptionhe tends to resume the point of view where he left the datum to make the space for him dont you see now he tends to resume that point of view and the moment that he does of course you get energy discharge because you have created space see he is there therefore he createsrecreates the original space that was created there and you get zooom zooom zooom zooom tone arm action if you dont put him in that exact point of view you dont get tone arm action you just get high tone arm now there can be lock points of view which is quite interesting other little balls of massed energy cling to this big stable datum other subsidiary points of view if you get him into one of those you get little blowdown and it will go back up again in other words you can recognizenow listen to this carefullyyou can recognize on the emeter whether or not you have brought the pc to resume the point of view of the center of that mass either of his own space or what he considered the enemys space and the second that you bring him actually to that center point of view to recreate that space in that time span that meter just goes apart because theres nothing else can hold the space together you see that space now starts discharging zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom loose everythings going to pieces you cant get anything done you know you got too much tone arm action thats when you got him dead center on an riwhether his own ri or the enemy ri everything goes to hell that stuff wont stay together anymore because hes recreating the space on which that and all the locks occur but if you have him merely on lock it simply disturbs it little bit by resuming to some slight degreeyou see hes in close to resuming the point of viewand you get little blowdown and then the arm will go up again it will all rocket read dont you see but you havent got tone arm action as result of finding it you got that now that in actual fact is theoretical dissertation on the subject of what really should be redesignated now as routine 4 because its just class iv routine 4m but we could say routine 4mta now its practically the same 3m you did before but it has this big difference i have just been working this over ive gotten my hands real dirty with this and ive looked it over and i said is there any faster way that an auditor can absolutely guarantee that he will really get the ris yes there is and that is by tone arm action tone arm action now you all know the phenomenon of finding an item and getting blowdown you give the item to the pc and theyour pc then says thats right and you get blowdown if you did that you found lock thats just lock you should behave two blowdowns you should have blowdown when he gives you the item on the list and then you should get fall on the next items the next few items fall fall blowdown blowdown fall you see and you list little bit further and you got your tone arm action thats calmed down just little bit you go back and you check it will be one of those items and usually the first one the first one of that little series of blowdowns that you got now you give the pc the item and you get new blowdown only this time nothing can hold the meter together it just goes aaablablablabowbowbow you understand youve pulled the plug out of the bathtub you havent just splashed some water on the floor you understand now let put this in more practical terms from your point of view what youre looking for service fac for and whats service fac supposed to do its supposed to produce tone arm action why does it produce tone arm action you pull it out of the way and the discharge will then go simplest way of putting it you start getting this discharge of energy thats because its longer there to block it youre dealing with the same thing here see now if you get anything thats close in to real service fac anything that substitutes for it you thereafter get lots of tone arm action dont you see well dont you think you ought to get even more tone arm action for real ri more tone arm action for real ri there are two things you can do you can find lock which gives you beautiful rocket read nothing rocket reads as lovely as lock if you really want to see classic rocket read find lock that is not accompanied by blowdown and itll just rocket read and rocket read and rocket read beautiful dialwide gorgeous thing takes off with beautiful spurt and has curly tail on the end and so forth marvelous if you want to demonstrate to somebody what perfect rocket read is i plead with you dont find service fac or real rrori dont mean to infer that all service facs should rocket readwhat youre calling service fac or can use with one isnt an ri find lock find lock on pcs gpm start the list and see an rr and then dont go on listing see one rr that is not then followed by any blowdown oh it might be little 2 you know 25 division drop little little drop doesnt amount to anything and just dont complete the list of course the pc probably will arc break but thats all right you can tell him to shut up while you demonstrate it to the class dont you see every time you say thisyou see the real item is sultan see thats the real item and it was going to come up in about six or seven more items listed see and you found eunuch see on the list and you saw it rr see and you just stop the list right there thats it thank you shut up you know thats it all right thats fine now class were going to show you real rocket read see you say eunuch psewwwwwww eunuch psewwwwwww eunuch psewwwwwww gorgeous marvelous nothing more lovely itll keep up days later you put in the mid ruds on it and itll fire if you never complete the list see itsjust go on why its getting its power from the actual heartthe actual point of viewits getting its power and that power is leaking sideways and of course it will never wear out it will just go on rocket reading endlessly rocket reading rocket reading rocket reading all right well lets take pity on the student few days later and lets take pity on this person for demonstration purposes and lets finish the list this is the way it will behave see eunuch scimitar harem camels grand wazirs sultanright away psewwwwwww that moment that he says it see and then he will say palace date palms desert arabia tone arm action here see every time he says one of these things he gets another fall or blowdown gorgeous falls gorgeous blowdowns see well you go on and he also says datesthat didnt do much he says dates oil wells uhmmnato allies you see and nowherenothingits going on up now see itll go up if you keep going you can get it pretty highyou can get it pretty high you see youll notice the pc is starting to look kind of black and creaky and torn up and so forth dont pay any attention to that just go on list it you know you get upi think you can probably get it up to 6 if you tried why hell you found it man you found it what told you you found it because you got consecutive now get that carefully consecutive blowdowns that patch of stuff cant hold together you actually dont find now dont get this one wrongyoure not listing in actual fact to find an rr youre listing to find seriestwo three four fiveof blowdown items you want series of these thingsyou want series youre listing for series as soon as you find that series youve done it the only thing you have to do is list until you dont have the ta action quite so much its coming up but you really actually dont have to go that far all you need is that series see that series and therefore although its very nice to have your tone arm actions over on the sideyoull very shortly by the way have meter computers that give you total ta action we just had conference with fowler and allen and theyre building one and they equip onto old type meters too the new meters will be equipped with them dont know how fast itll take them to get these things out but theyre up over the horizon here someplace but that will give you your total action for the session and if youre so busy sitting there writing figures that you havent got time to write bd or b you know for blowdown and f for fall seeif you havent got time to write your tone arm commotionyoure so busy you see trying to say well it went from 425 to 41 you see and then it went from 45 to 35 and so forthif youre so busy tracking figures while trying to write items too youll soon find yourself lost in the dust and sand you see so the real bd that you want the real blowdown that you want to record is how far the thing blew down totally as result of having found it as an item you could mark that in after youve given it to the pc you see therefore it takes some mention of where your tone arm got to and so forth but that isnt what i would read by that isnt what i would read by i would sayin the first place blowdown isnt 25 divisions nothing ever blew down that little you understand thats not blowdown not with thisim still trying to call it r3m this 4mta thats not blowdown we want blowdown the biggest one that youre going to get is about two divisions that would be considered awful darn good and rather rare i would say you know maybe you got every eight ten itemsris that you foundyou had one that on giving it to the pc you promptly and instantly got two divisions of blowdown you see thats rather extreme point five divisions i would consider minimumminimum expectancy to be called blowdown so that leaves us up to about 75 or 1 division and so forth as what you would call commonly nice blowdown see phenomenal2 divisions minimalabout half division less than half division you cant read it without microscope anyway you understand go ahead and keep all the tone arm record that you want that is compatible with recording so that you can find out what happened so when you put blowdown on something well you know this thing went down see this hit the silk you know oh i can see some auditor sitting there quietlyquietlyquietly auditing along and the needle moves and he gets 1 divisions of motion of the ta and mark that blowdown now that could leave you with totally erroneous impression of the whole thing you see so if youre going to mark something with blowdown lets make sure it blew down you see lets not fool around with it now the whole point is simply this this is all you really have to get that if you pick the riwhether terminal or an opposition terminalout of that bank if you pick it out there aint nothing holding the bank together you understand at that point theres nothing holding it together youre going to get tone arm action and if you pick out quote ri quote unquote and it all stays together beautifully well and there is tone arm action and you go on thinking youve got the pcs ri then youre going to get into one of the wildest cat races you ever saw in your life see because youre going to have locks opposing locks and locks opposing more locks and locks opposing more locks and youre going to go astray youre going to be listing into the next gpm and over the hill into the next bank andoh youre going to have 5682 items per gpm and oh its just going to be so involved that you and so on furthermore the items wont make much sense on the line plot locks locks locks see but you list by tone arm action you get an entirely different view now you want consecutive series of blowdowns now we will settle for steep falls on the next two or three items that also cause tone arm action once you reach in to that bank and pull the plug well naturally the next three or four items the pc gives are going to be in violent motion because the only thing that was holding them still was the big one now look youre trying to find service facsimiles to get tone arm action right all right find ris for the same reason while youre doing the pcs gpm and you cant miss thats all the tone arm action there is to see or have the most that you will get what is the service facsimile of the pc it is simply the topeither one of the top ris of the current gpm see there it is so why do you think stuff out of the main bank would operate any differently it operates just exactly the same every time you reach in there and pick up great big handful of ri and yank it out wow everything caves in which means your tone arm is going to move and its going to move right now and its going to move fast and he gives you another itemof course hes sitting there in the middle now hes reoccupying the space that he occupied before see he had it occupied with stable datum but now hes reoccupying that space so he gives you the next one and that goes booorrrr and he gives you the next one and that goes pow see the next one boom the next one bang well hows it going to operate if you dont find the ri beautiful rocket read and the next ones going to go click and the next ones going to go tsk and then its going to go blank for few why its all in place you havent disturbed the bank any he can live through lots of these being found see the difference you havent in essence found anything that tore the bank up so of course if you didnt find anything that tore the bank up you are not going to get tone arm motion thats all there is to that so then when youre going down the line listing pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa mark in those rrs ooh thats fine theres nothing wrong with marking in rrs you sure better had you see something rr mark it in see but auditors sometimes miss rrs but its very hard to miss tone arm action so you notice this thing isnt centered so you better put down bd see sultanbd now youll get lot of blowdown lot of items blow down half division so you just mark that its whether or not they produced consecutive blowdown of items that is important see thats the important thing so if youve got sultan you see palace kingdom you know and it was sultanbd and palacefall bd kingdombd fall see hey were riding up on this thing you see and oilwell revenues you see fall now its going to be real quiet well i dont know i dont know quite how you shut the pcs itsa off and sometimes they feel better for going on listing for while they get very engrossed and that sort of thing because now you see theyre occupying the point of view you see hey what am i doing here you know i havent been here for long time and im very interested you know and here it is and so forth gee look at all this space you know and theyll go on goldplated rollsroyces you see turbans diamonds you know robins egg rubies or something you know theyll go on and go on thud thud thank you robins egg rubies thank you thank you thatyeah yeah thats it i think we got it see arc break but the point isthe point is the pc gets so darned involved that theyll list their ta way back up again and you can go on and on and on and on and you start listing them around the corner and theyll go into other banks you didnt go around the corner on the first consecutive series of blowdowns you hadnt gone around the corner you hadnt gone anyplace see youre right there but you keep going on to the next consecutive series of blowdowns well you probably missed an item and you go down the next consecutive series of blowdowns and your ta starts looking awful high now and then youll start ducking around the corner and going into another bank and all kinds of wild little ramifications this thing is now getting high its getting sticky the pcs got bad sen the pcs got bad somatics turned on by this time and you say well just to be on the safe side lets list all the tone arm action out of it well that datum was perfectly fine for source lists but it sure doesnt apply on any other kind of list as matter of fact even source lists dont have to have the tone arm action out now this is all in the effort of shortening up auditing the whole effort is how fast can you run gpm see i ran one in three hours and half last night whole thing and i was riding right up on top of the thing and it turned out that the only mistake i madethe only mistake i made going down the line was i ignored consecutive series of blowdowns not having the technology of course and i finally sat back and said you knucklehead and backed it up again and got it in there and squared it around and it was all right i said well of course of course youre pulling the plug out on this stuff and naturally youre going to get tone arm action i hastily thumbed through everything i had and i found out you always had this conditionyoull find youllalways had that condition if youre working on the right goal if youre working on the right ri and the right list and opposing it right way to and its all going along fine and you havent skipped any items then youre going to have consecutive series of blowdowns thats going to last for two three four items see its going to be commotion when you see that commotion its one of those items probably the first one undoubtedly the first one because thats the one where you took the plug out but you might not have noticed that one as it went by so you take the one just before that now as far as neatness of rrs are concerned the real ri does not have neat rr its disintegrating rr and is blowing up in your face the thing is disintegrating all over the place actually you really cant tell if its an rr it looks like steep surge or fast fall or what is it and its so wide and so long that you just see the start accelerationif youre lucky you dont quite know when its going to take off you dont get chance to see the end of it usually its too long and the tone arm motion is falling too rapidly dont you see you never see good looking rr when you find an ri they justthats on an actual gpm they just dont look good theyre too big theyre too long theyre falling to pieces as you look at them charge is blowing up in all directions so you come back and you call the thing youre going to get nicenice looking read of some kind or another its going to read now heres the next little precaution all of your listing stuff applies but there is precaution that if you start nulling and you get two items to tick any two items on the list to tick well youve missed you shouldnt have two items ticking on list not for this technique not for 4mta noyou dontyou dont want two items ticking on list you read eunuch and it ticks and you read date palms and it ticks i wouldnt pay any more attention to the list why well youve obviously left the plug in the tub must still be full of water they didnt release if eunuchs and date palms didnt get out of there and if theyre still reading you obviously havent found the ri see its elementary my dear watson you see the rationale the area still must be charged up if something else besideis ticking you actually dont need much of test read couple of items that youve seen rr you see both of them tick man you havent got any more ri on that list than the man in the moon now if you run into trouble on this youve done something knuckleheaded and there are very few knuckleheaded things that you can do most knuckleheaded of them isis keep on listing with high ta which is going higher pc has got heavy mass and is pulling in and its all very uncomfortablewell you just missed an item thats all you did you just went right on by now its very easy to list an opposition to something see some series of blowdowns is the only frailty of it and find yourself in the wrong gpm so this step is absolutely necessary you can miss an item and find yourself wrong to thing doesnt list well energy pulls in on somebody see youve skipped pair youve gone around corner you see and youve skipped pair doesnt behave well isnt operating according to the textbook see well you better get busy did we skip an item yorp we skipped an item well lets go back and find that item see not leave it there because this blowdown phenomena will not continue to occur if youve skipped items see the bank is still very well cohesed theres some point of view the pc has not taken so as result he cant assume the next point of view hes sort of stopped right there so if it isnt working what im just telling you and this isnt occurring then youve done something goofy now the other way you can do something goofy is to oppose something backwards ordinarily you ask the pc if the terminal had pain on it you say did that have pain on it and the pc said yeah and hell point out the point where it had some pain on it well that was terminal heat cold and pain is actually all terminal stuff winds of space sensation that sort of thing thats your oppterm test you dont need to strain at this too much you normally can run it beautifully just on thejust on the terminal side without upsetting the pc at all by just finding out if he had pain on it because if it was terminal and youre operating on center ri of course he had pain on it dont you see see you keep your check there and you practically never list one backwards its quite obvious where you are in the bank ordinarily the line plot is making sense and everything is going along gorgeously you know where this is one of the main things that will get in your road as youre doing this is just if it doesnt go right youve done something wrong i mean that is all there is to it and the sooner you recognize it isnt going right then the sooner you can ask those burning little questions like have we listed one wrong way to and have we skipped an item are we operating an item that isnt part of this gpm that type of question you see now theres one questionand you can be suckered in on this because pc is very often very obliging you must run this little formula on an actual gpm it is totally missing you see on old 3n now 4non old 3n now 4n its totally missing whereby you check up and check up your goal and all that sort of stuff but that is vital in running an actual gpm that you do all those little courtesy steps theyall the little bingbang steps you see would sultan oppose the american government or whatever the oppterm was you see that youre listing on check and make sure the oppterm doesnt tick if the oppterm still ticks man you just havent got the ri thats all dont argue with it you just havent got it and naturally why havent you got it well the list is incomplete and you havent had the proper series of blowdowns and all that sort of thing or the pc is busily listed around the corner well if the pc is listed around the corner hell list back around the corner again if you let him just continue the list little bit actually pc sometimes will list himself down to seven banks below where he is not bank by bank but hell give you couple of items from the seventh bank where he is and then give you items back in the bank where hes operating well unfortunately you once in while can get series of blowdowns from the seventh bank aaaaaahhh hahaha and the best way to check that is you say to the pc see would sultanhow would sultan relate orwould sultan relate to the goal to be rich and hed say oh brother haha yeah yeah yeah all right the pc says well lets see dadadada dadadada well i guess it could yes yeah it could and so on dont be fool man youve got item out of wrong gpm pc cant tell you that relates bang just like that see if he just says that oh well hell yes what are you asking for you idiot you know sultan gonna be rich youre silly i meanhaha of course naturally sometimes you think its very obvious and you shouldnt ask the pc these little courteous questions that fit in at this particular point which are all given in the rundowns see you could omit these nonsense man that is the biggest test there is to make sure you havent gotten in the wrong pew you getyou get an item like titillation all right good now you say to the pc just ratatatattattat how would that oppose and so on well it would oppose it all right and you say all right now how does that titillation relate to the goal to be rich you see well lets see if you mphhamph so on and so on well itit does brother watch it you havent got anything out of that gpm you may be fifteen banks to the left see maybe completely wrong its got to fit right now bang see now listen if this 4mta doesnt run by the book its old 3m its all done with the same steps but if it doesnt run by the book youve done something goofy something is wrong see the technique isnt wrong the pc isnt different nothing else screwy has happened this gpm is not constructed in some different fashion you understand see youve done something screwy and the only screwy things you can do you can actually plot out of the picture of pc in gpm see you thought you were in this gpm and youre actually in that gpm you thought you were listing an oppterm and actually you got terminal and you thought this was the next item actually you skipped an item dont you see and youve done something goofy here see you could plot them all up theyre just elementary things you just landed in the wrong viewpoint of dimension naturally in the midst of harems and sultans and that sort of thing this item titillation obviously it comes up it occurs to him he actually pulled it out of some other bank its been lying in there for some time see its not neat plot its in from somewhere else and if it doesnt go right and it doesnt go by the book youve done something wrong and if any ri you find doesnt blow the bank up as far as youre concerned at that moment you havent got an ri you got lock and you start opposing locks with locks and i wish you lock because youll need it anyhow now actually youll probtheres far fewer ris in gpm than has been thought theres possibility that this is the case you start finding nothing but ris see with an exclamation point you know every time you get one it blew down and then was followed with steep falling item and ä blowing down item and steep falling item and blowing down item and youyou got it see you go back and you call one of these off youll find theres just one fire on the list see that thing is probably firing sloppy too only one of these see there wont be one or two of them firing one of these fires sloppy usually the first one that started the commotion and that will give you beautiful fall or surge or blowdown of the ta or rocket read or commotion see after you get it all tamed down and prepcheck it see if you got it all preptamed down you put in your big mid ruds on it you got it all straight you got it all calm you got it all straightened out most of the confusion has blown off this immediate area dont you see and man the pc has cognited all over the place its nice and calm now and so forth now you say it see sultan psewwww youll get that rocket read because thats the chargethats as much charge as is left on it now and that will continue to be left until youve opposed it or its been opposed for the next ri thats the only charge thats left on it see theres more residual charge mixed up in it another thing is you dont want to give pc an ri that turns on lot of mass you hand him this ri and its some opposition terminal and some kind or other federal drug addicts you see opposition to be happy you see goal to be happy see federal drug addicts and he sits there you know you get little blowdown you know you say whats the matter oh nothings the matter and so on theres all these pictures and these ridges and so forth and theres this black mass lying alongside of my head you havent got the itemyou havent got the item too much mass on it now all items have tiny little bit of mass on them or they wouldnt be items at all but when you move him into the center of this thing see why he shouldnt have the mass sticking to him it should be going bzzzzzzzzzzzzzz see and if youve got mass plastered all over his face or his head or something like that you obviously have him about half in see you got him over here some place he hasnt moved into that old viewpoint of dimension and knocked out that stable datum you see hes only halfway in so of course hes half ridge and half not ridge and hes messed up to that degree if you just consider this what it is that the cohesion of the bank is problem of the confusion and the stable datumand you dont get off lot of the confusion you havent got the stable datumif you use it the same way as service fac it all makes beautiful sense to you now of course the whole gpm is held in position by the goal but the ris are major exclamationsized locks on the goal itself but they are ris in their own right and each one of them gives this phenomena and unless you find them you wont get blowout when you get to the bottom of the bank and find the goal youve got to list for these and youve got to crisscross and you got to bring them down every one of them is going to behave just exactly what ive been telling you about an ri one of the mistakes that you can makenow listen to loud and clear pleasei dont care whether you test the goal going down the bank or not if the rrs lessening you havent got the pcs goal ta is going to hell i mean youve got something wrong with the goal you know this is some elementary type business that an auditor is accustomed of running into but youre going on down the bank and you call the goal off occasionally it ceases to read very rapidly when you really find an rris when youre really finding real ris this goal ceases to read at an awful rate of speed when you get down to the bottom that goal exists as an ri totally independent of its influence on the remainder of the bank and this is one of the goofiest and one of the strangest phenomena which you ever wanted to see it wont fire as goal but it will fire as an ri that is utterly nutty just exactly how that degree of differentiation can take place i am completely flabbergasted but it does i just got through watching one call goal you know call it and call it and call it and talk it and prepcheck it and worry about it to make sure that were on the right goal and everything you know and theres nothing firing because its all blown apart see and is calling the goal and calling the goal and calling the goal not even flick just perfectly smooth needle next item the pc put on the list was the goal as an ri pow see spooky you know thing just fires its head off its an ri now it aint goal anymore its an ri now you turn around and take that firing goal and you use that fire as goal oppose to the next list dont come telling how your pc is feeling kind of creaky on 4mta you see dont tell because you havent heard what im about to say so hear it it not only fits down against the next bank that goal as an ri see that not only fits down against the next bank you see but it also has an item over here that it opposes and the way to go about it is to find the item or find the goal but always find both thats the most marvelous way of missing an item and lousing up bank anybody ever didis not realizing that the goal to catch catfish let us say is goal for the whole gpm influencing every ri and then in its own smug little armchair self is sitting there as also an ri and has an item which is holding in place as an ri see i dont care if you come down the bank on your usual zigzag of listing and you finally wind up with thiswith this goal where you say well all right thats the whole gpm thats the goal as the ri you got down to the bottom and its still firing now if you do goal oppose list with it youre in trouble thatif you do goal oppose list and go off and leave its opposition ri unfound youll be in trouble because youve missed an item now very often between two gpms there will be floater pair theyre quite cute weve got the whole gpm below its top oppterm however is below this is quite interestingunlike helatrobus implants and that sort of thing we know lot of things that the boys who originated those otherthei mean thepardon the boythe punks excuse i didnt mean to beoriginated those things didnt know about and that is not always but sometimes between two gpms there will be pair of items which arent related really to either one which give you the reason the pc postulated the goal see he had reason to postulate it now youve run one whole gpmone whole gpm you see comes up here to the two top oppterms its ownpardon its terminal and its opptermsee thats whole bank then theres pair of items and then theres the goal as the ri and the item you see above that which opposes this and were into the other bank see so the goal as the ri quite commonly will come down and hit one of those interim items see one of those inbetween pair and the goal as an ri being on the bottom of the bank when you get who or what it would oppose it hits this interim pair it doesnt hit the top oppterm of the bank below it hits this interim pair see it hits the opposition of it and then you list against that one that youve just found and you find the other terminal which is across from that and then when you list this other terminal you get the top oppterm of the next gpm see if you dont know thatits not always there thats whats bedeviling about it see some of you were neat and some of you just sloppy you see it really just depends on whether or not the top pair of gpm were adequate enough excuse to postulate the next goal and if they werent why youll get then couple of items of goalless pc see and itll beyoull get some rana random pair of items itll bethe oppterm is boredom and the terminal is to postulate goal or to have game orthat wont be to have game itll be having game or something like that or having game and man there isnt even gpm within miles of the place has anything to do with game and has nothing to do with boredom or anything else there they sit they really belong there so your goal as an ri if avoided and simply used as an opposition its rr will disappear because of course its being listed against what goal would it oppose to get the lower goal dont you see and thatll disappear and youll sit there and youll have sleeper theres trace or leadin now to that pair of interim items that sit between those two banks and actually goal as an ri is just as alive as punch man its just sitting there with total dynamite you prepcheck it for little while if you prepchecked it as an item not as the bank you see why it would start firing again probably even if you listed it for two hundred items you know listed it down into the next bank for goal what goal would it oppose what goal would to catch catfish oppose see itd still be sitting there so you can set up situation where your pc feels terrible where youve got the goal as an ri alive but the fire you see has been vanished by doing your next goal oppose list but its still alive its still there and youve got the two interim items which gave the reason why he postulated the goal theyll be floating there completely unobserved and youve got three hot items between the present time and the bank youre working youll have three items above you all the time all the time all the time and boy will you get in trouble pc is arc breaky and he unemememauunn and you obviously have the top oppterm because god you couldnt get any higher on this next gpm youre doing you see than practically the goal itself as an opposition you know you couldnt get any higher and youd leave three ris so thats common mistake that you can make now lets just sail into this as fast résumé of how you go about it lets assume that you got raw meat pc raw completely raw how are you going to find his pt goal thats easy find his service facsimile with r3sc after youve found four five or six quote unquote service facsimiles youll finally wind up with one that is hot enough to find goal with you just list goals against it and you can say you know what goal would it be part ofwhat goal of yours would this be part of anyi dontthat doesnt give you an exact wording but im telling you what youre trying to find out see so use this facservice facsimile to find out what the guys goal is now the funny part of it is is you can find four five six of these service facsimiles before you actually reach one which if listedif you listed goals against it will give you that present time goal its quite interesting terrifically overburdened you see bank in terrific overrestimulation from pt and all that sort of thing you can count on mistakes so you found oh all sorts of divergent things you see you found marriage and you found sex and you found wisdom and you found investigating things and you found eating and you want to look for thenot necessarily the one that gave you the most ta unfortunately you want to look for something that looks like it might lead into goal itll be something the pc had lots of problems about and the best indicator is if you find service facsimile for which the pc gives you in answer an automaticity of problemsyoure heading right in there man youre riding right in so you take it or its first cousin something right there and youll be able to find the pcs goal with it you know what i understwhat i mean when i say an automaticity of problems youre fooling around with this pc just using r3sc you see and youre fooling about trying to find ta action and browsing around and youre combing out present time some kind or another and pc all of sudden hits hits the village square now the pc doesnt tell you about the village square but tells you an automaticity of problems about the village square just goes brrrppp brrrppp brrrppp brrrppp brrrppp brrrppp brrrppp brrrppp brruu yeah i hate to tell you but you cant get down theres too many people in there you cant get your car in there and so forth and all the people around there ill tell you you cant get near the stores ill tell you theres an awful lot of difficulty in this particular area because you see you cant get near the stores and the police are always on the corner and so forth and you try to get through there and its got traffic light nobody will do anything about it and theresso forth and the pavements all rough as you walk over it with spike heel you sprain your ankle every damn time you know i meanandand so forth im notim not now just just clowning you see im giving you this dope i mean the pc goes problem problem problem problem problem problem problem problem problem problem problem problem problem problem problem problem problem problem da daahhh youre sitting right on top of his pt goal man youre sitting right on top of an ri you must have come in close to this ri you see or he wouldnt have been making that much space when he makes this space he gets his head knocked off with the problems you havent got the ri but youve got its cousin man now you start running any kind of r3sc process you see on what youve just foundthe village square is what this thing you opened your mouth and said the village square and you got poppetapoppetapoppetapoppetapop mortar fire on the line well thats all there is to that thats easy you know that the goal is somehow or another associated with the village square itll be totally unlikely but if you asked for goals listed against the village square seeso what kind ofyou know what kind ofwhat goal would have something to do with you and the village squarei dont care how corny your listing isyoull probably find out itstheyll tell you eventually you see to never go to church and you get nice tick on it and that thing cant be driven out dont you see you got nice ticking goal you examine it is this the actual gpm is this properly worded is it differently worded you know and is this present time and so forth or is this an earlier one go through bit of an analysis of this particular character and itll show up and the pc had never seen the fact that the village square has church at the end of it see and the top ri you see isnt the village square at all itll have something to do withentirely different but you just moved in on lock that close in you see itll probably have something to do with tombstones which you can also see you see or hymns or somethingjust village squarehymns you see they dont compare so dont try to get too logical about this thing but you give it to the pc youve triggered in close enough that hell fire off his goal at you all right thats raw meat pc scientologistsomebody whos had lot of auditing over long period of time ive already given you the formula for this in the last lecture there is hardly anything to improve on what goal you found is terribly interesting is that your actual gpm all right what kind of gpm does it look like all right lets list what goal would oppose it what goal would oppose that what goal will oppose that it seems to be in present time is this your present time goal all right thats very fine good lets give it the most likely top oppterm for this particular thing see and that fires and we list it and it starts blowing down and youre on your way you run into trouble doesnt go by the textbook youve done something wrong you see youve taken the next to the last one i mean or wrongly worded goal or youve done something else see all right so you got the pcs last gpm thats what you want you got that and so on you got the top oppterm for it well that should have kicked hole in the meter see big ta action when youve found that because hell ifs the biggest piece of service fac you could possibly lay your hands on itd be the pt ri and thats whats got all of his present time restimulation in high gear you oppose that bang youve got his first terminal there should be pain on that big bunch of tone arm action all right just carry it down now you oppose that with list you get your next opposition terminal and you oppose that with list you get your next terminal and you oppose that and you get your next opposition terminal and you oppose that and you get your next terminal and every one of those things ought to blow blow blow blow charge charge charge charge action action action action tone arm motion tone arm motion and youre runningyoure running this process on somebody with the tone arm at 50 brother you have done something incredible not just wrong incredible see they just carry it down you find the oppterm top oppterm whatever it is of course you dont know how complete this gpm is first one all the rest below that are complete but everything else is complete but the first one and it may be complete youre kind of on the spot with that one though youre not too sure where it ends and it follows of course the form and pattern of the earlier sample gpms like the one to scream that sort of thing thats what they look like and you just list them down you finally get down to where you get the goal as an ri see well about halfway down the goal itself startsstops firing then it fires again gorgeously as an ri now at the point of your departure you may in having listed the pc up the line found the goal just under this if theres any way to know what this goal is without listing another list use it dont monkey around you listed opposition goals up to it you see well heck you found the guys goal its the one to go to church you see itsthis one is to live saintly life you see its something like that and you found that gpm well list for its top oppterm its the first action you take on that but remember to dispose of the other gpm that you just left lets get its opposition see to that goal as an ri of the one you just left you understand you found the next gpmyou better do something about the one you just left so lets not corn around with it i dont care whether you find the goal first or you list the thing out against an ri first i frankly dont care which one you take probably its more comfortable on the pc not to find the next goal yet but just get that goal as an ri opposed see thats probably the more comfortable action to take on the pc but sometimes to get that thing opposed he opposes it much better and more accurately if hes got some idea of what the next gpm is thats the only reason i say theres variation of technique at that point but if you can just avoid finding the next goal or something like that until you need it dont throw any more in restimulation you see on the pc than you have to take it easy all right now lets take thattake that bank now youve opposed the goal as an ri and youve got all the other items theyre all written up on line plot and it all seems to make sense you go over that line plot and you read them all off to the pc any one of them ticks or suppresses you keep checking for suppress suppress just keep checking for suppress suppress is the one you want to find because if you find one ticking there is something wrong so the thing that keeps them from ticking is suppress sometimes fail to reveal the three that are suppressive in the extreme of course are suppress careful of and fail to reveal it isnt really terribly necessary to get all those in on all those ris but youre looking for something wrong with one of these ris and actually the thing that stands most in your road is its suppressed and you go all over that bank and everything youve found in it you go right on up that bank and you get the pc to assemble that bank and you work with the pc but youre trying to get that bank put together and youre trying to find out if anything ticks because if something ticks you got something wrong now take off at that point and do an analysis sheet lets find out if youve skipped an ri or this isnt the ri or theres missing ri you just found lock oryou see lets find out whats wrong at this point and lets straighten it out whatever it is wrong lets straighten it out and go on back up and the most usual action is to have left pair at the top or more than pair at the top two four six pairs at the top of gpm you might have that many pairs missing at the top you get into mischief so you want to check that over ouija board your meter you know the ouija board is something that the spirits are supposed to guide and it tells you the answers and spells out the name of the man youre going to marry and all this sort of thing good old 1890it was developed the same time as medical psychiatry and so forth has about the same degree of reliability but when i say ouija board your meter youll find some auditors doing this to the extreme you see are you is it you see theyre asking for the answers out of the meter and they sometimes ask the most unlikely things you know that meter never could tell them you see the data just isnt on file you see like are we going to have happy session you know but you can ask you can ask lot of questions you can ask enough questions of meter to find out actually whatever is wrong have you missed items have you done one wrong way to you know has an item been listed wrong way to anyway you just straighten up that bank add any additional items that you find in it assemble the whole thing make sure that extraneous items come from some other gpm you see make that just as neat as you please and youre going to just be blowing charge blowing charge blowing charge blowing charge all the time youre doing this so its quite worthwhile you see well you just clean that thing up and sweep the street man dont leave single shard or bit of glass or anything else around there just neat that up gorgeously go on downif you havent found your next goal find it repeat the same operation of course on your next gpm work from present time back never work from back to present time never go on the basis that if you just find the earliest item the earliest gpm the pcs going to be in beautiful condition because youre workingim afraid thats going to be too unreal and too upsetting and too out of line youll be crowding the pc into present time and none of the problems it solves have anything to do with his present time existence so youve left the totality of his present time restimulation sitting on his head while youre trying to run the hottest stuff that hes ever come near so thats serious mistake you must work from now to then never from then to now except of course when youre straightening up gpm you of course come back up the same gpm now when you make that real neat youll find out your needle gets awful awful awful floppy and the next moment that you get into the next and actual gpm your needle gets very stiff and the tone arm goes up and you have lots of trouble because now you of course have put the pc into viewpoint of seeing its there but not into any viewpoint from which he has really viewed it and hes now in trouble hes got somatics his neck hurts he wishes he hadnt quite started the session and he probably hasnt and you got most of your troubles all over again now working it that way you can cope with the idea that the earlier you get the mostmore savage these gpms are so your pc is in good condition all the way hes coming up in gradient sufficient to handle the degree of charge that there arethere is to be found on these things you work it the other way to and of course youre taking this little tiny pc whos gone way down scale and youre putting him back in great big cavern and he feels mighty timid about the whole thing you work it the other way to and youre going to find that your pc stays pretty happy all the way it doesnt take very long to run these providing you run them against tone arm action that youre very neat and you clean them all up all the way too the speed of doing it is proportional to the accuracy it is done withthe accuracy it is done with you have to keep working at it pocketapocketapocketa but if you start finding lock ris and you start listing items out of wrong gpms and this gpm youll find youll spend three sessions wishing to god you hadnt been such knucklehead as to make the mistake you made in the first place because you wont make any progress see actually the fastest way is the simplest way is the easiest way is the textbook way and the first moment that it doesnt run like that and so forth start bloodhounding the whole thing are we going to have happy session you know thank you very much 1 editors note per hcob 2 oct 63 gpms experimental process withdrawn technical bulletin volumes volume vii this process r4mta was cancelled
