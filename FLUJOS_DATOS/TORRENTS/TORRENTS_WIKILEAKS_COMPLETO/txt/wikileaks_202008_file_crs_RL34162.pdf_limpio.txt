fuels and electricity variety of funding tax incentives and regulatory policies have been enacted to support renewables as means for addressing concerns about energy security air pollution international competitiveness and climate change this report reviews the background for renewables and describes the current congressional debate budget and funding issues are key concerns the energy policy act of 2005 authorized several new renewable energy demonstration and deployment programs but most of them have not been funded further the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 authorized several new renewable energy programs that have not yet received appropriations the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 pl 110161 increased department of energy doe renewable energy funding by 314 million 7 the continuing appropriations resolution for fy2009 pl 110329 hr 2638 continues doe funding at the fy2008 level through march 6 2009 tax policies are also at issue the interaction of the federal renewable energy electricity production tax credit ptc with state renewable portfolio standard rps policies has forged strong incentive for wind energy development the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 division b hr 1424 extends the ptc for wind farms for one year three years for most other renewables through the end of 2009 provides 800 million for new category of clean renewable energy tax credit bonds and extends for eight years the 30 level for the business solar tax credit and the 30 residential solar tax credit further the law repeals nearly 177 billion in tax subsidies for oil and natural gas and reduces certain other financial incentives that will be used to offset the cost of the tax incentives for renewable energy 91 billion and energy efficiency 36 billion the ethanol fuel issue intensified for much of the 110 th congress corn ethanol production climbed rapidly but appeared to be causing food price increases concerns about rising food prices and apparent limits to the longterm potential for corn ethanol have brought focus on cellulosic ethanol cellulosic sources avoid many limits on corn and appear to have much lower net co 2 emissions but they require an extensive and costly conversion process pl 110140 set new renewable fuels standard rfs which starts at 90 billion gallons in 2008 and rises to 36 billion

depleted by human use such as the sun wind and water movement these primary sources of energy can be converted into heat electricity and mechanical energy in several ways there are some mature technologies for conversion of renewable energy such as hydropower biomass and waste combustion other conversion technologies such as wind turbines and photovoltaics are already well developed but they have not achieved the technological efficiency and market penetration that many expect they will ultimately reac h although geothermal energy is produced from geological rather than solar sources it is often included as renewable energy resource and is treated as such in this report commercial nuclear power is not generally considered to be renewable energy resource 1 despite fluctuating government policies since the 1970s combination of incentives and high energy prices has enabled wind energy to gain toehold in electric power markets and allowed ethanol to secure modest but growing presen ce in motor fuels markets congress is now debating whether to provide additional subsidies incentives and mandates to further expand renewable energy use this report describes the background and primary policy issue areas affecting renewable energy including budget and funding tax incentives electricity regulatory initiatives renewable fuels and climate change

renewable energy policies these policies included support for research and development rd technology demonstration projects and commercial deployment of equipment for renewable energy these policies included focus on the production of both liquid fuels and electricity g8g158g142g149g156g561g18g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 the energy tax act of 1978 established 4 cents per gallon excise tax exemption for ethanol blended into gasoline this incentive expired and was extended several times during the 1980s and 1990s in some cases the incentive was modified at the same time that it was extended 2 the energy policy act of 1992 extended the excise tax exemption and created tax deduction for cleanfuel vehicles that included those using 85 ethanol e85 it also established requirement that federal state and other vehicle fleets include growing percentage of alternativefueled vehicles including those using ethanol in 2000 the general accounting office gao 3 reported that the excise tax exemption and the alcohol fuel tax credits had been the most important incentives for renewable fuels4 by the time that the energy policy act of 2005 epact was enacted variety of tax grant loan and regulatory provisions had been established for renewable fuels this included some 17 programs spanning five agencies at present the major 1 for further definitions of renewable energy see the na

blends 1 dollar per gallon tax credit for agribiodiesel 50 cents per gallon for recycled biodiesel and the alternative motor vehicle tax credit5 however some believe that the renewable fuel standard rfs set by epact section 1501which requires that motor fu els contain increasing amounts of renewable fuel each year through 2012may now be the most important policy supporting renewable biofuels6

utilities to purchase electricity produced from renewable energy sources purpa also empowered the states to set the price for such purchases purpa aimed to reduce oil use for power production encourage the use of renewable energy for power production and to structure new dimension of competition to help keep electricity prices down in the early 1980s under the influence of purpa regulation convergence of federal and state policies launched commercial deployment of wind and solar energy in california in particular the development of early wind farms was driven mainly by combination of federal and state investment tax credits for wind energy as the new wind industry developed two emerging aspects stimulated further policy changes first some firms took advantage of the investment tax credits by capturing the tax benefits at the front end and leaving wind machines that operated poorly or not at all recognition of this problem eventually led to the creation of prod uctionoriented tax credit second in order to obtain third party financing wind farm developers needed to secure agreements for power purchases that fixed the price for longterm 10 years or more period this led the california public utility commission to promote the devel opment of standard offer contracts these contracts reduced investment risk established stable revenue streams and helped launch early wind farm developments oil and natural gas prices slumped during the mid1980s and declined more steeply in the late 1980s meanwhile congress let the residential solar investment tax credit expire in 1985 funding for department of energy doe rene wable energy rd programs also declined reaching low point in 1990 in late 1990 and early 1991 the persian gulf war reignited interest in renewable energy other nations notably japan and germany began to undertake more aggressive policies to subsidize renewables especially wind and solar technologies in the united states congress began to increase funding for the department of ener gy doe renewable energy rd program in 1992 the united states became signatory of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc this action forged new environmental motive for support of renewable energy these national interests were reflected in the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 for electricity this law made permanent the 10 business investment tax credit for solar and 5 the 2004 jobs bill pl 108311 revised and extended the excise tax exemption for ethanol and created the incentives for biodiesel fuel epact extended the ethanol and biodiesel incentives it also sunset the deduction for cleanfuel vehicles and created new credit for alternative motor vehicles for more details see crs report rl33572 biofuels incentives summary

production tax credit of 15 cents per kilowatthour kwh for wind farms and closedloop energy crop biomass climate change concerns spurred other industrialized nations to strengthen renewable energy policies and programs through the 1990s concern about global climate change became an increasingly important motive in the european union eu japan and other countries for raising renewable energy production goals and providing incentives to support commercial deployment the kyoto protocol set emission reduction targets for carbon dioxide co 2 and other greenhouse gases ghg after signing the protocol these nations intensified their efforts for commercial deployment of renewable energy in the united st ates concern about climate change was largely offset by concern about the potential effect of the kyoto co 2 emission reduction targets on economic growth and competitiveness as result of this economic concern the united states has taken more limited effort than many other industrialized nations to support renewable energy as strategy for addressing climate change the federal government has continued support for existing funding and subsidies however aside from the previously mentioned policies it has not established major new policies and programs like the feedin tariff in germany or the european unions target for producing 20 of its energy from renewables 7 state action on renewable energy has often supplanted federal action or created models for new federal policies as one example california has implemented very aggressive programs for renewable energy in the mid1990s the advent of electric industry restructuring led california state policymakers to create public goods charge on ratepayer electricity use part of the resulting revenue was used to fund renewable energy development and deployment programs also californias electricity shortages in 2000 and 2001 prompted the state to expand its renewable energy programs motivated by concern over climate change california has recently adopted more aggressive actions for renewables this includes 3 billion solar deployment initiative and an increase of its renewable portfolio standard to 33 of total electricity production by 2020 g3g140g157g146g152g151g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g343g343g342g157g145g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 economic and environmental concernsnamely energy

some incentives the primary issue was focused on house proposals to fully offset the estimated cost of the incentives by reducing other tax subsidies for example during the house floor debate over hr 535150 opponents argued that the proposed repeal of oil and natural gas subsidies 301 and 302 would raise gasoline prices and lead to higher energy costs generally further they contended that such repeal would cause decline in oil industry jobs also some opponents argued that the proposed 35 cap on the renewable energy production tax credit ptc would severely impair the ability of the credit to stimulate the development of new wind farms 51 proponents argued that the repeal would focus mainly on the five largest oil companies which have recently made historical recordbreaking profits and thus do not need the subsidies further they contended that the subsidies currently favor conventional fuels and that the bill would help to bring support into more equal ba lance proponents also argued that the incentives would spur the development of greater numbers of green jobs and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions 52 for more details about the proposed revenue offsets see crs report

coupled with rising energy costs rd advances and variety of state policies the ptc has stimulated significant growth in wind capacity over the past 10 years60 however the ptc expirations in 2000 2002 and 2004 caused annual capacity growth to fall sharply in those years by as much as 80 relative to the previous year after each expiration the ptc was reinstated for one to twoyear periods61 in 2005 one wind industry representative testified unfortunately two plus one plus one plus on does not necessarily equal five predictable years instead it represents not the sum total of years the credit has been in place but rather periods of uncertainty when new wind construction stopped jobs were eliminated and costs were driven up business thrives on the known and fails on the unknown the unpredictable nature of the credit has prevented the needed in vestment in usbased facilities that will drive economies of scale and efficiencies62 in 2007 one renewable energy analyst echoed this observation testifying that the frequent credit expiration and shortterm nature of reinstatements and extensions have led to several adverse impacts on wind industry growth the variability of the credit has caused the growing demand for wind power to be compressed into tight and frenzied windows of development this cycle of boomandbust has resulted in underinvestment in manufacturing capacity in the united states and variability in equipment and supply costs it may also have caused underinvestment in transmission planning and development further restricting growth 63 the american wind energy association has noted that the cycle of decline in wind industry activity actually starts about eight months before ptc expiration date64 representatives of the wind industry have testified that the cycle of peak manufacturing production demands followed by cutbacks would be eliminated if longterm ptc extension was in effect65 opponents of the ptc say that the credit was created to provide temporary economic assistance to help the renewable electricity production industry get started further they say that the ptc was not intended to be permanent subsidy despite 15 years of subsidies wind still apparently cannot compete without the ptc opponents note

natural gas the costs and risks of exploration for geothermal are as high or higher than those for the oil and gas industry and the ability to attract financing is far more difficult once resource is verified permitting and construction can take three to five years or more since 1992 there has been very limited development of new geothermal facilities67 in 2005 epact increased the amount of the ptc available to geothermal facilities from half to full credit however the ptcs short windows of availability have made the credit largely ineffective as an incentive for the geothermal industry industry representatives have noted that the largest projects may not go forward because they face unacceptable risks trying to meet the rigid deadline or to avoid taking an allornothing gamble on future extensions of the credit68 the geothermal industry says ptc extension of 10 years or more could be sufficient to stimulate higher level of sustained industry growth69 representatives of biomass hydropower and landfill gas industries say their facilities are more like geothermal facilities than wind machines and thus also require longerterm ptc period in 2005 testimony eia offered similar observation shortterm extensions of the ptc are likely to have limited impact on qualifying technologies like biomass and geothermal which have relatively long development periods even if the credit were large enough to make them economical 70 the ptc has been even less valuable for so lar energy equipment most solar electricity equipment comes as small widely distributed units that are designed mainly for onsite use not for power sales to the grid 71 these aspects make the ptc less valuable for solar than the business and residential investment tax credits itc72 due to rules against multiple tax credit use solar equipment cannot qualify for both the ptc and itc and so owners must choose one or the other representatives of the solar industry have indicated clear preference for itc over

growth in energy production and it has caused the us wind industry to become more dependent on european equipment due to stronger european requirements for renewables 77 despite these problems wind has been the main beneficiary of the credit related issue is that the ptc has not been effective at stimulating the development of other renewable energy facilities which generally need longer period of credit availability the main proposal to address the variable impact on wind and the lack of impact on other renewables is the enactment of longerterm ptc extension the wind industry prefers an extension of five years or more on occasion the ptc has been expanded to include broader range of renewable energy resources this credit design issue surfaced in the 110 th congress as it addressed the question of whether the credit should be expanded to include production from equipment that uses marine energy tidal wave and ocean thermal resources and hydrokinetic river current resources pl

would also be the best way to encourage baseload renewables such as geothermal and biomass such an extension it said would provide longterm certainty to utilities independent project developers and manufacturers to address budgetrelated cost concerns for ptc extension midamerican suggested that longterm extens ion could be coupled with gradual phasedown of the credit to 15 centskwh alternatively if the credit extension were set at something less than five years midamerican proposed that conditional second deadline could be set up that would extend the placedinservice eligibility period that extension would require an offsetting reduction in the credit period the length of time over which credit claims could be filed the conditions required for an extension to secondary placedinservice deadline are that the project must be under construction and have signed power sales contracts before the initial credit expiration date and it must bring the project online before the secondary placedinservice deadline for example if the secondary deadline were set as one year past the initial placedin service deadline project that met those conditions would be eligible to receive the credit

argued that the ptc is merited because it corrects market failure by providing economic value for the environmental benefits of clean energy sources that emit less in many cases far less air pollutants and co 2 than conventional energy equipment also they contended that it helps level the playing field noting that there is an even longer history of federal subsidies for conventional energy87 for example they point to the permanent depletion allowance for oil and natural gas that has been in place for many decades88 opponents of extending the ptc beyond the end of 2008 argued that generally there are market failures that warrant special tax subsidies for particular types of renewable energy technologies they argued further that subsidies generally distort the free market and that renewables should not get special treatment that exempts them from this principle also regarding the concern about the environmental problems of dirty conventional energy sources they contended that the most costeffective economic policy is to put tax on the pollution from energy sources and let the free market make the necessary adjustments another argument against the ptc was that much renewable energy production particularly from wind and solar equipment has fluctuating nature that makes it less valuable than energy produced by conventional facilities 89 at senate hearing in february 2007 energy secretary bodman testified that the administration was unlikely to support fiveyear or 10year ptc extension because it would not be consistent with free markets90 consistent with that stance the administrations fy2008 budget request did 87 federal subsidies for conventional energy resources nd technologies and for electric power facilities including large hydroelectric power

proceeds two years less than the previous fiveyear period for crebs second the tax credit rate will be lower set at 70 of the previous rate for crebs106 third taxpayers can carry forward unused credits into future years fourth the tax credit benefits can be separated from bond ownership 107 national limit of 800 million was set for new crebs of which onethird will be available for state local and tribal governments onethird for public power providers and onethird for cooperative electric companies the revenue drain on the us treasury is estimated at total of 267 million over the period from 2009 through 2018108 the administration repeatedly stated its opposition to the new crebs that the house approved in the first session hr 3221 and the house version of hr 6 and in the second session hr 5351 and hr 6049109 for example it contended that the crebs are expensive and high ly inefficient and that new crebs would be inconsistent with the federal credit reform act of 1990 andor unduly constrain the administrations ability to effectively manage federal credit programs110 proponents of the new crebs counterargue that the ne w crebs would help limit the environmental consequences of continued reliance on power generated using fossil fuels the taxcredit bonds they argue can attract investment from taxpayers that are unable to benefit from tax credits 111 continued

the renewable energy electricity production tax credit ptc is the single most important form of federal support for state rps policies the ptc can buydown the cost of renewable energy by about 20mwh

countered by citing an eia study that examined the potential impacts of the 15 rps proposed in samdt 1537 it indicated that th south has sufficient biomass generation both from dedicated biomass plants and existing coal plan ts cofiring with biomass fuel to meet 15 rps eia noted further that the estimated net rps requirement for the south would not make it unusually dependent on other regions and was in fact below the national average requirement regarding electricity prices eia estimated that the 15 rps would likely raise retail prices by slightly less than 1 over the 2005 to 2030 period further the rps would likely cause retail natural gas prices to fall slightly over that period in house floor action on hr 3221 an rps amendm ent hamdt 748 was added by vote of 220 to 190 the bill

key points and counterpoints of the senate debate were repeated on the house floor rps opponents also contended that biomass power technologies were not yet ready for commercial use and that certain

displaces petroleum imports thus improving energy security they further contend that its use can lead to lower emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases especially if higherpercentage blends are used opponents argue that various federal and state incentives for ethanol distort the market and provide corporate welfare for corn growers and ethanol producers further they assert that the

percentage of renewable energy substitution can depend on many factors including energy prices energy demand growth142 technology cost and market penetration as renewable energy production displaces fossil fuel use it would also reduce co 2 emissions in direct proportion except perhaps for biofuels and biopower143 in general the combustion of biomass for fuel and power production releases co 2 at an intensity that may be close to that for natural gas however the regrowth of biomass material which absorbs co 2 often offsets this release hence net emissions occur only when combustion is based on deforestation in closed loop syst em biomass combustion is based on rotating energy crops there is net co 2 release unless fertilizer is used and any fossil fuel displacement including decreased natural gas use would tend to reduce co 2 emissions g21g158g153g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g20g142g151g142g160g138g139g149g142g156g561g157g152g561g5g158g155g139g561g5g17 g344g561 since 1988
