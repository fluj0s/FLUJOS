activations of standby emergency authority remained acceptable practice until the era of the vietnam war growing public and congressional displeasure with the presidents exercise of his war powers and deepening us involvement in hostilities in vietnam prompted interest in variety of related matters senator charles mathias together with senator frank church sought to establish senate special committee to study administration reliance on 1950 proclamation of national emergency to prosecute the vietnam war initially chartered in june 1972 with mathias and church as cochairmen the study panel subsequently produced various studies and assessments3 among other discoveries the committee after reviewing the united states code and uncodified emergency powers statutes identified 470 provisions of federal law that delegated extraordinary authority to the executive in time of national emergency it also found that there was process for automatically terminating outstanding national emergency proclamations thus the panel began developing legislation containing formula for regulating emergency declarations in the future and otherwise adjusting the body of statutorily delegated emergency powers by abolishing some provisions relegating others to permanent status and continuing others in standby capacity its final report offering findings and recommendations was issued in may 19764 the national emergencies act as early as july 1974 the special committee had unanimously recommended legislation establishing procedure for presidential declaration and congressional regulation

these generally returned all standby statutory delegations of emergency power activated by an outstanding declaration of national emergency to dormant state two years after the statutes approval however the act did not cancel outstanding 1933 1950 1970 and 1971 national emergency proclamations because these were issued by the president pursuant to his article ii constitutional authority nevertheless it did render them ineffective by returning to dormancy the statutory authorities they had activated thereby necessitating new declaration to activate standby statutory emergency authorities title ii provided procedure for future declarations of national emergency by the president and prescribed arrangements for their congressional regulation the statute established an exclusive means for declaring national emergency furthermore emergency declarations were to terminate automatically after one year unless formally continued for another year by the president but could be terminated earlier by either the president or congress originally the prescribed method for congressional termination of declared national emergency was concurrent resolution adopted by both houses of congress this type of socalled legislative veto was effectively invalidated by the supreme court in 19836 the national emergencies act was amended in 1985 to substitute joint resolution as the vehicle for rescinding national emergency declaration7 when declaring national emergency the president must indicate according to title iii the powers and authorities being activated to respond to the exigency at hand recent crs compilation identifies almost 160 provisions of law that may be activated by an emergency proclamation8 they include authority to prosecute and punish anyone who willfully makes or conspires to make defective war material 18 usc 2154 to waive the written application requirement for radio station licenses and renewals 47 usc 308 to release national defense stockpile
