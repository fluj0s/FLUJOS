dianetics date how do you change beingness so what your preclear desires is change now if youve got any pen there that writes fire you might write these words down in fire because theyre very important you are trying to effect change in the communication level of your preclear youre trying to effect change in the communication level of your preclear because thats the only way he ever finds out hes being something is with communication so then basically not very runnable except in one technique youre trying to change beingness and when you say auditing you can run right in with it change beingness now how do you change beingness the only way you can really change beingness is to change the level of communication of the individual because his beingness awareness his awareness of being or his awareness of trying to be depends utterly upon his ability to communicate l ron hubbard this excerpt has been taken from the the factors admiration the renaissance of beingness lectures invalidation vs validation an article by l ron hubbard we said long time ago the auditor must not evaluate for the preclear well that obviously tells you by the way that was derived from experience and that tells you immediately that one of the worst aberrations that you could have on the track would be evaluation and it is and then we found out that the this is empirical you see just studying large numbers of preclears being audited we find out that the other one was invalidation the auditor mustnt invalidate the preclear and if he invalidated the preclear bad bad news bad news right away so lets just take those right there at the beginning and lets look at the auditors code and lets realize that in the auditors code there are really only two important shuns invalidation and evaluation and knowing there are two important shuns it tells you immediately how to drive man mad doesnt it how do put somebody under control well you evaluate for him and you invalidate him so whats the backbone of the aberration then in terms of thought more or less wed have invalidation and evaluation now lets turn these two over and then look and see if we find there are two things that add up to sanity well if evaluation is bad then evaluation would be the reverse of that so weve got evaluation sitting up there as sanity and if invalidation is bad then validation would wipe things out wouldnt it or it would be good and sure enough what you tend to validate with preclear works out to be what he becomes thats very fascinating l ron hubbard from the lecture review of dianetics scientology and
