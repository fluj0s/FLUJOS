proposals to reduce marriage tax penalties have received attention an increase in the joint return standard deduction is included in hr 4579 passed by the house on september 26 the administration has proposed an increase in the child care credit number of bills have been intr oduced as well current law and proposed changes are addressed with respect to their effects on equity efficiency and administrative feasibility using an abilitytopay standard in determining at what incomes families of different sizes are equal the current tax rules favor large families across most of the income scale because of the more ge nerous treatment of families with children under the earned income tax credit eitc and the recently enacted child credits married couples with one earner also benef it because the imputed value of spouses services in the home is not taxed work ing couples and heads of households with children also benefit from child care credits essentially these features establish single individuals and childless working c ouples as paying the highest tax rates based on the abilitytopay standard for all but the very highest income taxpayers two distortions of particular concern to family taxation are the effects on marriage and the burden the tax system im poses on the earnings of married women who are estimated to be the most sensitive in their labor participation decisions the size and extent of marriage pe nalties and bonuses pend on assumptions made about splitting unearned income and deductions and particularly about the allocation of children if assignment is typical of what is more likely to occur when couples have children without marrying or if they divorce with children assigned to the mother who has the lower earnings 37 of couples have penalties of 24 billion and 60 have bonuses of 73 billion for net bonus of 49 billion if children are assigned in way to minimize taxes as assumed by the cbo in its base case for studying tax revisions 43 of joint retu rns had penalties of 32 billion and 52 had bonuses of 43 billion for net bonus of 10 billion approaches to addressing the marriage penalty include optional separate filing general reductions in tax ra tes for joint returns and second earner deductions the first approach targets benefits to returns with penalties and to earnings of married women although it might be complicated nd will differentiate taxes among married couples with the same income second earner deduction has similar characteristics although it is less targeted to penalties it is also flex ible and relatively simple reducing joint return tax rates will be simple and keep rates the same for all married couples but does not perform very well on equity and efficiency grounds most of these approaches favor higher income taxpayers however there are some options including those focusing on the eitc th at would favor lower income taxpayers the desirability of larger child care cr edits and of refunda ble credits depends on ones philosophy about family needs and equity there is little justification on equity grounds for proposed credits for athom parents in general the current tax system appears to make highly generous adjustments for childrenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653contents introduction 1 development of current tax treatment of the family 4 pe r so n l xe mp tio n s ch ild cr d its 4 sta n d r d d d u

singles marry is the subject of several tax cut pr oposals marriage can also result in tax bonus when the couples income shares are uneven proposal s include permitting married couples to file as singles decreas ing tax burdens for all married couples and allowing special deduction for the seconda ry earner the first of these proposals can be found in hr 2456 weller and mc intosh and other bills several bills would simply reduce simply tax burdens on married couples for example hr 3104 riley and hr 3734 weller mcintosh riley and herger which would reduce marriage penalties but which would also expand bonuses this approach has been included in the current tax proposal pa ssed by the house on september 26 hr 4579 this bill would make th standard deduction for joint returns twice those for single returns third set of proposals is for second earner deduction as in hr 2593 herger and kennelly the marriage penalty cannot be eas ily addressed because we cannot simultaneously achieve three apparently desired income tax objectives progressive tax marriage neutral tax and equal treatment of c ouples with the same total incomes but with different income shares currently our system is progressive and taxes couples with the same income at the same rates but cont ains marriage penalties and bonuses however the issue of quity goes beyond the issue of different treatment of couples with the same income and cerns all families single individuals will be referred to in this report as families according to early tax data for 19961 out of 111 million returns filed only 44 million about 40 are joint returns of married couples small numbe r of which are surviving spouses who are allowed to file joint returns for two year s single returns account for 44 and head of household returns families w ith children or other dependents headed by single person account for 14 the remaining 2 are married persons filing separate returns in fact the marriage penalty came into being in 1969 because of the enactment of tax cut for singles who complained that their taxes were too high any reduction of marriage penalty through lower rates for all joint returns could also be characterized as increasing the penalty for being single since data indicate that more than half of married couples receive bonuses rather than penalties to not consider equity between sing and married coupl in addressing family tax issues is to ignore large fraction of taxpayers therefore this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs2 2see for example reclaiming the tax code for american

legislative proposals interest in these issues of tax treatment of the family has been ongoing the marriage penalty has been an issue almo st since it was created in 1969 and for several years there was secondearner deduction the tax reform act of 1986 which broadened the ba and lowered tax rates incl uded repeal of this deduction in part because the marriage penalty was deemed to be less important with the less steeply graduated rate structure legislative changes since that time however increased the importance of marriage for tax burdens the effect of marriage on tax liability was exacerbated by the higher tax rates introduced in 1993 at the top of the income distribution and by the expansion of the earned income tax cr edit eitc at the bottom end marriage penalties occur because income is aggregat ed and forced into higher tax brackets upon marriage in the case of the ei tc penalties can occur because larger aggregated incomes cause loss of the cred it through income phaseouts bonuses however occur when one of the spouses has small income relative to the other or at the extreme income marriage to nonworking spouse results in larger standard deductions and dditional personal exemptions it can also increase the amount taxed at lower rates because the rate brackets are wider it can make single individual eligible for larger eitc if he or she marries person with children but with little or earnings the house republican contract with america in 1994 proposed reduction in the marriage penalty although sp ecific mechanism was not set out benefits for children have also been the focus of attention for some time in 1991 several proposals were ma to allow child credit or increased personal exemption in order to specifically target ta x relief to larger families in part because the tax burden was argued to have become increasingly burdensome on large families as personal exemptions failed to grow with inflation and income2 this shift washttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs3 3an earlier paper by steuerle documented the increased tax burden on large families prior to the 1986 act see eugene steuerle the tax treatment of households of different size taxing the family ed rudolph g penner washington american enterprise institute for public policy research 1983even greater prior to the 1986 tax reform act which increased personal exemptions substantially3 the proposals in 1991 for refundable credit had nuances beyond the progressivity of the tax system itself since it would have used the tax system to provide direct cash benefits for verylowincome families the design of these proposals was also motivated by the concerns about disincentives in the current tax and welfare system to marry and work per child credit was also proposed in the house republican contract with ameri ca in 1994 in 1997 the taxpayers relief act adopted an additional per child cred it of 500 for children under 17 this credit was partly refundable agains t payroll taxes for families w ith three or more children while generally refundable child cred it was not adopted the eitc which is refundable was expanded s ubstantially in 1993 its rates are much greater for families with children with an even higher rate allowed for families with two or more children these changes also altered the landscape for considering family taxation in the broader sense of family size new work requirements in the welfare system have also made the issue of child care more of concern although child care assistance for low income individuals may be addressed throug h spending programs rather than tax benefits the tax system also contains variety of phaseouts for ta x benefits including personal exemptions and child credits phaseouts were adopted to increase the progressivity of the tax system and direct benefits to lower income individuals however once personal exemptions and credits are phased out there is differential between the tax paid by large and small families an alternative to phaseouts is more graduated rates which would maintain an adjustment in tax liability for family size this analysis provides framework for evaluating the efficiency equity and administrative issues posed by the current and proposed tax provi sions affecting the treatment of families with different characteristics the next section of the paper summarize s the development of the current tax system and the features which affect tax differentials across family type the next section discusses distributional effects and equity concentrating primarily on horizontal equity issues the following s ection uses one of these horizontal equity principles abilitytopay as framework for examining the present tax differentials across families including the marriage penalty and bonus the next two sections briefly discuss efficiency issues and s implicity the final section examines various tax proposals including alternative ways of addressing the ma rriage penalty and of providing further relief for childre n through the child care credit development of current tax treatment of the familyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs4 current federal income tax law differentiates among families by type and structure in several ways this differe ntiation has changed considerably over the years and includes personal exemptions standard deductions rate schedules and various other features such as child car credits age exemptions and earnedincome credits personal exemptions child credits personal exemptions allow certain am ount per person to be exempt from tax combined with standard deductions which vary by family type they exclude minimum level of income from tax in 1986 these combined amounts were roughly set at the poverty level pe rsonal exemptions can also pl ay part in marriage bonuses when only one spouse works single individual cannot claim an unmarried companion as dependent while husba nd can claim wife and vice versa the tax laws have always allowed some relief for family size through exemptions although the original 1913 act allowed deductions only for the individual taxpayer 3000 and spouse 1000 these amounts were very large relative to incomes but the initial income tax was not intended to r each broad group of individuals even when depende nt exemptions were allowed in 1917 they were only 200 small relative to the basic ex emptions the practice of allowing an equal exemption for each family mber began in the early 1940s personal exemptions were reduced in the initial years of the tax then increased then reduced again they were last reduced in the early 1940s the real value of the exemptions was also affected by infla tion for example the personal exemption remained constant at 600 from 1948 throug h 1969 while its real value was heavily eroded through inflation it was gradua lly increased over the next ten years to 1000 where it again remained constant until 1985 from 1948 through 1984 the personal exemption lost 63 of its purch asing power even the increase to 2000 in 1986 was insufficient to restore its 1948 valu its real value still fell by 38 the exemption has been indexe d for inflation since 1986 in large part due to diminution of the r eal value of personal exemptions the tax burden had shifted over time to fall more heavily on larger families this effect was changed dramatically by the adoption of the 500 child credits in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 in the cases where these credits apply for children under 17 they cause the personal exemption plus the deduction equivalent of the credit to be 57 larger than its 1948 value for families in the 15 rate bracket and 16 larger for families in the 28 bracket the credit is not however indexed for inflation standard deduction or flat exclusion standard deductions which va ry across the types of returns single joint and head of household also affect tax burdens across families th standard deduction for singles and heads of household are 60 nd 80 respectively of the size of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs5 4in general floors and ceilings for standard deductions for joint returns were halved for married couples filing separate returns 5in 1997 the personal exemption was 2650 and the standard deduction 6900 for total of 17500 the exempt allowance in 1948 was 2667 600 times 4 divided by 9 if the 1948 levels had kept pace with the gnp deflator the total amount would be 16976 deduction for joint returns the standa rd deduction can contribute to marriage penalty four example two singles who both work and marry will have smaller combined deduction it can also contribut to marriage bonus if there is only one earner in the couple since the joint deduc tion is larger than the single deduction virtually from its inception the tax law llowed deductions for taxes interest charitable contributions and certain othe r personal expenses in 1944 standard deduction of 10 of adjusted gross income with ceiling of 500 was allowed as substitute for these itemized deductions4 major reason for this exemption was to reduce the number of itemizers and make tax filing less complex in 1964 minimum standard deduction of 200 plus 100 for each exemption with 1000 ceiling was added beginning in 1969 thes standard deductions were increased substantially the percenta ge standard deduction was gradually increased to 16 and the ceiling increased to 2000 lowincome allowance of 1100 to be reduced by 50 in each of the next two years was substituted for the minimum standard deduction these re ductions were included because of the rise in the personal exemption that was increasing total exempt amounts the low income allowance was increased to 1300 in 1972 in 1975 the lowincome allowance was once again differentiated but based on family type joint head of household single rather than size joint returns received 2100 allowance by 1976 the ceiling on th percentage standard deduction was also differentiated by family type and was raised to 2800 for joint returns by 1976 in 1977 the lowincome allowance and th percentage standard deduction were consolidated into single flat allowan ce called the zerobracket amount which was set at 3200 in 1977 and at 3400 in 1978 this zerobracket amount was indexed in 1981 so that it would rise with inflati on the tax reform act of 1986 raised the flat deduction amount but continued to diffe rentiate it with resp ect to family status but not family size in comparing the relative benefits over time it is important to consider the changes in all flat allowances as well not just the personal exemption for example prior to the 1997 changes and thus ignoring the child credit while the real value of the personal exemption has declined bout 38 since 1948 the exempt amount for family of four joint return was very close to the exempt amount had 1948 values been indexed for inflation using the gnp deflator5 indeed current levels are about 3 larger than those which would have occurred had the exempt level in 1948 been indexed smaller families have more generous exempt levels today while larger ones have less gener ous levels for example again ignoring the child credit exempt allowances are larger in real terms today for singles 60 larger for heads of households with two or three family members 34 larger and 10 larger and for joint returns with two three or f our family members 44 17 and 3 larger respectively real levels are smaller th an in 1948 for heads of household with fourhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs6 6 the itemized deduction phaseout range which is indexed for inflation is projected to begin at about 125000 for 1998 the personal exem ption phaseout which is also indexed varies by type of return but should begi n at about 125000 for singles the 36 rate begins at 155000 of taxable income and the 396 rate begins at 278000 of taxable income child credits will begin to phase out at about 75000 for head of household returns and 110000 for joint returns these higher tax rates tended to exacerbate the problems of the marriage penalty and also meant that persona l exemptions are eventually eliminated for very high income taxpayers so that families of different sizes would not have different tax burdens at these incomes 7internal revenue service statistics of income bulletin fall 1997 washington dc us government printing office 1997 p 22 or more family members 2 for fourperson family 9 for fiveperson family and 14 for sixperson family they are also smaller for jointreturn families with five and six family members 5 and 10 respectively heads of household and joint returns with children eligible for the child credit however have greater exempt levels fo r joint returns assuming that additional members are eligible childre n causes all of them to have increased exempt amount equivalents between 40 and 44 higher than in 1948 for heads of households all families are better off an increase of 73 for family of two 63 for family of three 56 for family of four and 54 for family of five note however that changes in benefits compared to past levels do not necessarily have implications for the appropriate treatment of different families if past family differentiation was not due to theory about equitable treatment of differing families there is economic reason that current tax treatment s hould conform to any past standards rate structure two important aspects of the rate stru cture are the unit of taxation and the progressivity of the rate structure that is how tax rates rise as increments of income increase today rates are imposed at 15 28 31 36 and 396 and taxes are imposed on family units married c ouples cannot use the single rate schedules although they can file sepa rately through with rate structure that offers advantage over joint filing significant majority of taxpayers are subject to rates of 15 and most have income s that are taxed higher than 31 the width of the brackets is greatest for joint returns and smallest for singles the points at which the 28 and 31 rates are reached for single returns are 60 as large as for joint returns the 36 bracket for singles is reached at point 82 as large for heads of household the 28 31 and 36 brackets are reached at points 80 85 and 91 the size of those for joint returns the 396 rate is reached at the same taxable income level for all returns there are also phaseouts of itemized deductions personal exemptions and child credits at very high income levels6 however the higher rates and the phaseouts apply to onl small fraction of taxpayers less than five of taxpayers had adjusted gross income over 100000 in 19957 in the original 1913 tax law single rate structure was applied to all taxpayers as individuals in 1948 joint returns were allowed that effec tively permitted incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs7 8although there were two statutory rate bracke ts after 1986 15 percent and 28 percent there was also surcharge that was designed to phase out the benefits of the 15 percent rate and the personal exemptions for high income taxpa yers this surcharge effectively increased the tax rate by 5 percentage points to 33 percent and created bubble rates were 15 percent then 28 percent then 33 percen t and then fell back to 28 percent splitting this change had little to do with any theory regarding the tax treatment of the family rather it occurred because marri ed couples in community property states were successfully claiming the right to divide their income evenly for tax purposes under graduated rate structure this incomesplitting reduces the total tax burden by reducing the amount of income subj ect to higher rates incomesp litting was adopted to equalize treatment across the states and to forestall major taxinduced disruption in state property laws this move created the familiar joint and single returns both the community property treatment and the legislated incomesplitting resulted in tax subsidy for marriage individuals who married would experience lower tax liabilities due to the rate structure as long as their incomes were unequal shortly after in 1951 headofhousehol d schedule for unmarried taxpayers with dependents was introduced which allowed half the benefits from income splitting ie wider tax brackets this treatment could in theory create marriage penalty for families with children although this poi nt received virtually attention criticism from singles arguing that thei r taxes were too high led in 1969 to singles rate schedule with wider brackets this difference in rate schedules however also created marriage penalty for certain types of families including those without children if both spouses worked tax b ills could increase with marriage many people were uncomfortable with tax pr ovision which encouraged couples to live together without benefit of matrimony coupled w ith increasing female labor participation and changing social structure the marriage penalty created considerable concern for this reason capped deduction for the secondary earner in family was adopted in 1981 the pr ovision allowed ten of income to be deducted subject to cap of 3000 this deduction was an imperfect device which partly alleviated the problem of the marri age penalty and for individuals below the cap reduced the marginal tax rate on the s econdary worker it was repealed in 1986 when the flatter rate structure caused the marriage penalty to be less severe the marriage penalty was increased for very hi gh income individuals in 1993 with the addition of higher tax rates these changes affected however only very small fraction of the population the degree of progression in the rate structure interacts to affect the tax burden that applies to taxpayers in different circumstances the rate structure has varied significantly over time but major revisi on in the 1986 act reduced the brackets to two 15 and 28 as well as lowering the t op bracket certain be nefits were phased out in 1990 the bubble due to these phase outs was eliminated in exchange for adding new tax rate of 31 8 capital gains were held to 28 rate however personal exemptions were still phased out itemized deductions were also phased out on temporary basis at three of agi since itemized deductions tend to rise with income faster than the reductions due to the phaseout this phaseout is the equivalent of increasing taxable income by 3 and an additi onal percentage point or so in tax each dollar of adjusted gross income taxed leads to reduction inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs8 deductions of 003 and if the marginal tax rate is around third then the additional tax per dollar of income is around 001 in 1993 two marginal tax rates were added at the upper income levels 36 nd 396 this legisla tion made the itemized deduction and personal exempti on phaseouts permanent earned income tax credit eitc the earned income tax credit eitc is refundable credit or negative tax that provides wage subsidy for low income working individuals the credit is percentage of earned income which reach maximum fixed amount and then is eventually phased out the cred it rates are currently 765 for fa milies wit hout children 34 for families with one child and 40 for families with two children the phaseout levels are higher for fa milies with children than for those without children in 1997 the credit reached its maximum value of 332 for families with children at an income of 4300 the credit is phased out at incomes between 5440 and 9770 for families with one ch ild the maximum credit of 2210 is reached at 6500 the credit is phased out between 11950 and 25800 for families with two or more children th maximum credit of 3656 is reached at 9100 and is phased out between 11960 and 29290 unlike some other provisions there is differentiation by family type rather the differences depend on the presence of one two or children the eitc plays role in creating marriage penalty for lower income families if individuals with low earnings marry the couples higher comb ined income may phase out more of the earned income tax credit at the same time marriage can reduce taxes if single individual marries someone w ith children but with little or income because he or she becomes eligible for the larger credit for families with children the earned income tax credit eitc wa s first enacted in 1975 this provision provided refundable tax cred it for ten of earned income phased out at rate of ten of income over 4000 because the credit was refundable individuals who paid income tax were nevertheless eligible for benefit there were variety of rationales for the eitc to provide work incentive to offset the social security tax burden and to provide relief for recent price increases in food and fuel the credit was however only allowed to indivi duals who maintained household for dependent children thus like the major welfare program afdc aid to families with dependent children the eitc as originally enacted was not extended to singles and childless couples the eitc has been revised in various ways and in 1990 was differentiated with respect to number of children in 1993 the credits were increased substantially and small credit was added fo r families without children child or dependent care credit another provision allows for credits for paid child care expenses for children under 13 and disabled dependent s deduction for these costs was first allowed in 1954 and converted to credit in 1976 the cr edit is 30 of eligible expenses but is phased down to twenty as inco rises from 10000 to 28000 eligiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs9 9this concept may unfamiliar particularly to readers who think of spouses working at home as making monetary sacrifice perhaps to st ay with their children while their income is smaller they save the taxes that would have been paid on outside earnings however these spouses do not give up all of their income since there are cost savings as in lower child care payments or not having to pay for other services eg dry cleaning household help it is this value that provides benefit to oneearner families and is the imputed income not subject to tax expenses are limited to 2400 for one chil d and 4800 for two or more children the credit is available only to single pare nts or married couples where both parents work and is limited to the smaller earned income it is not indexed other provisions in addition to these basic provisions rate structures personal exemptions standard allowances and creditsseveral other provisions related to family structure are summarized here first there are specific provisions that relate to family structure or characteristics there are additional standard deductions for elderly and blind taxpayers provisions that give little benefit to high income individuals who tend to itemize deductions in addition ther is 15 tax credit for the elderly and disabled that is phased out since the base for the credit is offset by social security it tends to benefit elderly and disabled indi viduals who do not receive social security another explicit family tax provision adopt ed in 1986 is the kiddie tax which taxes unearned income of children unde r 14 at the parents tax rate one might add variety of exclusions some social security benefits welfare payments inkind benefits employer provi ded child care and deductions or credits medical expenses educational expenses which benefit families of certain income levels characteristics moreover since the tax law does apply to certain imputed income families who prefer owneroccupied homes or inhome provision of goods and services or the consumption of isure over other goods have greater tax benefits these benefits are in some cases associated with family characteristics for example families with higher incomes and at certain ages are more likely to live in owneroccupied homes oneearner marri ed couples benefit from the services provided in the home by the nonworking spouse which are not subject to tax9 finally the payroll tax can alter the relative net tax burden between different types of families with consequences that could matter for concerns of equity and efficiency such as work choice the soci security system may confer marriage bonus that can increase the implicit tax on wo rk effort for sec ond earners spouses receive benefit without n ecessarily paying any payroll taxes of their own second earner spouse pays additional social security taxes but his or he r benefit is only the net of benefit based on the individua l earnings record and the benefit for spousesand this amount may not be positive that is the spouses benefit based on the partners earning record may be be tter than the benefit spouse receives on his or her own earnings record and there is therefore return to payroll taxes paid thus the net tax on second earner spouse is effectively larger than it would be in the absence of benefit for spouses since little or additional be nefits occur as result of those payments there are also implicit taxes that affect behavior in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs10 10progressivity in the tax system is typically based on an equal sacrifice notion and the notion that dollar to poor person is much more valuable than dollar to the wealthy person these theories do not easily pin down the desired degree of progressivity however 11see gregg esenwein the size and distribution of the federal tax burden 19501995 crs report 96386 april 30 1996 tax rates at th top first fell with the tax cuts in the 1980s and then rose largely because of the higher tax rates in 1993 these numbers do not take into account the effects of the 1997 tax cuts which had benefits for higher income individuals because of the capital gains tax cuts as well as variety of other provisions that benefitted middle and uppermiddle income individualstransfer system where increases in income through work or marriage may cause reduction in benefits thereby discouraging these behaviors equity and distributional issues tax proposals can be evaluated on many grounds but one issue is that of fairness this issue of fa irness can involve two elements vertical equity or the equity of changes in tax burdens as income rises for an otherwise identical family and horizontal equity or how taxes should be fairly differen tiated between families of different sizes and structures this analysis focuses primarily on the issue of horizontal equity since this is an issue which can be addressed in more analytical framework we first however briefly discuss the issue of vertical equity vertical equity different tax revisions can ve very different distribu tional effects for high and low income taxpayers because the desire d degree of redistribution cannot be easily established issues of ver tical equity involve value judgments to considerable degree10 by and large the overall distribution of the tax system has not changed very much in the last twenty years alt hough there have been fluctuations at the bottom and the top of the income distribu tion and generally lower burden at the lower end of the distribution due to the earned income tax credits which have more than offset growth in payroll taxes11 how different tax revisions affect the progressivity of the income tax depends on several factors first significant fraction of taxpayers do not have income tax liability positive income taxes do not apply in mo st cases until individuals are above the poverty line in the tax reform ac t of 1986 the combination of standard deductions and personal exemptions were t to roughly approximate the poverty line the income levels above which families of different si zes are not considered poor the allowances for single individuals are clearly below the poverty line the addition of the child credit means that ta xpayers with qualifying children well above the poverty line would not be subject to ta x these taxpayers would not be affected by tax cut httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs11 an exception is when tax cuts are refunda ble an expansion of the eitc which is refundable credit or negative tax w ould affect low income individuals other tax credits can also be made explicitly re fundable as has been proposed for the child care credit in some bills certain types of revisions tend to be nefit higher income individuals while others tend to provide little be nefit to that group for example widening the joint rate brackets as is proposed in some pl ans would tend to benefit higher income individuals who are affected by the higher rates higher income individuals are also more likely to itemize deductions and changes which increase the standard deduction will tend to focus more benefits to moderate income taxpayers than high income ones similarly expansions of benefits that are phased out such as the personal exemptions and child credits w ould not benefit high income individuals horizontal equity horizontal equity has to do with equal treatment of equals for the income tax this standard might mean that families of th same size with th same income should pay the same tax but it c ould also be taken to mean that two individuals with the same income should pay the same tax in progressive tax system these two standards can be incompa tible and indeed this incompatibility causes marriage penalties and bonuses in system where the family is the tax unit thus the basic challenge of assessing standa rds of horizontal equity is to determine how to treat different taxpayers equitably first we review the economic principles which could be used in that assessment second we consider in further detail the abilitytopay concept which seems most consistent with the equalsacrifice principles of horizontal equity as the recent history of the tax law suggests and the following discussion reveals tax policy has not generally been gu ided by consistent theory of fairness or equity across different types of families indeed it is clear that many of the structural changes in the treatment of the family were haphazard income splitting perhaps one of the most important aspects of family ta x differentials was dopted in reaction to legal situation other changes were cont emporary reactions to set of complaints or concerns about behavioral response suc h as the singles rate schedule or attempts to fix the marriage penalty theories of equitable taxation for taxation purposes there are two fundamental attributes of fa milies the type of head married couple or single individual and the size families can be composed of single persons single parents with children childless couples and married couples with children and in turn there are two important features of the tax system that relate to these differences first should the unit of taxation be the individual or the family the us tax system imposes taxes on families and differentiates in its rate structure between singles head of households single pare nts with children and married couples however an alternative would be to appl single rate schedule to each individual on his or her own earnings while some preference for this view of individual taxation may have to do with philosophical matters one argument for treating the individual rather than the family as taxpaying unit has to do with marriage neutrality and efficiency which are discussed subsequently that is if individualshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs12 12see harvey brazer income tax treatment of the family and alicia munnell the couple vs the individual under the federal personal income tax both in the economics of taxation ed henry j aaron and michael j boskin washington dc brookings institution 1980 13the notion of children as consumpti on can be traced to henry simons personal income taxation chicago university of chicago press 1938 could be taxed solely on their own earning s there would be tax consequences of being married and the married state would not affect incentives to work via tax differentials the second issue is how one should adjust for family size or in the case of individual taxation for the number of depe ndents despite the thrust of recent legislation which added substantial tax credits for children some of the debate over differentiating by taxpayer characteristics has been over whether personal exemptions for dependents should be allo wed at all under some theories of how the family should be taxed differentiation should be allowed for dependents indeed arguments are made that individuals shoul d be taxed on their income without regard to their family arrangements for that matter individual taxation does not preclude allowances for number of depe ndents rather its focus is on treating working adults even though married as separate entities12 in practice such tax system must always deal with the possibility of income splitting of capital income by transfers of assets within the family as well as the allocation of deductions clearly the family involves social and economic unit which differs from unrelated groupings although taxation of the family has recei ved limited attention in the economics literature vari ous principles have been advanced about how to treat family characteristics three such approaches are outlined here treating living arrangements and children as personal choices that should not be addressed by the tax law equating posttax standards of living for families with the same pretax standard of living and family assistance this analysis does not consider anothe r alternative principle of taxation the benefit principle which woul d set taxes to reflect the am ount of government services received one could argue that large familie s particularly familie s with children are greater beneficiaries of public spending such as educa tion while some taxes are explicitly formulated as benefit taxes eg the gasoline tax which is used to build roads the individual income tax has gene rally been based on other principles such as the ones described here family arrangements as personal choices people are relatively free to choose whether to marry and have children and an argument can be made that such choices should not lead to tax relief from this perspective if they choose to have children they are not worse off since the enjoyment they receive from their children outweighs any cost thus one could think of children as part of the consumption of the parents13 at minimum this approach suggests that allowance be made for the additional cost of supporting children tr eating the choice to have children as consumption item different from the decision to consume food or clothinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs13 similarly the choice of spouse could be seen as consumption or investment choice which should not alter the tax paid by the individual or the combined tax of the two spouses in this case the individual should be the tax unit while the argument that children constitute consumption to their parents may be defensible one using this view as guide to making tax policy is problematic even if the adults have made choice troublesome aspect of this treatment of children as consumption is that it consid ers only the wellbeing of the parent or parents parents tastes for children asid the material level of consumption for children as well as for adults is affected by the number of others in the family some theories have suggested that child ren could be seen as an investment perhaps for support in old age there is some justification for this theory of parental motivation although it must rely be less than universal since many parents leave bequests to their children rather than be ing supported by them in old age if investment were the objective of havi ng children then there would be some justification for tax relief since the cost of such an investment should in theory be recovered at the same time re turns such as help in old age should be taxed to the parents our tax system is not designed along these lines and in any case the childrenasinvestment theory also suffers from lack of focus on the wellbeing of the children ability to pay approaches another approach is simply that of ability to pay which is the cornerstone of progressive taxation applying this abilitytopay standard of taxation is stra ightforward in theory if one begins with the proposition that families with equal sta ndards of living before tax should have equal standards of living after tax if all family members were more or less identical in their needs and if all goods consumed we re purely private in nature this standard would suggest full income splitting of total family income among all members of the family one could merely divide all family income ev enly and then subject each share to an identical rate structure in progressive tax system larger families would pay smaller taxes than smaller families with the same total income the difficulty with this straightforward prescription is the existence of club goods within the family some goods are more or less purely private goods such as food if one person consumes food it is not available to anyone else other goods have elements of club nature with more than one person consuming the goods without interfering with nothers consumption such club goods include housing and some furnishings reading materials nd the family car none of these goods are pure shared goods since tastes may not be identical and congestion may occur but they do provide scale advantages in consumption within family these scale advantages in family consumption are reco gnized in construction of the poverty line which varies with family size yet doe s not increase in full proportion to it if we knew how to scale ability to pay by family size design of the income tax would be theoretically straightforward the method would be as follows choose representative family eg family of two devise the tax rate schedule to achieve the desired degree of progression setting the exempt level at the poverty level or whatever other leve l is desired the solution to horizontal equity is then simply an averaging approach for example consider larger family which needshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs14 50 more income than the basic reference family this means that larger family that has 75000 of income should have the same average tax rate as smaller reference family with 50 000 of income we simply apply the basic tax rate schedule to two thirds of the larger familys income and multiply the resulting tax liability by 15 this approach will produce th same effective tax rate for the larger family as for the reference family the larger family which has more income will still pay more taxes but the fraction paid will be the same as the smaller family the two families will have the same although smaller sta ndard of living after tax just as they had the same sta ndard of living before tax when exempt levels of tax are set roug hly at the poverty rate as was the intent of the 1986 tax reform act families whose income falls w ithin the first rate bracket the current 15 tax bracket tend to have equal effective tax rates if the relative poverty measures across families are correct ignoring the earned income tax credit these effects will not hold however when higher income families are considered or when other provisions such as the child credit and the earned income credit are considered moreover families with one earner are better off than families with two earners at the same income because of the expenses of working including child care and the benefits of home production of the nonworking spouse thus credits for child care expenses or allowances for work ing spouses can move the system towards more equitable treatment at l east visavis oneearner couples targeted family assistance at the opposite end of the spectrum is the notion of targeted family assistance especially for lower income families and often targeted towards children to accomplish this ta rgeting allowances for family size differentials eg personal llowances are often made refundable they take the form of credit rather than an exemption and benefits are often pha sed out as incomes rise several of these featur have made their way into current law where both the child care credit and the child credit exis t where the eitc is refundable and personal exemptions child credits and the eitc are phased out at least some bills have proposed that the child car credit be made refundable this view of family allowances diffe rs from the philosophy that personal exemptions along with other exclusions should be used to exempt minimum subsistence am ount from the income base the philosophy underlying the 1986 revisions and one which is more in line with the ability to pay standard similarly benefit for child care would be more appropriately made through deduction if child care was viewed as one of the costs of working under an abilitytopay approach proposals that are driven by this ph ilosophy are simulta neously addressing differentiation across family types and vertical distribution objective this objective is not necessarily inconsistent with the abilitytopay objective addressed previously even though it often appears to be because of the mechanisms chosen such as credits that are phased out for given family size any degree of vertical equity can be obtained through either exemp tions or credits or by arranging the tax rate schedule appropriately but the differentiation across families at the same income level or abilitytopay can be achieved only by selecting the sizes of personal exemptions for different family members an abilitytopay approach would include differentiation of families of different sizes at either high or lowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs15 14one argument along these lines is that progre ssive taxation could be justified by the need to maintain human resources at the bottom of the scale which justifies some minimum exclusion and curb the accumulation of power at the top since the accumulation of power is undiminished by family size there should be little differentiation at the top of the scale see harold m groves federal tax treatment of the family washington dc the brookings institution 1963 income levels when vanishing exemption or credit is chosen in the interest of vertical equity the actual result is to allow differentiation for family size at higher income levels14 finally it is important to recognize that the income tax system exists side by side with welfare system and many conclude that targeted family assistance might better be addressed thr ough the welfare system applying the ability to pay approach to current law the ability to pay approach seems the mo st consistent and to many appealing of the three approaches to dealing with tax differentiation based on family size this method considers the welfare of all in soci ety rather than focusing exclusively on adults or children in the remainder of this study this standard will be used as framework for analyzing horizontal equity in the current system and the implications of various tax proposals in defining families that have the same ability to pay the us poverty levels for differe nt family sizes will be use d under this standard single person requires about 75 of the inco of family of two family of six requires about twice the income of family of two thus for married couple with children with 20000 of income an equi valent single person would need 15000 and married couple with four children would need 40000 unfortunately there are several difficulties and uncertainties which complicate the analysis of the tax system using this standard these are discussed in the appendix which also reports the tax provi sions used to construct these tables the first subsection examines the variation in tax rates by size of family using these standards the following subsecti ons address special issues in addressing horizontal equity through the ability to pay standard imputed income of spouses who work in the home the child care cred it and the marriage penalty or bonus tax rates by fam ily type and size table 1 reports the effective tax rates for low and middleincome taxpayers at different levels of income for family sizes of up to seven individuals and for the three basic types of returns single joint and head of household without considering the child credit the families in each column have the same estimated abilitytopay these numbers assume that dependents are children and that the families are eligible for the earned income tax credit but the table does not include the per child credit which will not become fully available until 1999 the credit is 400 in 1998 itemized deductions are assu med to be twenty of income thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs16 are illustrative calculations that do not account for any other tax preferences and are designed to show how the basic structural familyrelated features of the tax law affect burdens table 2 repor ts the same tax burdens with the assumption that all children are eligible for the per child cred it of 500 table 3 reports these effective rates for highincome individuals in this case excluding the child credit which would not affect the results in any case except the one noted because the credit is largely phased out for these taxpayer s these measures account for the earnedincome credit assuming all wage income and allow itemized deductions assumed at 20 of income but excl ude provisions which are not broadly applicable such as childcare credits they also assume that all income is earned andor taxed at full rates although there are variety of favorable treatments eg lower capital gains tax rates that would affect these effective tax rates in practice these tables suggest that the pattern of tax burden by family size varies across the income scale as it reflects the complica tions of the earned income tax credit the child credit and graduated rates including phaseout effects moreover the variation across families which have the same ability to pay is substantial at low incomes families with children whether headed by married couple or single parent are favored because of the earned income tax credit these include joint returns with three or more members and all head of household returns which by definition have children or other dependents however the families with two or more children tend to get larger benefits because they receive the larger credit for having two children yet the largest families do not fare as well r eceive smaller subsidies because of caps and phaseouts of the eitc which do not differentiate by family size as income levels rise singles and larger families pay higher tax rates before considering the child credit with the child credit the larger families are favored however they begin to lose this favorable position because the higher incomes needed to keep them at the same ability to pay level tend to phase them out of the credits and also push them up into higher tax rates this effect continues for time as incomes rise as seen in

each column would have more income and singles would have less incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs20 overall these calculations suggest 1 that singles are taxed more heavily than childless couples 2 when the child cred it and eitc are ava ilable families with children tend to be favored over families without child ren at low and moderate income levels 3 the number of ch ildren in family so metimes causes more beneficial treatment and sometimes less depending on how the eitc and child credit are being phased out and 4 the graduated rate structure causes large families at higher income levels to be taxed significantly more these results can be characterized as resulting from the funda mental structural flaws of phaseout provisions and rate brackets phaseout points and rate bracket s should be based on family size if the ability to pay criterion is being used to determine the tax structure the flat amount of the child credit also cau ses it to have little ffect on relative tax liabilities at high income levels phasing it out causes more distortion across family size similarly the phaseout of the personal exemption exaggerates the over taxation of large families relative to small ones at higher income levels at low income levels however the family comparisons are affected by the earnedincome tax credit and differences in tax burdens by family size can be striking if there were earnedincome tax credit effective tax rates would be relatively uniform at the lower income levels at zero or small positive percentage amount the eitc introduces disparities first the eitc rate is much lower for single taxpayers or twomember joint returns where there are qualifying children than it is for families with children second if one accepts the abilitytopay standard the eitc has an inappropriate adjustment for family size there is reason to vary the rate of the eitc by family size but the base or maximum creditable wage and the phase out levels should be varied according to the abilityto pay standard that is both dollar amount sthe amount on which the eitc applies and the income at which the phaseout beginsshould be tied to family size according to the ability to pay standard while the eitc rate should be the same for all families by not varying these amount s large families may be poor but still have enough income to receive little or eitc to make the eitc neutral across families using the abilitytopay standard would require in addition to allowing it at common rate for all families changing the base levels and the phaseout levels for family size changing the rate as was done in 1990 and retained when the eitc was expanded in 1993 does not accomplish equal treatment across families of different sizes providing too much adjustment for some families and not enough for others oneearner married couples nd imputed income child care credits the tax rates in tables 13 do not account for some important features of the income tax that have implications for horizontal equity one such issue has to do with the treatment of married couples wh ere only one individual works outside the home these families are better off because the spouse not employed outside the home can perform services at home which result in cost savings perform household tasks which increase leisure time for the rest of the family or enjoy leisure the value of this time which is not counted in the measured transactions of the economy is referred to as imputed income this imputed income is not taxed and it wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs21 probably be impractical to ta x it nevertheless the ta x burden as of cash plus imputed income is lower for such family imputed income is not easily valued such individuals could in most cases work at least at the minimum wage table 4 shows the effective tax rates for oneearner families at low and moderate income levels assuming an imputed value of the services of the nonworking spous at the minimum wage 515 per hour for 40 hours per week and 48 weeks per year we do not include the lower income families who would have cash income or very high income families who would be negligibly affected since families are arrayed by equivalent abilities to pay this treatment is the same as allowing 9888 deduction from income which changing any of the other provisions including the size of itemized deductions these adjustments illustrate the importa nce of nontaxation of imputed income of the nonworking spouse benefit that can significantly reduce the effective tax rate as can be seen by comparing the tax rates in table 4 with those in tables 2 and 3 for example at an income level of 35000 for family of two effective tax rates across families range from 6 to 10 in table 2 incorporating the new tax rates in table 4 they range from 4 to 10 table 4 average effective income tax rates for one earner married couples imputed income of nonworking spouse valued at minimum wage

more income incomes include imputations if the primary reason spouse does not work is to care for children the disparate treatment between these taxpayers as compared to taxpayers who work and also have children can be offset by the childcare cr edit as shown in table 5 the full use of the childcare credit can also lower effective tax rates this benefit ameliorates the differential between these two classes of taxpayers with children however the credit does tend to increase the relative favoritism towards families with children in general in the low middle and middle income classes very low income families do not httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs22 have enough tax liability to benefit from the credit and the credit has little relative effect on higher income individuals essentially these

two larger families in each column would have more income these calculations should be considered with caution as they depend on the precision of the poverty scale ratios which do not take into acc ount the heterogeneity of the cost of rearing children and are aimed at measuring cash needs to attain given standard of living lower inco families with younger children who need child care may find their standard of living in material matters lower than other types of families because of the higher cost of that care relative to their income in that case the effective tax rates in tables 4 and 5 may be understated for these fam ilies and the child care credit may be considered an appropriate device to adjust for these particular circumstances at higher income levels child care costs are probably much smaller relative to income even if more is spent on care the child care credit however has little effect on effective tax rates at these income levels moreover the potential wages of athome spouses are pr obably higher when the working spouses incomes are higher so that tax rates ma be overstated in table 4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs23 15for other discussions of this issue

to pay however remaining single can alter their tax liability remaining single can cause tax liability either to rise or fall depending on the split of income between the two spouses if one individual

significant benefit with an even split primarily because these individuals do not get phased out of the eitc when only one person earns the income the phaseout of the eitc is not affected but the single taxpayer is penalized by the lower standard deduction of singles as result there is marriage bonus tax liability woul d fall with marriage through most of the middle incomes there is virtually marriage penalty as percentage of income but significant marriage bonuses the marri age penalties are small because of the existing rate structures which provide larg er deductions and wider brackets for joint returns than the single brackets if exem pt amounts and bracket widths were half as large for singles as for joint returns there would be marriage penalty even with equal division of income the standard deduction and points at which the rate brackets go from 15 to 28 and 31 are about 60 as large as those for joint returns hence marriage penalties are not very large as percentage of

dated september 18 1998the second set of calculations shows th effects of marriage between singles where one has child the individual with the child is assumed to be the nonearner in the case of the 1000 split if the earne r was assumed to have the child the bonus would be smaller because the single earner would be taxed at lower headof household rates the assumption that ch ildren remain with the nonearner reflects the likelihood that children would remain with the nonworking spouse who is typically the mother in the event of di vorce or would have had custody of the children if the couple were never married according to the census bureau 85 of children who live with one parent live with their mother16 in general if income is evenly split individuals pay more tax when they are married as the combining of income more than offsets the flatter rate graduation this is the marriage penalty when income is unevenly split the former effect is less important and taxes tend to be higher when individuals remain single this is marriage bonus the bonuses are particul arly large when only one spouse works because nonworking single cannot take any advantage of standard deductions personal exemptions child credits or the earned income tax credit at low incomes the effects are strongly driven by the earned income tax credit in the case of two singles without childre n marrying can cause them to be phased out of the eitc an effect most pronounced at the 10000 combined income level the same effect occurs when one of the indi viduals has child but at higher levels because of the higher phaseout rates there is also potentially powerful marriage bonus with respect to the eitc in cases wh ere one partner earns most of the income but does not have the child marriage makes that partner eligible for the eitc recent study of low income families indicates that this latter effect the bonus is the most common effect of the eitc17 these comparisons suggest that marriag bonuses are probably more significant than penalties an extensive study of the marriage penalty by the congressional budget office cbo18 supports this notion using similar allocation of children as that in table 6 in 1996 39 of couples have penalties 4 are unaffected and 57 have bonuses penaltie s were estimated at 25 b illion and bonuses would be 55 billion with net bonus of 30 billion updated numbers for 1999 reflecting the child credit indicated that 37 had pena lties 24 billion 3 are unaffected and 60 have bonuses 73 billion for net bonus of 49 billion in most of its analysis the cbo assumed children were allocated to minimize tax liability this allocati on is particularly important for bonuses because it would assign at least one child to the spouse with the higher earnings who would then qualify for headofhousehold status or the eitc the importance of this choice ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs26 allocation of children can be seen by comparing the effective tax rates reported in the footnote to table 7 when the child is assigned to the earner that earner is eligible for head of household status for the child credit for the personal exemption of the child and for more generous eitc treatme nt that depends on number of children at the 10000 equivalent level about 12000 for family of three the bonus entirely disappears if the child is allocated to th spouse with earnings this family has positive tax liability after considering the child credit and the earnings are eligible for the same eitc which depends not on filing status but on the presence of children if however the parent with earnings filed as single positive taxes are paid because of loss of personal exempti ons part of the sta ndard deduction and child credit and the taxpayer loses the entire eitc because he is phased out of it at the 20000 equivalent level filing as single rather than head of household causes loss of small eitc loss of the child credit and of personal exemption and part of the standard deduction as the fa mily moves through the income scale the eitc becomes irrelevant eventually it is the rate brackets that matter more which are wider in the headofhousehold schedule clearly however the child credit has made this allocation decision more im portant to measuring the marriage bonus cbos estimate of aggreg ate penalties and bonuses c onfirms the importance of this allocation in measuring the aggr egate size of bonuses with the tax minimization assumption in 1996 42 of jo int returns had pe nalties and 51 had bonuses penalties amounted to 288 billion and averaged about 2 of income while bonuses amounted to 329 billion and av eraged about 23 of income most of the bonus 285 billion went to the 44 of joint returns that had only one earner updated 1999 numbers including the child credit showed 43 had penalties of 32 billion and 52 had pena lties of 43 billion for net bonus of 10 billion the cbo study also examined the distribution of penalties and bonuses by income class these numbers reflect cbos assumption that children are assigned primarily to the higher earning spouse nd do not reflect the recently enacted child credit lower income returns adjusted gross income of less than 20000 were more likely to receive bonuses 63 of the returns received bonuses and 25 of returns were unaffected with only 12 s ubject to penalties bonuses amounted to 39 billion while penalties were only 09 billion however for those returns with penalties the pena lties were larger relative to in come 76 than bonuses 50 and the penalties and bonuses we re much larger relative to income than for other groups in the middle incomes 20000 to 50000 bonuses were slightly more common but accounted for less in dollar term s than penalties 55 of returns had bonuses and 44 penalties these were respectively 26 and 32 of income penalties were 96 billion nd bonuses were 87 billion in the higher income categories more than 50000 the opposite occurred more re turns had penalties 54 vs 44 with bonuses respectively 16 and 2 penalties accounted for 183 billion and bonuses for 203 billion it is difficult to know how these patterns would be affected by changing the allocation of children and including the child credit although the dramatic increase in bonuses with an alternative allocation suggests that bonuses would dominate pena lties across the income scale note that based on the abilitytopay sta ndard the equity issue arises because individuals who live as family unit without being married are receiving benefit or penalty depending on their circumstances that is it might be clearer to referhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs27 19census bureau current popul ation reports marital status and living arrangements march 1997to singles bonus rather than marriage pe nalty and singles pe nalty rather than marriage bonus and the implication for dist ributional equity in current law depends not on the size of bonuses or penalties for those already marrie d but for those who are not married presumably much sm aller group the census bureau reported 1092 million married adults living with their spouses about 55 million households but only 41 million unmarried couple households19 in most cases it would likely be the marriage penalty that these singles are avoiding and thus some singles are enjoying lower taxes than are appropriate using the abilitytopay standard of course singles could so have roommates and joy some of the benefits of club goods although the less intimate relationship between roommates as compared to couple that might marry might cause more congestion problems with club goods or make them less valuable unfortunately these problems are not easily solved since in practice it would be im possible and intrusive into persons lives to adjust the tax law to take account of th relationships which do not involve legal arrangements summary the assessment of tax burdens in the framework of the abilitytopay standard suggests that taxes across family groups have not been guided by any consistent philosophy the abilitytopay philosophy s been reflected in the choice of the family as the unit of taxation and the prin ciple of exempting the poverty level income in the 1986 tax reform act which would re sult in an equitable system for families subject only to the 15 rate this patte rn is perhaps unavoidably violated when imputed income of oneearner families is taken into account or when tax benefits or penalties by couples who live together but are not married are taken into account but it is also greatly altered by series of provisions aimed at children in the low and middle income levels that seem to reflect family assistance motive the child credit the eitc and the child care credit at the high end of the distribution taxes are reasonably even although fa milies with children are taxe d more heavily primarily because the rate brackets are not adjusted for family size this effect is exacerbated by the phaseout of personal exemptions and child credit the result of these provisions is that the most heavily taxed families through most of the income distribution are single individuals and married working childless couples while the most lightly taxed are oneearner married couples with children efficiency issues fairness or distributional issues are usually the focus of assessments of family tax issues but there are also issues of economic efficiency if the tax system encourages individuals to make choices whic h are not otherwise sirable then theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs28 20c eugene steuerle and

child credit in 1991 steuerle and juffras stress the disincentives provided by the current combined welfaretax system20 they note that lowincome individuals may improve their lot by moving working and marrying the welfaretax sy stem discourages all three many types of welfare benefits are not portable n obvious example is subsidized housing where often there are waiting lists the phaseout of welfare benefits including afdc food stamps and medicaid along with the additional costs of working especially child care costs can result in family becoming worse off when working finally marriage to partner who earns inco is discouraged since welfare benefits would be reduced or lost entirely the co mbined income of the couple may fall as result of marriage these disincentives have traditionally been an issue with the welfare system although recent work requirement s may have reduced that ffect but the income tax can also influence these decisions marriage pena lties and bonuses can alter individual decisions to marry and while an tax system other than lump sum tax which is not feasible will distort work choices the practice of combining couples incomes on joint returns may have an esp ecially important eff ect on labor supply of second earners who are typically women these workers labor supplies are also affected by the social security system which provides significant survivors benefits to spouses so that second earners get very little in return for the payroll taxes they bear there has been lot of anecdotal ev idence about couples getting divorced to avoid the marriage tax penalty although mu ch of this evidence occurred before 1981 when the marriage penalty was much larger recently number of statistical studies have examined the evidence they conclude that the marriage penalty or bonus has some effect on marriage but these effects are small21 the census data reporting only relatively small number of unmarried c ouple households supports that notion of course there are bonuses as well as penalties in fact the eitc does the opposite of traditional welfare system for very low incomes since single individual with earnings can become eligible for much larger credit by marrying an individual with low earnings and with children22 however even if the effects are small it may be disturbing to have tax syst em where social behavior that is considered by many as inappropriate living to gether without marriage is encouraged by the tax law it is probably for this reason that marriage penalties have been of greater concern than bonuses although bonuses are larger and more pervasive httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs29 23see the previous citation pp 1012 for disc ussion see also thomas mroz the sensitivity of an empirical model of married womens hours of work to economic and statistical assumptions econometrica vol 55 1987 pp 765799the effect of the tax system on second earners is of considerable interest because this is the main class of workers that at least some empirical evidence has suggested to be quite sensitive to wages and net wages are affected by taxes fall in the net wage can have effects that both encourage and discourage labor supply because income has decreased individuals may work harder to make up that income the income effect at the same time the lower wage and lower price of leisure discourages work the substitution effect both effects together govern the labor supply but the latter effect determines th degree of distortion imposed by the tax system most empirical evidence suggests that work effort by primary workers is not much affected by wage rates either through income or substitution effects especially with respect to their decision to participate in the labor force but also with respect to hours worked married women are found to be more responsive in some studies primarily with respect to participation d ecisions note however that there are number of difficulties in statistically estimating participation decisions for example the wage of person who is not working cannot be directly observed in cross section study23 married women tend to face the highest rates of tax for given income group because under joint filing their income is added to that of their husbands and taxed at his marginal tax rate single i ndividual will have c onsiderable amount of income exempt from tax through personal exemptions and standard deductions and his or her income will then be taxed at the first rate bracket if husband is already working the exemptions and deductions nd even most of the lower brackets may be used up to the extent that we have evidence of sensitivity to wages in labor supply it is among married women who are affected by potential marriage penalties and are most heavily taxed this effect might be considered in formulating tax policy the child care credit can also affect the tax burden on married women who are considering working one of the costs of working is child care and tax relief can reduce that cost of child care since the current tax system excludes imputed income from those working at home there is ta x increase associated with the decision to work that can be offset by the child credit this effect is illustrated in the comparison of tables 4 and 5 thus an increase in the child care credit will reduce the increase in tax liability from working and presumably lead to more participation by married women simplicity and compliance fair and efficient treatment of families cannot be achie ved if the tax system is too complicated simplicity may sometimes conflict with the objectives of equity and efficiency since targeting benefits may require complex calculations questionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs30 of simplicity are especially important at the lower end of the income scale where taxpayers have the most limited resources to deal with complexity many strides have been made in simplifying the filing of tax returns in particular the increase in personal exem ptions in 1986 eliminated many individuals from the tax filing population providing re lief through re fundable credits such as the eitc added many of these individuals back to the filing population moreover compliance with the eitc has been ques tioned as the eitc has been claimed by some ineligible individuals and has not been claimed by some eligible ones the introduction of multiple rate s depending on family circum stances had required the use of tax table to figure the eitc since that tax table already exists modifications to make the eitc more consistent with abilitytopay principles would add little complication two features of the tax law that may introduce inequities or distortions are however desirable for purposes of simplic ity one of these is the exclusion of imputed income of wives who work in th home which would be quite complicated to include in general the tax system does not include imputations of income the second feature is joint filing joint filing not only reduces the number of returns filed but also avoids complicated issues of how to allocate unearned income deductions and children between the two individuals any proposal for allowing or mandating individual filin g would complicate tax administration even where specific rules are provided to allocate in come deductions and children each couple would have to make more th an one tax calculation analysis of proposed changes there are variety of propos ed revisions to the tax law that would affect the tax treatment of the family and that can be addressed in light of these issues of equity efficiency and administrative simplicity we consider in turn proposals that address the marriage penalty and proposals that address the child care issue proposals to address the marriage penalty if we set aside issues of the earned income tax credit there are three major types of options for addressing the marriage pe nalty individual filing for married couples either voluntary or mandatory providing an income exclusion for the second earner or altering the joint rate schedule and exemptions to accomplish the equivalent of full income splitting there are also variety of approaches that would reduce marriage penalties that arise as result of the eitc in general the major impetus for the marriage penalty proposals is presumably to reduce the marriage penalty rather than increase the marriage bonus for each option we first report some statistics from the cbo study about three features of each proposal how much revenue is lost how much of the change is targeted towards penalties rather th an bonuses and the distribution of the tax cut across income groups the latter data is related to vertical quity considerations recallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs31 however that the data from the cbo st udy do not account for the recently enacted child credit and uses an allocation of children that minimizes bonuses and maximizes penalties then the option is discussed with regard to horizontal equity efficiency and administrative simplicity and compliance some vari ations of certain proposals are then addressed individual filing marriage penalties and bonuses could be eliminated with revenue gain by mandating that married c ouples file individual returns using the assumption of dividing children so as to minimize tax liability slightly less than half of married couples have pe nalties so more taxpayers would experience an increase in tax than decrease the revenue gain would be the size of the existing net of bonuses over penalties or about 4 billion if children were allocated to the lower earning spouse the revenue gain would be much larger 30 billion it is unlikely that mandatory individual filing with its tax increases would be chosen although revenues c ould be used to reduce single and head of household rates so as to provide revenue change or even revenue reduction many married couples who benefit from bonuses would pay hi gher tax an approach that would be more costly but which would not raise any current taxes would be to allow individual filing as an option cbo s estimated that such an optional system would cost 29 billion 64 of the bene fit would go to couples with over 50000 incomes 3 to go to those with incomes under 20000 if the option used rules to allocate children to the lower earning spous the cost would drop to 25 billion all of the revenue would go to couples with penalties so that this option would be perfectly target efficient optional filing does not perform well on horizontal equity grounds married couples even those who worked would pay different taxes depending on their income shares married working couples do not appear to be overtaxed relative to singles or to headsof household unless they are childless and this proposal would benefit couples with child ren proportionally more ssuming headofhousehold f iling status was allowed and children could be allocated to minimize taxes on efficiency grounds this option perfo rms well only couples with second earners would benefit from this revision and thus all of the tax cut would reduce the tax on labor income to the secondary wo rker the proposal would eliminate all marriage penalties problem with this approach is administr ation we have already seen that the assignment of children to each partner can have dramatic eff ect on tax liability in addition how are unearned income and deduc tions to be assigned cbo calculations assume assignment in proportion to ear nings which seems reasonable rule however unless unearned income and ductions are apportioned in restricted way they could be assigned in way to minimize taxes and even with set of formal rules the number of calculations and number of tax returns filed would be greatly increased optional filing for example would in many cases require three separate tax calculations to determine whether to take the option one for joint return and two for individual returns administrative difficulties however could be largely overcome by the use of lookup credit tablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs32 24this option is reported in briefing paper prepared by davis house budget committee democratic caucus the marriage penalty and related proposals april 23 1998 variation of this approach would allow optional filing but only as single it would lose about 19 billion in tax revenues24 this change would be an improvement on horizontal equity grounds si nce it would limit benefits to an already favored group married couples with childre n this option would not be attractive to low income individuals because single filing reduces the eitc although it would also prevent wives with small earnings but whose family income is not low from claiming the large childbased eitcs cbo also discusses allowing credit which would be the difference between joint and si ngle status for earned income using the standard deduction this option would cost 10 billion this latter option would have effect on penalties caused by the eitc and like the previous proposal would reduce benefits to couples with children w ho are already favored by other provisions these variations on optional filing would also simplify administrative problems it would be much easier to design l ookup table if headofhousehold returns were not allowed and even easier with table that simply reflects the differences between joint and single filing using only the standard deduction and spouses personal exemptions ie treating every ma rried couple as childless couple lower taxes for joint returns widening the brackets and standard deduction to twice that of the single re turn would cost about 25 billion but much of the revenue would go to couples that already have bonuses according to cbos methods of allocating children whic h tended to minimize bonuses and maximize penalties 51 of the revenue loss would nevertheless go to couples with bonuses 7 would go to couples w ith penalties and woul d be in excess of penalties and 43 would offset but not eliminate penalties these numbers would shift dramatically toward increasing bonuses with different assumptions about assi gnment of children compared to the previous option more of the tax cut would go to individuals with over 50000 in income 87 but 6 woul d go to those with incomes below 20000 cbo also reports that more than fivesixths of the reduction in penalties would go to families with earnings over 50000 most of the bonus increase would also go to these higher income taxpayers this option would also not perform well on abilitytopay horizontal equity grounds it maintains equity between marri ed couples with different earnings and is the only way to eliminate marriage penalties ignoring the eitc without differentiating among couples by increasin g bonuses however it would lower the overall tax rates of married individuals relative to si ngles including oneearner couples and families with children who are ready more favored through most of the income distribution the proposal does not perform as well as the previous one on efficiency grounds much of the revenue cost would not be targeted at couples with penalties although penalties for most childless coupl would be removed this proposal would not be very effective in reducing the disincentive for second earners to enter the labor force since the benefit would accrue regardless of whether there were two earners in the families there is special targeting towards the income of the secondhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs33 25ibidearner the second earner would still face ma rginal tax rates determined by the tax bracket of the first earner although thes rates would be somewhat lower for some taxpayers because of the tax reduction that is while this approach might encourage work effort it would have much smaller incentive for each dollar of revenue loss than would optional filing which would treat the second earners income as separate taxable entity with substantial portion of the income exempt this approach would not affect low income taxpayers who do not generally pay positive taxes and would not affect the receipt or phaseout of the eitc the plan is however the simplest of an of the proposals since it would require change in the way tax returns are filed more modest option would be to make the standard deduction larger for joint returns as proposed in the current tax bill hr 4579 this would cost about 6 billion and affect the approxima tely one half of married couples who use the standard deduction25 this option would in addition to being much less expensive concentrate more benefits to lower and m oderate income indivi duals however it too is not very targeted about half the be nefits would go to reduce penalties and half to bonuses and it would still extend benef its to those who are currently the most favored increasing phaseout rates and other options for the eitc another set of revisions would focus on the low inco families who received the eitc one option discussed by cbo would be to allow receipt of the eitc on the basis of individual earnings this approach while eliminating any marriage penalty arising from the phaseout of the eitc would be very costly estimated at 14 billion and would also allow the eitc to relativel welloff families wher the second earner had small earnings that effect would not be very much in the spirit of the purpose of the eitc cbo estimates that onethird of the tax cut would go to families with incomes above 50000 if that approach we re modified to phase out credits based on family income at double the current levels the cost would fall to 10 billion and only 10 would go to families with inco mes over 50000 another approach would be to split incomes and then apply the current limits provision that would be less beneficial to couples with very different incomes this option would cost about 4 billion with virtually all of it going to families with incomes under 50000 less than one of the revenue loss would go to individuals now receiving bonuses these eitc revisions would extend the eitc to families with incomes greatly above the current limits who are generally considered middle income and would differentiate substantially between families headed by c ouples rather than singles particularly when children are involved this can be seen by examining table 2 for example singleheaded family of 5 recei ves 40 subsidy at their equivalent of 5000 income for two about 9000 14 s ubsidy at twice the income in the 10000 column reflecting an income of about 18000 and 0 tax at four times that income in the 20000 column with an income of 36000 these numbers are comparing fixed family size across the row as income rises however joint return would be allowed to split incomes and each file as head of household withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs34 half the income with high subsidies of around 40 even when the single family is reduced to 14 subsidy and at 14 subsidy when singleheaded family has subsidy to conform the change to the abilitytopay horizontal equity standard phaseouts should be based on the total number in the family not the marital status and the credit rates should be equated across families very different type of reform the eitc revisions would however increase work incentives for second earners by allowing these earnings to be eligible for the eitc subsidy this effect would be the smallest for splitting the income and largest with allowing optional separate filing any of these revisions would complicate an already complex provision however since the eitc cr edit is already looked up in table certain revisions such as income splitting would be easy to incorporate in the tables second earner deduction final alternative would be to allow second earner deduction cbo consider ed deduction similar to that in effect between 1982 and 1986 second earner would take ten deduction of income not to exceed 3000 this provision would cost 9 billion eighty of this cost would go to reducing penalties by cbos calculation 82 of th tax cut would go to families over 50000 penalties among higher income couples would be reduced the most by this change since it would not affect the eitc and the amount of the deduction is small at lower incomes second earner deduction is in some ways middle road between more dramatic changes it tends to violate horiz ontal equity but not as much as in the case of more dramatic changes and much less than in the case of lowering taxes on all joint returns it is almost as efficient per dollar as optional filing it is less costly and more targeted to reducing penalties than increasing the rate brackets and standard deduction although some of the benefit goes to fa milies with bonuses all of the benefit goes to the second earner so it s performance with respect to reducing labor supply distortions is like that of the op tional filing alternativ it adds little complexity but not nearly as much as optional filing of course second earner deduction could be designed differently from the one enacted in the 1980s and studied by cbo for example s uppose one desired second earner deduction more targeted to lower income families one possibility would be to allow an increase in the st andard deduction equa l to the difference between twice the singles and the join t standard deduction currently about 1400 this approach would remove the marriage penalty for all couples without children whose income is taxed at 15 rate ignor ing the eitc it would not affect couples using itemized deductions where deductions were 1400 in excess of the current standard deduction it would not be likel to benefit couples with bonuses because of its concentration at lower income levels and its disallowance to itemizers it would reduce the penalty for couples with children without making judgement about the distribution of children it may be that the marriage penalty has greater effect on couples without children in any cas if the deduction were also allowed to reduce adjusted gross income for purposes of the eitc phase out it would slightly reduce eitc phaseouts it might also be possible to add an additional deduction forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs35 26see laura wheaton marriage penalties and low income families urban institute forthcomingsecond earners that is dependent on the number of children such provision would be much less costly second earner deduction involving flat allowance would also increase the return to taking job since it is not ma rginal it would not necessarily affect the number of hours but it would increase the return to labor pa rticipation which is generally thought to be more sensitive to net wages one proposal that has been suggested is to allow larger 5000 fl at addition to the standard deduction up to the amount of the second earners wages that would also reduce the eitc phaseout as well such proposal would significantly alter work incentives at the lower and middle of the income scale26 the distributional effects across the income classes could be altered by changing the rate deduction and ceiling the flat exemption discussed above would be like 100 deduction with 1400 ceiling rath er than 10 deduction with 3000 ceiling there are an infinite combination of ceilings and rates that could be used to adjust these distributional effects summary the analysis of options indicat that each proposal has drawbacks as well as merits some of these drawbacks such as the problems with horizontal equity simply reflect the inevitable conf licts between objectives that simply cannot be resolved in progressive tax syst em nevertheless some options including optional individual filing and variations on this appro ach as well as second earner deductions and certain revisions in the eitc are more economically efficient because they are targeted to penalties and to earnings of married women these more efficient options are more complex in some cases primarily optional single filing but there are variations which could easily use lookup credit table the revenue cost and vertical distribution of the va rious proposals also differ and might be important concerns and it is clear that the allocation of children is of enormous importance in both measuring the size of marriage penaltie s and bonuses and in designing certain tax revisions child care credits child care credit proposals fall into thr ee basic types expanding the credit making it refundable and in troducing an allowance for oneearner couples each of these is discussed separately expanding the credit the current child care credit is allowed at 30 rate phased down to 20 with adjusted gro ss income above 28000 the president has proposed an expansion of the credit to 50 up to 30000 phased down to 20 for taxpayers with incomes of 60000 or mo re dollar limits on the amounts eligible for the credit would be retained the administration also proposes to expand business credits table 7 shows the ma ximum effects of this proposal which can be contrasted with tables 2 and 5 these credits increase the tax subsidies availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs36 to families with many children they do not affect the lowest income families or smaller families or higher income families there may be case for indexing th maximum dollar amounts and phaseout levels if the original child care credit we re deemed appropriate under some equity or efficiency standard the analysis of horizontal equity in this study suggests that there is not very much justification under the abilitytopay st andard for additional benefits to families with children at moderately low income and middle income levels very low incomes would not be eligible for the credit because they have insufficient tax liability under family assistance approach special benefits for these children may be desirable however they would be more targeted to low income families if they were refundable their in teraction with the eitc how ever might be considered refundable credits the desirability of ref undable credits depends on how strongly the family assistance notion dominates tax considerations low income and moderate income families who do not pay positive taxes have relief for child care costs however they also receive very generous earned income tax credits and their tax burdens are much lower based on ability to pay sta ndards than families without children to some extent this evalua tion depends on whether the poverty scales adequately take into account the costs of child care and whether other direct assistance programs are being considered or mig ht be preferable it is true that the eitc has caused these families to file tax returns and the administrative disadvantages to requiring tax filing to obtain the credit are reducedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs37 table 7 effective tax rates assuming full use of

more income credits for athome parents the argument for extending child care benefits to stayathome parents is not consistent with the economic analysis already provided these parents already receive the benefits of failure to tax the value of their services in the household which is more generous benefit in most cases than the child care credits although perhaps some what less than the proposed larger credit rates in the case of lower in come families in effect these taxpayers already receive child care benefit since in economic terms care of children at home is one of the components of household production if cred it is to be allowe d the base could be included in income so that there is doubl counting of benefit or the credit rate could be lowered in these caseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs38 conclusion one of the most striking pictures that emerges of the assessment of the tax treatment of the family is how tax rates both under prior law with the child credit and with proposed changes such as th dependent care credit indicate the erratic treatment as family size changes along different income levels for example the earned income tax credit becomes much larger with one child and slightly larger with two children the child credit can become much larger at low income levels with three children because of the refundability feature this feature becomes more important with the larger child care credits which tend to reduce tax liabilty substantially as shown in table 8 however large families get phased out of the eitc the effective tax rates show the c onsequences of enacting tax revisions on piecemeal basis without f undamental philosophy of how to treat the family this lack of consistent standard also complicates the consideration of the marriage penalty since the cost and eval uation of proposals for change are very sensitive to the assignment of children the picture which appears to emerge from this analysis is that children have become much more crucial in affecting tax liability through most of the income spectrum than is justified by ability to pay standards this is significant departure from th philosophy underlying the 1986 changes of exempting poverty level income s and it arises from child credits and the importance of the eitc before these changes one could have argued that large families were overtaxed through much of the income spectrum but that is longer true it suggests caution in adopting further child associated tax credits if the ability to pay standard is to be considered at the same time the phaseout of all provisions that differentiate families by presence of children except for the head ofhousehold rate sc hedule has caused large families to be overtaxed these phaseout provisions also complicate the tax law and reconsideration of those phaseouts might be considered as part of any general family tax revision the options with respect to the marriage penalty are as is the case in the past beset with imperfections ho rizontal equity cannot be obtained so that part of the issue with respect to the marriage penalty is how far it is desirable to go to relieve the penalty at the cost of penalizing singles who are already more heavily taxed than the abilitytopay standard suggests is appropriate certain approaches are however more clearly targeted to families with penalties and more likely to reduce labor supply distortions given the uncertainty about families with childrens bonuses and penalties and the likelihood that families with children are already favored and probably less sensitive to tax considerations in their marriage decisions approaches that focus on reducing the penalties between single and joint returns may be more appropriatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs39 27patricia ruggles drawing the line alternative pove rty measures and their implications for public policy urban institute press 1990 pp 7299 for discussion of these alternative measuresappendix assessing horizontal equity with abilitytopay tax rates the objective of this analysis is to define families that have the same standard of living and calculate tax rates the first difficulty is determining how much more income larger family must have to have the same standard of living as smaller family this study uses the official us government poverty levels wh ich vary by family size other measures of poverty and of equivalen ce across families may differ somewhat from this official poverty measure27 most of the alternatives make larger adjustment for family size than do the official levels which would mean that tax rates for large families that are compared to smaller families using the pove rty standards would be increased and subsidies reduced that would occur b ecause larger families would need larger incomes than those specified in the poverty measures to attain the same standard of living since tax rates rise as income rises these tax rates for larger families would rise as well subsidies such as th eitc would fall for the same reason the second difficulty involves heterogene ity of family members children of different ages may require different expenditures to ma intain given standard of living and the latter is ill defined in an case for heterogeneous families although the current child credit is allowed only for children under 17 personal exemptions are allowed for older teenagers and young adults who are depe ndent on their families while obtaining further education in practi ce it is difficult to differentiate for the age of children the third difficulty is that the club ve rsus private nature of goods may vary across the income scale while poverty lines which presumably take into account the club nature of these goods have been cal culated for families higherincome families may choose different mix of goods thus fixed averaging approach which applies at all income levels may not be good way to differentiate for example it seems reasonable to expect that higherincome families might spend more of their budget on housing good with significant club aspects and less on food private good thus the relative adjustment factors for the poverty line might incorrectly adjust for equating standards of living at higher levels of family income table a1 shows the data on the budget shares devot ed to private goods from the survey of consumer expenditures by family size and income while families at higher income levels consume slightly more club goods the differences are not very pronounced these results suggest that uniform meas ure could probably be used for all income levels although the incomes required for large families at higher income levels may be slightly overstated ce these families use more club goods if these families had smaller incomes their tax rates would be lower httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs40 table a1 budget shares of private goods consumer expenditure survey

fees public transportation education and personal care the residual club goods are housing and home furnishings private transportation other entertainment and reading materials the fourth complication is that some families headed by married couples may have income from only one spouse working outside the home while in others both spouses work if these two families have equal cash income and are otherwise identical from an economic perspective the family with only one worker is better off than the family with two workers since the unemployed spouse is either producing goods for home consumption performing rvices which allow greater amount of leisure for the family or consuming additional leisure this observation only holds for otherwise identical families family with spouse who is at home because of illness or disability for example may have less ability to pay than similar two earner family thus this view is only appropriate as ge neral proposition in general one could correct for this effect by imputing income to account for the additional value of services produced in the home or the additional leisure enjoyed by the family alternatively fixed ex emption could be allo wed to second earners and to singles and heads of household wh ich is not allowed to the married couple with one earner final difficulty is that not all economic gr oupings are lega l families in practice it is not possible for the tax law to recognize these groupings under current law couple who marries can pay more ta x or less tax dependi ng on their relative earnings than they would pay if they lived together without legal marriage there is perfect solution to this problem but compromises can be reached via the different tax schedules for single joint and head of household httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98653crs41 28us department of commerce bureau of the census poverty thresholds 1997 see httpwwwcensusgovhhespovertypre97sizhtmlthe criterion for constructing the tables in the text is the poverty line these numbers are for nonelderly households povert levels are slightly different for families with elderly heads in 1997 an individual with income of 8350 had an ability to pay equivalent to married couple with income of 10748 for families of three four five six or seven members with all additional members children the respective equivalent amounts are 12919 16276 19154 21446 and 2402128 thus family of six needs roughly twice the income of family of two to attain the same standard of living these income ratios are applied across different income levels the adjustments are slightly different for heads of households because poverty lines allow some di fferentiation for the additi onal member being child versus an adult married couple is fa mily of two adults and headofhousehold family of two has an adult and child for head of household families of two to seven members the income levels are 11063 12 931 16333 18861 21047 and 23076 in the text tables therefore an income of 20000 refers to an income for two person family comparable families of one will have incomes of slightly over about 15000 while familie s of six will have incomes of about 40000 the tables in the text are based in 1997 income levels and tax rules except for the 500 child credit in 1997 the pers onal exemption was 2650 and the standard deduction was 6900 for joint returns 6050 for head of household returns and 4150 for singles taxable income up to 41200 for joint returns 33050 for head of household returns and 24500 for si ngle returns was taxed at 15 taxable income above these amounts but below 99600 85350 and 59 570 respectively was taxed at 31 the 36 rate bracket was reached at 151750 for joint returns 138 200 for heads of household and 124650 for single returns the point at which the 396 rate applies is 271050 for ll returns itemized deductions are phased out at 3 of income over 121200 personal exemptions are phased out at 2 for each 2500 over incomes of 181000 joint returns 151000 head of household returns and 121000 single return s the child credit is phased out at 50 for each 1000 over 110000 for joint returns and 75000 for other returns
