109th congress to split the ninth circuit court of appeals summary proposals to split the ninth circuit court of appeals have been before congress for decades proponents of split generally argue that the current ninth circuit is overburdened and that creating two or more new circ uits with reduced geography population and caseloads would improve j udicial administration opponents of split reject those claims saying that the current ninth circuit functions well and that the court is model of i nnovation opponents of split also suggest that efforts to divide the circuit represent an attack on judicial independence claim supporters of split deny in november 2005 the house of repres entatives passed th deficit reduction act of 2005 hr 4241 which among many other provisions contained language splitting the current ninth circuit into new ninth circuit and twelfth circuit during december 2005 housesenate conference negotiations language sp litting the ninth circuit was dropped from the

judgeships and caseloads 3 how quickly the circuit disposes of cases 4 cost of splitting the circuit 5 banc procedures and 6 the circuits rulings splitting the ninth circuit would have different effects in each of these six areas caseload is particularly prominent in the debate over splitting the ninth circuit proponents of split suggest that redu ced caseloads woul d improve judicial administration opponents suggest that if split occurred judges in new ninth circuit would have higher caseloads than their counterparts in proposed twelfth or thirteenth circuits analysis of the most recently available estimates from the administrative office of the us courts suggests that if the current ninth circuit had been reorganized in 2005 five of seven bills introduced in the 109th congress splitting the circuit would have yielded somewhat higher caseloads based on authorized judgeships in new ninth circuit than in the current ninth circuit during the same time period six of the bills woul d have yielded higher caseloads in new ninth circuit than in proposed twelfth or th irteenth circuits by contrast one bill hr 3125 would have yielded higher cas eload in twelfth circuit than new ninth circuit caseload estimates can vary by source and methodology other factors such as how quickly the circuit disposes of cases and complexity of cases could also affect cas eload considerations neither chamber of the 109th congress passed legislation related to splitting the ninth circuit this report will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33189contents introduction 1

introduction in 1891 congress established the us courts of appeals often called circuit courts to hear appeals from federa l district courts and later many agency regulations1 the circuit courts remain the last avenue of judicial review for all but the relatively few cases the supreme court considers establishing the appeals courts organized federal judicial business into geog raphic divisions circuits today there are 11 numbered circuit courts covering fe deral judicial distri cts housed in the 50 states and us territories in addition th court of appeals for the dc circuit has jurisdiction over appeals fo r the district of columbia including many agency appeals2 finally the court of appeals fo r the federal circuit has national jurisdiction over specialized issues such as patents and trademarks3 the ninth circuit located in the western united states is the nations largest circuit court in geography population and appeals filings figure 1 shows the boundaries of the current ninth circuit on occasion th ninth circuit has been noted for its controversial rulings these factors nd others discussed below surround recent proposals to split the ninth circuit into one or more new circuits opponents counter that the ninth circuit should remain intact and that proposals to sp lit the circuit threaten judici independencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33189crs2 this report provides information and analysis on the debate concerning splitting the ninth circuit and compares provisions of house and senate bills intr oduced during the 109th congress that propose to split the

splitting the ninth circuit would have different effects on each of these six areas as is summarized at the end of this report splitting the ninth circuit recent legislative proposals the debate over whether to split the current ninth circuit into two or more circuits has been before congress for decades two major commissions on circuit reorganization have reached different conclu sions concerning

to improve court management5 congress chose not to adopt the hrus ka or white commi ssions recommendations to reorganize the ninth circuit since the mid1990s several bills have been introduced that would split the ninth circuit during the 108th congress representative michael simpson sponsored house amendment 780 to s 878 which would have split the ninth circuit into three circuits the house passed s 878 with the amendment by vote of 2051946 in october 2004 but the measure did not win senate pproval in the 109th congress seven bills have been intr oduced in the house and senate that in

circuit bills because it couples splitting the ninth circuit with authorizing mo re than 60 new federal judgeships throughout the nation hr 4093 also creates an article iii court in the us virgin islands the other bills under consideration that would split the ninth circuit do not address additional judgeships except within what is currently the ninth circuit or the article iii court for the virgin islands topics not addressed in this report negotiations language splitting the ninth circuit into proposed new ninth and twelfth circuits was dropped from the budget reconciliation bill in the senate three bills s 1296 s 1301 and s 1845 proposing to split the ninth circuit were the subject of an october 2005 subcommittee on administrative oversight and the courts hearing9 hr 4093 in the house and s 1845 in the senate appeared to be the bills receiving the most legislative and media attention dur ing the first session most recently in the house on februa ry 8 2006 hr 4093 was reported by the judiciary committee and placed on the union ca lendar on the nate side s 1845 was originally scheduled for june 29 judiciary committee markup that markup was postponed after chairman arlen specter in response to request from senator dianne feinstein agreed to schedule future hearing on s 1845 the full senate judiciary committee held september 20 2006 hearing on s 184510 t h witnesses and contents of that hearing were largely reminiscent of other recent hearings on the topic the status of that debate is discussed throughout this report geographic provisions of twoway split the major difference among the seven bills introduced during the 109th congress to split the ninth circuit concerns whether the current ninth circuit would be divi ded into two or three new circuits11 four of the seven bills hr 3125 representative michael simpson hr 4093 representative james sens enbrenner s 1296 senator lisa murkowski and s 1845 senator john ensi gn would split the ninth circuit into two circuits the new ninth and the twelfth all bills specify the same geographic boundaries as shown in figure 2 under these bills the new ninth circuit would include california guam waii and the northern mariana islands the twelfth circuit would include alaska arizona idaho montana nevada oregon and washington httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33189crs5 12 28 usc 48athe four bills also specify where reor ganized courts would meet and in some cases be headquartered currently the nint h circuit is headquartered including the offices of the clerk and circuit executive in san francisco and also meets

portland and missoula hr 3125 specifies that new ninth circuit meet in honolulu pa sadena and san francisco like hr 4093 and s 1845 the twelfth circuit would meet in phoenix and seattle none of the bills requires that new ninth circuits headquarters w ould remain in san francisco although it certainly could s 1845 and s 1296 specify that the twelfth circuit headquarters be located in phoenix none of the other bills proposing twoway split specify headquarters locations fo r twelfth circuit fifth bill hr 212 representative michael simpson also proposes twoway split but with different boundaries see figure 3 hr 212 would create new ninth circuit including arizona calif ornia and nevada the twelfth circuit would include alaska guam hawaii idaho montana the northern mariana islands

nth circuit argue that the court is too big and covers too many peopl to operate effectively opponents of split generally respond that although the ninth circuit is big it still delivers effective justice and provides legal continuity for the wester n united states opponents of split also often assert that dividing the court is backdoor thod of eliminating the current ninth circuit due to its reputation as the nations most liberal appellate court proponents of split deny that the ninth ci rcuit is targeted for division based on its sometimes controversial rulings saying instead that effective judicial administration is the prime concern opponents of split also say that the nth circuit handles its large number of appeals well and that professional case management helps facilitate circuit operations for example fo rmer ninth circuit chief judge james r browning has argued that the ninth circuits innovati ons such as computerized docketing and longrange planning serve as models for other courts15 those against split also contend that duplicating staff and administr ative functions in reorganized circuit would be costly and unnecessary opponents warn that existing ninth circuit staff expertise which they contend enhances the current circuits functioning could not necessarily be replicated in propos ed twelfth or thirteenth circuits those supporting split counter that th ninth circuit is overworked they contend that reducing the circuits caseloa d by dividing the circuit falls within congresss responsibility to manage the fe deral courts and that failing to do so jeopardizes timely access to justice pr oponents fear that judges are too busy to effectively manage the court and say that dividing the circuit and adding new judgeships would allow judges to follow cases more closely finally those who support split maintain that the ninth ci rcuits administrative innovations are ultimately shortterm solution to longterm problem16 the ninth circuits efficiency is ofte n discussed in the debate over whether congress should split the circuit althoug h efficiency is commonly cited on both sides of the debate measurements for the rm are rarely define d efficiency could be measured in variety of ways with varying results because there is universally accepted definition of efficiency in the current debate over splitting the ninth circuit this report di scusses

problem p 5 20 testimony of circuit judge diarmuid oscannlain in us congress senate committee on the judiciary subcommittee on admi nistrative oversight and the courts revisiting continuedand how quickly the circuit disposes of cases but does not address the ninth circuits efficiency per geography and population the ninth circuits geography and population are controversial for two reasons the rge area the circuit encompasses and feeling among some observers that cases originating in california dominate the courts docket in both nd area and population the ninth circuit surpasses all other federal circuits in 2004 th area covered by the ninth circuit included more than 58 million people almost 36 million of whom lived in california17 currently the sixth circuit kentucky michigan oh io and tennessee is the secondmost populous circuit with 2004 estimate d population of more than 31 million proponents of split contend that decreasin g the current ninth circuits population could improve judicial administration and suggest that rapid population growth in the west will exacerbate the ninth ci rcuits workload challenges18 those opposing sp lit contend that the ninth circuits large geography is essential in maintaining one legal voice for the western united states senator dianne feinstein member of the j udiciary committee who opposes split stated during an october 2005 committee hearing that the uniformity of law in the west is key advantage of the 9th circuit providing consistency among western stat that share many common concerns for example splitting the circuit could result in one interpretation of law governing trade with mexico in californi and different one in arizona or in the application of environmental regula tions one way on the california side of lake tahoe and another way on the nevada side19 by contrast ninth circuit judge diar muid oscannlain who supports split testified that the need for unified legal voice for the west and pacific coast is red herring he also argued that the atlantic coast has five separate circuits and that there is corresponding law of the south nor law of the east20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33189crs10 20 continued

cases slowing the courts overall work40 according to the ao as of october 2005 41 of ninth circuit filings were bia appeals and 88 of those were filed in california41 in 2005 ninth circuit judge sidney r thomas who opposes split testified that from 2001 to 2005 through june 30 bia appeals for the circuit had increased 570 but added that while the courts can expect continued volume of bia appeals for the next several years the volume of immig ration cases should d ecrease as the bia becomes current in its case processing judge thomas also said that centralized circuit staff resolve well over 80 percent of immigration petitions before they reach judges and added that although many bia ppeals take time to resolve much of the delay is due to what he sees as slow government filings not the ninth circuit itself42 on related note during the spring of 2006 congress considered proposals to transfer immigration appeals from the regional circuit courts to the court of appeals for the

likely be noticed much in our own lifetimes64 governor wilson also noted his continued opposition to splitting the ninth circuit judges opinions on split although few ninth circuit judges vocally support split the majority of the courts active judges reportedly do not since late 2005 however public statements from some judges suggested possible divisions on the split issue between most active circuit judges on one hand and some retired circuit judges and district judges on the other according to ninth circuit chief judge mary schroeder in april 2004 ninth ci rcuit judges held retreat to

about split shifting all sitting latino judges to new ninth circuit according to an arizona republic columnist who wrote in october 2006 that judge bea contacted him about the split the judge was concerned that arizona would longer have any latino judges on its new court all six latinos on the current court would probably end up in the reconfigured 9th circuit68 if the president chose to do so factors such as race ethnicity or gender could be used in filling the additional five seats most bills propose for new ninth circuit or fo r future twelfth circuit appointments those against split say that opposition from the majority of the circuits judges is one of the most compelling arguments in favor of keeping the circuit intact in addition several state and cal bar associations hous ed in the ninth circuit reportedly oppose split69 the same is true for group of more than 350 law professors70 coalition of environmental organizations coordinated by earthjustice71 and other groups by contrast the us chamber of commerce is supporting s 1845 which would split the circuit72 in october 2005 the us judicial conference agreed not to take position on bills proposing to split the ninth

circuit and requested additional information about dojs current position analysis potential impacts of splitting the ninth circuit congress has thus far chosen to leav the ninth circuit intact the impact of splitting the ninth circuit would likely vary depending on the final boundaries of split and related provisions such as changes in the number of authorized judges or other daytoday realities encountered by j udges staff and litigants operating in reorganized ninth circuit that cannot be anticipated as noted previously the debate over splitting the ninth circuit generally focuses on six areas 1 geography and population 2 judgeships and caseloads 3 how quickly the circuit disposes of cases 4 cost of splitting the circuit 5 banc procedures and 6 the circuits rulings analysis suggests that splitting the ninth circuit would have different effects on each of these six areas geography and population history suggests that the ninth circuits population is likely to continue increasing all seven bills introduced during the 109th congress would reduce the number of states geographic area and population in proposed new ninth twelfth or thirteen th circuits compared with the current ninth circuit as explained above six of seven bills introduced in the 109th congress all except hr 212 would create new ninth circuit including california guam hawaii and the rthern mariana islands which in 2004 included an estimated 37 million people currently the sixth circuit kentucky michigan ohio and tennessee is the secondmostpopulous circuit with 2004 estimated population of more than 31 million by contrast the cu rrent ninth circuit includes approximately 58 million people therefore creating new ninth circuit that included only california guam hawaii and the northern mariana islands would remove approximately 20 million people in the mountain west and pacific northwest from the current ninth circuit and place them in proposed twel fth or thirteenth circuits79 new ninth circuit would still be the nations most populous circuit although its population would be closer to other circuits than is the cu rrent ninth circuits population new ninth circuit including only california guam hawaii and the northern mariana islands would be the only circuit including just tw states california and hawaii although it would house more total jurisdictions s tates and territories than some other circuits judgeships and caseloads those who oppose splitting the circuit generally believe that caseload dispar ity between reorganized circuits would unfairly increase work for judges remaining in new ninth circuit while creating smaller caseloads for judges in proposed tw elfth or thirteenth circuits proponents of split point out that california would receive additional perm anent and temporary judgeships to aid the new nths caseload and contend that states located in the resthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33189crs28 80 qualitative data are often obtained through openended survey

bogged down by the large number of cases originating in california analysis of the latest available timates for the year ending june 30 2005 suggests that under six of seven bills introduced during the 109th congress caseloads ie filed appeals per authorized judges hip in proposed twelfth or thirteenth circuits would have been lower than casel oads in new ninth circuit as shown in figure 6 although two bills hr 212 and hr 3125 would have also produced lower caseload estimates based on authoriz ed judgeships for new ninth circuit than for the current ninth circuit if tw temporary judgeships designated for new ninth circuit are included all seven bills would have yielded caseload estimates below current levels one bill hr 3125 would have produced higher estimated caseload in twelfth circuit than in new ninth circuit unlike the other six bills introduced during the 109th congress to split the ninth circuit hr 3125 would provide rough caseload parity between pr oposed new ninth and twelfth circuits qualitative factors such as the complexity of cases circuits handle types of cases and other factors could also affect caseloads and as th next section discusses how quickly circuits dispose of cases80 how quickly the circuits would dispose of cases although the ninth circuit took median of more than 16 months to dispose of cases in fy2005 it also faced the secondhighest perjudge caseload in the nation by contrast the sixth circuit in fy2005 carried compar atively small 3257 filed appeals for each of its 16 authorized judges but took almost as long as the ninth circuit median of 145 months to dispose of those cases at the same time the eleventh and fifth circuits created in 1981 from the old fifth circuit both had high caseloads in fy2005 but disposed of those cases faster than virtually any other circuit court see table 3 these findings suggest that there is not necessarily uniform relationship between the number of filed appeals per authorized judgeship and the speed with which those cases are resolved it is unclear whether new ninth twelfth or thirteenth circuit would necessarily dispose of cases faster than the current ninth circuit cost of splitting the circuit as explained previously depending on source and level of detail estimated costs for splitting the ninth circuit vary widely ao and cbo cost estimates suggest that startup costs for split could range between 20 million and 94 million plus annual recu rring costs and costs related to additional judgeships those estimates also suggest that renovating existing courthouses rather than cons tructing new facilities could be way to limit costs in addition to facilities administrative expenses are likely to influence cost estimateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33189crs29 81 see

procedures none of the legislation currently before congress proposing to split the ninth circuit would alter banc procedures under pl 95 486 any circuit with more than 15 activ judges may devise rules to sit banc without all the circuits active judges twelfth circuit and thirteenth circuit under hr 211 and s 1301 would presumably sit banc with all authorized judges because none of the bills splitting th ninth circuit authorizes more than 14 judges for the twelfth circuit or thirteenth circuit by contrast all bills introduced during the 109th congress that would split the ninth circuit authorize at least 19 judges for new ninth circuit meaning that new ninth would still be allowed to employ limited banc procedure if the court chose to do so if congress wanted to curtail the use of limited banc procedures or require minimum numbers of judges to sit on banc panels legislative action would be necessary on march 2 2005 representa tive michael simpson introduced hr 1064 which would prohibit the ninth circuit from employing the limited banc procedure the bill was re ferred to committee on april 4 2005 but has not been acted upon since the circuits rulings the degree to which the current ninth circuits rulings motivate calls for split is hotly debated those opposed to split generally contend that attempts to divide the circuit threaten j udicial independence81 by separating conservative areas of the mountai n west or pacific northwest into their own circuit or circuits supporters of sp lit reject that argument saying that their efforts to split the circuit are based on administrative concerns82 if the current ninth circuit were split threejudge appellate panels whose members would be drawn from around the circ uit would still hear most cases all except those heard banc if the circuit were sp lit before january 2009 president george w bush would be authorized to make nominations for the additional judgeships each bill specifies although the appointing president is not necessarily an indication of how particular judges might rule some observers caution that new ninth would be more liberal than the current court allegedly is because there would be little geographic diversity in reorganized ninth circuit compared with the current ninth circuit83 overall it is unclear how splitting the ninth circuit would impact rulings in new ninth twel fth or

firstsession attempts to split the circuit as part of the budget reconciliation process84 senator dianne feinstein also stated prior to december 2005 conference negotiations on the deficit reduction act which as passed by the house would have split the ninth circuit that she would object to the language by invoking the senates byrd rule which can be used to strike extraneous matter in reconciliation matters85 during the second session there has been official legislative action on hr 4093 in the house beyond reporting the bill from committee and placing it on the union calendar the fy2007 budget resolution agreed to by the house hconres 376 reportedly assumes the 9th us circuit court of appeals will be reorganized and additional judgeships created reviving battle from last years budget86 the senate judiciary committee he ld hearing on s 1845 on september 20 2006 that hearing echoed many of the sa themes and featured some of the same witnesses as other recent hearings on splitting the ninth circuit as of this writing there has been additional legisl ative action on proposals to split the ninth circuit in the 109th congress these two bills hr 4093 in the house and s 1845 in the senate have received the most legislative and media attention hr 4093 was the focus of firstsession atten tion while senate action on s 1845 has commanded more attention dur ing the second session as table 1 shows both bills offer substantially similar revisions of the ninth circuit the major difference between the bills is that hr 4093 does mo re than simply reorganize the ninth circuit the bill also authorizes more than 60 additional judgeships throughout the nation and creates an article iii court in the us virgin islands topic not addressed in this re port by contrast s 1845 centrates solely on splitting the ninth circuit adding judgeships onl in new ninth circuit httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33189crs31 87 for example as noted previously thr oughout this report an

oponents of split argue that rapid population growth in the current ninth circuit will only exacerbate th courts alleged management challenges ma ny proponents of split view dividing the circuit as inevitable with only the timing of division and some details remaining uncertain87 others are equally determined to oppose dividing the circuit asserting that split is not solution to perceived problems and that the ninth circuit continues to func tion effectively the data and analysis presented throug hout this report suggest that splitting the ninth circuit would have different impacts in different areas common to the debate over the circuits future such as caseload cost and banc procedures in some cases the impact of splitting the circuit is unclear in every case the impact of splitting the ninth circuit would vary with context each dimension of the debate over splitting the ninth circuit offers congress potential benchmarks to consider in deciding whether to split the
