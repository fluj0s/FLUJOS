histories both east and west now at last in the 1046 lines of the poem hymn of asia is the statement that this hope has been achieved you can be free this moving hymn was written for buddhist convention in about 1955 or 56 coinci dent with the celebrations in the buddhist world of the 2500th year of the buddhist era later typed copies of this magnificent work many in altered versions were widely cir culated from hand to hand in various countries of the world the public demand for its publication grew enormousthen in late 1973 its author directed its publication and subsequently personally super vised the collaboration of talented artist designer and calligrapher in the final preparation of the book thus here we have beautiful edition which presents the fully correct original text of the poem one surely destined to become major document of mans spiritual history hymn of asia concerns the fulfillment of prophecy made 2500 years ago by siddhar tha gautama better known as buddha the founder of the religion known in the west as bud dhism this prophecy can best be understood in context of buddhas life and work ii the life and work of buddha the two key concepts of buddhism are contained in the words buddha and bodhi each derived from the root budh meaning both to wake up and to know thus buddha is one who is enlightened or awakened bodhi means enlightenment or alternately one who has attained intellectual and ethical perfection by human means siddhartha gautama was the first in recorded history to attain such state and because he also pointed the way to others to attain it he started religion which changed the history of the world buddhas final words before he passed from this world sum up his lifelong teaching decay is inherent in all compound things but the truth will remain forever work out your salvation with diligence2 here was the epochal statement that in one lifetime one could strive to achieve state of spiritual freedom from the endless cycle of death and rebirth and achieve spiritual independ ence of the flesh supernatural agencies were not involved the entire reliance was placed upon the in dividuals own impulse to redeem himself by rousing himself by earnestness the wise man may make for himself an is land which flood can overwhelm s enseless and foolish folk fall into sloth the wise man guards earnestness as his best treasure1 buddhas own life 563483 bc provides the greatest example of his own teaching siddhartha gautamas birthplace was at lumbini now part of nepal on the northeast border of india rich nobleman surrounded by opulence and destined to become ruler at theage of 29 the buddhatobe resolved to leave his privileged life to seek the greater life first he studied the inherited knowledge of his day under the greatest available teachers he then retired to the forest and excelled even his fellow ascetics in endurance nearly to the point of death realizing that selfdeprivation was enervating and mindclouding he sat down beneath fig tree from that spot he resolved not to rise until he had at last pierced the veil of illusion and achieved enlightenment as the earliest scriptures of buddhism state sitting under poplarfig tree he began to meditate methodically and with his spiritual eye pierced layer after layer of the nature of existence he remem bered his previous existences saw through the law of rebirth as consequence of deeds and realized this is suffering this is its origin this is its termination and this is the way to its termination he gained the insight unshakable is my liberation from suffering this is the last birth there is for more re existence he was 35 when he reached bodhi thereafter he spent his remaining lifetime expound ing his message and organizing and laying down the rules for the swelling congregation of monks who wished to devote themselves fulltime to the teaching iii the influence of buddhism the message of buddha reached far beyond the compass of his original followers in northeast india wherever it traveled its teaching of love and hope transformed practically overnight the existing barbarisms based upon the morality of force and violence within 1500 years after the death of its founder buddhism had civilized most of asia for example the golden ages of chinese tibetan and japanese history were buddhist civiliza tions 1 from the dhammapada the way of truth work traditionally scribed to buddha3 buddhism became the dominant religion of asia and in terms of numbers of adherents the most widely held religion on the planet westward its influence was just as important spreading along the heavily trafficked trade routes between the east and west its ideas moved into the near east in the first century bc the christian message of love its statement the truth shall set you free represented the words of buddha filtered through some 500 years and across thousands of miles siddhartha gautamas work even set the precedent for an applied religious philosophy which finally reblossomed in the west some 2000 years later iv the prophecy of metteya but siddhartha gautama did not regard himself as an end point he looked upon his work as incomplete and prophesized that at later time successor would arise to complete hiswork the most specific wording of this prediction in buddhist literature states that 2500 years after buddha redhaired or goldenhaired man would arise in the west to complete the job buddha began in buddhist literature his name is known as metteya or metteyya with two ys in pali 2 or maitreya in sanskrit3 metta is the pali word for love thus the name could mean one whose name is kind ness more fluent translation of metteya in english would be friend the legend of metteya forms an important part of the buddhist maturethere are two descriptions of metteya in the pali canon the earliest buddhist scrip tures these references are found in portion of the canon known as the digha nikaya which represent the memorized sermons of buddha faithfully passed down orally from generation to generation and finally transcribed in the first century bc when new buddhist writings began to be composed just before and after the christian era once again we hear of maitreya or metteya these mainly consisted of legendary accountsof the birthplace and history of the new buddhatobe some 600 to 700 years later at time when buddhism was decaying internally through rampant ritualism and superstition reformer from southern india wrote pali poem entitled anagata vamsa in this poem the author describes in detail the coming of metteya who will revitalize the truth buddha promulgated and usher in new golden age for the entire known world various other descriptions of metteya frequently recur in buddhist literaturestatues of metteya can be found throughout buddhist lands where he often goes by cal names buddhists universally believe in his advent and that according to the legend he shall appear in the west 2 pali the language of buddha and pali canon the earliest written scriptures of buddhism 3 sanskrit the classical language of indian literature4 it would be instructive to look at some examples of this great prophecy which has at one time or another inspired the greater portion of mankind in one passage in the digha nikaya wherein buddha has been describing world decline he states at that period brethren there will arise in the world an exalted one named metteya arahant4 fully awakened abounding in wisdom and goodness happy with knowledge of the worlds unsurpassed as guide to mortals willing to be led teacher for gods and men an exalted one buddha even as i am now he by himself will thoroughly know and see as it w ere face to face this uni verse with its worlds of the spirits its brahmas5 and its maras6 and its worlds of recluses and brahmins7 of princes and peoples even as i now by myself thoroughly know and see them the truth the norm lovely in its origin lovely in its progress lovely in its consummation will he proclaim both in spirit and in the letter the higher life will he make known in all its fullness and in all its pu rity even as i do now he will be accompanied by congregation of some thou sands of brethren even as i am now accompanied by congregation of some hundreds of brethren later as buddha prepared for his death the following prophecy was among his last words and ananda8 suppressing his tears said to the blessed one who shall teach us when thou art gone and the blessed one replied i am not the first buddha who came upon earth nor shall i be the last i came to teach you the truth and i have founded on earth the kingdom of truth gautama siddhartha will die but buddha will live for buddha is the truth and the truth cannot die he who believes in the truth and lives it is my disciple and i shall teach him the truth will be propagated and the kingdom of truth will increase for about five hundred years then for while the clouds of error will darken the light and in due time another buddha will arise and he will reveal to you the selfsame eternal truth which i have taught you ananda said how shall we know himthe blessed one said the buddha that will come after will be known as mai treya which means he whose name is kindness from the book of the great decease the idea that metteya will arrive when mans fortunes are at low ebb is prevalent in the legend for example here is description of his advent from chinese buddhist sources 4 arahant variation of arhat one who has attained spiritual perfection 5 brahmas plural of brahma from hindu terminology term signifying the personified creative aspect of spiritual ab solute 6 maras plural of mara literally death the personification of evil 7 brahmins members of the indian priest caste 8 ananda buddhas cousin and his chief aide5 the first period began with s akyamuni9 buddha and ended five hundred years after his death it is called chengfa here translated as the first model period the second period lasts from the end of chengfa for another five hundred years and is called hsiangfa the period in which pictures must be used in this period men must work their way to the truth through pictures and books from the end of the second period and lasting for further two thousand years comes mofa the final period then and need are increased to such gree that buddhism itself goes to pieces at this point maitreya appears with his millennial kingdom new cycle of life begins with hope and redemption for all living things thus one cycle follows another until all living things are re deemed in milohsiasheng ching the chinese scripture describing metteyas descent into the world we find how he is solemnly appointed by gautama buddha to come as the great renewer at the time when the power of evil is at its height and all living things seem to be going to ruin under and punishment and in tibetan buddhist materials echoing earlier buddhist indian sources this star tling prophecy is made when he shall be seen in the west seated in the western fashion his hair like flames about his noble head discoursing then shall the inhabitants of the three worlds10 rejoice knowing that the emancipation of all sentient beings is immi nent then it shall be called the age of the blessed because it will become com monplace to achieve emancipation in one lifetime professor nicholas roerich 18741947 russian painter and archaeologist spent five years exploring in the himalayas in his altaihimalaya five year record of his expedition now out of print he related widespread prophecies throughout the east concerning metteya professor roerich states in altaihimalaya it is told in the prophecies how the new era shall manifest itself he relates some of these prophecies as follows 1 first will begin an unprecedented war of all nations 2 then shall the teachers appear and in all corners of the w orld shall be heard the true teaching 3 to this word of truth shall the people be drawn but those who are filled with darkness and ignorance shall set obstacles even those who by accident help the t eachings of this spiritual king of the world will receive in return hundred fold 9 sakyamuni buddhas full name was originally siddhartha gautama of the sakyas siddhartha was his given name gautama his surname and sakya the name of the clan to which his family belonged after he attained buddhahood his disciples sometimes called him sakyamuni silent sage muni of the sakya clan 10 three worlds three worlds of tibetan scriptures body the physical world pertaining to the body and its operations and life speech the world of communication between entities and things mind ones own world the world of ones own creation6 4 and one can already perceive unusual people already they the teachers open the gates of knowledge and ripened fruits are falling from the trees and finally5 those who accept him the messiah shall rejoice and those who deny him shall tremble and the warriors teachers shall march under the banner of maitreya v summary of the metteya legend thus we find these are the most salient details of the metteya legend 1 he shall appear in the west2 he shall appear at time when religion shall be waning when the world is imperiled and convulsed in turmoil 3 he will have golden hair or red hair 4 he will complete the work of gautama buddha and bring in new golden age of man by making possible the attainment of spiritual freedom by all beings 5 although the date of his advent is variously forecast the nearest date places it 2500 years after gautama buddha or roughly 1950 the date of gautamas own life being somewhat of an estimate itself in one form or another the prophecy of metteya has been the principal hope that the east has preserved and bequeathed to the world the editors
