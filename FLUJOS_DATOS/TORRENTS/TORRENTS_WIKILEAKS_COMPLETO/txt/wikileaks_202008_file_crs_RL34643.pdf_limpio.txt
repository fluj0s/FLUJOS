sent unsolicited direct mail advertisements to individuals on states registry could be charged fine for each infraction while federal dnm legislation is currently pending some members have expressed an interest in the subject and constituents regularly request inform ation about junk mail proponents of dnm policies have claimed that adve rtising mail harms the environment renders recipients more susceptible to identity theft and consumer fraud and is timewasting nuisance the united states postal service usps and direct mail marketers however argue that the environmental impact from advertising is minimal fraud or identity theft linked to mailings is rare and timewasting is in the eye of the beholder while environm ental and consumer protection groups have advocated the creation of the dnm registries direct mail marketers and the usps have offered alternative so lutions to legislation including do not mail initiatives managed by direct mail marketers themselves estimates

5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl346431 full analysis of possible constitutional issu related to state dnm statutes is beyond the scope of this report and in any event may be somewhat speculative given the apparent lack of direct judicial precedent and th absence of specific statutory language nonetheless at least three constitutional prin ciples may pertain free speech rights the power to regulate interstate and foreign co mmerce and the express authority of congress to establish post offices and postal roads precedent on state and federal do not call registries appears to indicate th at dnm statutes could be crafted to comply with free speech principles see for example mainstream mktg servs v ftc 358 f3d 1228 10th cir 2004 federal registry and natl coalition of prayer inc v carter 455 f3d 783 7th cir 2006 indiana statute see so rowan v post office department 397 us 728 1970 in which the supreme court rejected an ar gument that federal statute which allows addressees to request that postmasters issue orders prohibiting delivery of matter addressees in their discretion find offensive does not violate the first amendment and observed generally that addressees have right to cont rol the kinds of mail that they wish to have delivered the implications under the constitutions commerce clause may be more difficult to assess unlike the case of do not call registries there is neither federal statute that broadly regulates unsolicited mail through registries nor federal statute that explicitly allows states to establish their own do not mail registries perhaps the most formidable obstacle to st ate dnm statutes is the constitutional power granted to congress to establish post offices and postal roads judicial interpretation of this congressional power is relatively sparse but th authority that does exist some of it quite old suggests that the postal power embraces the regulation of the entire postal system and that state statute which significantly inte rferes with the performance of this federal function by impeding the delivery of matter that may be mailed and how it may be mailed continueddo not mail initiatives and their potential effects possible issues for

illconceived proposal with the do not call registry in fact it would have devastating consequences direct mail is an essential part of the postal services mail volume do not mail legislation would curb this growth and place heavier burden on other classes of mail to cover the fixed costs of providing postal service and thus raise its costs and jeopardize universal affordable service direct mail is in way comparable to the unsolicited and invasive telephone calls that are curbed by the do not call registry direct mail imposes burden on the public it causes interruptions and i for one look

may significantly reduce the amount of unsolicited advertising mail he or she receives th mail registries however have authority to fine or otherwise penalize organi zations that do not heed the lists congress may consider potential legisl ative options related to reduction of unsolicited advertising mail one option would be to seek legislation that is nearly identical to many of the pending state dnm bills the bill might specify which agency would manage the dnm registry andor whether its maintenance could be awarded as private contract direct mail marketers would need to access the list at intervals determined by the legislation the bill could also determine the penalties for direct mail marketers who fail to heed the list or leave that determination to the entity managing the list creating such legislation would have costs and benefits constituents with concerns about environmen tal waste or identity theft could sign up for the registry and reduce unsolicited advertising mail from their mailboxes organizations that rely on advertisin g mail for revenue how ever could suffer economic losses that prompt rise in pricing or lead to the elimination of jobs congress may also consider other legislative action to help usps generate revenues to replace those lost including increasing federal building flexibilities for usps current statutes nd usps policies place restricti ons on renting space in post offices to private vendors like banks and coffee shops by allowing usps greater flexibility to rent some of its retail space the service could collect additional revenue
