bossier parish bossier ii9 and georgia v ashcroft 10 which had affected the enforcement of section 5 of the vra according to the congressional findings provi sion in section 2 of the new law the effectiveness of the voting rights act of 1965 has been significantly weakened by the courts two decisions which had construed congress original intent in enacting vra and had narrowed the protec tions under section 5 section 5 of the vra is statutory mechanism designed to eliminate possible future denials or abridgements of the right to vote based on racial discrimination it is limited in scope as it applies only to those states or political subdivisions that are considered covered under section 4b of the act in order to obtain preclearance of proposed electoral change from the department of justice or the us district court for the district of columbia covered jurisdiction must demonstrate that the proposal does not have disc riminatory purpose or effect11 in its 1976 decision beer v us the us supreme court interpreted the section 5 preclearance standard to mean that proposed electoral change cannot have the purpose or effect of leading to ret rogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise12 in its 2000 decision reno v bossier parish bossier ii the court concluded that in light of the language of section 5 and its holding in beer section 5 does not prohibit preclearance of redistricting plan that was enacted with discriminatory buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33425crs6 13 528 us at 341

georgia v ashcroft by l paige whitaker 17 id at 482 emphasis added 18 id at 480 elaborating the court observed that on the one hand smaller number of safe districts with majority of minority voters may virtually guarantee the election of the minority groups preferred candidate while on the other hand spreading out minority voters over greater number of districts may creat greater opportunity to elect candidates of choice idnonretrogressive purpose13 as the bossier ii court noted in beer it considered the question of whether reapportionment plan that would have discriminatory but nonretrogressive effect on the rights of black voters should be denied preclearance in beer according to the court it reasoned that section 5 must be read in view of its purpose of insuring that votingproce dure changes would be made that would lead to retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise holding therefore that legislative reapportionment that enhances the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise can hardly have the effect of diluting or abridging the right to vote on account of race within the meaning of 514 according to the court it concluded in beer that in the context of 5 challenge the phrase denying or abridging the righ t to vote on account of race or color or more specifically in the context of votedilution claim the phrase abridging the right to vote on account of race or color limited the term it qua lified effect to retrogressive effects15 in georgia v ashcroft 16 the supreme court in 2003 had further construed the nonretrogression standard under the section 5 preclearan ce provision in the context of redistricting finding that plan pr oviding minority voters with an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice can comply with section 5 requirements according to the court in addition to the creation of safe districts where minority voters constitute well more than 50 of eligible voters also referred to as minority majority districts the effective exercise of the franchise can also be achieved by spreading out minority voters over greater number of districts thereby creating more districts in which minority voters can have the opportunity but not near certainty of electing candidates of their choice17 section 5 the court announced affords the states the flexibility to choose one theory of representation over the other either option will present the minority gr oup with its own array of electoral risks and benefits and presents hard choices about what would truly maximize minority electoral success18 hence under georgia v ashcroft even if proposed redistricting plan reduces the number of minoritymajorit districts the plan can nonetheless satisfy the preclearance require ments of section 5 in evaluating proposed change under section 5 cour t should assess the totality of the circumstances and not focus solely on the comparative ability of minority grouphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33425crs7 19 id 20 see richard l hasen congressional power to renew the preclearance provisions

of its choice the court held19 as commentators have observed the court in georgia eased the burden on jurisdic tions seeking preclearance under section 520 in response to these supreme court rulings it appeared that section 5 of the law was drafted to define and cl arify congressional intent with regard to denying or abridging the right to vote of individuals in covered jurisdictions section 5 of the law amends section 5 of the vra 42 us c 1973c by dividing the section into four subsections section 5a of the w amends section 5 of the vra by striking does not have the purpose and will not have the effect and inserting neither has the purpose nor will have the effect sec tion 5b of the law amends section 5 by providing that any voting qualification or prer equisite to voting or standard practice or procedure concerning voting that has th purpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of th united states because of race color or limitedenglish proficiency to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges their right to vote section 5c of the law provides that the term purpose in subsections and b must include any discriminatory purpose section 5d of the law clarifies that the purpose of subsec tion b of this section is to protect the ability of citizens covered by the vra to elect their preferred candidates of choice hence it appears that the intent of section 5c of the law is to reverse the bossier ii decision by requiring denial of preclearance of electoral changes with any discriminatory purpose likewise it appears that section 5d of the law endeavors to reverse the courts holding in georgia v ashcroft by denying preclearance of any voting change that has the purpose or w ould have the effect of denying minority voters the ability to to elect their preferred candidates of choice litigation expenses section 6 amends secti on 14e of the vra which presently allows at the cour ts discretion the

had argued that requiring bilin gual language assistance should not be necessary because the united states is an englishspeaking country in which virtually all of its citizens speak r ead and understand the english language further he had stated that immigrants have to learn english in order to become naturalized citizens21 other witnesses however had testifie d that there are many limitedenglish speaking americans who are nativeborn such as hispanics and some american indians also puerto ricans whose primary language is spanish are us citizens some limitedenglish speakers are persons w ho were born in this country when many ethnic communities were segregated living in barrios or on reservations they had little need to leave their communities and enter the larger englishspeaking one as consequence while they understand some glish they are not fluent enough in the language to use it to vote other limitedenglish speakers include older naturalized citizens who have lived in this country for decades but are not fluent in english to become citizens they can receive an exemption from taking the examination for naturalization in english22 these witnesses cited statistics indicating that substantial percentages of hispanics speak language other than english at home and that sizeable percentage of asian americans are limitedenglish speakers because the demand for classes that teach english far ex ceeds the availability of such classes and also for other reasons they supported the extension of bilingual language assistance provisions of the vra23 chris norby an elected fficial from orange county california had expressed concerns about the costs of providing bilingu assistance to certain voters he had argued that the method for determining which voters are nonenglish speaking needed to be amended at present the ce nsus form offers the following selections to determine how well person speaks english very well well not well or not at all if person indicates on the ce nsus form that he or she speaks english well then the person is deemed limitedenglish speaker norby had proposed that person who indicated well be j udged sufficient to vote without language assistance according to norby orange county which he represents currently must translate election materials into spanish vietnamese chinese and korean if the standard for determining who is limitedenglish speaker were not changed he anticipated having to provide language assistance in other languages as well depending on future immigration patterns which according to him could

costs were reasonable in light of the challenges the county faces26 some supporters of extending section 203 had stated that the costs of bilingual assistance were minimal and that an implemented

the vra it would have changed the formula that determines which state or political s ubdivision is covered by the preclearance provisions of the vra by basing it on voter registration and voter turnout statistics the vras current formula however is based on stat or political subdivisions historical record of voting discriminati on against minorities who are covered in the act the norwood amendment would have provided that the preclearance provisions would have applied to st ate or political subdivision where the attorney general determines that state or political subdivision maintains test or device or the director of the census determines that less than 50 of citizens of voting age who resi in state or political s ubdivision were registered on november 1 of critical year or less than 50 of those citizens voted in the presidential election of critical year the amendment would have defined critical year as the three years in which the last preceding presidential elections took place also once preclearance determination had been made the amendment would have prohibited any judicial review and would have allowed that termination to become effective upon publication in the federal register proponents of the norwood amendment argu ed that the current formula that determines which jurisdicti ons are covered under the preclearance provisions of the vra is outdated reportedly some southern members of congress objected to their states having to submit changes in electoral procedures to doj for approval stating that despite their efforts to improve in this area the south continues to be treated differently from the rest of the country34 different view on this issue is that much of the progress that has occurred in addressing voting discrimination in covered jurisdictions is directly attributable to enforcement of section 5 of the vra supporters of this argument pointed to the number of objections from doj since 1982 to some covered jurisdictions proposed

evidence of the continued need for section 5 their vi ew is that without section 5 of the vra voting discrimination in covered jurisdictions would likely occur35 one reason for enactment of the original voting rights act in 1965 was to respond to the creative changing and effectiv efforts of some states to deny african americans access to the voting booth or to d iminish their presence there prohibiting voters from registering to vote and intimidating voters who attempted to vote was quite effective then among tactics used today to accomplish that objective however are urban annexati ons and redistricting the norwood amendment in relying on voter registration nd voting turnout records for the past three presidential election years 1996 2000 and 2004 did not appear to address voting discrimination in jurisdictions that were likely to use these tactics rather in using the voter registration and voting turnout records for the past three presidential election years 1996 2000 and 2004 the norwood formula would have for example subjected state hawaii to the preclearance provisions of the vra that had never been subjected to these provisions before36 at present 16 states are covered by section 5 of the vra eight states in their entirety alabama alaska ar izona georgia louisiana mississippi south carolina and texas and eight states with political subdivisions that are covered california florida michigan new hampshire new york north carolina south dakota and virginia according to us census bureau data for the presidential elections of 1996 and 2000 for each of these

and 441 of citizens of voting age populati on voted in the election of 200037 data are not available to determine if political subdivisions of state would have been covered under provisions of the norwood amendment in add ition it would have been hypothetically possible for the attorney general to have determined that state or political subdivision has used test or devi ce and thereby would have been covered by the norwood amendment gohmert amendment the gohmert amendment would have reauthorized and extended the temporary pr ovisions of the vra which were scheduled to expire on august 6

since according to him the supreme court has established that it will regularly change the playing field and regularly change the rules concerning the vra38 in response congressman sensenbrenner stated that testimony and evidence presented at 12 hearings on the vra support extension of the temporary provisions for 25 years according to him it would allow meaningful change in the voting process to be measured and would make eradication of discrimination in the voting process an achievable goal39 also the 25year period w ould meet the supreme courts requirement of large set of data for analysis to justify reauthorizing the vra further congressman sensenbrenner stated that the gohmert amendment if adopted would nullify the current incentive provided in the vra to encourage covered jurisdictions to maintain nondiscriminatory voting record for 10 years in order to be eligible to ba il out from coverage king amendment the king amendment would have deleted sections 7 and 8

interpreting the ballot westmoreland amendment the westmoreland amendment would have amended section 5 of the vra by requi ring the attorney general to annually determine whether each state and political subdivision covered by the preclearance provisions of the act can bail out of covera ge further it would have required the attorney general to inform both the public and each state or political subdivision of whether it can bail out where state or political subdivision seeks to bail out of coverage the amendment woul d have allowed such bailout if the attorney general determined that state or political subdivision met the requirements the westmoreland amendment would have retained the current criteria for bailing out of coverage in requiring the attorney general each year to determine every state or political subdivision that would be eligib for bailout howev er the westmoreland amendment would have shif ted responsibility from the state or political subdivision to doj to implement provisions of this amendment it appears that doj might have needed to increase its staff to conduct the n ecessary research and analysis it does not appear that the westmoreland amendmen t would have addressed the issue of additional doj resources debate on the westmoreland amendm ent centered on the small number of jurisdictions that have bailed out of vr coverage the costs for doj to
