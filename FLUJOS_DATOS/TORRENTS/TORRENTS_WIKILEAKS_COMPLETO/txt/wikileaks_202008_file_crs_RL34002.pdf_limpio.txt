coordinate it with other services the organizations representing phas have disagreed arguing in favor of the current locally driven and focused system phas have important local connections with entities ranging from landlords to local zoning boards connec tions that states they contend would not have3 furthermore phas have the most experience in administering federal housing assistan ce for the poor both through the voucher program and the federa l public housing program hud has taken some steps to promote c onsolidation of phas specifically it has provided guidance to phas on how to

such as when public housing is demolished or when the longterm c ontract on projectbas ed section 8 property expires while the addition of new tenant protection vouchers does increase the number of families receiving vouchers it does not necessarily increase the number of families receiving housing assistance since the familie s that receive them had been previously assisted through another program 10 in 2003 the bush administration introduced such reform termed housing assistance for needy families hanf the legi slation was introduced in the house and senate but further action was taken

provided 125 million for incremental vouchers phas earn administrative fees which they can use to cover the cost of administering the voucher program and for other purposes such as providing s upportive services downpayment or security deposit assistance or housing search assistance this system is governed by hundreds of pages of regulations and guidance that make the program some argue overly prescriptive and difficult to administer past reform initiatives have propos ed to convert the current program into something more akin to block grant redefining the c oncept of voucher by instead providing funds that phas could use for re ntal assistance homeownersh ip assistance and supportive services as defined by the grantee10 voucher would longer have uniform meaning and phas could provide more or less generous assistance to families at their discretion outside of some if not ll current federal rules such reform would be consistent with the 1996 welfar reform law that abolished the aid to families with dependent child ren afdc program and re placed it with the broader purpose temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant11 there has also been debate about how much of the voucher program should and can realistically be focused on promoting homeownership the bush administration has made priority of increasing the number of firsttime homebuyers making purchases with homeownership vouchers successful homeownership can help lowerincome families build assets and wealth which can help their longterm financial security however the vouc her homeownership program has minimum requirements that many familie s currently served by the rental voucher program may be unable to meet minimum income st andards employme nt requirements furthermore some voucher fa milies particularly those in lowwage andor volatile employment markets may not have the fi nancial stability nece ssary to successfully maintain homeownershiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34002crs4 12 incomebased rents are used in the majority of hud rental assistance programs including public housing projectbased section 8 hous ing for the elderly

structure under the current rules of the voucher program families pay an incomebased rent12 specifically families are required to pay 30 of their adjusted incomes toward rent although they may choose to pay more13 it is generally accepted that housing is affordable for lowincome familie s if it costs more than 30 of their adjusted gross income on the assumption that lowincome families need the full remaining 70 to meet other needs however this figure is somewhat arbitrary for some families with few costs for work tran sportation medical child care or other needs 40 or even 50 of income mig ht be reasonable contribution toward housing costs in fact the current vouche r program allows familie s to choose to pay up to 40 of their incomes toward housin g costs initially and even greater amounts upon renewal of lease for other fa milies with high expenses for work transportation medical child care or other outside costs some percentage lower than 30 might be the most reasonable or affordable contribution critics of the current rent calculati on including the bush administration14 and some pha groups15 have argued that phas should ve the flexibility to modify the existing incomebased rent system or adopt new systems partially or fully decoupled from income such as flat or tiered rents under flat rents families would pay phadetermined fixed below market rent based on unit size regardless of their incomes as income changed rent would stay the same current law permits phas to set voluntary flat rents for public housin g families are permitte d to choose to pay flat rents but must be permitted to switch back to incomebased rents under tiered rents phas coul d set different flat rents for broad tiers of income families would pay the rent charged for their income tier and only fluctuations in income that move them from one tier to nother would change their rent if phas set rent tiers very low then fewer tenants would face an increase in rent but phas could face higher voucher costs if the tiers were set higher then more tenants would face rent increases but phas w ould see reduced voucher costs shallower subsidies under flat or tiered rents would llow phas either to save money or serve more people with the sa amount of money depending on the authority provided by hud and congress but might lead to greater costburdens for the lowestincome

changes in housing bill will help many tenants august 1 2006 another argument in favor of moving fro m an incomebased rent to flat rent concerns administrative ease the current complicated rent calculation paired with the difficulty of verifying the incomes of tenants has led to high levels of error in the subsidy calculation according to hud 2001 quality control study 60 of all rent and subsidy calculations contained so type of error hud has estimated an annual 2 billion in subsidy over and unde rpayments in the section 8 voucher program these errors have led the government accountability office gao to designate the section 8 program high risk program meaning that it is particularly susceptible to waste fraud and abuse beginning with the fy2003 consolidated appropriations act pl 1087 hud was given access to the national directory of new hires database that may allow phas to better verify income data there has been some improvement 2003 qua lity control study released in 2004 found 37 reduction in erroneous payments from 2001 although 40 of subsidies were still erroneously calculated adopting flat or tiered rents could substantially reduce if not eliminate errors in rent calculations flat rent structure may also help reduce the work disincentives inherent in the current calculation since re nt goes up as income goes up families face an effective 30 tax on any increase in earnings and therefore they may have disincentive to increase earnings andor an incentive to hide income to help address this problem in the public housing program congress has instituted mandatory income disregard however such mandatory di sregard exists in the voucher program except in the case of certain disabled recipients16 if phas choose to disregard increased earnings they will not receive funding for the increased costs or face sanctions from hud for not accurately calcula ting subsidies under flat or tiered rents families can generally increase their earnings without facing changes in their rents lowincome housing advocates generally agree that the current rentsetting system is overly complicated but still support incomebased rents over flat rents flat rents are not as responsive to change s in family income as incomebased rents and their adoption could result in some families paying much more toward rent than is generally considered afford able 30 of income they argue that changes to the method of calculating income could do much to simplify the rentsetting process17 calculation of income under the current voucher program rent is based on familys annual adjusted income the current system for calculating income as noted earlier in relation to rents has been criticized as cumbersome and prone to errorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34002crs6 18 summarized from 24 cfr 5609 19 see 24 cfr 982516 20 see 24 cfr 5611 for list of deductions 21 see government acc ountability offi ce gao progress and

familie s who are receiving voucher as result of being displaced from other assisted housing families using their voucher to purchase home or families meeting other criteria established by the pha 23 for example 50 of ami for three person family in missoula mt was 24550 and 30 was 14750 in 2007 fifty percent of ami in san francisco ca was 50900 and 30 was 30550 in 2007annual income which is us ed for determining eligib ility and as the basis for determining adjusted income for rentse tting purposes is defined as all amounts that are anticipated to be received by all mbers of household during the subsequent 12 months with some exclusions such as foster care payments18 anticipating low income families future incomes can be very difficult as their employment is often variable the composition of family may also be variable with members joining or leaving the household over the course of year further phas are expected to verify families incomes using thirdparty sources which can be timeconsuming process19 once the total amount of income s been determined adjusted income is calculated for rentsetting purposes from total annual income the family may qualify to have certain amounts deducted such as 480 per dependent 400 for elderly and disabled households and r easonable child care expenses disability expenses and certain medical expens of the elderly or disabled20 the complexity of the income determination system is major factor behind the high rates of error in rent determination many of the current requirements are regulatory rather than statutory and pha groups have called on hud to simplify the process hud has stated that it is looking at ways to improve the income calculation process21 although major administrativ changes have been made eligibility the current voucher program sets initial eligibility for assistance at the very lowincome level 50 or below of area median income ami22 with requirement that 75 of ll vouchers be targeted to extremely lowincome families 30 or below ami23 the targeting requirement wa s enacted as part of the 1998 public housing reform law and was designed to ensure that the neediest families received assistance serving lower income familie s results in higher costs per voucher in limited funding environment the higher the per voucher cost the fewer the number of families that can be served the difficult

administration has advocated loosening current targeting standards in an attempt to either serve more families or reduce the cost of the program24 low income housing advocates generally support retaining current income eligibility and targeting requirements arguing that the lowestincome househol ds face the heaviest rent burdens and are the most in need of assistance work requirements and time limits the voucher program does not currently have time limits or work requirements families that receive voucher assistance can retain that assistance until either they choose to leave the program they are fo rced to leave the program due to non compliance with program rules or insufficien t funding or their income rises to the point that 30 of their income equals their housing costs at which point their subsidy is zero the public housing program does have mandatory eighthour work or community service requirement for nonelderly nondisabled tenants however most public housing resident s are exempted and it is unclear how thoroughly the provision has been implemented25 some have advocated tting time limits for receipt of voucher assistance and making work requirement for ongoing ligibility they argue that under the current system families have incentive to increase their incomes or work efforts and leave the program26 adopting work requirement in the voucher program may help encourage nonelderly nondisabled households that are not currently working to go to work time limits and work requirements have been at least partly credited with decreasing the size of the welfare rolls another reason to consider time limits relates to the fact that many communities have long waiting lists for assistance since few new vouchers have been funded in recent years turnover in the current prog ram is the primary way to serve those families on the waiting lists there is evidence that families with children those most likely to be affected by work requirements and time limits already leave the program relatively quickly according to hud research from 2003 the dian length of stay for families with children is two and half years27 further while time limits and work

for hqsmay help move families out of the voucher program it is unclear whether such changes would increase families incomes or lead to selfsufficiency research based on the 1996 welfare reform changes pl 104193 indicates that for many poor families increases in work do not necessarily translate into greater total income and most households need work supports s uch as child care and transportation assistance in order to make them successful in becoming financially selfsufficient28 such supportive services are not currently part of the voucher program and would likely require additional funding in fact it is unclear how wincome families that are leaving the program now are mee ting their housing costs hud conducted research looking at families with children who left the voucher program over five year period and found that less than 1 of them had incomes sufficient to afford an apartment at the fair market rent in their community29 low income housing advocates promot providing incentives for families to increase their work efforts and their incomes rather than time limits and work requirements for example nonelderly nondisabled families could be encouraged to find and increase work

failures may be found for violations that tenant might consider minor violation such as missing lights witch plates or tear in the carpet that could be considered tripping hazard yet phas are still required to withhold payment this can also contribute to landlords reluctance to participate in the program the prevalence of substandard housing va ries widely areas with relatively new housing stock particularly in the sout hwest may only need inspections every couple of years to ensure quality whereas areas with relatively old housing stock such as the northeast may require more frequent inspections perhaps even more than once year in order to ensure quality although there have been calls to change the inspection requirements it has proven difficult to balance providing flexibility to phas to address the needs of specific communities with ensuring protection for tenants from substandard conditions portability section 8 vouchers are nati onally portable which m eans that families can take their vouchers and move from the jurisdic tion of one pha to the jurisdiction of another pha once family moves the two phas come to an agreement on how to administer the voucher the original pha can choose to forgo the voucher and allow the receiving pha to absorb it meaning that the voucher would be permanently transferred from the old p to the new pha if the voucher is absorbed when the family leaves the program the new pha has the right to reissue the voucher alternatively the original pha can also choose to be billed for the voucher meaning the new pha will administe r the voucher on behalf of the original pha and will seek reimbursement from the original pha for any costs associated with the voucher in billing situation the original pha will retain the voucher as part of its stock and if and when the family leaves the program the original pha can reissue it there are advantages and disadvantages to both billing and absorbing originating phas that bill must forgo portion of their administrative fees and the administration can be complicated originating phas that allow their portability vouchers to be absorbed lose vouchers often in communities where the waiting list for voucher is very long recognizin g these problems phas have the abi lity to limit portability pha can require family to live in its jurisdiction for up to one year upon initial receipt of voucher and p can deny portability move if it will increase phas costs above wh at can be supported by fede ral appropriations in the past proposals have been offered to alter portab ility to make it administratively easier they have ranged from limiting portability except between jurisdictions with preexisting agreements33 to having national pool of vouchers that could be used to smooth out the

contribution toward the rent 30 of the tenants income phas costs fluctuate as tenants income s and market rents increase or decrease prior to fy2003 hud reimbursed phas for the actual cost of their vouchers and each year hud would ask congress for funding sufficient to cover what hud anticipated it would take to fund phas costs due partly to changes in the rental market and partly to changes in the rules of the voucher program such as increases in the payment standard phas actual costs began rising rapidly in 2002 and 200336 this raised concerns for both the administration and congress partly in response to these cost increases the administration proposed potentially costsav ing changes in both the way that phas received funds and in the underlying factors th at led to the cost growth including the amount tenants were asked to contribute toward rent and the maximum payment standard congress reacted by changing only the way that phas receive their funding without enacting other program reforms in fy2005 congress directed hud to fund phas based on what they received in the pr evious year this new funding formula which was continued in fy 2006 was more predictable fo r phas similar to formulas used for other discretionary social pr ograms and easier for hud to administer however it also led to funding problem s for some phas whose actual costs were still driven by the difference between rents and incomes in their communities while their funding was capped as result so pha groups called for either change back to an actual cost funding formula or changes to the structure of the voucher program that would allow them to better control their costs in the fy2007 funding act pl 1105 congress reverted back to funding formula based on actual costs and utilization

the rules of the us housing act and that the agencies will disconnect rentsetting policies from income with the result that tenants will pay increased rents40 while the initial intent of phas may not be to charge higher rent or serve higherincome familie s there is concern that in restricted funding environment such policy changes will have to be made in order to balance budgets the existing mtw program while called demonstration was not implemented in way that would allow it to be effectively evaluated therefore there is not sufficient information about different reforms adopt ed by mtw agencies to evaluate their effectiveness there is some information available about how phas have implemented the program as noted earlier however it is unclear whether phas implementing modified mtw progra m in an environment where funding is limited would make the same choices that earlier mtw agencies made the moving to work charter program act of 2007 the moving to work charter program act of 2007 s 788 would expand and modify the mtw program it would permit the secretary of hud to enter into charter contracts with up to 250 phas similar to the current mtw demonstrat ion the secretary would be permitted to waive all of the aspects of the us housing act except for labor standards and demolition and disposition requirements and phas would be permitted to blend their section 8 and public h ousing funding unlike the current mtw program the mtw charter program would re quire phas to ensure that at least 75 of the families assisted are very lowincome families establish reasonable rent policy designed to encourage employment selfsufficiency and home ownership by participating families and meet other specified additional requirements the housing innovation program the section 8
