foods inc by individuals w ho allegedly became sick sometimes more than once because they ate peanut butter tainted with salmonella according to the plaintiffs conagra did not recall conta minated peanut butter from one plant until february 2007 though the fda suspected that peanut butter manufactured by conagra foods under different brand name s might have been contaminated with salmonella as early as 200511 consumer rights groups seek new statut ory authority that would allow the fda to mandate recalls of food and other products12 however the fdas center for food safety and applied nu trition has argued that cooperation between fda and its regulated industrie s has proven over the years to be the quickest and most reliable method to remove potentially dang erous products from the market13 according to the agency both the fda and industry share an interest in removing unsafe andor defective products from the marketplace14 an industry representative involved in the pet food recall has also argued against additional regulation sa ying that industry could have been more valuable partner in the recall process if it received access to the same information as the fda15 according to the head of the pet food institute which represents us pet f ood manufacturers the communication of such information would have allowed the organiza tion to crossreference lot numbers

recalled due to being potentially contaminated with botulism25 some have argued that the lack of complete information regarding the recall as well as links to webpages not specifically associated with the chili pr oduct recall could result in consumers overlooking relevant inform ation and potentially consu ming tainted products the food marketing institute nonprofit associ ation of retailers and wholesalers that account for the majority of us grocery st ore sales and others have contended that the creation of single food safety ag ency would help in food crisis b ecause the public is faced with lengthy delay while overlapping bureaucracies creak into some attempt at coordina ted response while the search for who knew what and when goes on the crisis worsens and public confidence erodes26 those opposed to the idea of combining fda and usda into single food safety agency assert that such measur would distract the agencies involved from their mission while the reorganization process occurs27 they argue that food security would be compromised and that overlap between agencies is not as significant an issue as many assume28 furthermore critics of single food safety agency point out that coordination between federal state and local government agencies would still be required to address threats to the food supply29 current statutory authority for mandatory recalls the fda possesses mandatory recall authority only with regard to three products infant formula30 medical devices31 and biologic products32 this section provides an overview of the statutory aut horities that exist for recalling these threehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34167crs6 33 ffdca 412f1 34 ffdca 412f2 35 21 cfr 107200 36 ffdca 412f3 see 21 cfr 107230d see also 21 cfr 107250 37 ffdca 412g1 38 id 39 ffdca 412g2products the fda is one of several agenci that comprise hhs therefore the federal food drug and cosme tic act ffdca provisions refer to the secretary of hhs who in turn delegates authority to the fda infant formula the hhs secretary has prescribed regulations for recalls of infant formula begun by manufacturer33 which address the mandatory scope and extent of infant formula recalls necessary and appropriate for the degree of risks to human health presented by the formula subject to the recall34 the regulations for infant formula recalls are av ailable at 21 cfr part 107 subpart infant formula recalls and state in part the following when the food and drug administration determines that an adulterated or misbranded infant formula presents risk to human health manufacturer shall immediately take all actions necessary to recall that formula extending to and including the retail level consistent with the requirements of 21 cfr part 107 subpart e35 the ffdca states that the regulations must require manufacturers that begin an infant formula recall because of risk to human health to request each retail establishment at which such formula is sold or available for sale to post at the point of purchase notice of such recall at such establishment for such time that the secretary determines necessary to inform the public of such recall36 the ffdca also requires manufacturers of infant formula to create and keep records respecting the distribution of infant formula throug h any establishment owned or operated by such manufacturer as may be necessary to effect and monitor recalls37 t h manufacturer must retain such records for at least one year after the expiration of the shelf life of the infant formula38 and the secretary may promulgate regulations regarding recordkeeping if the secretary determines that the required records are not being made or maintained39 medical devices the ffdcas medical devi ce recall authority provisions place requirements on device manufacturers importers distributors retailers and other appropriate persons if the hhs secretary finds that there is reasonable probability that device intended for human use would cause serious adverse health consequences or death then the secretary must issue an order requiring the appropriate person to 1 immediately stop distributing the device 2 immediately notify

which the secretary makes the above determination however the order may be amended to mandate recall of such device the secretarys order must provide the pers on subject to the order with an opportunity for an informal hearing to be held not later than 10 days after the date of the issuance of the order on the actions required by the order and on whether the order should be amended to require recall41 if the secretary determines after the informal hearing that the order should be amende d as such the secretary must amend the order to require the recall set timetable for the recall and require periodic reports describing the recalls progress42 the secretarys amende d order must not include recall of the device from individuals and must not include recall from device user facilities if the secretary determines that the risk of recalling such device from the facilities presents greater health risk than the health risk of not recalling the device from use43 additionally the secretarys amended orde r must provide notice to individuals subject to the risks associated with the use of such device44 to notify individuals regarding the device the statute provides that the secretary may use the assistance of health professionals who prescribed or used such device45 however if significant number of individuals cannot be identified the secretary must notify them via ffdca 705b that provision gives the secretary the broad authority to cause to be disseminated information in situations involving in the opinion of the secretary imminent danger to hea lth or gross deception of the consumer46 recalling device is only one of the methods that the secretary may use to address the risk it presents to the public health the secretary may also notify health professionals who prescribe or use the vice order the manufacturer importer or any distributor to submit plan for repairin g or replacing the device or refunding all or part of the purchase cost of the device and may require the manufacturer importer distributor or re tailer to reimburse for expe nses incurred in carrying out the secretarys order any other person w ho is manufacturer importer

administers50 chapter seven of the fdas regulatory procedures manual also serves as refe rence for fda employees and industry as to recall procedures the manua l is not law and does not bind the fda or industry51 as result only fda regulatory authorities and not the manual are discussed in this report the fda views voluntary industryinitiate d recalls as an alternative to fda legal actions to remove or corr ect products that violate laws52 for example the fda has the power to seize adulterated and misbranded produc ts under the ffdca53 however the agency states that company recall is generally more appropriate and affords better protection for consumers than seizure when many lots of the product have been widely distributed54 the fda may turn to seizure as remedy if the agency has reason to believe that recall w ould not be effective determines that recall is ineffective or discovers that violation is continuing55 industryinitiated r ecalls the fda recommends that companies undertake certain practices that may prepare them for recall or assist them during recall these include 1 creating contingency plan 2 using codes on fdaregulated products that will make it possible to iden tify and recall the fective products and 3 keeping records even beyond the shel f or expected use life of product thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34167crs9 56 21 cfr 759 57 21 cfr 746 58 id one

had not been included in menu foods earlier recalls tested positive for melamine chemical used as fertilizer and in the manufacture of cutlery and kitchenware the fda informed menu foods inc and the

regulations suggest that the firm immediately notify the closest fda district office if the product being recalled would be subject to court action such as seizure for being misbranded or dulterated then the fda deems the companys action to be recall and will ask the busine ss to provide the agency with information on the amount and identity of the product as well as communications about the recall and other data57 fda regulations also provide for instances in which company decides to recall product after being informed by the agen cy that the product in question violates the law but the agency has not specifically requested recall58 in this case the companys decision to recall the product is treated as an industryinitiated recall furthermore agency regulations provide pr ocedures if company begins to remove or correct product in way that the company believes would constitute market withdrawal market withdrawal is fi rms removal or corr ection of distributed product which involves minor violation that would not be subject to legal action by the fda or which involves violati on eg normal stock rotation practices59 if the business is conducting market withdrawal but the reason for the need to remove the product is not clear the fda is willing to help the company ascertain the cause of the problem for example c onsumers may have experienced adverse reactions to the product but the source of the problem may not be obvious or clearly understood60 fdarequested recalls the fda can request business to voluntarily recall fdaregulated produc t however such requests are reserved for urgent situations61 the fda would make such request to the company with primary responsibility for the manufacture and marketing of th defective product62 the fda commissioner can request

adverse health consequences or death66 according to the fda ove r 100 class i recalls of food products occurred in fy2006 and the average number of class i food recalls for the last five fiscal years
