funds the nuclear w eapons complex the complex those sites that develop mainta in manufacture and disman tle nuclear weapons in hearings held in 2004 the house appropr iations committee pre ssed the secretary of energy for systematic review of requirements for the weapons complex over the next twentyfive years the committee expressed its concern that the complex is not well suited to the postcold war s ituation and should reflect presidential decisions on the stockpile as well as issues of cost security and complex size in response the nuclear weapons complex infra structure task for ce of the secretary of energy advisory board prepared repor t released in final form in october 2005 the report indicated that the comp lex had redundant f acilities security concerns high cost excessive competition between the wea pons labs and inadequate equipment for the production plants to redress these problems the task force proposed restructuring the complex it would shift much production and some rd to new nuclear production cen ter probably close one or more plants contract out some nonnuclear work shrink the labs conso lidate facilities and take steps to make governance more effective it was concer ned that current warheads produced during the cold war are inappropriate for the current situation because they have more yield and efficiency than is needed yet are more vulnerable to terrorist threats than is desirable are hard to manufacture are designed close to failure points and will probably become harder to maintain it r ecommends restructuring the nuclear arsenal by producing newdesign reliable replacement warheads rrws with characteristics deemed more suitable to the current environment the report links complex and warheads in the task for ces view rrws would be easier to produce and maintain permitting smaller more efficient and less costly complex observers familiar with the current complex raise several concerns from their perspective closing complex sites and facilities might meet fatal political opposition they maintain that the report s eems to downplay the value of investments in complex facilities over six decades and projects large cost savings through 2030 based on questionable assumptions they fear that shifting key tasks that the nuclear weapons labs perform to othe r sites could disrupt the labs ability to do their work the recommendation to proceed immediately with rrw deals with restructuring weapons rather than the complex and in th is view may go beyond the task forces mandate department of defense official stated that department of defense department of energy agency did not approve the task forces proposed 3step transition to rrw despite the reports strong implication to the contrary while any final decision on deploying rrws must aw ait completion of studies that might possibly reject rrw the task force assumes rrw will proceed and does not examine how its restructured complex would support current warheads some express concern that task force recomme ndations may be at odds with us nuclear nonproliferation policy this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256contents background 1

report stated during the fiscal year 2005 budget hearin gs the committee pressed the secretary on the need for systematic review of requirements for the weapons complex over the next twentyfive years and the secretary committed to conducting such review the secretarys report should asse ss the implications of the presidents decisions on the size and composition of the stockpile the cost and operational impacts of the new design basis threat and the personnel facilities and budgetary resources required to support the smaller stockpile the report should evaluate opportunities for the consolid ation of special nuclear materials facilities and operations across the complex to minimize security requirements and the environmental impact of continuing operations the secretary should assemble team of outside experts to assist with this review prior reviews have largely been conducted by insiders from the weapons complex who produce the predictable but not very credible

the tf reported that there was master plan guiding the complex instead it stated that there were redundant f acilities within the complex excessive competition between the weapons labs an imb alance between the labs with stateof theart experimental facilitie s and the production plants with archaic equipment and special nuclear material snm see appendix at six of the eight complex sites increasing vulnerability to terrorist attack and raising security costs the tf also found current warheads to have undesirable ch aracteristics such as designs offering less safety and ss control over unauthorized use than dod and doe wanted designs that approached too closely the poi nt at which they would fail components that were difficult to manufacture excessive use of exotic or hazardous materials and maintenance that would probably beco ever more costly these problems resulted in high costs as result th task force concluded the status quo is neither technically credible nor

complex operating inte ractively and continuously conducting research nonnuclear testing and w eapon modernization production and dismantlement 4 it would be respons ive to the needs of its customer dod as measure of responsiveness the complex will be designed to respond to any needed design change in less than 18 m onths field protot ype nuclear weapon in less than 36 months and go into full production in less than 48 months and perform an underground test at the nev ada test site within 18 months by 2030 the complex would be in equilibrium producing and dismantling at rate of 125 devices per year 4 the tf would restructure the complex closing some sites building another relocating some experimental facilities and making other such facilities available for use by complex personnel it would di smantle all cold warera weapons the current stockpile by 2030 the replacement warheads and restructured complex would according to the tf be safer more secure and less costly the tf recommended proceeding briskly to implement this vision the task force vision is best achieved at the lowest risk to the nations nuclear deterrent through an aggressive schedule for achieving the 2030 vision with nearterm budget increases resulting in substantially larger accumu lated longterm budget reductions 5 main recommendations of the task force to remedy the perceived problems and implement its vision the tf made two main related recommendations first it creat ed master plan that would restructure the entire complex the plan has several key elements consolidated nuclear producti on center cnpc would produce all components in the nuclear explosive package or nep see appendix including those made from uranium plutonium and high explosives and would asse mble complete nuclear weapons while pantex would dismantle current warheads by 2030 cnpc would dismantle the next generati on of warheads vii 4 cnpc would include facility for fabri cation of plutonium components separate facility for fa brication of uranium co mponents materials research laboratory facility for machining and testing all the insensitive high explosive for the complex though the explosive itself might be procured from out side vendors or dod building for weapons assembly nd disassembly areas to store plutonium and pits another building to store uran ium and secondaries and several other facilities 1416 cnpc would not store deployed warheads4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs4 the y12 plant fabricates and st ores uranium components and assembles and stores secondaries these functions would move to cnpc it thus appears likely that y12 would close pantex could close the tf stat upon dismantlement of the last of the cold war weapons pantex if not the site of the cnpc could be decommissioned 19 while d ismantlement of the last cold war weapon is envisioned to occur by 2030 4 the tf also emphasizes accelerating dismantlement e2 kansas city plant would not be part of cnpc it would continue to produce nonnuclear components ba tteries fuzes bomb casings etc but as many components as practical would be procured from commercial vendors 22 the labs would become smaller the tf states technical staffing levels at the sign laboratories can be significantly reduced as the complex leverages the years of investment in new automated test and computational capabilities at the design laboratories perhaps greater impact on complex staffing levels will be the efficiency realized by personnel moving into continuous design plus weapon production and manufacturing cycles which evolve into family of modular nuclear weapons 23 some large experimental and scientific facilities might move to cnpc or nts and duplicative facilities at more than one lab might be closed and the remaining facility of each type made into user facility ie available to staff of all labs viii j1j3 the tf raises the prospect that one of the two nuclear weapon physics labs alamos national laboratory l anl and lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl mig ht close the longterm requirement for two physics design laboratories will be determined through overall complex performance and needs 4 some lab facilities under considera tion would move to cnpc for example the chemistry and metallurgy research replacement cmrr building at lanl for rd on uranium and plutonium for which construction began in january 2006 would instead be built at cnpc on grounds that other facilities to be placed in cnpc would have similar capability lanl would instead have cmrr lite designed for only laboratory sample levels of material and amenable to commercial security 21 one lab would house highend computing for the entire complex and complex staff at other sites c ould use that sites resources by remote connection 20 the nevada test site might gain several experimental facilities j1 j3 and is possible site for cnpchttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs5 governance would be made more eff ective in the tfs view so as to enable the transformations needed for the complex and the stockpile 25 dodnnsa proj ect officers groups which are key elements in managing integration of warhead with the weapon system throughout the entire life cy cle would have representation from the plants 25 as is bein g done with the reliable replacement warhead program described be low nnsa would have more independence within doe 26 nnsa offices at complex sites would report to the deputy admin istrator for defense programs rather than to the nnsa adminis trator 27 business practices would change 2732 and an ffice of transformation would be the change agent viii that w ould conduct riskbenefit and other analyses to support transfor mation of the complex 33 the problems that the tf found with th complex are intertwined with the products the complex supports accordin gly the second main recommendation of the task force is to proceed promptly w ith family of warheads designed to meet different set of requirement s and constraints than current warheads for detailed discussion of reliable replacement warhead rrw program and the life extension program lep discussed in the balan ce of this section see crs report rl32929 nuclear weapons the reliable replacement warhead program by jonathan medalia current warheads were designed and manufactured during the cold war to meet cold war requirements within the constr aints of the time dod needed warheads with high explosive yield and that had high yield to weight that is they achieved their yield in the lightest package they we re also tightly constrained as to size and shape to meet those goal s nuclear weapon designers used sophisticated design features exotic and hazardous material s and hardtoproduce components and pushed designs close to points where they would fail while these weapons are complex nuclear testing gave designers confidence in their performance however the last us nuclear test was held in september 1992 the united states has observed test moratorium since then to maintain cold warera weapons without testing the complex unde rtakes leps when certain key weapon components deteriorate or otherwise need repl acement an lep seeks to remanufacture these components as closely as possible to the original specifications the reason is that nuclear testing confirmed the safety and reliability of the designs now without testing nnsa chooses to min imize loss of confidence in warheads that use remanufactured components by minimiz ing changes so as to keep the components as close to their original testproven pedigree as possible there is considerable debate about wh ether leps will be able to maintain existing warheads indefinitely supporters ar gue that for nine ears the secretaries of energy and defense have been able to certify that the stockpile remains safe and reliable without resorting to nuc lear testing they have been able to do this because of the existing stockpile stewardship program ssp and key parts of it surveillance of warheads to monitor for defects and life extension programs these various programs have greatly increased knowle dge of weapons performance and potential problems and knowledge of specific w eapon types has likewise increased withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs6 5 statement of ambassador li nton f brooks administrato r national nuclear security administration us department of energy before the senate armed services committee subcommittee on strategic forces apr 4 2005 p 3experience supporters therefore believe that lep should enable the united states to maintain warheads inde finitely without testing nnsa questions the longterm viability of lep according to ambassador linton brooks administrator of nnsa it is becoming more difficult and costly to certify warhead remanufacture the evolution away from tested designs resulting from the inevitable accumulations of sma ll changes over the extended lifetimes of these systems means that we can count on increasing uncertainty in the longterm certification of warheads in the stockpile5 lep also it is argued imposes high costs on the complex the tf states to support this unique stockpile the complex must maintain parts materials processes and even tools that are longer in common use to ensure capability to respond to any stockpile problems thus our current stockpile is extraordinarily expensive to monitor and to maintain 11 because of the costs and potential uncertainties associated with the types of warheads being maintained representative david hobson chairman of the house energy and water devel opment appropriations subc ommittee proposed new approach the reliable replacement warh ead rrw program the fy2005 budget request had included funds for rrw and other committee reports for fy2005 had not referenced it instea d rrw made its first legislative appearance in the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act p l 108447 which provided 90 million for the purpose for fy2006 nnsa requested 94 million for rrw and congress appropriated 250 million the rrw program would design warh eads taking into account the great changes in requirements and missions aff ecting warheads since the end of the cold war there is less need for high yield or for high yieldtoweight ratio accepting reductions in yield and yieldtoweight it is argued would enable weapon designers to move away from the complicated desi gns hardtomanufacture components and exotic materials that characterized cold war weapons instead the tf recommends setting number of design parameters in cluding certification without underground nuclear testing inexpensive manufactur and disassembly ease of maintenance maximizing component reuse and minimizing lifecycle costs 8 the tf views immediate design of reliable replacement warhead as the most important element for transforming the stockpile 13 rrw advocates believe that these characteristics would benefit the complex in their view simpler easiertomanufactur designs could be made with simpler equipment would use less floor space and would have higher throughput reduction in hazardous and ex otic materials would reduce the threat to worker and environmental safety pe rmitting reduction in equipment and floor space designing nuclear explosive packages to incorporate use control and use denialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs7 6 according to ambassador linton brooks if we were designing the stockpile today we would apply new technologies nd approaches to warheadlevel use control as means to reduce physical security costs sta tement of

of physical security required6 these factors would also be expected to reduce cost discussion of task force recommendations in the task force scenario construc tion of modernized complex would be simpler and less costly with several facilities built at single site the tf anticipates that operating costs would be lower for single new cnpc than for several facilities dating back halfcentury or more with security designed into warheads and facilities alike rather than retrofitted the tf projects that physical security costs would be lower it holds that new quipment should be more efficient than combination of new and old equipment and that removing most fissile material from alamos and livermore should reduce their security costs making many experimental facilities into user facilities to the extent that that differs from current practice might reduce costs further in this view the shift to rrw could offer savings and increased confidence in design production maintenance and certification yet some observers main tain that some tf recommendations may prove difficult or impossible to implement the balance of this report discusses some of the task force recommendations reliable replacement warhead program recommendations the tf makes recommendation that it believes is the most important element for transforming the stockpile the task force endorses the immediate initiation of the modernization of the stockpile through the design of the reliable replacement warhead this should lead to family of modern nuclear weapons designed with greater margin to meet military requirements while incorporating stateoftheart surety requirements the task force recommends that new version of the rrw incorporating new design concepts and surety features be initiated on planned fiveyear cycles this family of weapons will form the basis of the sustainable stockpile of the future 13 congressional language calling for the tf report stated that the report should assess the implications of the presidents decisions on the size and composition of the stockpile 7 these decisions were to be inputs for the tf which would then determine how to restructure the complex to implement them similarly the secretary of energy in letter to the tf chair wanted the tf to provide options and recommendations by the end of april 2005 to modernize consolidate and

recommendations on the complex key recommendations concerned the stockpile itself that nnsa proceed with rrw and that dod change the charact eristics it required of warheads in order to facilitate manufacture t he dod should work to relax the military characteristics of its nuclear weapons in order to gene rate the design space necessary for nnsa to develop highmargin manufactur able designs for the future stockpile 34 some feel the tf may have exceeded its mandate by recommending how to redesign nuclear weapons for example seab noted concerns about the tfs work on rrw number of seab members believe that the issue of reliable replacement warhead rrw will need further study by the department of energy and the administration9 on the other hand complex and warheads are linked the goal of the complex is to design and manufacture product and characteristics of the product will necessarily shape the complex complex intended to produce reliable replacement warheads would be expected to differ fro m one intended to c onduct life extension programs there is case to be made for shaping the complex to support rrws the tf finds the status quo is neither technically credib nor financially sustainable ix furthe r ambassador linton brooks ad ministrator of nnsa said that the current stockpile is the wrong one for todays needs technically militarily and politically and from the standpoints of longevity cost and physical security10 if current warheads are as pr oblematic as claimed thoug h others disagree as noted earlier perhaps it makes sense to design complex to support an alternative warhead type yet it may well have been appropriate for the tf to have shaped complex to support leps as well as rrws perhaps with path for the complex to transition to supporting only rrws if congress and the ad ministration later decide to proceed exclusively with that warhead type wh ile congress and the administration support rrw at this early stage that is not the same as commitment to deploy even one rrw type let alone an allrrw stockpile it may turn out that the future stockpile will be allrrw but final decision on whether to manufacture and deploy even the first rrw can be made for several years or more indeed choice among rrw design options is expected until november 200611 if for some reason the administration decides not to proceed with rrw likely fallback position wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs9 12 authors note the joint nuclear weapons council is small doddoe agency established by 10 usc 179 that coordinates nuclear weapons activities between the two departmentsbe to continue maintaining existing warheads using lep in any event the complex will probably conduct leps of cu rrent warheads for many years it thus can be argued that it is premature to design complex based on the assumption that rrw will proceed the fiveyear cycle plan that the tf suggests could offer significant benefits for dod and nnsa continuous design certif ication production nd deployment of nuclear weapons would exercise the comp lex provide realworld training to scientific and produc tion staff minimize agerelated defects in weapons and permit the introduction of new design features into the stockpile developing and maintaining skills would increase dods c onfidence in the complex confidence that the complex could produce warheads in time to respond to adversary efforts to develop threats to the united states the responsive infrastructure that the december 2001 nuclear posture review ca lled for would permit dod to reduce the number of reserve warheads it maintains as hedge to augment the force if needed confidence in the reliability of the new warheads would permit dod to reduce the number of warheads it maintains as reliability backups in case problems emerge with deployed warheads reducin g warhead numbers and incorporating new usecontrol features could reduce dods security costs saving large sums in other ways however continuous sign and production might impose high costs rrws are supposed to be easier to maintain than current warheads replacing one generation of rrw s with another as the tf suggests 7 rather than maintaining the first would appear to forgo the maintenance advantage while incurring large costs for designing nd producing new warheads and dismantling those being replaced b some claim that rrw might permit stockpile of fewer designs while at least two warhead types are currently available for each type of delivery system one rrw design might be used on more than one type of delivery system that approach could save mone by reducing the number of designs and spare units in the stockpile simplifying production and mainte nance and permitting smaller complex that advantage could be lost if steady stream of rrw designs entered and left the stoc kpile c firstgenera tion rrws would presumably incorporate large gains in technology made since the last warhead was designed two decades ago if those rrws meet the high standards required to be certified for the stockpile though technical gains from subse quent generations might be modest d an ongoing production and replacement prog ram would require larger and more costly complex than that needed to produce firstgeneration rrws and maintain them for decades through leps such program might raise proliferation concerns as discussed below the tf introduces new element into the rrw program block transition transition strategy emerging from the dod would put the nation on new path toward the sustainable stockpile this strategy already endorsed by the nuclear weapons council12 is based on the rrw concept an rrw weapon design is responsive to an existing weapon mission but moves the stockpile toward thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs10 sustainable stockpile of the future its introduction is made possible by segmenting the current leps into discrete blocks block 1 would incorporate the current lep design but would be truncated much sooner than normally planned and transitioned to the block 2 design rrw1 which would include some but probably not all attributes of the future stockpile as soon as practical block 2 would be transitioned to block 3 rrw2 which w ould incorporate all the attributes of the future stockpile implementation of this rrw block change strategy system by system would ensu re smooth transition to sustainable nuclear stockpile and eventually to stockpile designed for modern deterrence 1213 block 2 could provide faster route to upgrading the stockpile than move directly to block 3 it would presumably incorporate features that were easier to design and manufacture leaving more diffi cult ones for block 3 as steppingstone to block 3 block 2 would in effect func tion as pilot project that would reveal potential difficulties in design and manuf acture thus fac ilitating design and manufacture of subsequent rrw s and lowering their costs block 2 would also be consistent with the tfs proposal for an ongoing cycle of design and manufacture with block 2 warheads done in the first cycle and block 3 warheads in the next it is however hard to know if these dvantages would materialize because the tf does not provide clear definition of block 2 even though block 2 could involve billions of dollars for new warheads the only references to it in the entire report are in the paragraph quoted above long with brief mention on page 34 block 2 warheads would appare ntly include some features of current designs and some features of rrw designs but it is not clear which changes would render warhead block 2 warheads using components outside the nuclear explosive package such as radars that have been modified from the original design would probably not be considered as block 2 such components are tested extensively in the laboratory as part of existing leps warheads designed around newlymade pits of selected old designs might be counted as block 2 becau the state of the art in design and manufacture has advanced cons iderably over the years pit designs from several decades ago might be simpler to manufacture than current designs that press the state of the art the fact that they have been tested would facilitate certificati on on the other hand they would not have some key rrw features and would divert resources from block 3 rrws warheads designed around old pits might be considered as block 2 but in addition to the drawbacks noted above the warheads would have short service life if the pits used were near the end of their service lives the most certain approaches to cer tifying replacement warhead without nuclear testing are at one extreme to replicate the original design as closely as possible or at the other to create new design that is simple enough to permit high confidence in order to maximize yield to weight and achieve other design goals allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs11 13 the preceding information in this paragr aph was provided in personal communications november and december 2005components of cold warera warheads are designed to work together with little performance margin to spare with such tight design small changes in materials or manufacturing processes can reduce confidence in performance that is why the complex goes to great lengths to minimize differences from original specifications when designing and producing replacement components despite the absence of nuclear testing the labs have been certif ying for continued use in the stockpile current warhead designs that incorporat replacement component s that are not exact replications at the same time the labs believe that they w ill be able to certify rrws without testing by designing in greater performance margins in contrast the labs have said nothing to indicate that they could certify anything between these extremes such as block 2 warheads as result any potential advantages from block 2 replacement warhead might be lost owing to difficulty in certification or in acceptability to dod it might be argued that surer path to confidence in replacement warheads would be to skip bl ock 2 and move to block 3 directly even if the threeblock approach coul d be done successfully it would apparently result in three distinct designs one lep one rrw and one in between for each warhead type for example w76 block 1 2 and 3 block 2 would be neither the original weapon with which the comple x has extensive experience nor the final rrw which would be in the stockpile for years to come but transient interim design sustaining producing and mainta ining the three designs would appear to require far more complex resources than would be required for one design per warhead type steve henry deputy assistant to the secretary of defense for nuclear matters in the office of the secretar of defense stated that the nuclear weapons council voted to study the feasibility of relia ble replacement warhead and if the study proved successful to endorse transition directly from leps of currentdesign warheads to the rrw program counc il study group considered other options including block 2 but did not recommend th em to the council because those options could not achieve critical rrw program goal s such as enhancements to safety and use control in addition the study gr oup was concerned that pursuing block 2 option would be costly and could dela the rrw program beyond the time when nuclear weapon designers with underground test experience would retire raising certification difficulties13 therefore block 2 is onl recommendation of the task force not of the nuclear weapons council cost issues to analyze costs of its recommendations the tf set forth three cases baseline case with flat budget in fy2005 dollars for the period 20062030 if the baseline budget is the fy2006 request for the complex the tf finds that the total cost for 20062030 would be some 170 billion the tf rejects this case because it would not lead to the tfs vision for the future complex thereby representinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs12 very high risk option for maintaining the nations nuclear deterrent e1 complex transformation in place case involving minor changes to the complex and the stockpile there would be consolidation of snm and cnpc exis ting production facilities would continue in place rrw begins but most leps continue like the baseline this case would not lead to the tf vision for the future complex because the physical pl ant especially the production facilities will not be transformed into the 21st century the tf states that this option involves risks especially beyond 2020 when pit lifetime warhead reliability and dismantlement become issues the tf calculates that this case would cost about 5 billion more than the baseline case in 2005 dollars e1 revolutionary complex tr ansformation case involving consolidation of snm maximum acceleration of cnpc and implementation of the other tf recommendations the tf finds this case would cost 10 billion total above the baseline case for the period 20062015 but would save 25 billion for 20162030 saving 15 billion over the 25year period about half the extra 10 billion is to accelerate dismantlement and half to accelerate cnpc the case would manage risk by having rrw proceed on responsive schedule the results are sensitive to assumptions on the extent of leps cnpc operating efficiencies reductions in physical security costs and efficiencies from improved business practices costs could be reduced by delaying the start of cnpc operations closing some facilities and reductions in force at the labs etc but the tf finds that such steps w ould increase risk e2e3 in its analysis the tf judges that th baseline case involves high risks that minor tweaks to the complex in the transformation in place case increase cost and risk that large upfront investment woul d yield large savings some years from now and that the calculated costs and savings depend heavily on various assumptions its revolutionary transformation case shows that proceeding with complex modernization and rrw in ta ndem would reduce both cost and risk the latter case makes 5 billion investment to accelerat dismantlement of warheads the tf concludes that so doing reduces the sign ificant security and storage cost burden on the complex 24 further the tf woul d have pantex dismantle existing weapons and upon dismantlement of th last of the cold war weapons pantex if not the site of the cnpc could be decommissioned 19 finding that savings from accelerating dismantlement woul d exceed the 5 billion that the tf allocates to that purpose would be significant these cost and schedule estimates however could prove optimistic for number of reasons because the

delays the tf states historically doe projects are either underestimated or have scope creep that drive the projects above their budgeted estimates histori cal doe completed construction costs are in the range of 13900 to 33000 per square foot of construction this wide range ca lls into question the accuracy of estimates of cnpc cost and thus of savings the tf projects mpf modern pit facility see pit producti on issues below to cost in the range of 14400 to 19400 per squa re foot h2 estimating mpf cost at the bottom of the hist orical range of doe construction costs seems highly op timis tic given that it is probably the facility within cnpc that would have the highest requirements for safety and security and produces one of the most difficulttomanufacture components of nuclear weapon combination of delays and cost growth would increase investment costs and shorten the period th rough 2030 in which operational savings could accrue tipping the balance between investment costs and operational savings toward the former the tf proposes reducing the footprint of mpf as one option to reduce cost h5 much of the co st of complex facility is for planning proceeding through the nepa process selecting site obtaining the needed permits designing the facility and especially for snm facilities providing the requisite security if nnsa later needed to add capacity at mpf it would be much more costly and timeconsuming to secure any needed permits perhaps repeat the nepa process redesign the facility shut it down if construction so required and finally undertake the construction than it would be tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs14 build extra floor space at the outset and install equipment later if required it is thus arguable that mpf should be built with more floor space than is needed initially rather than the minimum according to the report the task force used budget details from the fy 2006 nnsa congressional budget submission appendix d to form the basis of financial comparisons and estimates made within this report xi the fy2006 nnsa budget submission goes through fy2010 it seems an insufficient basis for estimating costs and savings going out quartercentury that document also appears to have limited value for estimating rrw expenses even for the period it covers the pr ojected rrw budg et for fy2006 fy2010 in the fy2006 request simply uses the amounts that would have been allocated to the advanced concepts initiative nuclear weapons research and study program that congress terminated in the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl

february 2005 to prepare detailed prog ram and budget for rrw forgoing the value of sunk costs the complex has developed over more than 60 years during that time it has accumulated many buildings and much equipment and infrastructure given that history the complex is probably far less efficient than complex of new design and construction woul d be the complex that the tf recommends would incorpor ate new facilities liminate redundant ones and probably close some sites these step s are predicted to re duce operational costs including security the tf anticipates that conducting manufacturing using modern processes in new buildings making easiertomanufacture components for rrws would save large sums on the other hand the united states has i nvested many billions of dollars in the complex over the years it could be argued that abandoning some of this investment which has been built and is now operating on the basis of an analysis showing reduced operating costs over the long run would be taking budgetary risk by closing some major facilities and perhaps some sites sunk costs would certainly be lost whether reduced operating costs woul d exceed the costs of closing existing facilities and building new ones is less certain and as the tf notes depends heavily on the assumptions used following are examples of sites and facilities whose sunk costs might be lost under the tf

workforce for the complex it finds that the complex is rapidly losing experienced nuclear design experts 1 it was delighted to find generation of young people entering the complex 3 it notes the enduring key to maintaining safe reliable stockpile of nuclear weapons is the quality of people 22 some of its recommendations are made with goal of strengthening expertise it stresses the absolute necessity of resuming design activities now such that those who still have the benefit of real testing experience can mentor the nextgeneration designers in the complex 23 several of its recommenda tions however might undercut this workforce or seem to rely on workforce that may not exist the tf states that as the complex is transformed it will need to develop talent pool of personnel experienced in modern production technologies and processes the task force believes that thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs17 personnel s hould come from commercial hightech background not from within the complex 23 the plants have modern equipment and workers trained to operate it as well as old equipment yet the recommendation could be viewed as downplaying the value of the workers skills many of which are unique to the complex suggesting that workers skills may not meet current needs and implying that existing workers will not be trained in the skills needed could be seen as showing lack of confidence in the workforce that could harm morale even rrw will require workforce experienced in handling and machining snm it is also not clear that personnel with commercial high tech background would have the expertise to work on nuclear weapons production or that they would want to do so as the specialized skills required might be difficult to market in the civilian economy narrowing their career options the tf would locate cnpc in sp arselypopulated area in order to reduce the effect that terrorist attack on the facility would have on nearby communities it consid ers llnl lanl y12 and pantex sufficiently close to residential and commercial structures such that any partially successful terrorist attack on these sites may cause collateral damage to the rrounding civilian population and associated assets 19 if lanl y12 and pantex are considered too densely populated for safety cnpc would have to be located in an even more rural area yet it could prove difficult to hire thousands of people in rural area who come from commercial hightech background nd could take years to provide the requisite security clearances and training the problem would be eased somewhat by the length of time needed to build cnpc the tf envisions the comple x producing and dismantling 125 warheads per year and states second shift would provide surge capacity in pit production or weapon assembly should it be required 5 it does not indicate the source of workers to constitute the projected second shift potentia l problem in rural areas would the complex train second cadre of people with these skills and then provide them with work sufficient to maintain these skills so they would be available if need ed manufacturing typically requires some depth of personnel to back up workers who are ill on vacation in training etc but it is unclear if these added personnel would suffice to operate an entire shift especially for an extended time the director of

laboratories the role of the nuclear weapons laboratories and the resources they requi re have been perennially contentious issues some have argued fo r raising or lowering the amount spent on experimental facilities fo r reducing funds for indepe ndent research for limiting nonweapons work and the like some are c oncerned that having two physics design labs alamos and lawrence livermore results in excessive redundancy cost and competitiveness in this regard the tf shows an ambivalence concerning competition and cooperation at the labs regarding comp etition the current complex needs to initiate design competition immediatel for family of modern replacement weapons 4 and each weapon design inco rporated into block change should be the result of formal competition between lanl and llnl each supported by snl sandia national laboratories 34 regarding coopera tion within the complex the physics design laboratories lanl nd llnl aggressively seek independence rather than cooperative interdependence resu lting in re dundant programs and facilities increasing costs and reducing productivity nd the production sites are under funded vi regarding both the challenges to the complex will require competition for the best design concepts followed by coopera tion in implementing the winning design and cooperation in the cer tification 19 of particular concern the three design laboratories routinel compete with each other and set their own requirements as justification for new facilities and redundant research funding in the fear that one laborator may become superior the net result is that the complex sites are competing for programmatic funds and priorities rather than relying upon their divergent and complementary strengths and thereby operating as truly interdependent team with shared success and rewards 2 the tf recommends number of changes to the labs that seek to reduce redundancy save money and foster cooperation it would eliminate many research facilities and capabilities from the labs in order to consolidate them it would store all category i and ii quantities of snm at cnpc 4 move rd on category i and ii quantities of snm to cnpc 15 close ta55 as pit production plant 15 move rd on all but small quantities of explosives to cnpc or nts 15 and consid er consolidating the type of experiments done by darht nd site 300 at nts 21 j3 the tf proposes that there be only one capability ie highend computing machine location in the complex single location would more effectively leverage staff and infrastructure usershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs19 would be and should be highly distributed this would tend to enhance expertise and substantially reduce operating costs 20 the tf favors making some large facilities at single lab into user facilities that is shareduse facilities that would be run by the host lab but available to users from other labs it proposes that nnsa can reduce operating costs and promote teamwork by designating many of its facilities as user facilities examples of such facilities are the highenergy density devices eg the nif llnls national ignition facility the zmachine at sandia omega laser facility at the university of rochester as well as the facilities involved in such activ ities as hydrotesting site 300 and the darht facility he high explosives testing snm testing and tritium research 28 further over the last 12 years the sciencebased stockpile stew ardship program has made an enormous investment in new capability and test facilities in the three design laboratories the task force believes that these are valuable complex assets and shoul d be operated as asse ts for the benefit of the complex not the host site 20 the tf calls for elimination of redundant nonweapons relevant research and testing 33 the tf accepts the prospect of smaller labs the weapons laboratories of the future will lik ely have smaller nuclear weapons program staff than they have today 19 critics of the tf report are likely to raise number of issues concerning these recommendations regarding user facilities some current laboratory facilities have been operated in this manner for many years the labs treat major facilities such as nif sandias z machine and the alamos neutron science center as national assets because it would be too costly to replicate maintain and staff them at two or three labs they are instead made available for use by complex staff and in some cases by academic and industrial researchers the tf would have lab scientists travel to cnpc or nts to do some work this would result in additional effort expenditure of time and costs and would separate work at those sites from other relevant equipment and expertise at the labs it is also uncertain if these sites could provide the needed support the tf states that cnpc would include center for research on snm as user facility for laboratory staff and cnpc staff would provi all requisite equipment and technical support staff to support th design laboratories science and engineering users 15 but the existing facilities at the labs for snm rd have been developed over many

therefore 3 undermine the development and deployment of rrw20 lanls director is also concer ned about changes affecting key experimental facilities rrw design certification will push the limits of current predictive tools the seab recommends that these critically important tools be consolidated transferred or eliminated putting rrw at risk21 the tf approach raises more general issues as well regarding the labs cooperationcompetition rela tionship lanl and llnl c ooperate in many ways such as peer review of weapon designs joint use of computa tional and experimental facilities and collaboration on scientific research at the same time they are by design and evolution competitive in their most important stre ngth nuclear weapon design during the cold war they creat ed competing designs in response to military requirements for new weapons in thes competitions sandias albuquerque branch teamed with lanl and sandias livermore branch teamed with llnl this competition continues with the design for rrw many analysts believe that design competition is especially important now that nuclear testing is not available to check warhead performance in this view competitions require competitors nuclear weapon design competitions require riva l labs in order to explore differing approaches and to challenge competing desi gn teams redundant facilities at the two labs help make competition possible by providing each lab with similar base of resources some supporting the current labor atory system hold that if the tf wants competition there must be redundancy becau it would be difficult to have one without the other even more than research facilities the core strength of the labs is arguably their ability to bring many disciplines to b ear on weapon problems each lab is community with each member drawing on the skills of many others and each contributing to the research needs of many others because of the complexity of nuclear weapons solving typical wea pon problem draws on many skills resident at lab including physics chemistry metallurgy computer operation computer modeling engineering mech anical chemical electrical inst rumentation andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs21 22 alamos national laboratory inertia l confinement fusion mission statement available at httpwwwlanlgovprogramsicfmissionshtmlexperimentation designing weapon also draws on many skills similarly research facilities support multiple areas of expertise only fe w laboratory staff may operate an experimental facility computer center research laboratory building and the like but single experiment may draw on many skills and may contribute data valuable to staff in many areas of the weapons pr ogram accordingly some are concerned that removing one major scientific resour ce would be likely to disrupt work in number of areas the tf would shift resources in numbe r of crucial areas of weapons science it would remove highend computation facility from most labs and would move much work on snm and he from the labs to cnpc and nts snm high explosives experimentation and computati on are critical to nuclear weapon labs and are often interdependent nuclear explosion requires he and snm experimentation provides da ta on the behavior of nuclear weapons computer modeling integrates data from experiments scientific theory and past nuclear tests to improve understanding of weapons performance and of the relevant theory the tf would move category i and ii snm to cnpc and nts yet llnl and lanl are currently conducting socalled accelerat ed aging experiments on plutonium to provide better estimate of pit life which is crucial for determining future pit production requirements th experiments use more than category ii amounts of plutonium so the tf plan would seem to bar that work from the labs both labs dismantle pits which have category i quantity of snm to inspect them for age related changes the tf would appa rently move pit production from ta55 to cnpc yet ta55 could arguably be used to experiment w ith producti on thods and as pilot plant in addition to servin g as backup to mpf some believe that removing major scientific facilities from the labs could impair recruiting laboratory staff have stated for many years that outstanding scientific facilities attract outstanding recruits for example go of the laser sciencebased stockpile stewardship program at alamos is to exploit excellent highquality science in recruiting22 while the tf envisions the prospect of smaller weapons pr ogram staff critics of the tf report maintain that nuclear weapons laboratory requi res certain set of skills regardless of stockpile size they point out that staffing assumptions based on the more limited range of skills that the tf seems to believe may be required by the rrw concept implicitly rest on other assumptions that the rrw concept will appear after study able to meet its goals that the administration and congress will choose to replace many current warheads with rrws and that designing and engineering such new warheads will require smaller skill set than is needed to maintain existing designs they question whether such farreaching assumptions should be present basis for planning future lab needs regarding the possible impact of imp rovements in computing on reducing numbers of laboratory staff the tf states technical staffing levels at the design laboratories can be significantly reduced as the complex leverages the years of investment in new automated test and computational capabilities at the designhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs22 23 on the latter point see eileen patterson r ender safe defusing nuclear emergency alamos research quarterly fall 2002 2223 24 personal interviews alamos livermore and sandia stafflaboratories 23 improved computing s greatly increased the capability of lab staff so they are able to do better work and presumably more work per hour this does not necessarily mean that fewer people are needed laboratory staff state that chemist cannot do the work of weapon signer designer who specializes in weapons primary stage cannot design secondary stage and computers cannot mentor new staff they also questi on whether automated test equipment and enhanced computational capabilities would permit significant reductions in technical staff at the labs having highend computer at each lab offers important benefits it helps each lab recruit and retain talented computer specialists who are attracted by the opportunity to work on such machines ving top computation talent at each lab makes computer specialists more easily accessible to specialists in the many if not all disciplines who depend on highend computing it can be argued that providing highend machines for all the labs permits them to try different approaches to computer and software design and aids competition between the labs complex relying on one highend computer center coul d face the risk that connectivity to the labs would fail or become overloaded b ecause it takes several years to design program and install highend computers nd make them operationa l managers of single highend computer center serving the entire complex might be unwilling or unable to introduce new machines very ofte n in contrast supporters of the current laboratory system maintain that with each lab having its own highend computers which may phase in at different times highcapability computer is likely to be introduced into the complex more often than would be the case with single complexwide computation site clearly supporting one location instead of four would save on procurement operation and maintenance at issue is whether the savings outweigh the benefits of the current approach laboratory staff have stated over the years that sharply curtailing nonweapons work as the tf proposes would harm the labs the labs conduct much non weapons research some is related to s ecurity such as nonpro liferation c onventi onal defense technology and homel and security for example weapons scientists help interpret intelligence data relevant to nuclear proliferation and study how to disarm potential terrorist nuclear weapons23 the labs perform other work in areas such as energy global climate modeling the human genome traffic flow modeling and basic research such work aids recruiting interviews with laboratory staff suggest that few graduate students star t out intending to do nuclear weapons work but as postdoctoral fellows some come to th labs to work on nonweaponsrelevant projects and then move to classified weapons work24 permitting staff to do some work that they and their laboratory deem as having high potential value aids morale skill development nd retention as well as leadin g to useful new technologies critics maintain that re moving nonweapons work could harm weapons work because the two often benefit from each others resources and

equipment and facilities 1 congress and nnsa recognize these problems as well and have begun to address them by among other things directing part of the budget to the plants for specific purposes and including facilities and infrastructure recapitalization program for which 1509 million was appropriated for fy2006 cnpc proposes more comprehensive solution with cnpc for nuclear com ponents and more contracting out for nonnuclear ones the industrial model that the tf applie s to the plants however may have some deficiencies in dealing with nuclear w eapons production for one as an organizing principle cost has been accorded lowe r ranking in the design and production of nuclear weapons than in other areas of indus try the tf states strong leaders and healthy organizations must have commitme nt to success not perfection successful businesses know when products and services are good enough and recognize that cost is one of the metrics for excellent performance 25 and aggressive cost goals are achievable on new weapon component designs and cost goal adds healthy degree of discipline to the design process 9 many would maintain that when designing and manufacturing nuclear w eapons in contrast to many commercial products only something close to perfecti on is good enough during the cold war cost was much less important than warhead safety and reliability while cost is more salient considerati on now nuclear weapon experts hold that safety and reliability are and will remain of greater importance the tf also suggests design tocost model which may not be appropriate

perform specific task s many of which are at the state of the art and unique to the complex at the lowest price if that price is greater than the targeted design cost what happens the tf recommends outsourcing of nonnuc lear components the complex is strongly encouraged to purchas these components and assemblies from commercial industrial ve ndors to the degree practical given classification and security requirements 14 while this has been done for years to limited extent expanding the scope of outsourcing could encounter many problems qualifying vendors such as by assuring compliance with quality assurance standards obtaining security clearances for workers and installing security apparatus for facilities would be burdensome to companies even if nnsa bor the monetary costs some nonnuclear components would be procured in small lots that woul d be economically unattractive to vendors some would be of old design or would use nonstandard manufacturing techniques so would not

if kcps workload drops significantly it would have difficulty maintaining diverse set of skills these problems could become significant large shrinkage of the plant could put producti on of certain nuclear weapon components at risk if key vendor went out of business or chose not to continue its work one tf recommendation on outsourcing mig ht be seen as potential conflict of interest in keeping with its approach to outsourcing nonnuclear components the tf recommends outsourcing producti on of beryllium and beryllium oxide components immediately if services can be obtained from quality commercial vendors 22 tf member is director of technology at brush wellman iii that company bills itself as the only fully in tegrated producer of beryllium and beryllium oxide in the world26 the tf would also outsource storage of components to save money on security for security cost savings most of these nonnuclear components would be stored at the commercial vendors location or another complex facility but consistent with justintime commercial practices 16 however total security cost could arguably be higher if component s were made at dozens of industrial plants each of which would seemingly have to be secured rather than at kcp which has security in place and elaborate procedures for accounting fo r these components as they work their way through the transportation system might hamper justintime deliveries the recommendations could affect pantex upon dismantlement of the last of the cold war weapons pantex if not the site of the cnpc could be decommissioned for the

certification has not yet been comple ted nnsa does not view ta55 as having sufficient capacity for the long term in stead nnsa has planned for modern pit facility or mpf with capacity of 125 pits per year the tf would locate all of mpfs functions at cnpc 15 as discussed below congressional acti ons have raised questions about the future of mpf that facility might proceed on the other hand decision not to proceed with it would call into question the future of cnpc because mpf would arguably be cnpcs most important facility the tf analysis of mpf and ta55 is discussed here to cast light on the role of ta55 and consid erations involved in establishing pit production program the schedule and capacity required for pit production hinge on several factors pit life the tf states that the pits in the stockpile were made between 1978 and 1990 actually 1989 and that the best current estimate of pit life from the weapons labs is minimum of 45 to 60 years 12 thus the entire stoc kpile may need to be turnedover by 2035 to 2050 depending on the accep table level of uncertainty in pit lifetime 12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs26 30 nnsa requirements for modern pit facility summary p 6 31

production rate of 125 pits per year cnpc must be functional by 2014 with pit life of 60 year s that date shifts to 2034 17 either case assumes that ta55 pr oduces 50 pits per year 17 from 2012 til

pits per year by the end of fy200730 the tf envisions boosting that capacity to 50 pits per year by fy2012 34 higher capacity at ta55 would permit lower capacity at mpf or delay in reaching given capacity at mpf alternatively it appears that the tf would close production at ta 55 when cnpc opens as noted earlier if ta55 were kept ope n then it and mpf could meet stockpile requirements more easily than mpf alone without mpf ta55 would require very large increase in capacity to maintain stockpile of 3200 warheads ability to reuse pits the tf stat that reuse of young plutonium pits less than 45 years old nd of canned sec ondary assemblies should be evaluated 9 reusing young pits would reduce the number of pits that would have to be made before then perhaps permitting lay in mpf until pit life and future weapon requirements became clearer in contrast if ta55 is to be the sole us pit facility its capacity would have to be increased sharply even if young pits are used much more capacity is needed than simply enough to provide pits for direct stockpile use unde r the moscow treaty the united states and russia will each have 1700 to 2200 operationally deployed strategic nuclear warh eads by the end of 2012 other warheads would be needed for t actical missions and for nondeployed reserves the tf assumes stockpile of 3200 warheads nnsa notes that additional pits must be manufactured because some units will be scrapped because of manufact uring defects while others will be needed to meet requirements for replacements for pits destroyed in the course of evalua ting

need to know what size were going to build first and how many were going to build im not opposed to building new modern pit facility but this numbers thing drove nuts and until we get there were just not going to do it37 consequently the tf recommendation to greatly accelerate the current pit production schedule despite congressi onal opposition to mpf unres olved concerns over mpf characteristics and sharp constraints on capacity at ta55 would appear problematic second it may be difficult to find site for cnpc for example as noted earlier the office of the governor of nevada opposed siting mpf at nts even if site is found it would take years to complete the nepa process obtain the needed permits design and build the facility and prepar it for operation lawsuits by national nongovernmental organizations or local gr oups could further lay site selection third the tfs estimates of capacity and schedule for mpf and ta55 are at odds with those of nnsa the tf states classified supplement2 analyzes the issue of timing for the cnpc for stockpile of 2200 active and 1000 reserve and the expected pit manufacturing capacity of the future complex the conc lusion is that if the nnsa is required to 1 protect pit lifetime of 45 years 2 support the above stockpile numbers and 3 demonstrate production rates of 125 production pits to the stockpile per year the cnpc must be functional by 2014 if one accepts the uncertainty of pit lifetime of 60 years the cnpc can be delayed to 2034 in either case ta55 is assumed to be producing 50 production pits to the stockpile per year 17 footnote 2 in text classified supplement to the nwcitf report recommendations for the nuclear weapons complex of the future in contrast nnsa states minimu m production capacity of about 125 pits per year starting in 2021 is required to support reduced stockpile as reflected in the june 2004 stockpile plan assuming 60year pit lifetime and the current nnsa planning approach for an mpf of 125 pits per

discussed earlier some would be spares or withheld to ex amine later for aging problems or destined to replace pits that detailed evaluation re nders unusable others would be rejected because of manufacturing defects the tf envisions an nnual mpf production rate of 125 pits to the stockpile40 while nnsa envisions mpf producing 125 total pits per year thus the capacity of the tfs mpf would be substantially larger than that of nnsas mpf nnsas plan for mpf is to start construction in 2012 and full scale production in 2021 the tf calls for an operational mpf with capacity well beyond 125 pits per year 7 years ahead of nnsas schedule at the same time the tf envisions modi fying ta55 to produce 50 pits per year by 2012 it is not clear that that is feas ible nnsas goal is to have ta55 produce 10 pits per year by the end of fy200741 and is planning to increase that figure to 30 40 per year sometime after 2010 accordin g to report of an interview with ambassador brooks42 modifying ta55 to produce 50 pits per year starting in 2012 would require larger inve stment and the schedule might prove difficult to meet as discussed under forgoing the valu of sunk costs the tf would shut production at ta55 when mpf opens at cn pc which could in the tf plan be as early as 2014 if mpf proceeds the logic of spending large sums to turn ta55 into production facility and then closing it fo r production after only 2 years is open to question on several grounds most of the pot ential value of the investment would be lost after converting ta55 so that its main mission was production it might be desirable at added cost to reconvert it back to re search facility once production halted because plutonium fac ilities are extremely costly and ta55 is the largest such facility in the complex if mpf were to open ta55s pr oduction capacity would appear to be of potential value in many ways as an engineering facility to test new production techniques as pilot plant to test and improve th producibility of new pits as surge producer in case the intern ational situation called for added capacity as source of extra production to fix unanticipated warhead problems without disrupting mpfs production schedule as boutique producer of small lots of pits for new or modified nuclear weapons nd as backup production facility in case mpf must shut down so as to avoid to tal halt to weapons production as occurred when rocky flats pit production endedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs30 finally the tf raises the prospect that newe r pits could be reused if this is the case then fewer new pits would be neede d as result the capacity required by pit facility could be reduced or the pit production schedule extended security in the tf plan cnpc would be the only site in the complex for category i and ii snm 14 15 this ma terial would be moved from pantex and y12 assuming cnpc is not located at either site and from lanl and llnl part of the rationale is to reduce security costs cnpc would probably achieve that objective whether it would reduce the overall threat to the complex vii is less clear it would reduce the number of sites and communities that could be targets of terrorist attacks 24 but reducing the number of potential terrorist targets would seem to increase security only if there is concern about the possibility of an attack on multiple complex sites at the same time if terrorists could attack only one site having more sites with fewer assets at each would make each site lowervalue target which could reduce the risk of att ack on any one site conversely locating many facilities at single site would seem to make that site more attractive terrorist target it is far from certain that any complex site would rise to the top of terrorist target list given that these sites are well defended and large in area related tf goal is that consolida tion would result in reduction of risk to adjacent civilian populations currently the llnl lanl y12 and pantex sites are sufficiently close to residential and co mmercial structures such that any partially successful terrorist attack on these sites may cause collateral damage to the surrounding civilian population an d associated public and pr ivate assets 19 of these four sites only llnl is located in denselypopulated area yet the tfs consideration of relocating plutonium rd to llnl 35 would require increasing the inventory of plutonium at that laboratory for the threat of snm release to occur as result of terrorist attack on comp lex site several step s would be required terrorists would have to attack the site wh ich would be difficult given site security they would have to gain access to snm which additional security features would render very difficult they would then ve to seize and det onate bomb although there are few complete weapons in the co mplex other than at pantex and complete weapons are well protected lternatively they might try to seize and disperse snm as dirty bomb but snm is poor choice for dirty bomb because it is very much less radioactive or accessible than such radioactive materials as cobalt60 or cesium 137 reducing risk to adjacent population th us seems questionable rationale for cnpc nonproliferation critics hold that the tf report might adversely affect us nuclear nonproliferation efforts the lead sentence of the report states that the goal of the nuclear weapons program has shifted to sustaining existing warheads for the indefinite future v even though stat party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty including the united states agreed in article vi to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament the tf recommends continuous design and production on family of modular nuclear w eapons 23 this might likewise be interpreted as inconsistent with the npt the tf says it is confident that the complex can now design nuclear weapon th at is certifiable without the need for undergr ound testing vi this has been true since 1945 designers were so confident in the hiroshima bomb that it was dropped without test of its design

that the stockpile stewardship program is intended to enable the united states to design weapons without testing43 the tf statement might be taken as support of this point the tf recommends considerin

certification becomes increas ingly important 10 nuclear weapon experts maintain that final stockpile certification may become more or less difficult but never more or less important asserting that it has always been of the utmost importance the ta55 facility is not being run as production unit but rather as research and compliance driven facility pr oductivity is about 5 of what would be required and achievable of an industrial operation in the same facility with the same task h1 high producti on rate however was not the goal of ta55s pit production program after rocky flats clos ed doe could have converted part of ta55 to more efficient production by taki ng out existing equipment and installing new production lines but that could have taken years and been expensive instead doe chose to

to make certifiable pit until the processes can be shown to work and pits can be certified and decision on mpf can be taken and decision reach ed on where to conduct plutonium rd and the type of pits

benchmarks for pr oduction of plutonium components at mpf the tf stated since there is little commercial experience with plutonium the study group tf subgroup looked at beryllium manufacturing

difficulties now labs and plants exhibit much more concern about ease of manufacture for example the tw design teams routinely consult with the plants on this topic ease of manufacture is goal of rrw and plant representatives participate in the rrw project officers group the focal point of rrw activity redundancy has value in certain instances for example rocky flats plant was the only site in the complex that made pits for the stockpile when production at ro cky flats plant halted in 1989 the complex could longer produce nuclear weapons as result today the united states is the only nuclear weapons power without productionlevel capability to manufacture plutonium pits for the nuclear arsenal45 supporters of the current comple x maintain that there are many examples to counter the tf statem ent that the complex is unable to solve problems the ability of the complex to create scores of warhead designs and to produce ma ny thousands of units during the cold war the ability of the co mplex to increase its understanding of nuclear weapon behavior through the ssp and the ability of the complex to maintain the nuclear stockpile after the cold war so that doe and dod could certify its safety and reliab ility annually for nine years so far another example is the ability of the complex to recapture the pit manufacturing process despite long hiatus between 1989 when rocky flats ma nufactured the last certified pit 2003 when lanl delivered the first certifiable pit and 2007 when lanl is scheduled to deliver its first certified pit46 the task force found complex of va ried strengths and weaknesses with little evidence of master plan vi ta sk force critics acknowledge that there is single overarching multidecade master pl an but maintain that that lack is inevitable from

washington dc may 1 2001just as the foregoing developments did not exhibit master plan so too were many responses necessarily ad hoc at the same time major facilities typically take years to build so there has necessarily b een some longterm planning as well according to the tf dismantlement is central elemen t in nuclear threat reduction and deterrence as the comp lex embarks on continuous production strategy and replaces the cold war stockpile the nation needs to dismantle the retired cold war weapons to demonstrate to its citiz ens the congress and the world that the deployment of an improved sustainable st ockpile is not the beginning of stockpile growth 19 yet there is link betw een deterrence and dismantlement in the long history of us nuclear weapons polic ies and programs us arms control and weapon employment policies ve focused on us deployed forces perceived us will and intent to use them and the potential to increase their numbers or capabilities not on the ability to dismantle them similarly the nuclear posture review of late 2001 links infrastructure such as the complex to deterrence but this linkage results from the ability of the infrastructure to maintain existing warheads or make new ones not from its ability to dismantle them warheads are removed from deployed forces as byproduct of treaties and other agreements that reduce deployed forces as result of determination that certain types of warheads or their delivery system s are longer needed or during the cold war because they were replaced by newer models some of these warheads are kept in an inactive status available for use ot hers are retired stoc kpile size has dropped because fewer and fewer warheads are deem ed necessary for deterrence or other military requirements the end of the cold war for example led to sharp reduction in the number of potential targets and ther efore in the number of weapons needed by one analysis the size of the us nuclear stockpile has been falling steadily since 1966 and even more sharply since 198947 this trend may continue president bush said i am committed to achieving credible deterrent with the lowest possible number of nuclear weapons cons istent with our national security needs including our obligations to our allies my goal is to move quickly to reduce nuclear forces48 such reductions in deployed forces might lead to further stockpile reductions though not necessarily in any preci numerical relationship while many retired warheads are disman tled dismantlement is not required by treaty but is more housekeeping matte r to reduce the cost and effort for maintenance storage and security current methods used at pantex to dismantle the cold war stockpile provide physical basi s for demonstrating to the world that the overall number of nuclear weapons is being reduced thereby reducing the nuclear threat 24 because there is transparency such as international monitors observing dismantlement if there were continuous production as the tf suggests dismantlement would demonstrate net re duction to us citizens the congress and the world only if observers coul d monitor both dismantlement and new production and found that the former exceeded the latter in contrast the unitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs35 49 department of energy department of energy fy 2006 congressional budget request volume 1 p 75states has for decades demonstrated threat reduction through verifiable dismantlement of delivery vehicles nd associated equipment eg bombers intercontinental ballistic missile silos and missile submarines moreover there is link between dismantlement and force reduction different stockpile sizes can support the same deployed force and it is that force that figures in us deterrent policy furthe r most current dismantlement is happening to warhead types totally removed from deployment over the last two decades not to warhead types still deployed task force assumptions the tf makes number of assumptions on lep and rrw that may prove correct but furthe r details are required to make the case convincingly accordingly some would view it as premature to adopt recommendations based on them the task force assumes that the curre nt method for repairing problems with existing warheads the lep will be increasingly costly over the long term v it notes that many warheads contain toxic materials that the complex must maintain materials and equipment longer in curre nt use and that the lep strategy requires that the complex retain or reacquire capabilities and processes that are necessary to refurbish weapons designed and built many years ago 1112 while it would be costly to maintain the stockpile using lep the tf does not show why it would be increasingly costly an alternate possibility is that while the first lep of warhead type might be costly and diffi cult second and subsequent leps of that warhead might be easier and cheaper in that scenario several thing would occur between the first and second leps ssp would learn more about weapons science in the intervening decades the surv eillance program woul d provide further information on the specific warhead deta ils of conducting the lep on that warhead type would be recorded software inst ructions to production machines would be stored and key equipment and materials would be stockpiled related point involves the longevity of the stockpile under lep the tf argues that lep will sustain the viability of the cold war stockpile for while but it will not achieve future sustainable st ockpile 12 so are concerned that an accumulation of small changes with several leps could lead to insufficient confidence to certify warheads in the absence of nuclear testing in this view the very lack of adequate evidence on the future effectiveness of lep combined with the absence of complex with adequate capacity poses risk that an unexpected failure of warhead type could undermine the deterrent force on the other hand if ssp including surveillance and lep have been able to sustain the stockpile for about decade lep supporters ask why should it not be able to do so for longer indeed nnsas goal for lep is to extend warhead life by 20 to 30 years49 to that end it has conducted an lep of an intercontinental ba llistic missile warhead w87 and is conducting leps of gravity bomb b61 submarinelaunc hed ballistic

ited states should proceed immediately with rrw the recommendation rests on assumptions that the labs can come up with workable design for rrw that th weapon can be produced at acceptable cost and on an acceptable schedule and that th design can be certified without nuclear testing further the tf assumes that the cost of refurbishing existing weapons through lep will exceed the cost of signing and certifying rrw setting up new production lines to manufacture it and pr oducing thousands of newlybuilt units the tf also assumes that the status quo is not financially sustainable ix clearly the status quo is costly it is one thing though to estimate that particular course of action would cost certain amount to call it unaffordable appears to be subjective

content of isotope number 239 it is surrounded by layer of chemical explosive designed to generate symmetrical inwardmoving implosion shock front when the explos ive is detonated the implosion compresses the plutonium greatly increasing its density and causing it to become supercritical so that it creates runaway nuclear chain reaction neutrons drive this reaction by causing plutonium atoms to fission releasing more neutrons to increase the fraction of plutonium that fissions boosting the yi eld of the primary neutron generator injects neutrons directly into the fissioni ng plutonium in addition boost gas mixture of deuterium and tritium isotopes of hydrogen gases is injected into the pit the intense heat and pressure of the implosion cause the gas to undergo fusion generating great

states has not made any pits that have been certified for use in stockpiled warhead s once rocky flats pits were used up the united states has been unabl to make entire new warheads alamos has established smalls cale pit production plant at its plutonium facility technical area 55 ta55 ta55 has pr oduced several pits but alamos has not completed the work needed to certify them for use in the stockpile nnsa anticipates that that work will be completed in fy2007 and that ta55 will achieve capacity of 10 pits per year beginning in fy2007 nnsa has plans to increase ta55s capacity to 3040 pits per year sometime after 2010 nnsa however believes that that num ber is inadequate to support the stockpile and proposes new modern pit facility mpf to provide more capacity 125 pit per year mpf with full produc tion starting in 2021 ontime is the minimum capacity to support the presiden ts reduced 2012 stockpile assuming 60 year pit lifetime52 in nnsas view because of the long lead time needed to design and build pit facility planning for mp f should continue as hedge against unexpected problems with pits in the stockp ile others challenge that plan arguing that if pit lifetime proves longer than antic ipated or if the future stockpile declines more than anticipated an expanded ta55 would suffice so that the united states should delay decision on mpf until future pit requirements become clearer the fy2006 energy and water development ppropriations act pl 109103 deleted funds for mpf conferees on the measure di rected nnsa to focus on improving the manufacturing capability at ta55 on the other hand representative david hobson chairman of the house energy and water devel opment appropriations subcommittee and key player on nuclear weapons issues stated in december 2005 that he does not oppose mpf but wants to have it defined more clearly before proceeding the future of mpf thus appears uncertainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33256crs39 glossary abbreviations
