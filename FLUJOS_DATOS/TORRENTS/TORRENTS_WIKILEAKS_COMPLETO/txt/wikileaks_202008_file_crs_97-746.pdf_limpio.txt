christine m matthews resources science and industry division july 23 2008 abstract the increased presence of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs and in the scientiﬁc workforce has been and continues to be of concern to some in the scientiﬁc community enrollment of us citizens in graduate science and engineering programs has not kept pace with that of foreign students in those programs in addition to the number of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs signiﬁcant number of university faculty in the scientiﬁc disciplines are foreign

graduate science and engineering programs and in the scientific workforce has been and continues to be of concern to some in the scientific community enrollment of us citizens in graduate science and engineering programs has not kept pace with that of foreign students in those programs in addition to the number of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs significant number of university faculty in the scientific disciplines are foreign and foreign doctorates are employed in large numbers by industry few will dispute that us universities and industry have chosen foreign talent to fill many positions foreign scientists and engineers serve the needs of industry at the doctorate level and also have been found to serve in major roles at the masters level however there are charges that us workers are adversely affected by the entry of foreign scientists and engineers who reportedly accept lower wages than us citizens wo uld accept in order to enter or remain in the united states nsf data reveal that in 2005 the foreign student population earned approximately 347 of the doctorate degrees in the sciences and approximately 631 of the doctorate degrees in engineering in 2005 foreign students on temporary resident visas earned 308 of the doctorates in the sciences and 586 of the doctorates in engineering the participation rates in 2004 were 285 and 573 respectively in 2005 permanent resident status students earned 38 of the doctorates in the sciences and 45 of the doctorates in engineering slightly above the 2004 levels of 37 and 42 respectively many in the scientific community maintain that in order to compete with countries that are rapidly expanding their scientific and technological capabilities the country needs to bring to the united states those whose skills will benefit society and will enable us to compete in the new technology based global economy the academic community is concerned that the more stringent visa requirements for foreign students may have continued impact on enrollments in colleges and universities there are those who believe that the underlying problem of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs is not necessarily that there are too many foreignborn students but that there are not enough nativeborn students pursuing scientific and technical disciplines legislation has been introduced in the 110 th congress to attract foreign students in the scientific and technical disciplines hr 1645 the security through regularized immigration and vibrant economy act of 2007 would provide among other things an expansion of the types of individuals who would longer be subjected to the annual limits on legal immigrants included in this group would be those who 1 hold an advanced degree in science mathematics engineering or technical fields and who have been working in the united states in related field for three years on nonimmigrant visa and 2 been awarded medical

has not kept pace with that of foreign students in those programs2 in addition to the number of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs significant number of university faculty in the scientific disciplines are foreign and foreign doctorates are employed in large numbers by industry those in the scientific community arguing for ceilings on admissions for immigrants maintain that foreign students use us graduate educat ion programs as stepping stones to immigration through sponsorships for permanent residence 3 approximately 56 of foreign doctorate degree earners on temporary visas remain in the united states with many eventually becoming citizens4 data on adjustments from temporary visas to permanent status increased by 68 from 347416 in 2003 to 583921 in 20045 it is estimated that by 2010 more than 50 of all employmentbased preference workers would adjust their temporary status to permanent status few will dispute that us universities and industry have chosen foreign talent to fill many positions6 foreign scientists and engineers serve the needs of industry at the doctorate level and also have been found to serve in major roles at the masters level7

on projections and potential imbalances in certain scientific and technical disciplines9 the us bureau of labor statistics reports that between the years 2000 and 2010 employment in science and engineering fields will increase at faster rate than all other occupations the growth rate will result primarily from growth in mathematics and computerrelated occupations10 much attention in the scientific community has focused on the h1b temporary admissions program11 report of the national science foundation nsf during the late 1980s claiming nationwide shortage of scientists and engineers may have contributed to the decision by congress to expand the skilledlabor preference system contained in the immigration act of 199012 the 1990 legislation more than doubled employmentbased immigration including scientists and engineers entering under the h1b visa category the act raised the numerical limits or ceilings on permanent employmentbased admissions from 54000 to 140000 annually 13 in addition the legislation ascribed high priority to the entry of selected skilled and professional workers and simplified admissions procedures for foreign nationals seeking to temporarily work study or conduct business in the united states on october 17 2000 the american competitivenes s in the twentyfirst century act of 2000 was signed into law pl 106313 significantly

excluded from the new ceiling all h1b nonimmigrants who are employed by institutions of higher education and nonprofit or governmental research organizations the law authorized additional h1b visas

increments typically the specialty occupation includes positions such as scientists engineers teachers computer programmers medical doctors and physical therapists the application for h1b status must be filed by an employer an individual cannot obtain an h1b visa on his or her own employers of h1b workers are required to meet certain labor conditions including paying comparable wages the

twoyear decline21 the increase for this academic year was the first significant enrollment increase since 20012002 in addition new foreign student enrollment for 20062007 increased by approximately 100 from the previous academic year the new enrollments are said to result from both recruitment efforts by us institutions and recently improved visa processing for students 22 the international student enrollment changes are reflected differently by types of institutions levels of study and disciplines there are noticeable differences by world region of origin in the flow of foreign students

the effects of significant foreign presence in graduate science and engineering programs some argue that us universities benefit from large foreign citizen enrollment by helping to meet the needs of the university and for those students who remain in the united states the nations economy 39 foreign students generate three distinct types of measurable costs and benefits first 13 percent of foreign students remain in the united states permanently increasing the number of skilled workers in the labor force second foreign students while enrolled in schools are an important part of the workforce at those institutions particularly at large research universities they help teach large undergraduate classes provide research assistance to the faculty and make up an important fraction of the bench workers in scientific labs finally many foreign students pay tuition and those revenues may be an important source of income for educational institutions 40 the increased participation of foreign students in graduate programs has generated critical responses by many in the minority community41 blacks hispanics and native americans 38 university support includes t eaching assistantships research assistantships and research traineeships 39 the open doors 2007 report of the institute of international education states that foreign students contribute approximately 145 billion annually

underrepresented in the science and engineering fields contend that disparity exists in the university science community with respect to foreign students42 it is charged that there is not equal access for us minorities to graduate education receipt of scholarships promotion to higher ranks receipt of research funds access to outstanding research collaborators and coauthorship of papers and other outlets for scientific publications frank l morris former professor university of texas charged that colleges and universities employ exclusionary mechanisms rather than supporting minority graduate students institutions provided the majority of their resources to departments that have admitted foreign students in testimony before the subcommittee on immigration and claims morris stated that the generous immigration policy coupled with the much better and disproportionate and much better subsidy out of us taxpayer funds of foreign doctoral student over all american minority students and especially much better than the support given to african american doctoral students this has created situation that place the economic well being of the african american community in jeopardy becau we have received inadequate doctoral training to prepare for or compete in an increas ing information and higher order scientifically technologically driven current and future us economy 43 another criticism noted by some is that foreig n student teaching assistants do not communicate well with american students language as barrier has been perennial problem for some foreign students44 there are charges that the accented english of the foreign teaching assistants affects the learning process45 large number of graduate schools require foreign teaching assistants to demonstrate their proficiency in english but problems remain46 several states have passed legislation setting englishlanguage standards for foreign students serving as teaching assistants47 some academics and scientists do not view scientific migration as problem but as net gain these proponents believe that the international flow of knowledge and personnel has enabled the us economy to remain at the

computer professionals working in the united states is lower than that of their us counterparts who are the same age and educatio nal level others charge that the hiring of h 1b workers undermines the status and bargaining position of us workers58 the department of labor has sought to enforce the existing policies on temporary employment of nonimmigrant foreign workers under h1b visas and to penalize those employers who are found to be in violation many in the scientific community maintain that in order to compete with countries that are rapidly expanding their scientific and technological capabilities the united states needs to bring in those whose skills will benefit society and will enable us to compete in the newtechnology based global economy individuals supporting this position do believe that the conditions under which foreign talent enters us colleges and universities and the labor force should be monitored more carefully59 and there are those who contend that the underlying concern of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs is not necessarily that there are too many foreign born students but that there are not enough nativeborn
