httpwwwoagstatenyuspress2004octoct14a _04_attach1pdf for the text of the complaint the role of insurance brokers recent charges by the new york state attorney general have highlighted possible wrongdoing by both insurance brokers and insu rance companies but the complaints focus largely on insurance brokers and their actions insurance brokers are similar to the insurance agents who are likely familiar to most people from purchase of individual insurance but brokers generally service comme rcial clients rather than individuals while insurance agents can be either exclusive or captive agents who represent one particular company or independent agents who may place persons policies with any of several different companies brokers are almost always i ndependent they are typically expected to search the marketplace on behalf of client for whatever insurance company offers the best policy and to act as knowledg eable advisor to that client they can be particularly important for insurance needs that may be complicated or somewhat non standard brokers have ty pically been compensated through some form of commission on the insurance policies that they arrange listed below are

opposing that in mr spitzers complaintalong with number of insurance companies aig ace hartfor d and munichamerican risk partners rigged the bidding on number of insurance placements for clients being represented by marsh the complaint alleges that marsh would predetermine the insurance company that should be chosen by client and asked other companies to provide higher bids than that preferred company with this extending to fake presentations by these other companies to give the appearance of competition in one instance it is even alleged that marsh went so far as to completely falsify bid when an insurance company cna refused to offer bid such bidrigging is clearly violation of law and three insurance executives have already entered guilty pleas in response to criminal complaints that were filed along with this civil complaint the other primary aspect of mr spitzers complaint is much broader indictment of the relationship and payment structures between insurance brokers and insurance companies in addition to the buyers commi ssion usually percentage of the insurance premiums paid insurance brokers have so received commissions directly from the insurance companies these commissions have allegedly been based on more than just percentage of the premium with brokers receiving higher commissions if certain volume or dollar targets are met known ge nerically as contingent commissions they apparently were also known as placement services agreements psas or market services agreement msas at marsh the complaint indicates that marsh was aggressive in soliciting such agreements from insurance companies such contingent commissions could provide major motivation for the bidrigging that was described above since unlike with straight per centage commission an insurance broker could possibly gain higher commission if particular insurance company were chosen by their client these commissions however were re portedly widespread in the industry and their propriety has been topic of much mo re debate than the clear wrongdoing seen in bidrigging4 whatever the ultimate legality of these commissions as shown in table 1 they appear to have been large revenue gene rator at marsh but not as large at the other insurance brokers market and regulatory response particularly in light of the fallout from previous investigations by mr spitzer into financial companies the market reaction to the latest lawsuit was very swift marsh mclennan shares fell nearly 50 in the af termath of the allegations while other insurance brokers shares fell as well with aon inc and arthur j gallagher down as much as 30 the fall in broker shares is likely due both to the large uncertainty created in such scandal as well as the market recognition that the contingent commissions are both large part of broker earnings and are likely to be curtailed or eliminated in the future marsh and aon have reportedly already indicated that they will longer charge contingent commissions and veral insurance companies ve also announced that they will longer pay them although the ending of contingent commissions may mean that they have to pay less fees the share prices of insurers also reacted generally negativelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21966crs4 5 see the california department of insurance website at httpwwwinsurancecagovdocs fsprs08404htm for specific

to coor dinate investigations and draft model law address the issues numer ous private lawsuits have been filed across the country other types of insurance such as group life disability and health policies that are often purchased as employee benefits are apparently being sc rutinized as is other broker activity such as the possibility of tying of primary insurance business together with reinsurance business from the same firm issues for congress the primary federal statute addressing insurance regulation is the mccarran ferguson act of 19456 this act affirmed the primacy of the states as regulators of insurance including limited exemption from the federal antitrust laws since its passage almost all congressional or othe r federal action on insurance begins with questions revolving around mccarranferg uson any federal action on the latest insurance scandals would be exception mccarranfergusons antitrust exemption one of the state laws cited by mr spitzer in the complaint was new yorks antitrust law7 if there were to be any federal gal action federal antitr ust law would almost certainly be invoked as well federal antitrust actions against the insurance industry however are complicated to some degree by the language of mc carranferguson which provides that the sherman act the clayt on act and the federal trade commission act will be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by state law8 the law also states however that the previous preemption of the sherman act does not apply to any agreement to boycott coerce or intimidate or act of boycott coercion or intimidation9 thus rather than simply establishing violation of the federal antitrust laws federal claim against someone in the insurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21966crs5 10 see crs report rl31982 insurance regulation history background and recent congressi onal oversight by carolyn cobb for discussion of the history of mccarranferguson and the following court decisions 11 while it was originally assumed that mccarrans use of the term business of insurance was virtually interchangeable with the term insur ance companies the supreme court made clear first in 1969 and again in 1979 that this assumption was erroneous in securities and exchange commission v national securities inc 393 us 453 1969 the court held that state statute directed at protecting the stock holders of insurance companies was not statute regulating the business of insurance and that the merger of an insurance company and another company was not entitled to mccarrans business of insura nce protection only statutes aimed at protecting or regulating the relationship between the insurer and the insured directly or indirectly are laws regulating the business of insurance 393 us at 460 emphasis added in group life health insurance co v royal drug co 440 us 205 211 1979 the court stated emphatically that the mccarran exemption is for the business of insurance not the business of insurers relying on those cases the supreme court and the lower federal courts have in variety of circumstances steadily narrowed the mccarran antitrust exemption it now generally excludes activities carried on by insura nce companies that may be deemed ancillary to the underwriting or riskspreading function of writing insurance policies whether or not those activities ultimately redound to the benefit of policyholders in union labor life ins co v pireno 458 us 119 1982 for example the court summarized its holding in royal drug in sum royal drug identified three criteria relevant in determining whether particular practice is part of the business of insuran ce exempted from the antitrust laws first whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading policyholders risk second whether the practice is an integral part of the policy rela tionship between the insurer and the insured and third whether the practice is limited to entities with in the insurance industry 458 us at 129 emphasis in original see also eg us dept of treasury v fabe 508 us 491 11993 hartford fire ins co v california 509 us 764 1993 podiatrist assn

factors to be considered in determining whether practice constitutes the business of insuranceindustry must also establish that the acts in question were either not the business of insurance or that they constitute boycott coercion or intimidation until specific case is filed and brought to conclusion it would be impossible to predict conclusion with certainty however it does not appear that the courts would be breaking with precedent in allowing federa l antitrust case along similar lines to that brought by the state of new york over the past few decades courts have generally been seen as narrowing the scope of pr eemption provided by mccarranferguson10 f particular importance in such federal antitrust case would be the definition of business of insurance which the courts have addressed number of times11 depending on how the courts might interpret the language of mccarranferguson in such an antitrust case congress might wish to clarify this antitrust exemption quality of state regulation for the past 60 years or more the insuran ce regulatory world has existed in state of varying tension between those who favor th existing statebased system and those who argue for federal involvement or even fede ral insurance charter whenever congress examines insurance regulation and thus ra ises the possibility of increased federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21966crs6 involvement one of the primary arguments of the supporters of the state regulatory system is that the individual states are essentially better regulators than an envisioned federal system would be th is argument however raises the stakes for any problems in the insurance marketplace as some might use them as counterex amples against the claimed superiority of th statebased system in the late 1980s there were number of large insurer insolvencies which were followed by congressional reports and hearings led by repr esentative dingell that were highly critical of the regulatory system nd discussed federal solu tions to the problems these insolvencies were an embarrassment to the state regulatory system and regulators were galvanized to show progress combatin g the problems to some degree they were successful and suggestions for federal intervention abated through the middle and latter part of the 1990s following this lull c ongress is now again examining the insurance regulatory system due primarily to the changes made to the financial regulatory system by the grammleachbliley act of 1999 which freed banks and security firms from many depressionera restrictions but left insurance regulation rgely unchanged the focus in the past few years has focused on uniformity of insurance regulation and to some degree on deregulation particular ly of insurance rates the question for congress is how to interpret this new insurance scandal is it an example of the state system working since it was state attorney general who has uncovered and prosecuted the wrongdoing or is it failure of the system since the problems were allowed to manifest themselves for as long as they did it has been argued that contingent commissions were widely used in the industry over the past d ecade if these commissions are indeed source of conf lict of interest why did the regulators not impose rules sooner commercial insurance is one of the more ligh tly regulated parts of insurance on the presumption that large enterprises are able to fend for themselves in insurance market what does this scandal say about this presumption does it shed any light on the suggestion that other insurance regulation such as ra regulation might be reduced or is the question of tightening market conduct regulati on essentially separate from the question of loosening rate regulation outlook while the investigations are continuing it seems likely at this point that the ultimate scope of the scandals may center on two issues first is an answer to the question of the propriety of contingent commissions if it is judged that these commissions are not improper then the initial complaint essentially reduces to specific illegal rigging of bids which is certainly serious but is much narrower than an indictment of widespread industry practice second is whether further damaging evid ence is found particularly on the question of tying with reinsurance ac tivity which reportedly is focus of ongoing investigation the senate governmental affairs subcommittee on financial management the budget and international security has nnounced hearing planned for november 16 2004 that would focus on insurance broker issues it is unclear whether and when the other committees that have held insurance regulatory hearings during this congress namely the house committee on financial services the senate committees on commerce and on banking may take action on this issue to this date legislation specifically addressing this issu has been introduced or announced
