that the relocation of the san from the ckgr where their population averaged around 1500 betw een 1988 and 1996 is important for the preservation of the fauna and flora of the ckgr and will allow the bushmen to develop according to the socioeconomic prac tices of the larger contemporary society the government maintains that the san have largely stoppe d living their traditional way of life because of their invol vement with the bakgalagadi8 an ethnic group related to the san which practices agriculture and animal hus bandry rather than hunting and gathering way of life the government argues that th methods of cattle herd ing used by the san are destroying the flora and fauna of the ckgr in addition the government claims traditional methods of hunting with bowand arrow have been replaced with the use of firearms and that the san have formed permanent settlements within the ckgr and longer live traditional nomadic lifestyle some observers also allege that some san use vehicles to hunt charge denied by the san the department of wildlife and national parks has stated that the biomass measure of the volume of living organisms within designated area more than doubled in the ckgr between 1986 and 1996 while the government maintains that the relocation program is encouraged to provide the san the benefits of development it has also st ated that it can longer fund its remote area development program radp and that the san people must move out of the ckgr to existing settlements such as new xade the government of botswana believes that the new settlements outside of the ckgr will better equip the san people to live according to demographically predominant social norms9 the botswana government ma intains that it has never employed force coercion or threats during its relocation of the san the government maintains that san are free to stay within the ckgr but that they would have to live without the government support they enjoyed under the governments radp the

prospecting concessions analysts also suggest that over six different mining compan ies have been awarded these concessions other human rights experts doubt that the diamonds discovered are economically viable at this time and see the relocation program as being motivated primarily by the states goal of pursuing environmen tal conservation within the ckgr for tourism purposes as well as due to the influence of cattle ranching interests11 human rights critics of botswanas government allege that in pursuing its relocation policy between 1996 and 2002 the government used tactics ranging from monetary incentives to the burning of huts the remova l of water supplies nd physical assaults survival international reports that the g overnment of botswana destroyed homes and water tanks to make the return of the san to their former settlements impossible one of the san who has taken the govern ment of botswana to court is reported to have said that the government told us to leave or they would send the army in he also alleged that government agents threatened to achieve their goals through the use of murder and arson they reportedly threatened to lock his wife in her hut and

banned nongovernmental organizations ngos from s upplying san within the ckgr with food and water12 critics also suggest that the governments relocation policy is placing in peril the ability of the san people to preserve and maintain their unique culture and language the sans relocation outside the c kgr for instance is seen by some anthropologists as eroding san social coherence because it has removed them from their ancestral lands and grave sites which have historically formed central facet of san spiritual life and social identity some san have na med new xade the place of death in addition some allege that resettlement may also be contributing to repor tedly high rates of alcoholism social degradation crime and hivaids in the resettled communities where jobs and other economic opport unities are rare some experts argue that although development services and programs have been provided to the resettled san they are inaccessible to the san due to cultural and lingu istic differences these expe rts also argue that although these programs are provided they do not t ackle the problems of social and economic exclusion cultural differences also play role for exampl the san believe the increase in health problems in new xade is due to their inability to visit their ancestors graves reports indicate that some san would be happy for mining to take place within the ckgr as

named first people of the kalahari fpk in 1993 in 19 96 the san ong with botswana human rights groups rallied together to form negotiating team to press their claims during interactions with the government the group included representatives from fpk working group of indigenous minorities in southern africa wimsa ditshwanelo botswanas center for human rights and the botswana council of churches their first step taken was to register 250 san as residents of the ckgr this offered the negotiating team basis for discussions with the botswana government14 negotiations did not produce the results acceptable to the san and human rights groups however and in april 2002 the san took the government to court in botswana the court case focuses on the legality of the governments policy of halting the provision of essential services to rads the governme nts potential legal responsibility to restore these services questions relating to the sans claim to hold land and mineral ownership rights in the ckgr on the basis of their ances tral occupation of the land in question and whether the government of botswana used fo rce to remove the san from the ckgr the case is being continued in new xade following initial hearings in the capital these were criticized by observers as being inaccessible to the plaintiffs who are generally poor lack transportation and in some cases do not speak english or tswana some observers see the case as an example of botswanas democracy at work but those defending the san object that all the judges are batswana and argue that this shows the botswana governments desire to tilt the judicial landscape in its favor15 legal precedents two prior political decisions made by the first president of botswana seretse khama are central to this court case first asserting that botswana was nonracial nation he effectively decreed that all people of bots wana were indigenes of the nations land this presumption has in formed the botswana governments decision not to recognize the san as the original people of the kalahari or as having any rights to the land in the ckgr through ancestry second under president kh ama the parliament passed law that decreed that all minerals are the property of the botswana government this law known as khamas choice means th at if any mineral deposits of wealth are discovered they automatically belong to the botswana government this is important to the san court case because the law may undermin san claims to the minerals within the ckgr16 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21956crs6 17 richtervelders are khoisan

botswana may prove im portant both regionally and intern ationally for those seeking the rights to their ancestral land the legal system s of several other afri can states where there exist historically disputed land claims are similar to those in botswana should the san win any portion of their case their victory may create precedents of legal strategy that may be applicable to the cases of land case pl aintiffs in other count ries similarly legal precedents in other countries may inform legal outcomes in botswana in 2003 for instance the richtervelders of south africa won landmark court battle with prominent diamond company17 the constitutional court ruled that even though the 3000 nama richtervelders had legal land titles they owned the rights to the minerals and land that they inhabit through ancestry analysts have suggested that the south african ruling is important in the ckgr case as botswana and south africa share similar judicial systems18 international observers also champion the importance of the san case for indigenes of other african countries such as th masai of kenya the pygmy peoples of central africa and the hadza hunting people of east africa19 us policy the san case has not attracted extensive attention among us policy makers but its outcome may provide an important precedent for treatment of aboriginal peoples by national governments around the wo rld the san rights case is an issue of concern to the congressional human rights caucus in late ptember 2004 the caucus held members briefing on the issue us aid and the department of state have both cited the importance of the c kgr san court case for other sa n within bordering southern african countries20
