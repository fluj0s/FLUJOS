etrd aj am rs ir subject azerbaijani president to us burns you cant boil two heads in one pot classified by charge donald lu for reasons 14 bd 1 c summary president aliyev used this coarse street slang to describe the relationship between russian president medvedev and pm putin but he might well have used the same idiom to describe his concerns about turkeyarmenia reconciliation and the nagornokarabakh nk peace process he told us burns that the sword of damocles of the april 24 armenian remembrance day is hanging over the nk process as well as the turkeyarmenia normalization process he suggested that it would be easier if the turkeyarmenia normalization could be considered after april in order to allow more time for progress on nk he also took the opportunity to press the usg to apply maximum pressure on yerevan to make concessions on nk he stressed now we are trying to be even more flexible 2 c summary continued on iran president aliyev said he supported economic isolation and believed it could be effective if enforced by broad coalition he complained about iranian security provocations on proposed battalionsized afghanistan contribution aliyev said that he would support sending team to georgia to observe the training being provided by eucom to georgian troops headed for afghanistan on energy cooperation president aliyev said that if the turks demonstrate constructive behavior this year that gas transit deal can happen finally on the jailed youth activists though he made firm commitments regarding their release he said i think pardon or amnesty can be done i had intention to hurt anyone end summary seeks pressure on yerevan to resolve nk 3 c under secretary of state for political affairs bill burns began his hourlong meeting with president ilham aliyev by stressing that he was sent with the simple message that washington wants to build our bilateral relations and create stronger partnership he then offered his condolences for the three azeri soldiers killed on the line of contact on february 18 aliyev responded that such events show that there is peace peace treaty and peacekeepers enforcing the ceasefire he worried more such incidents could happen burns commented that such incidents underscored the urgency of finding political solution on nagornokarabakh 4 c the balance of aliyevs comments sought to convey that he was ready to move forward in the minsk group process but that international pressure would be needed if armenia was to move forward he said that it is now time to find final resolution but armenian president sargsian wants to walk away from the process i told the cochairs that armenia wants to delay as long as possible and escape at the end he said that azerbaijan was prepared to do its part to propel the talks forward now we will try to be even more flexible 5 c aliyev outlined several steps to persuade armenia to agree to the minsk group basic principles the three cochair countries should consolidate their efforts at seniorlevel c the three cochair countries should send strong message that the independence of nk is not under review and c if these new proposals are not accepted there should be consequences in terms of international isolation especially in the form of russias curtailing some of its economic support for armenia 6 c aliyev noted that at sochi president sargsian had inserted proposal for specifying definite date for referendum or plebiscite on nk final status this aliyev argued undermined the entire framework of the agreement which is premised on an eventual referendum with definite timeframe in exchange for legalizing the illegally established regime in nk he also noted that armenia is vulnerable to isolation because it is dependent upon remittances from its diaspora as well as imports of gas and electricity after 18 years of negotiation we have tested all options if this phase of minsk group talks ends what is next the president asked aloud the russian role in nk and russian succession baku 00000134 002 of 004 7 c in response to us burns question about the russian role in the nk talks aliyev responded that he was convinced that medvedevs efforts have been sincere he said that medvedev has personally met with the azerbaijani and armenian presidents five times thus any failure to make progress on this issue will damage medvedevs credibility he said that at sochi medvedev tried to persuade sargsian to achieve breakthrough he added however that it was strange that with so much pressure from moscow and lavrovs visit to yeveran the armenians not only resisted progress but actually backtracked on previouslyagreed items in response to question aliyev said that he believes that pm putin has his own separate opinion about the desirability of an nk resolution i have evidence but i can feel this aliyev remarked 8 c aliyev said that he considers medvedev modern newgeneration intellectual surrounded by people whom he does not control he said that he has personally witnessed medvedev taking decisions that then required further approval before they were implemented referring specifically to border demarcation agreement that he had agreed with medvedev only to have it stymied by others presumably in the prime ministerial office he added many highranking officials dont recognize medvedev as leader he said that there are signs of strong confrontation between the teams of the two men although not yet between putin and medvedev personally we have saying in azeri two heads cannot be boiled in one pot crude street slang suggesting that two leaders are spoiling for fight strong pushback on the turkeyarmenia normalization 9 c us burns stressed that the us believes that progress on the turkeyarmenia protocols could create political space for sargsian to be more flexible on nk he continued that the reverse was also true that failure of the turkeyarmenia process would almost certainly result in serious negative consequences for the nk process aliyev said that nk progress would require minimum of five or six months he suggested that the entire turkeyarmenia protocol ratification process be delayed until after april 24 he said that the sword of damocles of armenian remembrance day is hanging unhelpfully not only over the turkeyarmenia process but also now the nk progress if there were deadline maybe we could see how to combine our efforts to resolve nk 10 c aliyev pushed back with his usual warnings about the negative effects of turkeyarmenia protocol ratification without being proceeded by nk progress he darkly predicted postponement of any nk settlement comprehensive regional security improvement damage to turkeyazerbaijani relations real partnership between turkey and armenia further isolation of central asia the undermining of energy projects and damage to georgia both in lost transit income but also in its role as the sole land corridor between russia and armenia relations with iran described as tense and unstable 11 c us burns explained in detail the steps the us had taken to initiate dialogue with tehran and support the tehran research reactor initiative he ended by noting that given the rejection of these overtures the us would move forward with another unsc resolution that included new sanctions targeting the iranian revolutionary guard corps aliyev responded that although the visible side of azerbaijans relations with iran appears normal the substance was very different i do not exclude that relations will be become more difficult the president added 12 c german chancellor merkel was very firm with on iran trying to persuade i told her need the president recalled he said that he was supportive of irans economic isolation and believed it could work if the international community worked together he said that earlier sanctions observance had been spotty with many european energy companies working in iran statoil supports iran more than it supports us he complained he noted that russian president medvedev once told him that russia did not want the americans to squeeze iran but also did not want nuclear iran baku 00000134 003 of 004 13 c aliyev said that iranian provocations in azerbaijan were on the rise he specifically cited not only the financing of radical islamic groups and hezbollah terrorists but also the iranian financing of violent ashura ceremonies in nakhchivan the organization of demonstrations in front of the azeri consulates in tabriz and istanbul violent religious procession recently in baku the use of the presidents photo alongside the star of david on the azerilanguage seher tv broadcast into azerbaijan and conflict in the caspian 14 c the president added that azerbaijan will not reciprocate on the liberalization of the visa regime with iran he also noted that azerbaijan is planning to create tv channel in persian that will broadcast into iran he said that he did not understand why the supreme religious leader chose ahmadinejad over former president moussavi he joked that perhaps it was too dangerous to have two ethnic azeris at the head of the iranian state he said that the election fraud was outrageous with ahmadinejad winning in azeridominated tabriz and moussavi winning in tehran where it was harder to falsify the vote he viewed the situation as very tense within iran and believed it could erupt at any time supports afghanistan troop contribution with conditions 15 c us burns asked for the presidents support to continue our discussions about battalionsized contribution of troops to afghanistan that would include us train and equip program the president said that he is aware of this initiative and his foreign and defense ministries are working on it he said that the fundamental problem is one of optics claiming it was difficult for him politically if it looks like the americans are only training azeri troops to send them off to afghanistan he said that it would be easier if half of those trained would be sent to afghanistan while the second half would remain in azerbaijan or be used for other purposes us burns noted that the presidents suggestion would create problems involving the us funding of the training the charge proposed that as an initial step ministry of foreign affairs and defense ministry staff observe the training of georgian troops headed to afghanistan by us marines the president thought this was good idea and instructed his aide to look at this suggestion pardon or amnesty of the youth activists can be done 16 c us burns said that one of the ways azerbaijan could show leadership as tolerant and secular country was in advancing democracy and human rights he specifically asked that following the appeal process of the two youth activists the president find way on humanitarian grounds to release the two men aliyev made firm commitment but responded i think this can be done i had intention to hurt anyone when us burns expressed the hope that the government could quietly take this step the president said okay russians are factor in turkish gas transit 17 c on energy cooperation president aliyev said that if the turks demonstrate constructive behavior this year that gas transit deal can happen he was clear however that nothing would be signed before april 24 he also professed to be worried that active turkishrussian cooperation could be one of the impediments to progress he confided that turkish energy minister yildiz recently told the head the azerbaijani state oil company why do you want to ruin our relations with russia do you really need nabucco 18 c the president continued that it is imperative for azerbaijan that formalities for the commencement of shah deniz phase ii gas development begin this year this project will bring 20 billion in muchneeded investment to azerbaijan and potentially develop azerbaijan into major source of new gas as much as 50 billion cubic meters baku 00000134 004 of 004 19 c unprompted by us burns aliyev spelled out the reasons azerbaijan decided to sell gas to russia last year noting that moscow had asked and offered good price for gas that was surplus anyway but the real reason aliyev confided was that the sale illustrated to our turkish friends that they will not be allowed to create gas distribution hub aliyev made clear his distaste for the erdogan government in turkey underscoring the naivete of their foreign policy and the failure of their initiatives including the loss of support for turkey among traditional international friends because of ankaras hostility to israel he noted that in his view there had never been any merit to the notion of moderate islamist government in turkey and that erdogans insistence on promoting hamas and gaza when other arab countries were notably silent on these issues had brought turkey benefits 20 u lastly us burns asked for the presidents assistance in resolving the longstanding difficulties in finalizing the lease for the new embassy compound the president responded positively that he thought this could be done 21 u us burns was accompanied by eur deputy assistant secretary amb tina kaidanow nsc director bridget brink and charge president aliyev was joined by his foreign policy advisor novruz mammadov 22 u this message has been cleared by us burns lu
