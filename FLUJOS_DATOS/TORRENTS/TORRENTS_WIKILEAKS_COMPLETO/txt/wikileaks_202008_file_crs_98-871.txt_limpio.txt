specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division science engineering and mathematics education status and issues summary an important aspect of us efforts to maintain and improve economic competitiveness is the existence of capable scientific and technological workforce major concern of the 110th congress may be regarding the future ability of the us science and engineering base to generate the technological advances needed to maintain economic growth discussions have centered on the quality of science and mathematics education and training and on the scientific knowledge of those students entering other disciplines even students pursuing nonscientific and nonmathematical specialities are likely to require basic knowledge of scientific and technological applications for effective participation in the workforce charges are being made that many students complete high school scientifically and technologically illiterate precollege science and mathematics instruction has an important relationship to the future supply of us scientific and technological personnel and to the general scientific literacy of the nation however several published reports indicate important shortcomings in science and mathematics education and achievement of us students at the precollege level some findings in the reports revealed that many science and mathematics teachers do not have major in the discipline being taught and that us students themselves on international measures perform less well than their international counterparts september 2006 report on the future of higher education states that while our colleges and universities have much to applaud for in their achievements there are some areas where reforms are needed as higher education has evolved it simultaneously has had to respond to the impact of globalization rapidly evolving technologies the changing needs of knowledge economy and population that is increasingly older and more diverse in the 21st century larger proportion of the us population will be composed of certain minorities blacks hispanics and native americans as group these minorities have traditionally been underrepresented in the science and engineering disciplines compared to their proportion of the total population report of the national science foundation nsf reveals that blacks hispanics and native americans as whole comprise more that 25 of the population and earn as whole 162 of the bachelor degrees 107 of the masters degrees and 54 of the doctorate degrees in science and

aspect of us efforts to improve economic competitiveness is the existence of capable scientific and technological workforce concern has been expressed about the future ability of the us science and engineering base to generate the technological advances needed to maintain economic growth1 some discussions have centered on the quality of science and mathematics undergraduate education and training the design and structure of the scientific curriculum are thought to discourage number of highly qualified students from entering and remaining in the disciplines2 other discussions have focused on the scientific knowledge of those students entering other disciplines even students pursuing nonscientific and nonmathematical specialties will require basic knowledge of scientific and technological applications and mathematical reasoning in order to adapt to constant changes in the labor market3 precollege science and mathematics instruction also has an important relationship to the future supply of us scientific and technical personnel basic science and mathematics education is considered necessary not only for those who will enter science as majors but for all citizens to understand scientific and technical issues that affect their lives however several indicators of the performance of us students in science and mathematics education at the precollege level reveal

production whether individuals are in the service sector manufacturing government or management many believe that some level of scientific literacy is required the term reform is repeated throughout discussions of science education at the precollege level covering such issues as school curriculum and the quality of science instruction student interest in science the shortage of qualified teachers teacher training and retraining student achievement on science and mathematics measures and the participation of minorities and women in science9 the us educational system has long history of attempted education reforms one particular report that received considerable attention was released in 1983 by the department of education ed the report nation at risk attacked the school system

in the real world structured so students would use the discovery process to study issues that are multidimensional to arrive at alternative approaches and to be able to anticipate both positive and negative consequences of their choices in 2000 the national council of teachers of mathematics nctm released revised principles and standards for school mathematics which described how students should be taught to solve nonroutine problems in meaningful context13 the nctm standards promoted the policy of students learning through induction rather than memorization directing the instructional process on inquiry14 as opposed to the traditional tellandtest approach and promoting assessment methods that are openended instead of machinescoreable more recently 2005 report of the fordham

publication investigating the influence of standards framework for research in mathematics science and technology education17 the report examined two primary questions 1 how has the system responded to the introduction of nationally developed mathematics science and technology standards and 2 what are the consequences for student learning the report offered guideposts for determining the influence of nationally developed science mathematics and technology standards and evaluates the significance of the influence on student learning on teachers and pedagogy and on the education system

developed through comprehensive national consultative process the results are reported according to three basic achievement levels basic proficient and advanced27 the proportion of students performing at the basic and proficient levels increased for 4th and 8th grade students from 2003 to 2005 higher percentages of black and hispanic students at both grade levels scored at or above basic and proficient in 2005 than in any previous assessment the score gap between white students and black and hispanic students continue but the gap has narrowed in may 2005 the naeps 2005 science assessments were released28 the naep 2005 science assessment is to provide baseline for science achievement and to assist in determining the progress being made toward the fifth national goal similar to the mathematics assessments results are reported at three achievement levels data revealed that the average scores of 4th graders rose approximately 4 points in comparison with 1996 and 2000 for 8th grade students there was significant change in overall scores in 2005 from the previous assessments29 for 12th graders there was change in performance from the administration in 2000 however in 2005 12th graders received lower average scores than in 1996 at this grade level the percentage of students performing at or above the basic level at or above the proficient level and at the advanced level all

graduate education undergraduate education while the uncertain job market for some scientists and engineers may have an effect on the enrollments in science and engineering the us system of higher education is called upon to continue to produce the qualified scientific and technical personnel necessary to maintain an intellectual and economic leadership35 colleges and universities are facing the mounting task of better educating their undergraduate and graduate students by restructuring their curricula to increase the versatility and employability of the graduates all disciplines have been targets however considerable importance is placed on graduates in the natural sciences engineering health sciences computer sciences and other quantitativelybased fields one challenge facing research institutions is that of finding balance between the basic academic activities of teaching and research within the scientific and engineering disciplines attempting to find the flexibility to blend the priorities of teaching and research has been perennial problem the standing of an institution is in direct relationship to the research productivity of its faculty and the competition for grants and scholars has led many research institutions to place increased emphasis on research at the expense of teaching in many research institutions research productivity has been given more weight than teaching effectiveness when deciding tenure or promotion efforts are underway at some institutions to change the reward system and evaluation of their faculty members36 an additional challenge for research universities is the need to address the complaints concerning undergraduate teaching many of these complaints are 34 continued nces 2005353r washington dc october 2005 p 1 35 see for

problems of undergraduate education37 in 2003 the national research council released the report evaluating and improving undergraduate teaching in science technology engineering and mathematics38 the report noted that colleges and universities are being held far more accountable for the education of their students than in the past institutions with peer review mechanisms to evaluate faculty research in science mathematics and engineering should have the same of attention directed at evaluating the faculty teaching in those disciplines the public and private sectors that make significant investments in university research suggested that faculty members excelling in the classroom should be recognized and rewarded similar to those faculty engaged in research the report recommended strategies for evaluating undergraduate teaching and learning in science mathematics engineering and technology the methods used for evaluation could serve as basis for the professional advancement of faculty faculty are encouraged to set definitive goals for their students and then determine if the goals are being met in addition to the faculty recommendations for evaluating teaching and learning were made for presidents boards and academic officers deans department chairs and peer evaluators and for research sponsors and granting and accrediting agencies the recommendations were based on the following tenets effective postsecondary teaching in science mathematics and technology should be available to all students regardless of their major the design of curricula and the evaluation of teaching and learning should be collective responsibilities of faculty in individual departments or wherever appropriate through interdepartmental arrangements scholarly activities that focus on improving teaching and learning should be recognized as bona fide endeavors that are equivalent to other scholarly pursuits scholarship devoted to improving teaching effectiveness and learning should be accorded the same 37 ibid p 7 38 national research council committee on recognizing evaluating rewarding and developing excellence in teaching of undergraduate science mathematics engineering and

mathematics and engineering disciplines witnesses testified about the factors that shape the quality of undergraduate reforms in the scientific and engineering disciplines elaine seymour university of colorado contends that there is decline in the perceived value of teaching teaching as career is believed by many undergraduates as being of low status pay and prospects also faculty in many institutions are more focused on research than teaching academic success is measured by grant writing and publications in many science and engineering departments portion of faculty salary is from research grants as result there is less interactive teaching by many faculty and more straight lecturing many classes become the responsibility of teaching assistants in numerous surveys students have indicated that poor teaching and unsatisfactory learning experiences were the primary reasons for switching majors and leaving the sciences seymour states that the institutional reward system and the pressure to obtain grants have consequences for both undergraduate and k12 education in the science mathematics and engineering john burris president beloit college testifying before the march 15 hearing offered several recommendations as to how the federal government can identify assess and disseminate that which works in undergraduate science mathematics and engineering programs he suggested that with the proposed doubling of the nsf budget over the next ten years41there should be doubling of the funding targeted specifically for strengthening and sustaining undergraduate programs in colleges and universities burris stated that significant parts of what works are i attention to how students learn ii an institutional culture that has common vision about the value of building researchrich learning environments and iii faculty who are eager to remain engaged within their disciplinary community and who have the resources of time and instrumentation to do so42 he suggested that the increased funding be directed at networks collaborations and partnerships he further called for the establishment of taskforce to oversee the proposed doubling of undergraduate funds the task

professions we recommend increased federal investment in areas critical to our nations global competitiveness and renewed commitment to attract the best and brightest minds across the nation and around the world to lead the next wave of american innovation46 graduate education graduate education in science and mathematics has been the subject of several reports and committees in the fall of 1993 the committee on science engineering and public policy cosepup joint committee of the nas the national academy of engineering and the institute of medicine iom proposed comprehensive study on the

function of the graduate schools in meeting the countrys varied needs for scientists and engineers there is clear human resources policy for advanced scientists and engineers so their education is largely byproduct of policies that support research the simplifying assumption has apparently been that the primary mission of graduate programs is to produce the next generation of academic researchers in view of the broad range of ways in which scientists and engineers contribute to national needs it is time to review how they are educated to do so47 cosepup had solicited responses concerning the existing structure of graduate education from such groups as postdoctoral researchers professors university officials industry scientists and executives representatives of scientific societies and graduate students themselves the general sentiment was that while the basic structure of graduate education was sound some change was warranted in order to respond to changing national policies and industrial needs48 some respondents both inside and outside of academia indicated that selected doctorate degree programs are too analytical and too oriented toward subspecialities survey responses indicated that doctoral students should be provided with broader training that would allow them to experiment with alternative career paths49 many of the responses from industry and international corporations stated that the nature of industrial work is changing and that the education and training offered by many of the doctoral programs should be changed as well industry wants graduate students who will better meet their research and development rd needs and compete effectively with their counterparts worldwide in rapidly evolving competitive market50 cosepup presented national strategy that was intended to emphasize both versatility and information one recommendation in the report was that graduate programs should provide wider variety of career options for their students this could be accomplished in program that has student grounded in the fundamentals of one field that is enhanced by breadth of knowledge in related field added to such program would be offcampus experiences exposing the student to the skills requested by an increasing number of employers the ability to communicate complex ideas and the experiences of working in groups of interdependent workers another recommendation offered to foster versatility in graduate programs was to have those 47 the national academies reshaping the graduate education of scientists and

february 1998 the national science board nsb released policy paper the federal role in science and engineering graduate and postdoctoral education51 some of the many issues examined by the nsb were 1 the relative merits of fellowships and traineeships 2 the role of graduate students as teachers 3 the mentoring of graduate students 4 access to faculty and time to degree 5 and the continuing underrepresentation of minorities and women in many areas of graduate science and engineering programs the nsb identified several areas of concern in the federaluniversity partnership where adjustments may enhance the capacity of the enterprise to serve the national interest in changing global environment52 the nsb noted that because of changes over the past 50 years such as increased demand for higher education the need to respond to advances in communications and information technology rising tuitions and administrative burdens and stresses on universities and faculty require changes and improvement in the federaluniversity partnership one of the stresses confronted by university partnerships as discussed by the report is the unintended consequences of federal policies the increased federal investment in research and education has come with increased oversight and accountability of funding the report states that the growing federal focus on accountability tends to emphasize shortterm research products and to deemphasize benefits to graduate education from engaging in research at the frontiers of knowledge increased emphasis on accountability also may result in an increase in the perceived value of postdoctoral researchers compared with graduate students on research grants thus reducing options for cuttingedge research experience during graduate training53 the recommendations posed by the nsb placed increased emphasis on the expansion of the partnership to include wider range of colleges and universities the integration of research and education increased flexibility of job opportunities outside of academia and diversity in graduate education it recommended that the 51 the national science board the federal role in science and engineering

53 ibid crs15 federal government promote closer collaboration between research and nonresearch institutions and to provide greater exposure to both faculty and students to research experiences and opportunities to address the concern of the narrowness of graduate education the report suggested that in addition to the core training the student should be provided with additional training options that might include interdisciplinary emphasis teamwork business management skills and information technologies the nsb proposed to reward institutions that established model programs for the integration of research and education while recognizing the creation of federal and institutional programs to increase the number of racial and ethnic minorities in the science and engineering disciplines the nsb noted their participation rate remains of some concern the report recommended that federaluniversity partnerships develop more effective mechanisms of increasing diversity in graduate education and to guard against strategies that inadvertently keep underrepresented groups from the mainstream of research and graduate education54 2005 report of the woodrow wilson national fellowship foundation the responsive phd innovations in us doctoral education analyzed the findings of several studies on doctoral education and detailed the most effective practices from leading doctoral institutions55 one of the challenges discussed in the report is the need to combine traditional research with adventurous scholarship within and across disciplines effective inclusive and more relevant training of the doctoral student requires extending knowledge beyond the walls of the institution and the major discipline also the report contends that graduate schools require significantly stronger central administration and structure that currently exists graduate school should guard against operating in isolation within an institution and instead create graduate community of intellectual cohesiveness across disciplines theme contained in all the reports reviewed was that for reasons of equity and efficacy there is need to broaden and reinvigorate efforts to increase the participation of underrepresented minority groups in the sciences some recommendations for action offered by the report include the central notion of graduate school requires strengthening so that it can become vital force in breaking down barriers between programs and sponsoring more cosmopolitan intellectual experience for doctoral students doctoral students need both departmental and extradepartmental structures to give their concerns strong and effective voice and to cultivate graduate student leadership as component of graduate education and professional development 54 ibid p 5 see also professional ms offer promise of more minorities pursuing graduate studies the washington fax october 10 2003 and postdoc mentoring in need of institutional changes

those institutions particularly at large research universities they help teach large undergraduate classes provide research assistance to the faculty and make up an important fraction of the bench
