financial issues mark jickling coordinator specialist in public finance government and finance division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21135 the sudden and unexpected collapse of enron corp was the first in series of major corporate accounting scandals that has shaken confidence in corporate governance and the stock market only months before enrons bankruptcy filing in december 2001 the firm was widely regarded as one of the most innovative fastest growing and best managed businesses in the united states with the swift collapse shareholders including thousands of enron workers who held company stock in their 401k retirement accounts lost tens of billions of dollars it now appears that enron was in terrible financial shape as early as 2000 burdened with debt and moneylosing businesses but manipulated its accounting statements to hide these problems why didnt the watchdogs bark this report briefly examines the accounting system that failed to provide clear picture of the firms true condition the independent auditors and board members who were unwilling to challenge enrons management the wall street stock analysts who failed to warn investors of trouble ahead the rules governing employer stock in company pension plans and the unregulated energy derivatives trading that was the core of enrons business this report also summarizes the sarbanesoxley act pl 107204 the major response by the 107th congress to enrons fall and related legislative and regulatory actions during the 108th congress it will be updated as events warrant other contributors to this report include william d jackson bob lyke patrick purcell and gary shorter enron what went wrong enron corp the first nationwide natural gas pipeline network shifted its business focus during the 1990s from the regulated transportation of natural gas to trading in unregulated energy markets until late 2001 nearly all observers including wall street professionals regarded this transformation as an outstanding success enrons reported annual revenues grew from under 10 billion in the early 1990s to 139 billion in 2001 placing it fifth on the fortune 500 enron continued to transform its business but as it diversified out of its core energy operations it ran into serious trouble like many other congressional research service the library of congress crs2 firms enron saw an unlimited future in the internet during the late 1990s it invested heavily in online marketers and service providers constructed fiber optic communications network and attempted to create market for trading broadband communications capacity enron entered these markets near the peak of the boom and paid high prices taking on heavy debt load to finance its purchases when the dot com crash came in 2000 revenue from these investments dried up but the debt remained enron also recorded significant losses in certain foreign operations the firm made major investments in public utilities in india south america and the uk hoping to profit in newlyderegulated markets in these three cases local politicians acted to shield consumers from the sharp price increases that enron anticipated by contrast enrons energy trading businesses appear to have made money although that trading was probably less extensive and profitable than the company claimed in its financial reports energy trading however did not generate sufficient cash to allow enron to withstand major losses in its dot com and foreign portfolios once the internet bubble burst enrons prospects were dire httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21135 it is not unusual for businesses to fail after making bad or illtimed investments what turned the enron case into major financial scandal was the companys response to its problems rather than disclose its true condition to public investors as the law requires enron falsified its accounts it assigned business losses and nearworthless assets to unconsolidated partnerships and special purpose entities in other words the firms public accounting statements pretended that losses were occurring not to enron but to the socalled raptor entities which were ostensibly independent firms that had agreed to absorb enrons losses but were in fact accounting contrivances created and entirely controlled by enrons management in addition enron appears to have disguised bank loans as energy derivatives trades to conceal the extent of its indebtedness when these accounting fictions which were sustained for nearly 18 months came to light and corrected accounting statements were issued over 80 of the profits reported since 2000 vanished and enron quickly collapsed the sudden collapse of such large corporation and the accompanying losses of jobs investor wealth and market confidence suggested that there were serious flaws in the us system of securities regulation which is based on the full and accurate disclosure of all financial information that market participants need to make informed investment decisions the suggestion was amply confirmed by the succession of major corporate accounting scandals that followed enron raised fundamental issues about corporate fraud accounting transparency and investor protection several aspects of these issues are briefly sketched below with reference to crs products that provide more detail auditing and accounting issues federal securities law requires that the accounting statements of publicly traded corporations be certified by an independent auditor enrons auditor arthur andersen not only turned blind eye to improper accounting practices but was actively involved in devising complex financial structures and transactions that facilitated deception crs3 an auditors certification indicates that the financial statements under review have been prepared in accordance with generallyaccepted accounting principles gaap in enrons case the question is not only whether gaap were violated but whether current accounting standards permit corporations to play numbers games and whether investors are exposed to excessive risk by financial statements that lack clarity and consistency accounting standards for corporations are set by the financial accounting standards board fasb nongovernmental entity though there are also securities and exchange commission sec requirements the sec has statutory authority to set accounting standards for firms that sell securities to the public some describe fasbs standards setting process as cumbersome and too susceptible to business andor political pressures in response to the auditing and accounting problems at enron and other major corporations scandals congress enacted the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 pl 107204 containing perhaps the most farreaching amendments to the securities laws since the 1930s very briefly the law does the following creates public company accounting oversight board to regulate independent auditors of publicly traded companies private sector httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21135 entity operating under the oversight of the sec raises standards of auditor independence by prohibiting auditors from providing certain consulting services to their audit clients and requiring preapproval by the clients board of directors for other nonaudit services requires top corporate management and audit committees to assume more direct responsibility for the accuracy of financial statements enhances disclosure requirements for certain transactions such as stock sales by corporate insiders transactions with unconsolidated subsidiaries and other significant events that may require realtime disclosure directs the sec to adopt rules to prevent conflicts of interest that affect the objectivity of stock analysts authorizes 776 million for the sec in fy2003 versus 469 million in the administrations budget request and requires the sec to review corporate financial reports more frequently and establishes andor increases criminal penalties for variety of offenses related to securities fraud including misleading an auditor mail and wire fraud and destruction of records see also crs report rl31554 corporate accountability sarbanesoxley act of 2002 pl 107204 by michael seitzinger and crs report rs21120 auditing and its regulators proposals for reform after enron by bob lyke pension issues like many companies enron sponsored retirement plan 401k for its employees to which they can contribute portion of their pay on taxdeferred basis as crs4 of december 31 2000 62 of the assets held in the corporations 401k retirement plan consisted of enron stock many individual enron employees held even larger percentages of enron stock in their 401k accounts shares of enron which in january 2001 traded for more than 80share were worth less than 70 cents in january 2002 the catastrophic losses suffered by participants in the enron corporations 401k plan have prompted questions about the laws and regulations that govern these plans in the 107th congress the house passed legislation hr 3762 that would have required account information to be provided more often to plan participants improved access to investment planning advice allowed plan participants to diversify their portfolios by selling company stock contributed by employers after three years and barred executives from selling company stock while plan is locked down the latter provision was enacted by the sarbanesoxley act similar legislation has not advanced in the 108th congress see also crs report rl31507 employer stock in retirement plans investment risk and

in the wake of enron and other scandals corporate boards of directors were subject to critical scrutiny boards whose chief duty is to represent shareholders interests utterly failed to prevent or detect management fraud several provisions of sarbanes oxley were designed to boost the power of independent directors and the audit committee of the board to exercise effective oversight of management and the accounting process under sarbanesoxley the boards audit committee must have majority of independent directors not affiliated with management or the corporation and is responsible for hiring firing overseeing and paying the firms outside auditor the audit committee must include at least one director who is financial expert that is able to evaluate significant accounting issues andor disagreements between management and auditors in 2003 the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq adopted rules requiring listed corporations to have majority of independent directors not affiliated with management or the corporation on their boards in 2004 the sec is considering rule that would facilitate the nomination of directors by shareholders securities analyst issues securities analysts employed by investment banks provide research and make buy sell or hold recommendations these recommendations are widely circulated and are relied upon by many public investors analyst support was crucial to enron because it required constant infusions of funds from the financial markets on november 29 2001 after enrons stock had fallen 99 from its high and after rating agencies had downgraded its debt to junk bondstatus only two of 11 major firm analysts rated its stock sell was analyst objectivity towards enron and other firms compromised by pressure to avoid alienating investment banking clients crs5 the sarbanesoxley act directs the sec to establish rules addressing analysts conflicts of interest these were issued in 2003 in december 2002 10 major investment banks reached settlement with state and federal securities regulators under which they agreed to reforms to make their analysts independent of their banking operations and to pay fines totaling about 1 billion see also crs report rl31348 enron and stock analyst objectivity by gary shorter banking issues one part of the fallout from enrons demise involves its relations with banks prominent banking companies notably citigroup and jp morgan chase were involved in both the investment banking securities and the commercial banking lending and deposit businesses with enron in 2003 the sec fined the two banks 120 and 135 million respectively for their roles in enrons accounting frauds several aspects of enrons relations with its bankers have raised several questions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21135 1 do financial holding companies firms that encompass both investment and commercial banking operations face conflict of interest between their duty to avoid excessive risk on loans from their bank sides versus their opportunity to glean profits from deals on their investment banking side 2 were the bankers enticed or pressured to provide funding for enron and recommend its securities and derivatives to other parties 3 did the dynegy rescue plan proposed just before enrons collapse and involving further investments by jp morgan chase and citigroup represent protective selfdealing 4 what is the proper accounting for banks offbalancesheet items including derivative positions and lines of credit such as they provided to enron 5 did the enron situation represent warning that glba may need finetuning in the way it mixes the different business practices of wall street and commercial banking see also crs report rs21188 enrons banking relationships and congressional repeal of statutes separating bank lending from investment banking by william d jackson energy derivatives issues part of enrons core energy business involved dealing in derivative contracts based on the prices of oil gas electricity and other variables for example enron sold long term contracts to buy or sell energy at fixed prices these contracts allow the buyers to avoid or hedge the risks that increases or drops in energy prices posed to their businesses since the markets in which enron traded are largely unregulated with reporting requirements little information is available about the extent or profitability of enrons derivatives activities beyond what is contained in the companys own financial statements while trading in derivatives is an extremely highrisk activity evidence has yet emerged that indicates that speculative losses were factor in enrons collapse since the enron failure several energy derivatives dealers have admitted to making wash trades which lack economic substance but give the appearance of greater market volume than actually exists and facilitate deceptive accounting if the fictitious trades are crs6 reported as real revenue in 2002 energy derivatives trading diminished to fraction of preenron levels as major traders and their customers and shareholders reevaluate the risks and utility of unregulated energy trading several major dealers have withdrawn from the market entirely internal enron memoranda released in may 2002 suggest that enron and other market participants engaged in variety of manipulative trading practices during the california electricity crisis for example enron was able to buy electricity at fixed price in california and sell it elsewhere at the higher market price exacerbating electricity shortages within california the evidence to date does not indicate that energy derivatives as opposed to physical spotmarket trades played major role in these manipulative strategies numerous firms and individuals have been charged with civil and criminal violations related to the manipulation of energy prices in california and elsewhere even if derivatives trading was not major cause enrons failure raises the issue of supervision of unregulated derivatives markets would it be useful if regulators had more information about the portfolios and risk exposures of major dealers in derivatives httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21135 although enrons bankruptcy appears to have had little impact on energy supplies and prices similar dealer failure in the future might damage the dealers trading partners and its lenders and could conceivably set off widespread disruptions in financial andor real commodity markets legislation proposed but not enacted in the 107th congress hr 3914 hr 4038 s 1951 and s 2724 would have among other things given the cftc more authority to pursue fraud including wash transactions in the otc market and to require disclosure of certain trade data by dealers in the 108th congress the senate twice rejected legislation samdt 876 and samdt 2083 that would have increased regulatory oversight of energy derivatives markets by the cftc and ferc see also crs report rs21401
