standard is intended for immediate operational use by units upon arrival for limited time these initial facilities may require replacement by more substantial and durable facilities during the course

incorporating atfp and physical security concerns into site selection and the development of the base camp layout will ensure adequate protection of personnel and assets the key to effective development of base camp atfp and physical security requirements is partnership between atfp personnel and the site engineers this partnership helps to ensure the development of integrated physical security protective measures and security procedures consistent with base camp design 621 essential to the base camp planning effort is the early identification of the atfp and physical security requirements addressing atfp and physical security concerns early helps to ensure that site location and layout is compatible with security operations and mission accomplishment early development of atfp and physical security requirements also helps to reduce both construction and manpower costs it is easier and more cost effective to establish security measures during the planning process than

atfp and physical security concerns are critical to the development of contingency base and long term camps incorporating atfp and physical security concerns into site selection and the development of

situation outlining the base camps limits for growth plus potential areas for development unclassifiedfor official use only r 4151 40 2 the long range development component lrdc outlines the endstate of development across the camp 3 the shortrange component src identifies specifics projects required to implement the lrdc b constraints and opportunities component caoc the caoc is an assessment of the base camps current situation with analysis to achieve the desired end state of development it illustrates infrastructure transportation zoning safety and other common systems required to support base development the caoc establishes the basic framework and specific options for developing and managing the base camp while documenting base camp capabilities constraints and opportunities it specifies optimum land use for enhanced mission accomplishment and quality community support it also identifies expansion capabilities based on current or known future missions the caoc provides the basic building blocks upon which all other bcmp components are based 1 the elements of the caoc are development analysis narrative analyzes the base camps missions goals and objectives with recommendations for development it includes the base camps ability to support expansion or reduction in missions and identifies the capabilities constraints and environmental limitations of the land utility sources infrastructure and facilities b environmental quality and land use analysis narrative and map serves as description of the baseline environmental conditions at the base camp and its ability to support assigned missions it analyzes overall base camp development and identifies the areas deserving environmental concern it describes gaps in baseline environmental information and recommends necessary surveys and studies required to complete the description of the base camp it recommends developmental opportunities that mitigate environmental damage it serves as the framework for all future formal environmental analyses the plan will portray constraints to base camp development with proper zoning taken into consideration it will be composite map of environmental data that include at minimum 1 safety zones to include explosive and airfield criteria 2 surfaceaerial limiting factors for example noise and flood plains 3 naturalcultural resource related for example soils

required to produce holistic plan for secure mission environment local force protection mitigation procedures and approval processes should be developed to mitigate vulnerabilities created by temporary construction ie fence replacement or guard shack reconstruction f fire protection assessmentplan narrative and map since the majority of facilities developed within the cjtf joint operational area will be built to initial or temporary construction standards the risk posed by fire hazards is high therefore as mitigation measure all base camps will assess fire protection measures into their caoc in order to address hazards and identify real property zoning actions 2 caoc development and review bases will complete their caoc as directed in centcom opords base commanders will

closure and turnover basing location fobsbase camps to the host nation or private property owner the process involves the disposition of structures materials contracts and the transfer of real and seized property to the host nation governmentcivilian as well as provision for security or assistance in reuse planning in addition the intent is to facilitate the timely termination of reduction of all contract services in conjunction with the base closure the appendix will apply to all basing locations within the uscentcom aor 2 real property 21 policy transfer all occupied host nation governmental property in the fobbase camp designated for closure to the responsible host nation agency for all privately owned real property being used under lease or similar agreement the property will be returned to the private property owner this policy applies to all us and coalition forces unless the respective national laws or regulations direct otherwise 22 definition of real property real property is defined as land and permanent improvements on the land all nonrelocatable buildings facilities or structures that house personnel vehicles supplies or equipment will be transferred 23 prior to transfer of real property as minimum the following tasks will be completed by the bosi currently occupying the fobbase camp 231 terminate all existing bosi or service funded facility
