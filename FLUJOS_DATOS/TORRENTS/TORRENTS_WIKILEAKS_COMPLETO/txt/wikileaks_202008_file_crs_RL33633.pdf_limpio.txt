the adoption of children through federal grants to states and through the tax code although federal assistance programs for adoption focus primarily on children adopted out of foster care federal adoption tax provisions are available for all adoptions except for adoptions of stepchildren congress created federal tax assistance for adoption by enacting the small business and job protection act of 1996 pl 104188 the act added tax incentives for adoption to the existing federal adoption assistance grant programs by creating tax credit and an income tax exclusion of up to 5000 per adoption and 6000 per adoption of special needs child the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 increased qualified expenses for the credit and the income tax exclusion to 10000 indexed for inflation but with sunset period beginning in 2011 the prior law limits of 5000 and 6000 will become effective again the tax credit and the income tax exclusion significantly limit who may benefit from the tax provisions both provisions are subject to phaseout rule which creates an income cap and the tax credit is nonrefundable which creates minimum income level for using the credit these provisions limit the number of taxpayers who benefit from the credit as result in tax year 2006 very few families with an adjusted gross income of less than 30000 or with an adjusted gross income of 200000 or more claimed the credit in tax year 2006 approximately 93400 tax returns or 07 of all tax returns included cl aim for the adoption tax credit with total credit value claimed of 3019 million policy issues associated with the tax provisions are the limited availability of the credit resulting from the phaseout rule and nonrefundablity of the credit more generous provisions for domestic adoptions and for adoptions of special needs children and whether the tax system is the most efficient means of providing federal assistance for adoption in the 110 th congress legislation was introduced hr 273 hr 471 hr 3758s 561 and s 3079 that would have repealed the egtrra sunset provision as it relates to the adoption tax provisions hr 1074 hr 3192 hr 7091 and s 2407 would have increased the maximum qualified expenses from 10000 to 15000 with an inflation adjustment and made the adoption tax credit refundable hr 4313 would have provided an additional 2000 of tax credit for

process of child adoption nonetheless the federal government plays significantthough indirectrole in supporting adoption through grants to states that provide both onetime and ongoing subsidies to parents of adoptive children with special needs and through tax benefits that help offset the costs of adopting child this report focuses primarily on the latterthe federal adoption tax credit and income tax exclusion for employerprovided adoption assistance g21g140g152g153g142g561g152g143g561g3g141g152g153g157g146g152g151g561 there are several types of adoption including domestic public agency adoption domestic private adoption and intercountry adoption with regard to each of these types of adoption the department of health and human services hhs collects data on children adopted with the involvement of state child welfare agencies and the department of state records the number of intercountry adoptions through its visa reporting system however statistics on private adoptions are the least reliable or consistent because private agencies and individuals who facilitate independent adoptions are not required to report data to either state or federal agencies the most recent data on all types of adoption collected by the national center for state courts ncsc indicate than an estimated 127000 children were adopted in 2001 this is approximately the same estimated number of adopti ons as in 1992 and somewhat higher than the estimated 118000 adoptions in 1987 1 according to ncsc data of adoptions in 2001 an estimated 46 were private including tribal and kinship such as stepparent 39 were intercountry and 15 were public agency adoptions however these percentages differ greatly from 1992 when an estimated 77 of adoptions were private 5 were intercountry and 18 were public agency adoptions the tax provisions described in this report cover all types of adoption except for adoptions by stepparents according to data for 1992 the most recent available the majority of private adoptions or 42 of total adoptions were by stepparents2 g6g152g150g142g156g157g146g140g561g18g158g139g149g146g140g561g3g144g142g151g140g162g561g3g141g152g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 children in state foster care are typically placed in either foster family homes relative foster homes group homes or institutional settings such as hospitals or residential treatment centers on the last day of fy2006 approximately 510000 children were in foster care and 129000 were waiting to be adopted foster children waiting to be adopted include those who have permanency goal of adoption andor those

independent agreements in which an individual arranges for another party to adopt his or her child4 like all adoptions private adoptions are finalized by state or tribal courts but data on these adoptions are not systematically collected or reported therefore national data on domestic private adoptions are the least reliable or consistent the most recent effort to count domestic private adoptions was in 2001 when as noted earlier the national center on state courts estimated them at 58600 or 46 of the estimated 127000 adoptions of all kinds adoptions the comparable estimate for fy1992 was 77 of the total number of adoptions also estimated at 127000 for that year or 97700 adoptions g11g151g157g142g155g140g152g158g151g157g155g162g561g3g141g152g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 intercountry also called foreign or international adoptions are adoptions of noncitizen or resident children by families who are citizens or legal residents of the united states5 in fy2007 the department of state reported issuing 19613 immigrant visas to orphans entering the united states issuance of such visa is prerequisite for intercountry adoption by us citizen and the number of such visas is considered good proxy for the number of such adoptions the comparable number of visas in fy2000 was 17718 in fy1990 the number of such visas issued was 7093 6

claiming the credit for the adoption of special needs child is assumed to have incurred the maximum amount of qualifying expenses and may claim the full credit16 many children adopted from the public child welfare system meet the definition of special needs for the adoption tax credit child is defined as special needs child if the childs state of residence determines that the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his or her birth parents there is specific factor or condition which leads to the reasonable conclusion that the child will not be adopted without assistance provided to the adoptive parents and the child is citizen or legal resident of the united states 14 irc 23d1b and irc 23d1c 15 prior to tax year 2003 taxpayer claiming the adoption tax credit or using

determining whether child is special needs child include ethnicity minority status age status as part of sibling group mental emotional or physical handicap and other medical conditions17 the definition of special needs for the adoption tax credit matches the definition provided in section 473 title ive of the social security act for the federal adoption assistance program18

be legal resident or citizen to qualify as special needs child therefore intercountry adoption meets the tax codes definition of special needs19 although taxpayer may not claim total adoption tax credit of more than 11650 in tax year 2008 for any single adoption the taxpayer may claim the adoption tax credit for single adoption in more than one tax year depending on when the adoption expenses are paid and whether the adoption is domestic or intercountry for domestic adoption the qualifying expenses may be claimed for the adoption tax credit prior to and during the adoption process even if the adoption is not finalized for an intercountry adoption the adoption must be finalized before taxpayer can claim the credit for the adoption expenses 20 therefore taxpayer adopting foreign child may only claim the credit beginning in the tax year in which the adoption is finalized table 2 shows the relationship between the tax year in which expenses are paid and the tax year when those

maximum amount for qualified expenses two other significant limitations are related to the credit the first is the phaseout of the credit or maximum income limitation the full credit can only be claimed by families with an adjusted gross income agi21 equal to or less than 174730 in tax year 200822 for taxpayers with incomes above this threshold amount their credit is reduced by the ratio of their income above the threshold to 40000 for example taxpayer with an agi of 180000 would have their credit reduced by 132 calculated as 180000 174730 or 5270 divided by 40000 equals 132 for taxpayers with an agi 40000 or more above the threshold 23 the credit is reduced to zero 0 the second limitation is that the credit is nonrefundable and nonrefundable tax credit can only offset tax liability24 for the adoption tax credit the actual amount of the credit that may be taken is based on tax liability remaining after almost all other nonrefundable tax credits have been appliedthe foreign tax credit credit for child and dependant care expenses credit for the elderly and disabled education credits retirement savings contribution credit and the child tax credit 25 therefore taxpayers with tax liability that is significantly lower than their qualified adoption expenses after the other nonrefundable tax credits receive only limited benefit from the tax credit if the qualified expenses exceed the taxpayers tax liability the tax liability will be reduced to zero but the taxpayer will not receive refund the lower the taxpayers tax liability the lower the benefit from the credit there is however carryover provision that allows taxpayer to carry the credit forward for up to five years 26

filing requirements may vary generally married couple must file joint tax return to claim the adoption tax credit 28 if two taxpayers not married to each other wish to claim the adoption tax credit they may split the qualified expenses for the adoption tax 21 adjusted gross income is total taxa ble income after statutory adjustments total taxable income does not include income that is exempt from income taxes such as veterans benefits statutory adjustments reduce taxable income before exemptions and any standard or itemized deductions examples of statutory adjustments are health savings accounts ira deductions and alimony paid the limitation is based on adjusted gross income without regard to irc sections 911 931 or 933 22 irc 23b2a the income limitation is 150000 adjusted for inflation therefore the income limit in tax year 2008 is 174730 23 taxpayers with an income of 214730 or more in tax year 2008 24 nonrefundable tax credit is tax credit that cannot ex ceed taxpayers tax liability any credit am ount left over more than the taxpayers tax liability may be depending on the tax credit carried over and used in future tax year with refundable tax credit such as the

major us companies offered adoption assistance as an employee benefit41 employers sampled by hewitt offered from 1500 to 15000 with an average of 3879 in reimbursement of adoption expenses42 because

taxpayer must have tax liability after other nonrefundable tax credits that is equal to or greater than the maximum amount of qualified expenses for the tax credit for example for childless married

approximately 90000 and 174730 43 if the taxpayer has an income outside this range the taxpayer will have reduced credit or credit in the tax year 2008 but in some cases may be able to claim the

tax liability after other nonrefundable tax credits in other words it is not refundable taxpayers whose tax liability after other nonrefundable tax credit is lower than their qualified adoption expenses will receive reduced adoption tax credit or adoption tax credit the interaction of the adoption tax credit with the other nonrefundable credits is significant because when taxpayer with qualified adoption expenses adopts child the taxpayer becomes eligible for 1000 child tax credit for the adopted child the child tax credit reduces tax liability before the adoption tax credit for example in tax year 2008 married couple adopts child and has qualified adoption expenses in tax year 2008 of 15000 if the couples income is 50000 their income tax liability before credits is 4657 after the nonrefundable child credit of 1000 their remaining tax liability is 3657 this is the maximum adoption tax credit the couple can claim with the remaining credit 8082 carried over to future

g343g342g561the percentage of total tax returns using the adoption tax credit has increased since tax year 1997 the first year of the credit when 03 of total tax returns claimed the adoption tax credit the change to the phaseout income level made by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act egtrra pl 1071644 significantly increased the percentage of tax returns with an adjusted gross income between 100000 and 200000 claiming the adoption tax credit from 03 in tax year 2000 to 16 in tax year 2004 making the adoption tax credit refundable may allow more taxpayers at lower levels of agi to benefit from the adoption tax credit however doing so would increase the cost of the credit the current cost of the adoption tax credit is relatively small 3512 million in credit claimed in tax year 2006 in contrast in tax year 2006 35 billion was claimed for the child and dependent care credit and 317 billion for the child tax credit cost one consideration in making the adoption tax credit refundable is an issue that arises with all refundable tax creditsthe refundable tax credit may encounter overclaim problems similar to those experienced with the earned income tax credit eitc 45 the amount of the adoption tax credit is limited by tax liability after other nonrefundable tax credits not by the cost of the adoption as agi increases larger amounts of the adoption tax credit can be used to offset tax liability and reduce the final adoption cost therefore assuming taxpayer adopting child out of foster care has qualified adoption expenses that taxpayer has greater chance of having those costs covered by the adoption tax credit this is because foster care adoptions are the least expensive with costs ranging from 0 to 2500 however even to reach 2500 of tax liability taxpayer must have an agi of approximately 50000 46 because of the carryover provision any adoption tax credit not claimed in the current tax year may be claimed in future tax years up to five tax years because costs tend to be much higher for domestic private adoptions and intercountry adoptions taxpayer will have to have higher agi and higher tax liability to utilize the maximum value of the adoption tax credit and recover more of the adoption costs where the adoption costs are greater than the maximum value of the credit which may be the case for some domestic private adoptions and intercountry adoptions the taxpayer will not recover the full cost of the adoption through the adoption tax credit even if the taxpayer can claim the maximum adoption tax credit for example if an adoption costs taxpayer 30000 the taxpayer will receive the maximum adoption tax credit if his or her agi is between approximately 102000 and 174730 however the final adoption costs will still be greater than the maximum adoption tax credit as result of the phaseout income limitation and nonrefundability of the tax credit many taxpayers may not be able to take the full adoption tax credit for an adoption this raises the policy issue of whether and how to expand the tax provisions to increase the use of the tax provisions and whether federal and state subsidies may be more efficient than tax provisions in helping offset the costs of adoption 44 egtrra pl 10716 raised the income threshold for the phaseout of the adoption tax credit from 75000 to 150000 45 for information

considered the efficiency of adoption tax provisions and adoption subsidy programs in the 1980s in 1980 the federal government began sharing with the states the cost of providing monthly subsidies for parents who adopt children with special needs adoption assistance and child welfare act of 1980 pl 96272 this federal adoption assistance program which helps parents with the ongoing costs of raising an adoptive special needs child is authorized under title ive of the social security act in 1981 the economic recovery tax act pl 9734 established an itemized tax deduction for certain costs of adopting child with special needs the provision was intended to encourage adoption of special needs children by relieving some of the financial burden for taxpayers 47 in 1986 the tax reform act pl 99514 repealed the itemized deduction and instead expanded the title ive program to require that states provide direct assistance to adoptive parents to help with the initial and nonrecurring costs of adopting special needs child that legislation also authorized federal matching grants to states for this purpose which as implemented range up to 2000 for an adoptive family with the federal government reimbursing 50 1000 of the cost to the state in making this change congress believed that the itemized tax deduction provided the greatest benefit to highincome earners48 congress also believed that agencies with expertise in placing children with special needs should have budgetary control over adoption assistance and that grant programs would facilitate more appropriate federal spending than the tax system 49 since 1997 however when pl 104188 first provided for an adoption tax credit federal assistance for adoption has been provided through both grant programs and the tax code

although the maximum amount of qualified expenses is the same for all adoptions taxpayer who adopts special needs child is assumed to have incurred the maximum amount of qualified expenses regardless of actual expenses and therefore has the maximum adoption tax credit special needs children by definition are considered hard to place for adoption without assistance to their adoptive parents providing preference for one type of adoptive child over another in the federal tax code may be viewed as unfair or inequitablea taxpayer adopting special needs child receives larger tax benefit than taxpayer adopting nonspecial needs child even if both taxpayers have the same total costs of adoption however the preference for special needs children is policy decision made by congress to encourage

because for domestic adoption qualifying expenses may be claimed even if domestic adoption does not finalize51 intercountry adoptions must become finalized before taxpayer can claim any qualifying expenses for the tax credit or income tax exclusion52 intercountry adoptions are typically considered more expensive and less predictable for finalization than domestic adoptions53 family may spend great deal of money for an intercountry adoption but will not receive tax benefit if something prevents the adoption from becoming final the preference in the federal tax provisions for domestic adoption may be considered inequitable or unfair by some families that do not receive tax benefit because their intercountry adoption was not finalized g7g9g22g20g20g3g561 current policy issue surrounding the tax credit and income tax exclusion is the sunset of certain provisions established in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 egtrra provided for an increase in the maximum qualified expenses and increased the amount of income where the credit phaseout begins the income limitation however to remain in compliance with the congressional budget act egtrra included sunset provisionthe changes will expire and in 2011 prior law will take effect taxpayers beginning in tax year 2011 will be allowed to claim up to 5000 in qualified expenses for non special needs children and up to 6000 for special needs children all expenses must be documented regardless of special needs status taxpayers with incomes greater than 75000 will receive reduced adoption tax credit because of the phaseout and taxpayers with incomes greater than 115000 40000 above the threshold will not be eligible for the adoption tax credit

provided an itemized deduction for adoption expenses which was repealed by the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 however the 1986 law also amended title ive of the social security act to require states
