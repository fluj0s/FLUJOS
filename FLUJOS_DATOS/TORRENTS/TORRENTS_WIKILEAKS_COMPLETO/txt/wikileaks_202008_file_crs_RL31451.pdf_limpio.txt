future international financial crises similar progress however has not been made in the management of such crises currently there is clear alternative to large loans often called bailouts by the imf or tting the debtor country fend for itself which may lead to severe recession in the debtor country andor the spread of the crisis to other countries two recent proposals one by anne krueger of the imf and the other by john taylor of the us treas ury aim to resolve this dilemma by establishing more orderly and predic table way to manage financial crises anne krueger proposes to establis h framework based on bankruptcy procedures in the united states to restru cture unsustainable sovereign or country debt john taylor proposes that collec tive action clauses which specify the procedure to be followed when country n eeds to restructure its debt be included in debt contracts the imf proposal s been described as more centralized structured approach while the treasury proposal is considered decentralized marketoriented approach both proposals are concerned with sove reign country debt owed to private creditors such as banks or bondho lders moreover both proposals involve the private sector in managing crises woul d probably reduce the need for large imf loans in the future major difference is how they would be implemented the imf proposal would likely require change in th imfs articles of agreement while the treasury proposal might require incentives to encourage lenders and borrowers to use collective action clauses in their debt contracts both proposals are fairly broad and do not specify all the details involved in implementation the important contributi on of these proposals is that they are stimulating debate about how to better manage intern ational financial crises opinion in the internati onal financial community is divided on support for the two proposals some economists favor the imf proposal and others the treasury proposal the private creditor commun ity discouraged the imf proposal but supports collective action clauses along w ith establishment of private sector advisory group many of the debtor count ries oppose collective action clauses which they believe will cause an increase in intere st rates they pay the major industrial countries support both proposals but mainta in that the treasury proposal which is easier to implement should be acted on first more orderly procedures for sovereign debt restructurin g are of interest to the congress because they might reduce the number and severity of international financial crises this in turn might re duce the need for additional funding for the imf or for direct us loans which we re given in the mexican crises of 1995 moreover if an amendment to the imf

alternatives to bailouts hardships and contagion introduction international financial crises have beco more numerous and serious since the mexican peso crises erupted in 1995 th international monetary fund imf has responded by supplying funds in larger am ounts to debtor countries resulting in the charge that the imf bails out banks nd bondholders currently there is clear alternative to large loans or letting the btor country fend for itself which may lead to severe recession in th debtor country andor the sp read of the crisis to other countries two recent proposals one by anne krueger of the imf and the other by john taylor of the us treasury aim to resolve this dilemma by establishing more orderly and predictable wa to manage financial crises1 the krueger proposal would estab lish framework based on bankruptcy procedures in the united states to restruct ure unsustainable sovereign debt in the taylor proposal collective action clauses wh ich specify the procedure to be followed when country needs to restructure its bt would be included in debt contracts both proposals are fairly general and do not specify all the details involved in implementation however both proposals are stimulating debate about how to better manage international financial crises the imf and treasury proposals are concer ned with sovereig n or country debt owed to private creditors such as banks or bondholders both proposals seek to deepen the involvement of the private sect or in managing the crises since low income developing countries are usua lly unable to obtain loans from private creditors the imf and treasury proposals would apply mostly to middleincome developing countries2 the goal of the imf and treasury proposal s is to better mana ge international financial crises these proposals

implications for congress questions posed in this report include why is more orderly procedure needed to restructure unsustainable debt apparently needed how are the imf and treasury proposals similar and how do they diffe r what is the role of the imf in each of the proposals what are the view s of leading economists private creditors sovereign borrowers and the indus trial countries on these proposals it is important to note that this is an economic not legal analysis furthermore it is an overview of the main issues involved in the proposals not an exhaustive study of all the deta ils and ramifications congress is interested in more or derly procedures for sovereign debt restructuring because they might reduce th number and severity of international financial crises this in turn might re duce the need for additional funding for the imf or for direct us loans as in the mexican crisis moreover if an amendment to the imf articles of agreement were n eeded to implement proposal the congress would have to vote on it background borrowing countries having trouble servicin g their debt are generally extremely reluctant to declare default major incentive to avoid default is that creditors may be unwilling to make future loans w ithout foreign capital countrys economic growth rate will be restraine d in some cases borrowing countries put off defaulting until their situation is desperate which makes the problem much more difficult to deal with borrowing from abroad to finance economic growth has long history in both the united states and other countries fo r example foreigners in 1900 held 31 billion of us railroad bonds3 defaults have occurred many times in history and the debtor countries have usually been able to borrow again in foreign markets after period of time has elapsed if creditors perceive them worthy despite the fears of borrowers defaults historica lly have not had permanen t effect on countrys ability to borrow abroad

repay in recent years advances in telecommunications and technol ogy have meant that the spread of news is almost instantaneous thus adverse economic or political developments may lead creditors to suddenly run for the exit the large growth and volatility of capital flows to developing countries since 1990 are shown in figure 1 above net capital flows to developing countries increased from 36

hornbeck 6 mishkin frederic s global financial instability framework events issues journal of economic perspectives vol 13 4 fall 1999 p 12causes of past problems the causes lis ted below are often interrelated and more than one factor may have c ontributed to overborrowing4 relaxation of capital controls by emerging market economies in the early 1990s along with perceived high growth opportunities led to surge in capital flows that was perhaps not justified by the risk weak national banking and fina ncial systems along with poor supervision and inadequate re gulation in emerging market economies contributed to lax lending standards overvalued exchange rates in some countries such as mexico and argentina led to deterioration in export competitiveness and growing current account deficit5 poor debt management policies culminated in high shortterm debt denominated in foreign currencies relative to central bank holdings of foreign currencies for example before each crisis began the ratio of shortterm debt to re serves was 26 in mexico and 15 or higher in south korea indonesia and thailand6 lack of adequate information on emerging market economies meant that financial markets c ould not properly evaluate the true risk of an investment the financial crises left the debtor c ountries cut off from foreign capital flows that were important to their economic growth at least for while the reduction in capital inflows drove up interest rates in the developing countries and slowed their investment higher interest rates also threatened the fi nancial health

s preceded by recession response of the international monetary fund the immediate res ponse of the imf was to coordinate package of loans for each crisis country in addition to the imf other contributor s were the multilateral development banks and indi vidual countries for example loan commitments to indonesia totaled 42 b illion of which the imf share was 11 billion the world bank and asian development bank share 10 b illion and the bilateral loan share 21 billion major purpose of the loans was to prevent the crisis from spreading to other countries contagion can occu r in one of several ways investor confidence can be shaken by real or perceived similaritie s between the crisis country and other countries for example if the crisis count rys shortterm debt is greater than its foreigncurrency reserves i nvestors may withdraw funds from other countries that are in the same situation crises can also spread though the trade account of affected countries especially among major trading part ners if the crisis country imports less the exports of its trading partners decline raising their current account deficit there is considerable debate over the extent to which contagion actually occurs nevertheless officials of governments and multilateral institutions tend to be risk averse and when crisis occurs they are likely to take steps to contain it

resources the principal source of funds for the imf are quota subscriptions each imf member country is assigned quota based on its economic size which determines its maximum financial contribution to the imf its voting power and is the basis for determining access to imf loans in addition the imf can borrow under two supplemental credit arrangements eleven countries make funds available under the general arrangements to borrow gab established in 1962 and renewed periodically twentyfive member countries make funds available under the new arrangements to borrow nab established in 1998 currently total imf resources are 307 billio n of which quotas account for 265 billion the gab 21 billion and the nab 21 billion over the past five years several steps have been taken to increase imf resources in 1997 the supplemental reserve facility srf was created to provide additional fi nancial assistance to members facing sudden capital outflow in 1998 imf quotas were increased by 89 bi llion of which the us share was 145 billion also in 1998 the new arrangements to borrow nab backup source of financing was established the us share was 35 billion criticisms of the imf major criticism of imf loans is that they contribute to moral hazard of creditors and debtors moral hazard in the international context occurs when creditor takes excessive risks when lending to developing countries because of the likelihood of an imf bailout the lender has come to believe that in the event of the debtors inability to pay the imf or another institution or group of count ries will come to the aid of the debtor and the creditor will not lose his investment in other words the creditor stands to gain if the investment is successful but losses will be mitigated if the investment fails thus the creditor may more easily take imprudent risks since he is not bearing the full cost of the risks some argue that the imf loan to mexico in 1995 reduced the incentives of creditors to pr operly evaluate the economic conditions of other countries before making loans and t hus it contributed to the financial crises of countries in the late 1990s the debtor countries themselves can also be subject to moral hazard if they perceive that imf or other loans will be forthcoming in the event of difficulty servicing their debt they might borrow more than is justified by their potential economic conditions furthermor debtor countries might be less inclined to pursue responsible economic po licies if they rely on the imf to come to their aid if their economy falters to the extent that moral hazard does occur the perceived availability of bailouts leads to making decisions that c ontribute to crises and are not in the long run interest of either the creditor or th debtor although moral hazard has been widely discussed both by academics and the media there are actual data to suggest that it plays large or small role in the behavior of creditors or debtors nevertheless it is important in the debate over the future role of the imf in making large loans to developing countries another criticism concerns the cond itionality attached to imf loans typically when loan is negotiated th borrowing country agrees to certainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31451crs8 9 for more information on these reforms see crs report rl30272 global fi nancial turmoil the imf and the new financial architecture by dick k nantoconditions which may specify limits on budget deficits or limits on increases in the money supply conditions are generally imed at strengthening the debtor countrys economic and financial situation the imf maintains that conditi onality is necessary to ensure that imf loans will be repai d unlike domestic lenders the imf cannot attach the assets of defaulting borrower in the late 1990s some critics thought that the macroeconomic conditions especially for countries that did not have huge fiscal defic its were too severe it was argued that requirements for tighter budget s and high interest rates worsened the economies of the debtor countries far more than was necessary furthermore some suggested that lowerincome people in the debtor country bore most of the brunt of conditionality imf conditionality was also criticized for going beyond macroeconomic and financial conditions to include structural conditions fo r example the conditions in the indonesian case included elimination of the clove marketing board and changes in the structure of the sugar flour and cement markets some argue that the world bank is better qualified to suggest structural changes others maintain that coordination of structural and stabilization policies is needed and it may be more effective to put them in the same package finally the imf was criticized for not providing the private sector with sufficient information to evaluate the potential risks of investment some also argue that the imf kept information confidential or did not provide reliable information in timely way imf reforms to prevent future crises preventing financial crises is part of the process of reforming the international financial architecture the imf and other institutions have taken number of steps in recent years although implementation nd enforcement of some of the measures remain weak these measures include9 improved transparency by providing timely reliable data and information about

orderly resolution of crises and created the contingent credit line ccl at the imf which makes funds available to countries with strong economic policies where problems might arise from intern ational financ ial contagion10 to date the ccl has not been used by any country possibly because of the perception that such use woul d damage the countrys reputation as responsible borrower managing financial crises although improved crisis prevention may reduce the number of future crises many argue that better procedures to manage crises are still needed at present there is clear alternative to loans by the imf and other lending institutions this raises the question of moral hazar d on the one hand and letting th debtor country fend for itself on the other hand which poses rdship on the borrowing country and may allow the crises to spread to other countri moreover as described earlier imf resources are not unlimited collective action pr oblem and clauses the collective action problem is at the heart of the imf and treasury proposals for managing financial crises in fact the economic rationale for both international bankruptcy procedures and the use of co llective action clauses in bond contracts is to deal with the collective action problem consequently it is explained in this section why cant country facing an unsusta inable debt problem simply initiate negotiations with creditors itself it can but it runs the risk that few creditors will immediately withdraw their funds to get th eir money before the other creditors do since there is not enough to go around for all creditors so hol dout creditor could initiate lawsuit in order to get full payment thereby disrupting the negotiating process this is just what happened in the case of elliot associates versus peru11 in 1995 peru announced that under the brady pl an it would restructure loans to two peruvian banks that had been guaranteed by the government in 1996 180 creditors agreed to exchange the old debt for combination of brady bonds and cash elliot associates firm that specialized in purchasing securities of distressed debtors bought peruvian bank bonds at price signif icantly below face value elliot did not participate in the brady exchange but instead filed suit in new york stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31451crs10 12 roe mark j the voting prohibition in bond workouts yale law journal december 1987supreme court seeking paymen t for the face value ultima tely after several rulings and appeals peru was close to defaulting on its restructured debt and chose to settle by paying elliot 563 million since the case was not litigated to conc lusion precedent was established thus there is concern that in future cases holdout creditors could block country from restructur ing its debt this case is widely cited as evidence that more formal process is needed to restructure debt generally creditors as whole are better off in debt restructuring if they cooperate in resolving the debt problem the assets of the debtor are usually worth more if held together and creditors gain by negotiating together at the same time an individual creditor can gain more by pulling his money out first moreover if one creditor is not sure the others will cooperate he is likely to run for the exit and get his money out safely if all creditors feel this way however creditor panic ensues bonds issued in the united kingdom in clude collective ac tion clauses cacs key provision of such clauses is that changes in the terms of payment of bond restructuring accepted by substantial or super majority perhaps 7075 of the creditors is binding on all creditors b onds issued in the united kingdom must also have procedure for appointing representativ of the creditors to negotiate with the debtor this effectively prevents holdout creditors from blocking restructuring agreement which benefits the majority of creditors holdout creditors cannot sue to block payment under the restructuring agr eement under uk law bond covenants can prohibit individual creditors from pursuing litigation against the debtor and require that proceeds of litigation be sh ared equally with all the creditors in contrast collective action clauses are not used in bonds issued in the united states changes in the terms of payment of bond must be approved by all the bondholders thus restructuring agreemen t must have unanim ous approval which is generally impossible to obtain since much of the emerging market debt is denominated in dollars the us practi ce has large effect on sovereign debt collective action clauses were however included in many corporate us bonds until passage of the trust indenture ac t of 1939 15 usc 77pppb made them illegal section 316b of th is act prohibits any change in the principal amount of corporate bond without the consent of ll bondholders the rationale for ending collective action clauses was to prevent in siders from gaining control of bond issue and then destroying it for their own benefit12 although the prohib ition does not apply to sovereign debt by tradition sove reign bonds issued in the united states do not include cacs presumably this means that cacs could be included in sovereign bonds issued in the united states without change in us law the imf proposal for sovereign debt restructuring mechanism sdrm on november 26 2001 anne krueger

ory basis for debtors and creditors to restructure unsustainable debt in an orderl predictable way the proposal called sovereign debt restructuring mech anism or sdrm was endorsed by the international monetary and financial committee imfc which represents the interests of the imfs 184 member count ries at the imfs annual meeting in september 2002 the sdrm is based on and similar in many respects to chapter 11 of us bankruptcy law key principles of the sdrm are the debtor is given access to working capital while thereorganization plan is being devise d the working capital would have priority over old debt in repayment access to working capital by debtors is important to help preserve the debtors ability to generate resources to meet its ob ligation to service debt working capital can also mitigate the hardship f aced by the debtor to encourage private creditors to provide such capital they need to be given priority in repayment so the new loans do not get caught up in the restructuring the completed reorganization pl an is voted on by qualified majority of the creditors and is binding on all creditors according to anne krueger14 the use of qualified majority of creditors to bind dissenting minority to the terms of the restructuring agreement is the most important element of the sdrm it prevents free riders from insisting on full payment after an agreement is reached which is unfair to other creditors and reduces the ability of the debtor to service the restruct ured debt majority voting also speeds up the debt restructuring process in the original proposal for an sdrm the imf included clauses requiring an automatic stay on litigation during the standstill on debtservicing in order to allow the debtor time to formulate reorganization plan in which all creditors are treated equally15 this was considered one of the mo st important components of the sdrm protecting the debtor nation as domestic debtors are protected under chapter 11 rules it also proved to be the one of th most highly contested issues concerning the sdrm and was eventually removed16 it should be emphasized that the imf proposal applies only to sovereign or country debt owed to private credito rs including bank loans and bonds the proposal applies only when the debt burde n is clearly unsustainable when there ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31451crs12 17 krueger anne new approaches to sovereign debt restructuring an update on our thinking speech april 1 2002 p 4 website http www imforg feasible way the debtor could resolve th crisis unless the value of the debt were reduced the rationale given for the imf proposal is twofold first lending to developing countries has increasingly take n the form of bond issues not commercial bank loans emerging market bond issues have grown four times as quickly as syndicated bank loans since 198017 this means that it is now much more difficult to coordinate debt restructuring than in the past because bondholders are far more numerous and diverse than banks more over bondholders have fewer incentives to cooperate in restructuring and are less likely to have common interests than banks second as discussed earlier imf resour ces may not be adequate to provide loans if multiple crises occur simultaneously in the future unlike domestic central banks the imf cannot print money its re sources are limited to the quotas paid in by its members and the funds it can borrow fro m the industrial countries through the general arrangements to borrow and wider group of countries in the new arrangements to borrow furthermore the widespread moral hazard concern that imf loans would bail out private creditors puts some limits on the use of imf resources in crisis the imf proposal would according to dr krueger reduce the cost of restructuring and would encourage debtor countries to restruct ure sooner than they do now perhaps avoiding some of the ec onomic dislocations that occur with disorderly restructuring creditors also would benefit since the value of their loans would decline less than in disorderly restructuring the proposal would also encourage sove reign debtors and private creditors to negotiate restructuring agreement outside of bankruptcy the threat of using the bankruptcy procedure in case negotiations fail may lead to unofficial bankruptcy workouts which are quicker and less costly for this to happen however formal bankruptcy procedure needs to be in place the role of the imf in the sdrm is one of the issues to be worked out in future discussions of the proposal initially nne krueger proposed that the imf would approve debtor countrys request for temporary standstill nd would review the debtor countrys policies to ensure that they were appropriate during the standstill qualified majority of the creditors w ould approve the restructuring agreement based on determination by the imf that the remaining debt is sustainable in the discussions that followed nne kruegers november 26 2001 speech some objected to the increased power that would be given to the imf in the proposal it was argued that imf mission creep would arise from the its role in deciding whether or not country could impos standstill and in determining the sustainability of the restructured debt moreover since the imf itself is creditor and the member countries of the imf in clude both debtors and bilateral

http wwwimforgcreditors some are concerned that the imf would not be impartial in approving standstill or judging whether restructured debt was sustainable subsequently revised sdrm proposal was nnounced in sp eech by dr krueger on april 1 200218 it differs from the original proposal in two main ways first it supports wider use of collective ac tion clauses but suggests that they alone are not enough second while it retains the general pro cedures of the sdrm the role of the imf is reduced qualified majority of credito rs would approve the initial standstill and the final restructuring agreement at the september imf meetings the imfc requested the imf to present concrete proposal for an sdrm at the spring imf meetings on april 12 2002 the most complete and recent proposal the design of the soverei gn debt restructuring mechanismfurther considerations was discussed by the imf executive board in december 2002 and released to january 7 200319 implementation of the imf proposal could be through an international treaty or by national legislation wh ich could be circumvented if all countries did not enact appropriate legisl ation anne krueger proposes us ing the treaty option to implement the sdrm the easiest way to establis h treaty would be through an amendment to the imfs articles of agreement which could provide the legal basis for the sdrm an amendment would be binding on all imf members once it is accepted by threefifths of the members with 85 pe rcent of the total voting power with more than 17 percent of the voting power us approval would be necessary it should be noted that this would only gives the sdrm statutory basis it would not by itself give the imf any additional authority one criticism of the imf proposal is that an sdrm is not needed for several reasons first governments already can unilaterally declare standstill second even though some creditors might initiate wsuits it is not easy to attach the assets of sovereign borrowers whic h are often in different jurisdiction since creditors are unlikely to sue it is argued the stay on legal action is not really necessary third provision of working capital during restru cturing process can be done by the imf which for the past several years has been lending into arrears providing loans to sovereign borrowers who have not yet comp leted negotiations with private creditors but who are negotiating in good faith another criticism is that the sdrm could lead to moral hazard for the debtor country in corporate bankruptcy procedure the judge can seize control of firms financial affairs and replace its manage ment in an international bankruptcy procedure seizing control of sovereign country or replacing its leaders would not be possible thus debtor country knowing that it would be protected by standstill might be more likely to declare bankruptcy the counter argument is that countries avoid bankruptcy primarily becau they dont want to be cut off from international financia l

countries but the name g10 remains unchanged lose than gain from filing for bankruptcy the moral hazard of the sdrm is considered small by some observers the us treasury proposal for coll ective action clauses cacs in speech on april 2 2000 john b taylor under secretary of treasury for international affairs proposed decentr alized marketoriented approach for sovereign debt restructuring20 under this plan creditors and sovereign borrowers would include clauses in their debt cont racts which would desc ribe the procedure to be used when country decides it has to restructure its debt guidelines for the clauses would include the following majority action clause this clause would allow supermajority perhaps 75 percent of creditors to change the terms of the contract which is then binding on the minority in this way small minority of creditors could not delay or disrupt restructuring agreement clause describing the process through which debtors and creditors come together to negotiate restructuring this clause would specify how the creditors would be represented and the data that the debtor must provide to the creditors representative the creditors representative would negotiate w ith the debtor and would have authority to initiate litig ation on instructions of certain proportion of the creditors clause describing how the sover eign country would initiate the restructuring this clause would allow for suspension of payments between the time the sovereign requests restructuring and the time the creditors representative is chosen fixed limit of perhaps 60 days is suggested and during this time creditor could initiate litigation one criticism of the treasury proposal is that it might be difficult to get bondholders and debtors to incorporate cacs in bond covenants several proposals to include cacs have been made by th g7 and g10 countries in the past few years with very little success21 thus the treasury proposal suggests that incentives may be necessary to encourage countries to adopt cacs one incentive might be to make cacs prerequisite for country to have an imf program another might be to lower charges on imf loans for countries with cacshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31451crs15 another criticism of the treasury propos is that collective action clauses would only be included in new bonds not existing bonds without complete coverage it is not clear how effective collective action clauses would be others maintain that since much debt is shortterm after few years cacs would be included in most bonds also bondholders and debtors might be given incentives to swap old bonds for new ones that included cacs however it is not clear how successful this would be finally if cacs are included in loans or bonds on an issuebyissue basis as the treasury proposal suggests aggregation of different types of debt issued in various jurisdictions may be difficult the treasury proposal suggests that any inconsistencies could be handled in an arbitration process for which the contracts could provide analysis of the imf and treasury proposals the goal of both proposals is to reduce the uncertainty surrounding the debt restructuring process if the procedur is more predictable sovereign borrowers will be better able to resolve debt problems in timely way moreover either proposal if successfully imple mented would likely reduce the need for large imf loans and thus reduce moral hazard bo th proposals address the collective action problem generally the imf and treasury proposals are in agreement that something needs to be done and that the private sector should be involved in debt restructuring but there is disagreement about how to do it the imf proposal has been described as more centralized structured approach while the treasury proposal is c onsidered decentralized marketoriented approach looked at another way the imf proposal is statutory while the treasury proposal is contractual even though the revised imf proposal reduces the role of the imf in the sdrm it still requires some i nvolvement of the imf or some other not yet created institution to make decisions along the wa some institutiona l involvement would probably also be necessary in the treas ury proposal especially in establishing incentives for countries and in aggregating cla ims of different types of debt still the treasury proposal is clearly more d ecentralized than the imf proposal the concept of an international bankruptcy court has never been tried the only precedents are domestic bankruptcy procedur especially chapter 11 in us law on which an international ba nkruptcy court would be m odeled there are number of differences between corporate bankr uptcy and sovereign bankruptcy procedure so that the two are not directly comparable thus it is difficult to know in advance what the possibilities and problems might be in contrast as discussed earlier collective action clauses were in use in th united states until 1939 in this respect then cacs would involve less risk than the sdrm httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31451crs16 22 see rogoff kenneth and jeromin zettelmeyer early ideas on sovereign bankruptcy reorganization survey imf working paper wp0257 18 pp website httpimforgsolvency versus liquidity crises liquidity crises occurs when debtor temporarily cannot pay some of his debts but has good longterm prospects in solvency crisis it is unlikely the debtor will ever be able to pay his debts the appropriate remedy for liquidity problem is usually to rollover the debt or to provide additional funds to tide the debtor over until the temporary problems end for solvency situation however the discharging of some or all of the debt is the most useful approach in us domestic law firm facing liquidity crisis would file chapter 11 bankruptcy petition while one facing solvency crisis would be dissolved under chapter 7 in one sense countries do not become insolvent because over time they have important assets in the productivity of their people and in their natural resources to the extent that countries cannot however tax their populations enough to pay their debts they may be considered insolvent it should be noted that it may be difficult to know whether country is illiquid or insolvent in the midst of financial crisis both proposals are relatively broad and only provide general outline of how the procedures would work number of important issues would need to be worked out for example the proposals apply only to sovereign debt what about debt owed by the private sector to foreign creditors which was important in the asian crises could the imf and treasury proposals apply to such debt should the sdrm andor cacs be used only for solvency crises or for both solvency and liquidity crises perhaps the most important issue is the implementation of each proposal although it appears that the treasury proposal would be easier to implement many obstacles remain as discussed earlier getting creditors and debtors to include cacs in new bond covenants could be difficult the likelihood that an amendment to the imfs articles of agreement is necessary to implement the sdrm is also major hurdle it usually takes long time to get agreement that an amendment is necessary and the actual amendment process is also lengthy perspectives of economists private creditors emerging market countries and industrial countries some economists support an internati onal bankruptcy court and others support adding collective action clauses to debt contracts the views of few wellknown

eichengreen professor of economics and political science at the university of california berkeley and richard portes professor of economics at the london business school nd director of the center for economic policy research the authors suggested among othe r things that loan contracts and bond covenants should specify that majority of creditors be entitled to alter the terms of the debt agreement25 more recent studies by eichengreen have continued to support the use of collective action clauses26 peter kenen pr ofessor of economics and international finance at princeton university advocates the inclusion of collective action clauses in all of the c ountries debt contracts both public and private27 in addition professor kenen suggest s that all such debt contracts should include 90day rollover option which each debtor country would be required to utilize if its government found that the count ry was in financial emergency this would eliminate the possibility of litigation b ecause the creditors would already have agreed to the rollover option majority of private creditors discouraged the use of the sdrm after it was announced in november 2001 some of the cerns of the institute for international finance iif global association of financial institutions were that an international bankruptcy court could inhibit investor confidence delay renewed access of debtor countries to capital markets that use the sd rm and might lead to contagion of other emerging markets28 according to the iif the sdrm also might encourage moral hazard by sovereign borrowers who believe they would be protected by standstill if payment problems arose instead the iif in an action plan announced in april 2002 recommended threepronged approach which includes but is not limited to collective actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31451crs18 29 ibid 30 martin paul theres better way the globe and mail may 8 2002 website httpwwwglobeandmailca 31 eichengreen barry and ashoka mody would collective action clauses raise borrowing costs website elsaberkeleyedu p 4clauses29 the iif plan involves establishing private sector advisory group to sustain investor confidence and facilitate orderly debt restructuring developing number of market incentives including co llective action clauses and designing legal strategy to ddress disruptive litigation by holdout creditors many emerging market countries ar reluctant to include cacs in bond covenants one argument is that borrowing countries are being singled out and that the wealthier developed countries should l ead the way by using cacs in fact canada did include clauses in its foreig n currency debt beginning two years ago30 only two countries the united king dom and canada to date do so borrowing countries also maintain that the inclusion of cacs would suggest to creditors that they may have difficulty repaying their loans as result creditors would only loan to them at higher intere st rate than borrowers who did not include cacs in the contracts however one recent study compared interest rates on bonds issued in the united states where cacs are not used to the united kingdom where cacs are used it found that for the most creditworthy borrowers cacs lead to lower interest rates while less creditworthy borrowers find their interest rates higher than without cacs31 although the less creditworthy countries would be dissatisfied with higher interest rates from the perspective of avoiding financial crises such distinction might be benefici higher interest rates might discourage lending to countries whose economies ar less than healthy and whose payment prospects are uncertain the finance ministers and central bank g overnors of the g7 countries have in statements issued over the past several ears supported the use of collective action clauses in bond covenants in or der to better manage interna tional financial crises on april 20 2002 the g7 countries announced an action plan in which they support both the treasury and imf proposals for debt resolution stating that the two proposals complement each other the g 7 countries focus more on the treasury plan however in the short run since the im f plan will take more time to work out more specifically the g7 action plan supports marketoriented approach of incorporating contingency clau ses in debt contracts the treasury plan which would describe what happens in the event of s overeign debt restructuring they suggest that clauses should include supermajority decisionmaking by creditors the process by which restructuring would be initiated including standstill and description of how creditors would engage with borrowers the action plan however also supports further work by the imf on pr oposed approaches to sovereign debt restructuring the imf plan that may require new international treaties changes in national legislation or amendments of the imfs articles of agreement since thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31451crs19 work is expected to take longer in the immediate future the contingency clause approach should be pursued expediti ously according to the g7 statement two other provisions of the g7 action plan are also significant in crisis prevention the g7 countries will work with the imf to improve the quality transparency and predictability of official decisionmaking regarding future imf loans the g7 countries want to limit nding to normal access levels usually 100 percent of each member state s quota except in emergencies implications for congress if the imf andor treasury proposal were effectively implemented it might reduce the need for crisis lending by the imf and g7 countries which has been substantial at times for example the ited states contributed 12 billion to the rescue package for mexico in 1995 and c ontributed contingent financing of 3 billion to i ndonesia and south korea in 1997 and 5 billion to brazil in 1999 mexico repaid the loans usually ahead of schedule and none of the contingent funds was drawn on increases in imf quotas whic h require vote by the us congress might also be less likely under the imf proposal it is likely th imfs articles of agreement would need to be amended as mentioned earlier the united states with more than 17 percent of the voting power in the imf w ould need to approve the amendment to approve an amendment the congress w ould have to amend the bretton woods agreement act of 1944 which would require approval by majority of both houses of congress in contrast to treaty which requires twothirds vote of the senate the entire process of amending the im f articles of agreem ent could be quite lengthy contentious and politically difficu lt both among countries and within the united states it appears that us legislative acti on may be necessary fo r sovereign debtors to issue bonds in the united states th at include collective action clauses conclusion neither the imf nor the treasury plan pr ovides quick or easy solution to the management of intern ational financial cris primarily because of the difficulties in getting agreement among and within count ries over the most appropriate plan working out the details of the plan and beginning to implement it still the proposals do offer guidelines for dealing with crises that in combination with measures such as strengthening the econo mies of the emerging market countries might prove beneficial perhaps the ma in contribution of these proposals is to stimulate debate and discussion on an important issue in some ways the two proposals are more similar than different both address the collective action problem and involve th private sector in debt reso lution inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31451crs20 32 see miller marcus sovereign debt restruct uring new articles new contracts or change international economics policy briefs institute for international economics april 2002 12 pp website http www iieorgfact it could be argued that th two proposals are complementary32 anne krueger suggests that bankruptcy procedure could be used for solvency crises and collective action clauses for liquidity crises the major difference is in the way each would be implemented the imf plan would likely need to amend the articles of agreement to achieve statutory basis for the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism while the treasury plan would need to amend contracts moreover the two plans are not mutually exclusive the current administration and the g7 have yet to endorse either purely sdrm or cacs approach and are urging the imf and the private sector community to pursue research on both proposals as well as looking at twotr ack approach utilizing both strategies the two proposals are part of broad effo rt to reform the architecture of the international financial system there is much agreement on the importance of preventing and managing inte rnational financial crises involving the private sector in debt resolution and avoiding large loans by the imf to debtor countries although there has been considerable progress on crisis prevention major measures to manage crises have been ad opted to date each of the two proposals discussed in this report aim to do that if successfully implemented either one of them would involve the private sector in debt restructuring nd would likely reduce the need for imf loans to emerging market borrowers
