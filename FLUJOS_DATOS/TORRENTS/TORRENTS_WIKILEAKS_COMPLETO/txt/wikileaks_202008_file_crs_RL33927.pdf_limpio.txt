aspects of program administration requirements for and determination of individual eligibility eligibility of health care providers types of benefits provided whether certain diseases are presumed to be eligible for compensation and the means by which the program is financed though federal compensation programs display considerable diversity in these attributes most can be classified into one of three categories 1 programs that primarily limit compensation or assistance to specified groups of people with little or limitation of the types of injury that may be compensated 2 programs that primarily limit compensation or assistance for specified types of injuries with little or limitation of the classes of individuals who may be compensated and 3 hybrid programs which limit both the classes of eligible individuals and the compensable injuries or diseases this report describes number of federal programs that congress established to compensate or assist individuals who have

people who suffer physical or psychological injury disease or death due to the actions of others may gain compensation through civil actions in the courts in addition congress has established number of programs to compensate or assist victims of certain specific circumstances including negligence terrorism and acts of god the programs fall broadly into three categories 1 those that primarily limit compensation or assistance to specified groups of people with little or limitation on the types of injury that may be compensated eg workers compensation systems 2 those that primarily limit compensation or assistance for specified types of injuries with little or limitation of the classes of individuals who may be compensated eg the vaccine injury compensation program and 3 hybrid programs which limit both the classes of eligible individuals and the compensable injuries or diseases eg the black lung program these compensation programs display considerable diversity in program design and implementation in the context of considerin g compensation for asbestos exposure the government accountability office gao reviewed four federal programs designed to compensate individuals injured by exposure to harmful substances gao found that design of the programs the agencies that administer them their financing mechanisms benefits paid and eligibility criteria including their standards of proof the evidence claimants must provide to support their claims differed significantly 1 to assure responsible stewardship of available funds variety of approaches are used to determine whether conditions stated in claims are actually related to the relevant employment or incident and should therefore be compensated this matter is more easily resolved in the case of acute injuries such as broken leg sustained from fall than it is for illnesses that emerge some time following an exposure often termed latent period some programs such as those for workers compensation evaluate claims administratively on casebycase basis offering claimants the opportunity to appeal denied claims other programs particularly those dealing with ionizing radiation or other hazardous exposures that may cause number of different health conditions develop lists often called tables of compensable conditions it is presumed that when an eligible individual develops listed condition the condition is related to the exposure and compensation is provided this is called disease presumption vaccine injury compensation programs incorporate both an injury table and time window following vaccination listed conditions that arise within the time window are presumed to be causally related to vaccination and are compensated time limitations may not be applicable in many other circumstances either because exposures did not occur at discrete or known times or because some conditions eg some cancers may arise decades after exposure but still be causally related to an exposure when program does not stipulate time limitations there is nonetheless often the requirement that claimant provide evidence that the onset of the condition did not precede the relevant exposure or incident 1 government

causality for health conditions vary among programs disease presumptions help sh ift the burden of proof from the claimant to the program administrator in what is an intrinsically adversarial system disease presumptions ideally flow from scientific evidence showing causal relationship between an exposure and subsequent disease but there is bright line in medical science beyond which causal relationship has been demonstrated and presumption should be provided further it is not generally possible to know for specific individual whether condition is causally related to the exposure of interest or arose for some other reason rather when evidence suggests that exposed populations face an increased risk of developing certain conditions the presumption of causality may be extended to all individuals in that population in accordance with the compassionate intent that underpins many of these programs this report describes number of federal programs that congress established to compensate or assist individuals who have suffered physical or psychological harm as consequence of specific events including the actions of others or who have suffered specific types of physical or

individuals or their health care providers for the costs of eligible health care services of these programs some will reimburse any licensed health care provider unless that provider has been excluded for cause from participation others restrict up front the types of providers that may be reimbursed in an effort to improve the quality of services provided among other factors restricting provider eligibility can improve the quality of care by ensuring that providers have experience in treating rare conditions for example congress required in the black lung pr ogram the establishment of network of black lung clinics to provide specialized care in areas where miners typically live this program is discussed further in subsequent section of this report some state workers compensation programs also establish specialized provider networks staffed by occupational medicine physicians and other specialists recent study found that use of specialized provider network by the louisiana workers compensation system reduced lost work time and was less costly compared with traditional case management 2 provider restrictions may also improve program accountability when eligible providers are trained for the purposes of the program to accurately identify eligible disease conditions and exclude other conditions from coverage specialized provider networks can serve as centers for clinical research and sources of outreach and training to general practitioners who may see these conditions very rarely requiring the exclusive use of selected or innetwork providers could limit access to care though if providers are not geographically wellplaced with respect to the individuals they serve g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g156g561 this section describes the benefits typically ca sh that eligible individuals may receive these include one or more of the following 1 benefit for death or disability 2 replacement of lost income and 3 payment or reimbursement of health care costs compensation may be provided as onetime or lumpsum payments as payment or reimbursement for needs as they accrue or combination of mechanisms for most of the programs described in this report compensation for health care costs if provided is limited to those health conditions that are related to the employment or incident being addressed these programs do not therefore constitute general health insurance in some cases the program serves as secondary payor and any comparable benefits paid by third parties are deducted from the program benefit the program may also be considered as third party payor by other benefits programs which may reduce their payments accordingly unless the primary programs benefits are protected from recoupment by statute benefits also vary in terms of whether they are considered as taxable income and whether they are considered in determining eligibility for public benefit programs such as medicaid and food stamps 2 edward j bernacki et preliminary

and the approach or approaches used to develop the list lists may be developed through variety of mechanisms lists ma be provided in statute eg some radiation exposure programs they may be developed through rulemaking eg the vaccine injury compensation programs scientific advisory groups may be tasked with identifying diseases for possible inclusion in presumptive list eg veterans compensation following exposure to agent orange disease presumptions may be rebuttable for ex ample many state workers compensation laws provide rebuttable presumptions that lung cancer in firefighters who dont smoke be considered occupationally related program administrators could rebut the presumptionsaying that other behaviors on an individuals part or other factors were more likely to have caused the cancerand deny the claim g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g151g144g561 the section describes the mechanisms by which the program is financed examples include annual appropriations special appropriations and payroll and excise taxes in its evaluation of four federal compensation programs 3 gao found that the federal role in all four programs has expanded significantly over time all four have expanded to provide eligibility to additional categories of claimants cover more medical conditions or provide additional benefits as might be expected as the federal role for these four programs has grown so have their costs beyond the costs associated with expanded eligibility increasing medical costs and new research on exposure levels and medical conditions associated with that exposure that could lead to expanded eligibility may further increase program costs the difficulty in estimating the actual cost of these programs may be due to the inherent difficulty of estimating the number of claimants and anticipating expansions of the programs however because these programs may expand significantly beyond the initial cost estimates policymakers must carefully consider the cost and precedentsetting

workers radiation exposure niosh provides this information to dol and advises dol regarding statistical determination of whether workers cancer is at least as likely as not to be workrelated though

diseases awards range from 12500 for certain benign tumors and noncancerous conditions to 125000 for certain types of malignant cancer for biological children of mother who was physically present at the time of the testing the nct provides 50 of amounts offered to firstgeneration claimants g6g146g156g142g138g156g142g561g18g155g142g156g158g150g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 initially the tribunal adopted list of 25 compensable diseases including the cancers listed under reca and other conditions for which ther was credible evidence showing significant statistical relationship between exposure to ionizing radiation and the subsequent development of the disease in determining which diseases to include on the list the tribunal referred to the findings of the radiation effects research foundation in japan and the us national academy of sciences and sought recommendations from dr robert miller an expert in the field of radiation health effects the tribunal reviewed the list of compensable diseases each year and considered any new scientific evidence on diseases linked to exposure to ionizing radiation as result of that review process the list has b een amended on several occasions since 1991 and now includes total of 36 medical conditions 69 g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g151g144g561 the 150 million nuclear claims fund was intended to generate perpetual source of income for personal injury and property damages claims as well as health care medical surveillance and radiological monitoring trust funds for the four atolls and quarterly distributions to the peoples of the four atolls for hardships suffered however the fund was nearly depleted by the end of 2006 the nuclear claims tribunals personal injury awards alone have far exceeded the 4575 million allocated by the compact to the tribunal for both personal injury and property damages compensation as of december 2006 the nct had awarded 914 million for compensable injuries to approximately 2000 individuals of

veterans affairs v pays monthly cash benefits to veterans who are physically or mentally disabled by injury or disease as result of military service these disabilities need not have occurred in the line of duty or even be related to active duty for condition to be regarded as serviceconnectedand therefore eligible for compensation veterans need show only that the condition occurred or was aggravated as result of military service or arose during that period the severity of veterans disability is evaluated by the v which assigns disability rating in increments of 10 from 0 to 100 in order to receive disability compensation veterans must be rated at least 10 disabled the rate of compensation depends on the degree of disability and follows payment schedule that is adjusted annually and applies to all veterans 75 to receive compensation for serviceconnected disability veterans are required to document that their condition is related to their service the claim is often clearly documented by pertinent military records however with some medical conditions evidence of serviceconnection is inconclusive since 1988 congress has on three occasions granted presumption of service connection for specific group of veterans making these individuals potentially eligible for disability compensation in the absence of conclusive evidence linking their medical conditions to military service 73 the ricky ray fund initially r eceived 75 million in the fy2000 laborhhseducation appropriations bill pl 106113 the fy2001 omnibus consolidated appropriations bill pl 106554 included 105

98542 to establish program to provide disability compensation to the socalled atomic veterans ie radiationexposed veterans who participated in the us atmospheric atomic tests or in the us occupation of hiroshima and nagasaki japan the law instructed the v to write regulations setting out the criteria for adjudicating claims under the program the v awards compensation if it determines that veterans disability is at least as likely as not the result of exposure to radiation while in service 77 although pl 98542 only mentioned the atomic test participants and the occupation forces in japan the regulations cover all veterans who were exposed to radiation from any source while on active duty each claim must be accompanied by an estimate of the radiation dose received by the claimant dose estimates are provided by the defense threat reduction agency dtra using variety of sources of data including radiation badges worn by service personnel because many individuals were not issued badges and historical records are incomplete inaccurate or missing dtra often has to perform dose reconstruction veteran may also submit an alternative dose estimate from credible source v officials determine whether it is at least as likely as not that the veterans disease is the result of serviceconnected radiation exposure using set of radioepidemiologic tables developed by the national cancer institute these tables allow an investigator to look up the probability that the development of particular cancer at age t was caused by radiation dose d at age t in order to satisfy the v s criterion ie at least as likely as not the probability of causation poc must be at least 50 current v regulations state that all cancers and four nonmalignant conditions eg thyroid nodules are potentially radiogenic the agency will also consider evidence that diseases other th an those listed in the regulations may be caused by radiation exposure

difficulty of getting compensation under pl 98542 congress in 1988 enacted the radiationexposed veterans compensation act pl 100 321 which established presumption of service connection for 13 specified types of cancer unlike the earlier law pl 100321 does not require an estimation of radiation dose if veteran participated in one of three specified radiationrisk activities78 and has one of the listed cancers 76 as defined in 38 usc 10133 the term persian gulf war means the period beginning on august 2 1990 and ending on the date thereafter prescribed by presidential proclamation or by

hiroshima or nagasaki and internment as pow in ja pan during world war ii resulting in an opportunity for exposure the va subseq uently expanded the definition of radiationrisk activities to include service at amchitka island ak prior to january 1 1974 if veteran was exposed while performing duties related to certain underground nuclear tests and service at gaseous diffusion plants located in
