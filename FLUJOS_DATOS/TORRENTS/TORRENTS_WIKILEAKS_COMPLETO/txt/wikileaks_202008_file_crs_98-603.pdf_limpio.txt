19891998 summary since 1989 the us policy debate ove r chinas mostfavorednation mfn status has undergone several transformations the issue was essentially irrelevant in the 1980s when annual extension of mf n to china was nearly automatic in 1989 the year of the tiananmen square crackdown resolution was even introduced that would have disapproved or put further conditions on chinas mfn eligibility but by 1990 congress and th bush administration were clashing repeatedly over the direction and c onduct of posttiananmen china policy administration officials often blamed congress for being obstructionist and partisan on china issues members of congress often criticized the president for ignoring congressional initia tives and being too accommodating toward beijing much of this debate was carried out thr ough the annual process of renewing chinas mfn status in this debate the house has frequently been the more active body the mfn debate reached zenith in the 102nd congress the house passed joint resolutions disapproving mfn for china in both 1991 and 1992 the senate has never passed joint reso lution of disapproval the real focus of the debate however was not whether to deny mfn status for china altogether but instead whether to place new human rights conditi ons on chinas mfn eligibility congress passed legislation in 1991 and again in 1992 that would have placed further conditions on chinas mfn status in both years president bush vetoed the legislation and while the house voted in both cases to override the senate did not have the votes to do so in 1993 newly elected president clinton announced he would link chinas mfn status to human rights progress beginning in 1994 although ultimately the president reversed himself the 1993 decision appears to have been pivotal catalyst in the declining importance of mfn status as tool with which to influence china policy neither the house nor the senate has passed mfnrelate d legislation during the clinton administration instead members ve turned to legislative alternatives most of which have included more specifi c more targeted sanctions on chinas activities although extension of chinas mf n status appears to be largely settled issue for now the annual rene wal process with its statutory deadlines for action is likely to continue to trigger consideration of chinarelated issues that do not deal with mfn note on july 22 1998 legislation was enacted which replaced the term mostfavorednation in certain us statutes with the term normal trade relations pl 105206 nevertheless since nearly all of the background information and congressional actions discu ssed in this report deal with material that predates this change this report will c ontinue to refer to this trade status as mostfavorednation or mfn status throughout httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98603contents chinas eligibility for mfn status 1 k f in d in g s 2t h b u sh d min istr tio n4 101st congress 19891990 4 1989 routine

extension act of 1951 pl 8250 which required the president to suspend mfn status of the soviet union and all countries of the then sinosoviet bloc the jacksonvanik amendment on emigration targeted the soviet union which at the time greatly restricted or even prohibited its citizens from emigrating although the jackson vanik amendment waiver renewal process has figured in chinas mfn status the annual debate has rarely focused on chinas emigrati on policies instead other issues involving human rights trade and national security have come to be cited as valid reasons for action by congress to disapprove the jacksonvanik amendment waiver extension for china chinas mostfavoredn ation mfn status congressional consideration 19891998 since the tiananmen square crac kdown of 1989 the nnual pro cess of renewing chinas mostfavorednation mfn status has been sharply controversial in us policy circles this report briefly reviews the us policy debate on chinas mfn status over the past ten years and di scusses the actions nd attention given to the issue by the 101st to the 105th congresses chinas eligibility for mfn status chinas eligibility for mfn status is subject to freedomofemigration conditions imposed by the jacksonvanik amendment sec 402 to the trade act of 1974 this permits us authorities to grant mfn status to nonmarket economycountry providing that that country does not restrict emigration1 under us law the president may either determin that china is in full compliance with the jacksonvanik amendment or else he ma waive the requirement of full compliance us presidents have done the latter for the peoples republic of china prc every year since 1980 when mfn status was firs t granted the presidents authority to waive restrictions expires every year on july 3 and he must recommend to congress an extension of this waiver authority not less than thirty days prior to its expiration date or later than june 3 congress has sixty days from the july 3 expiration date to disapprove the presidents recommendation by joint resolution under special fasttrack procedures or the waiver aut hority is renewed automatically for another year congress need not cite specific reas ons for its disapproval in addition to the joint resolution process congress may also amend current law at any time to impose new conditions or restrictions on chinas mfn eligibility or to modify or eliminate restrictions altogether such actions w ould be independent of joint resolution involving the extension of the presidents waiver authority and would not be subject to any of the jacksonvanik amendment d eadlines the 1998 change of terminology from mfn to normal trade relations does not affect either how this trade status is determined or the annual waiver recomme ndation process httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98603crs2 key findings congresss willingness to consider w ithdrawing or putting further conditions on chinas mfn status appears to ve declined dramatically since 1992 when both house and senate passed conditionality legislation which was ultimately vetoed by pr esident bush beginning in 1993 legislation to disapprove or to place further conditi ons on chinas mfn status has passed either house longstanding congressional divisions over china policy appear to have deepened in recent years crossing party and ideological lines mfn opponents include some conservative republicans rightwing religious organizations human rights organiza tions liberal democrats and labor interests proponents in clude party centrists probusiness republicans conservative democrats and freetraders in addition to disagreements over substance there appear to be disagreements over strategy and tactics with some senior congressiona l leaders committed to revoking mfn status and others playing key roles in steering floor actions away from the mfn issue and toward other alternatives the clinton administration after in itially linking chinas mfn eligibility with human rights progress in 1993 abandoned that policy in 1994 since then the clinton administration has fielded policy of constructive engagement and appears to have become more firmly committed to that approach in recent years since 1993 the issue of extending chinas mfn status has never regained the prominence it had in the later years of the bush administration attention instead has shifted to other legislative vehicles designed either to affect developments in china or to influence us policy the question of extending chinas mfn status became controversial the year following the tiananmen square cr ackdown of 1989 legislation to disapprove or place further conditions on chinas mfn status was even introduced in 1989 beginning in 1990 the determination of president bush to maintain presidential control over china policy and congress objection to the nature of those policy decisi ons combined to make the annual mfn renewal process the main focus of the us debate over china congress came closer in 1992 to withdrawing or placi ng further conditions on chinas mfn status than in any prior or subsequent year httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98603 crs3 congressional consideration of

beginning in 1997 chinarelated legislation was considered independently of the disapproval resolution the bush administration the collapse of the soviet union and with it chinas strategic importance as counterweight to soviet power may well have resulted in an eventual reassessment of us china policy in th 1990s regardless of other developments but it was chinas june 4 1989 tiananmen square crackdown that brought about an abrupt end to decade of fairly smooth uschina relations and modified optimistic us projections for chinas future tiananmen suggested that the nascent political liberalization that had accompanied chin as program of economic reform had abruptly ended along with it went the congressional support for administration initiatives on china that had characterized the us policy process through the 1980s between 1989 and 1992 the us policy process on china was characterized more by confrontation than consensus congress and the bush administration clashed repeatedly over the direction and conduct of china polic administration officials often blamed congress for bein g obstructionist and partisan on china issues members of congress often criticized the president for ignoring congressional initiatives and being too accommodating toward beijing in effect there was stalemate in uschina relations with beijing generally unwilling to make policy concessions to the united states president bush unable to resume pre tiananmen normal relations with china and congress increasingly frustrated by its lack of significant success in pressuring either china or the bush administration to change its policy approach for the most part much of the us debate over china during this period was carried out through the annual process of renewing chinas mfn status 101st congress 19891990 the tenure of the 101st congress saw the development of sharp divisions over china policy both between the congress and the white house and among members of congress divisions which were to characterize the us policy process on china for much of the next halfdozen years and the effects of which are still felt today 1989 routine renewal despite tiananmen square the annual renewal of chinas mfn status had been relativ ely noncontroversial since mfn or what is now referred to as normal trade relations status was first granted to china inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98603crs5 1prior to 1983 congress had disapproved congress had relied on socalled legislative veto to disapprove the annual extension of mfn to china and other presidential actions under this procedure one house or even one committe chair could effectively block presidential plan but in 1983 in the case of ins v ch adha 462 us 919 the supreme court ruled the legislative veto unconstitutional effectivel invalidating it as congressional tool the obstacle posed by the chadha d ecision could be part of the reason for the relative lack of congressional activity on the question of chinas mfn during the 1983 1990 time period in 1990 congress adopted provision in sec 132 of hr 1594 the customs and trade act of 1990 that resolved the chadha problem by amending the trade act of 1974 to provide for joint resolution of disapproval for pr esidential recommendations on mfn status the bill became public law 101382 on august 20 1990 2on june 5 1989 president bush

prohibitions on sales of military equipment and weapons to china export of us satellites overseas privat investment corporation opic and trade development agency tda programs export licenses for crime control and detection equipment and liberalization of xport controls on technology alt hough the law also banned nuclear trade and cooperation presid ent clinton announced after the october 1997 uschina summit that such cooperation could begin in 1998 19801 the mfn renewal process in 1989 was exception to this tradition in spite of the tiananmen square crackdown of j une 4 1989 which came just 3 days after president bushs mfn extension recomme ndation for that year the 101st congress did not debate chinas mfn status joint resolution was even introduced in the congress in 1989 to disapprove the presid ents recommendation for an extension of his mfn waiver authority for china instead the us response to tiananmen square that year consiste d of two sets of nonmfnre lated sanctions announced by president bush on june 5 and june 20 19892 and series of bills that congress considered which were designed to codify the presidents actions and expand their scope3 throughout 1989 president bush generally opposed these congressional efforts to broaden the tiananmen sanctions he had announced the subsequent policy differences over china that developed between the president and the congress through the rest of that year were fueled in part by the presidents objections to congressional involvement and by his efforts to main tain constructive engagement with the chinese leadership but interbranch tensions were also exacerbated by two specific circumstances the first was the visits to china in early july and onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98603crs6 4senator mitch mcconnell quoted in the congressional quarterly december 16 1989 p 3435 5in addition to vetoeing the emergency chinese immigration relief act of 1989 president bush vetoed the first version of the foreig n

that legislation was necessary cited in the congressional quarterly december 16 1989 p 3435 7in 1990 congress amended the trade act of 1974 with new procedures for disapproving presidential actions replacing those deemed unconstitutional in 1983 by the supreme court in ins v chadha thus 1990 was the first year that joint resolutions of disapproval were sanctioned as the method for congress to disapprove presidential recommendations on continueddecember 9 1989 by national security advisor brent scowcroft and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger in violation of the presidents own announced ban on highlevel visits to ch ina the fact that scowcroft and eagleburger went to china in july 1989 was kept secret from congress and the public until decembe r 18 1989 the second visit on december 9 1989 was announced as both men were enroute to china the visits sparked congressional ange r many members questioned the presidents judgment terming the visits as unwise or as the wrong message at the wrong time4 in addition congress became increasingly frustrated with the presidents veto or waiver of many of its legislative initiatives to toughen the us stance toward beijing in late 1989 and early 1990 for example the president vetoed or waived four key congressional initiatives on china5 members were particularly upset when the president vetoed the emergency chinese immigration relief act of 1989 hr 2712 rep pelosi only to take similar measures shortly afterward by executive order 12711 to many in congress the message was clear in his efforts to retain control over policy decisions the president appeared willing to prevent congressional initiatives to which he had substantive objections6 1990 beginning use of mfn as policy tool by 1990 many in congress had become increasingly frustrated with the direction of us china policy and with president bushs dominance of policy deci sions with its firstsession initiatives having been vetoed or overturned by th white house congress in 1990 turned to the presidents annual mfn renewal r ecommendation for china uncontroversial in the past as vehicle for regist ering congressional di sapproval of chinas repressive policies and as way of putting pressure on the bush administration to adopt tougher approach toward beijing thus while resolutions concerning mfn status had been introduced the previous year six resolutions of disapproval were introduced in 1990 with an additional three joint resolutions rela ting in some other way to eliminating chinas mfn status7 but there was little senate sentiment

disapproval of mfn status particularly in vi ew of the persian gulf war which was occupying most of the us attention that year in addition the willingness of chinese leaders not to stand in the way of

1990 by vote of 2471748 instead most of the debate during the year involved separa legislation that would have placed new conditions on chin as future eligibility for mfn status beyond those already imposed by the jacks onvanik amendment such legislation became known informally as conditiona lity legislation in 1990 the house concentrated on proposing broad sweeping but fairly general human rights and international security langua ge that should be applied to china before it could qualify for mfn status rep donald pease introduced the bill that became the main legislative vehicle for conditionality hr 4939 9 as introduced the bill would have added to the existing jacksonva nik amendment emigration conditions new conditions involving substan tial progress on gross human rights violations ending martial law throughout china including bet and ending assistance to the khmer rouge in cambodia as amended and re ported out by the house ways and means committee the bill deleted the language on assistance to the khmer rouge and limited itself more directly to general human rights conditions directing that the president must take them into account in order to extend mfn status to china beginning in 1991 as amended and pa ssed by the house hr 4939 included requirements that china release political prisoners improve political freedoms and end religious persecution also included in hr 4939 was senseo fcongress language that the president should link chinas observer status in th general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt to chinas mfn status eligibility10 all of the conditions put forward would have applied to chinas mfn stat us beginning the following year in 1991 the house debated the bill thoroughly in 1990 passing it by wide margin 38430 but president bushs repeated assertions that he would veto any legislation denying or placing further conditions on chinas mfn status made c ongressional action on conditionality appear more symbolic than substantive this was particularly true since the senate was regarded as insuffi ciently opposed to mfn to achieve two thirds vote to override certain presidentia l veto in any event congress adjournedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98603crs8 on october 28 1990 before the senate took acti on on the bill thus the 101st congress did not enact any mfn stat us restrictions for china

best side sticki ng patiently to our values even if we risk rejection11 administration officials defended the flexibility and selectiveness of the presidents actions on china congressional actions on mfn status were blunt instrument that would only hurt us interests according to administration officials secretary of state james baker made one of th administrations key arguments for unconditional extension of mfn status to deny mfn to china will destroy our dialogue with the chinese on these issues and dismantle our leverage conditioned renewal would be tantamount to withdrawal holding our

argued that the policy of engagement had failed and it was time for tougher approach16 in unexpected alliance both liberal democrats and conservative republicans introduced joint resolutions to disapprove the presidents recommendation to extend mfn status to china17 other members while s upporting the presidents position nevertheless advocated compromise believing that congressional sentiment was running against the white house in additi on to the greater rancor of the mfn status debate relevant legislation came closer to being enacted than in the previous congress whereas only the house had pa ssed conditionality legi slation in the 101st congress and then only during the sec ond session the house and senate each passed such legislation in the 102nd congress and in both sessions in each case president bush vetoed the legislation w ith only the house later voting to override 1991 the rise of conditionality the mfn debate in 1991 ultimately focused on the prospect of attaching new conditions to chinas future eligibility for mfn status rather than the prospects fo r denying mfn status altogether in addition issues being proposed in mfn conditionality legisla tion were sometimes introduced as separate freestanding bills or as amendments to other bills the china mfn status issue found its wa into the fy1992 foreig n operations appropriations bill linked to

language considered in the 101st congress and began not only to address more specific allegations of chinas human rights violations such as prison labor exports but to broaden the bills legislative focus to other issues such as missile proliferation and unfair trade practices on may 2 1991 well in advance of the presidents may 29 mfn status renewal recommendation representative nancy pelosi introduced legislation in the house hr 2212 that ultimately attracted 150 cosponsors and becam the vehicle for legislative action on mfn conditionality by june 1991 the pelosi bill had been modified sufficiently to secure the support of other key member s notably representatives solarz and pease who also opposed the administr ations recommendation for extension of mfn status without new conditions but who had been uncomfortable with the requirements of hr 2212 that china make specific improvements before it could receive mfn status again19 the modified pelosi bill applied new c onditions to chinas eligibility for mfn status the following year in 1992 these included the requirement of unequivocal chinese assuran ces on nuclear nonprolifera tion and missile sales as well as conditions relating to allegations of coercive abortions and forced sterilizations in china the bill also required china to make significant overall progress on series of human rights go als by 1992 including those involving tibet hong kongs reversion to china tortur and inhumane prison conditions and press freedom among others the bill also urged the president to take firm action on chinas trade violations and unfair trading practices finally the bill declared that before china could qualify for mfn status in 1992 beijing would have to provide an accounting for people who were arrested for nonviolent expression of their political beliefs during the tiananmen squa re crackdown and release those who had been imprisoned the house ways and means committee took up the bill on june 26 1991 and adopted series of amendments that si gnificantly toughened the bill including language demanding that china drop its opposition to taiwans becoming gatt signatory requirements that china nd any

saying that he was prepare d to address the concerns you and your colleagues have identified26 the somewhat tougher administration approach appeared to be too little and too late to blunt continued congressional initiatives but it underscored how congress could influen ce white house foreign policy decisions even absent the passage of vetoproof legislation 1992 challenging the president congressional acti ons on and influence over us decisions on china policy were more pronounced in 1992 than in any previous year for number of reasons first the presidents earlier dominance over us china policy had alienated many in congress by appearing to prevent the legislative branch from serving as respected partner in the policy process his decision to remain engaged with leaders in beijing had sparked widespread criticism that his policies were out of step with changing circumstances in china and in the communist world and the credibility of his policy was eroded by the failure to obtain important concessions from beijing finally as the us presidential election campaign progressed throughout the year president bush appeared increasingly vulnerable in his reelection bid while the administrations overall foreign policy ratings were high those ratings did not app ear critical to the election and in any case did not extend to us policy decisions on china these factors combined to help weaken the administrations ability to conduct coordinate d policy on china in 1992 and thus permitted growing array of diverse congre ssional initiatives to become more dominant and influen tial in shaping the 1992 debate congress acted on three separate mfnre lated bills in 1992 hr 2212s 1367 unfinished at the end of the first session in 1991 hjres 502 and hr 5318s2808 of the three measures only hjres 502 which was passed by the house but died in the senate finance committee would have disapproved the presidents recommendation to extend mfn st atus to china for 1992 the

remained unfinished business at the midterm recess with the house having passed the conference report in november 1991 the senate took it up on february 25 1992 floor debate reflected the range of views that had come to characterize the mfn status issue in congress over the past year because of the timetable im posed by the jacksonvanik provision congressional action ostensibly centered around whether to continue mfn status for china with new conditions position held by the administration or terminate it altogether view espoused by some in congress in effect however the debate again mainly centered on whether to place further conditions on chinas mfn status eligibility other than those freedomofemigration restrictions that were already in place in arguing for the imposition of new cond itions senate majority leader george mitchell summed up congressional frustration with the presidents policies since 1989 stating i believe the administrations policy has not succeeded it has failed it is time for stronger policy27 other senators supporting the bill argued that it was necessary given chinas miserable human rights record recurring reports that china was making destabilizing arms sales despite assurances to the contrary and chinas burgeoning trade surp lus with the united states as result of its unfair trade practices28 on the other side senator max baucus leader of the group of bipartisan senators negotiating with the white house referred to that dialogue as providing the foundations of new consensus over china policy and said that the administrations recent initiatives

some trade barriers signing memorandumofunderstanding mou on inte llectual property rights and agreeing not to transfer the m9 or m11 missiles to countries in the middle east after brief debate the house pa ssed the resolution on july 21 1992 by vote of 258135 during floor debate house supporters of the resolution cited the implications of chinas unfair trade practices for american jobs the unfavorable comparison of chinas policies with democratization programs in eastern europe and chinas repressive human rights policies the senate did not cons ider the resolution immediately after considering the resolu tion to cut off mfn status and under the same house rule the house took up th second conditionality bill that congress would consider during the year hr 5318 the uschina relations act31 although the bill was substantially similar to hr 2212 which had been considered only four months before it differed in some respects reflecting the efforts of members to refine and change the bill in ways that would deflect the arguments of its critics and gain the bill some add itional support hr 5318 prohibited the president from extending mfn status to china in mid1993 unless he certified that the chinese government either had met or had made significant progress toward meeting the following conditions accounting for and releasing citizens imprisoned for the nonviolent expression of their political beliefs during and after the tiananmen square crackdown ending re ligious persecution in china and tibet removing restrictions on freedom of the press and on voice of america broadcasts terminating harassment of chinese overseas ensuring freedom from torture ensuring access of international human rights monito ring groups to prisoners trials and places of detention and terminating restrictions on peaceful assembly in china and tibet in addition to these measures nearly all of which had been contained in previous conditionality legislation the bill as intr oduced contained new provision section 5 which provided that even if mfn status were denied to china in the future it would continue to be extended to an good that is produced manufactured marketed or otherwise exported by bus iness corporation partnership qualified foreign joint venture or other person that is not stateowned enterprise of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98603crs17 32 the house ways and

3a2peoples republic of china32 the bill would have required the us secretary of the treasury to determine and maintain lis t of stateowned enterprises that would be hit with tariffs if china did not meet the conditions specified in the legislation with this provision the bills sponsors hoped to undercut one of the criticisms which the administration and others had leveled at hr 2212 c onsidered just three months earlier that is that denial of mfn status would devastate the private entrepreneurs and export indus tries in chinas southern and coastal areas that were among the most democraticminded and west ernoriented ventures in china in targeting only stateowned companies for mfnrelated sanctions hr 5318 purported to leave nonstateowned ventures ligible to retain mfn status for their exported goods this new approach also d its critics primarily those who believed that targeting mfn sanctions to produc ts from specific enterprises would be unenforceable and unworkable supporters of the 1992 bill appeared more confident of eventual enactment hr 5318 was considered quickly by th house the ways and means committee reported it out by voice vote on july 2 with amendments33 the committeeamended version added human rights objective re quiring that china cooperate with the united states in efforts to account for u s military personnel lis ted as prisoners of war or missing in action mia in the korean or vietnam wars the committee also slightly amended the eligibility criteria in section 5 having to do with provisions for stateowned corporations the committee reports dissenting views signed by seven members stressed the themes of ear lier congressional opposition including the counterproductivity of isola ting china the economic damage withdrawing mfn status could do to chinas coastal regions and to us investors in china and the importance of keeping china engaged with the world rather than isolated under the rule h res 514 the house cons idered the ways and means committee amendments bloc in floor debate the bills supporters made number of major points some based on the objections raised to earlier legisl ation conditioning mfn status and many echoing the arguments made during the ways and means committees consideration of the bill supporters argued that the legislation was not meant to withdraw mfn status from china but to increase pressure on the chinese government to rethink and change some of its policies some members drew unflattering parallels between chinas political system and the peaceful mocratic changes that had come to most of eastern europe they strongly objected to the administrations assertion that us policy since tiananmen square had resulted in significant human rights improvements and other changes in china poi nting out that arrests detentions and torture in china still continued in any case they said the bill required china to make only overall significant prog ress on human rights

the united states could not afford to alienate the regime in beijing because of chinas key position as pe rmanent member of the security council one member cited chinas str ong support for the us position in the united nations concerning the breakup of yu goslavia as an indication of chinas larger strategic importance for us polic interests opponents of the bill also pointed to the administrations tougher initiatives toward china over the preceding months characterizing them as surgical instruments to influence beijing as opposed to the blunt tool of mfn suspension some doubted that the bills stateowned enterprise provision was enforceable saying that it would be impossible to identify products from china produced by state enterpri ses many stated that their objection to legislation conditioning mfn status for china was not over the goal of the legislation but over the proposed method of achieving that goal some suggested that the bills supporters might be more in terested in protecting us industry from chinese imports than in fostering political liberalization in china after debating the measure the house passed the bill on july 21 1992 barely three weeks after the completion of committee consideration by vote of 33962 the full senate also acted quickly on the mfn conditionality bill in 1992 taking it up in september less than two months after the house passed its version and barely three months after the presid ents june recommenda tion on september 14 1992 the full senate adopted the fi nance committee amendment to hr 5318 which replaced the language of the house bill with that of s 280835 the final senatepassed versi on was substantially similar to the housepassed version the major differences being that the senate vers ion contained longer findings section and included provisions that china adhere to the universal declaration of human rights and fulfill pledges made to secretary of state james baker that it would allow dissidents to emigrate although final senate passage of the mfn conditionality b ill was generally foregone conclusion the fact that the bill passed by unanimous consent was surprise in the previous congress it wa s the margin of the senate vote that was suspenseful since the bill would need an affirmative vote of twothirds in order to ensure override of certain presidential ve to the senates unanimous consent vote meant that president bush would receive the bill without knowing whether his veto would be sustained as it had been in the nate for the past two years or overridden which would be

such as nonproliferation and security concerns had factored in to past congressional actions on chinas mfn status in essence the 1993 clinton decision linked chinas mfn status exclusively with human rights issues in addition to the emigration rights issues already imposed by jacksonvanik other unrelated issues said the president would be pursued on separate tracks under the executive order the secretary of state could not recommend to the president an extension of chinas mfn treatment in 1994 unless he determined 1 that china had abided by its 1992 agreement with the united states to halt exports of prison labor products to the united st ates and 2 that an extension would substantially promote the freeofemigration objectives in the jacksonvanik amendment to the 1 974 trade act in addition to certifying to the above requirements in making his recommendation the secretary would have to determine whether china had made overall significan t progress in human rights including adhering to the universal declaration of human rights releasing and acceptably accoun ting for political prisoners ensuring humane treatment of prisoners protecting tibets religious and cultural heritage and permitting international radio and television broadcasts into china the executive order further stated that the administration would pursue other legislative and executive actions

unless the downward spiral in relations were halted and chinas human rights record were significantly improved according to press reports president clinton signed classified action memorandum in mids eptember 1993 which defined the new policy direction although the white h ouse did not formally announce policy change or articulate its terms the us deputy assistant secretary of state for east asia

interpretation of the presidents 1993 executive order in press conference on may 26 1994 president clinton announced that althoug h the chinese did not achieve overall significant progress in all the areas outlin ed in the 1993 executive order he nevertheless had decided that the united states should renew chinas mfn trading status in spite of that fact49 furthermore the president stated that he was going to delink human rights from chinas mfn status saying that linkage has been constructiv during the past year but i believe based on our ggressive contacts with the chinese in the past several months that we have reached the end of the usefulness of that policy as in 1993 the president seemed mindful of congressional c oncerns about key issues with china rather than simp ly announcing the delinkage and leaving it at that the president also announced that in view of the continuing human rights abuses in china he was extending the sanctions imposed by the united states as result of the events in tiananmen square50 he said he was so banning imports of chinese arms and ammunition encouraging multilateral human rights efforts expanding us international broadcasting programs targeting china and establishing new program of us support for human rights and democracy in china that program was to include increased broadcasts for radio free asia and the voice of america increased support for nongovern mental organizations ngos working on human rights in china and working with american businesses to develop set of voluntary principles for business activity in china over the next few

greater leverage on china searched for mfnrela ted proposals that offered more surgical retaliation than the overall mfn conditionality measures considered in the previous congress members began looking at propos als that targeted mfnrelated sanctions against specific chinese enterprises or indus trial sectors for instance rather than measures that put broadbased conditions on chinas

language to codify the presidents initiative to prohibit imports of chinese arms and ammunition the hamilton substitute was considered first and the house adopted it by vote of 280 152 in the second vote the house re jected the pelosi substitute 158270 amendment thereby endorsing the presid ents position on mfn status for china and effectively ending the mfn debate for th year the senate took

contributed to bilateral political difficulties none had the catalytic impact of president clintons decision of may 22 1995 made as result of heavy congressional pressure to issue visa for taiwans president lee tenghui to attend reunion at cornell university his alma mater57 china objected strongly temporarily calling its ambassador home from the unitedstates and initiating vigorous campaign to discredit president lees policies in taiwan in august 1995 and again in ma rch 1996 china held series of naval exercises and provocative livefire missile tests in the strait off the coast of taiwan

httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98603crs27 in addition to the crisis over taiwan there were other sources of political acrimony in uschina relations dur ing the 19951996 timeframe during the time period for

controvers ial decision on may 10 1996 the united states declared it would not impose sanctions on china because of chinese sales to pakistan of ring magnets which are used in uranium enrichment but greater tensions in uschina relations during these two years did not appear to translate into greater policy tensions in the united states over chinas mfn status congress chose not to interrupt or alter chinas mfn status although the 104th congress continued to search for ways to affect developments in china or gain leverage over the us policy process members appeared to have become disillusioned with the prospects for pu tting further conditions on chinas mfn status congress remained unwilling to withdraw mfn status altogether while the debate on conditionality rancorous in the past became barely noticeable in 1995 in 1996 the us presidential campaign so played role in the debate on chinas mfn status senator bob dole who had resigned from the senate to challenge clinton for the presidency came out in support of clintons decision to renew chinas mfn status the dole decision was blow to conservative republican opponents of clinton administra tion policy toward china and

clear that momentum in the us policy debate on china had shifted substantially away from using mfn as tool and had turned instead to the consideration of other legislative vehicles to influence us and chinese policy decisions only joint resolutions of di sapproval for mfn were considered by the 105th congress and these were only considered in the house they were also rejected by wide margins compared to previous years when alternative mfn bills were introduced in retrospect much about the uschi na relationship at the beginning of 1997 appeared destined to improve its pros pects the mfn

pressure cam from critics who believed that chinese assistance was key factor in pakistans sudden emergence as confirmed nuclear power69 because of these continuing contr oversies the house late in 1997 passed series of chinarelated bills unrelated to mfn status and congressional critics continued to target the clinton administrations policy of engagement with china pressuring the white house to take fi rmer more sanctionso riented approach it was in this atmosphere of controversy that the president made his planned summit visit to china from june 25july 3 1998 the summit got mixed reviews members of congress criticized the president for agreeing to tiananmen square the site of chinas 1989 blooddy military crackdown as the site for the official welcoming ceremony some criticized the summit as lacking in substance others were pleased by the unprecedented live cove rage that chinese television and radio gave to several presidential appearances including joint press conference between clinton and chinese leader jiang zemin where the president was able to speak directly to the chinese people about u s human rights concerns the most controversial moment of the summit came at

it was the first time that an extension of less than one year had been proposed and its proponents thought th at the move would give american policymakers time to assess how china was handling the

chinas mfn status given the trends of the previous few years there was little expectation that congress would pass the joint resoluti on and revoke chinas mfn status apart from the joint resolution of

never again be using that absurd language most favored nationnow we can get down to serious discu ssion about what we are really talking about and that is nor mal trade relations81 in fact most mfn opponents continued to use the term mfn throughout the 1998 house floor debate despite members awareness of the technical name change one opponent referred to the status as mfn or whatever they now want to call this gift to china82 new trends and issues despite the expected outcome of the debate on mfn in the 105th congress there were seve ral new trends and issues that affected th tone of the legislative debate and which demonstrated the continuing shift in focus away from mfn renewal to other legislative tool s these other trends and issues may continue to influence congressional actions and attitudes on china in the future issues involving religious persecution one new development in the 105th congress was the focus on issues involving religious persecution particularly in china but also worldwide this focus hi ghlighted important differences in the american religious community particularly between many mainstream religious groups and conservative relig ious organizations from th far right of the political spectrum many members of religious community groups such as the national council of churches and the national association of ev angelicals were supportive of concerns about religious persecution but worked to moderate pending legislation and in some cases actively opposed pending bills83 these sentiments were not generally shared by strongly conserva tive religious groups in particular conservative organizations such as th christian coalition the family research council and american renewal inc which for the first time began to devote more effort to the china debate certain ly on questions of religious persecution but also on broader range of issues lette r made available during the mfn debate in 1997 signed by key leaders of these orga nizations made clear their differences of opinion with christian missionary groups in china84 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98603crs36 84continued public life the letter referred to the groups deep respect and support for

result of th is involvement the debate over chinas mfn status in 1997 became infused with issues involving mo rality and values in this respect the clinton administration was singled out for particular criticism for its policies representative gephardt stated that the mf n debate was about p rinciple and value and belief85 representative wolf criticized ad ministration policy toward china as policy that had fundamenta lly failed it is not true to american valuesit is amoral and i personally believe it is immoral86 representative rohrabacher described mfn for china as taxpayer subsidy for elite american corporations calling this an abomination87 deepening divisions within congress the atmosphere of the 105th congress house debate on mfn also suggested that longstanding congressional divisions over china policy were deepening crossing pa rty lines and leading to unusual alliances in addition to conservative republicans and religious organizations from the right of the political spectrum mfn opponents include d liberal democrats labor interests and human rights organizations mfn proponents included party centrists pro business conservatives liberal free traders and some more moderate religious leaders88 differences existed particularly between social and economic conservatives in the republican party with some senior republicans stating that americas best strategy for promoting ting democratic change in this repressive society china is through the free exchange of goods and services in the context of an open mfn trade relationship89and others stating that multinational corporations have too much influence in the china debate there has been an unholy alliance between big business the clint on administration and certain republicans who have adopted

the mfn issue while accommodating the broad spectrum of views within the republican party speaker newt gingrich appointed senior republi cans representatives john edward porter and david dreier to lead house effort to review possible alternatives to mfn withdrawal91 the result of that effort hr 2095 was introduced on june 26 1997 the proposal included increased funding for broadcasts for radio free asia in china and for the national endowment for democr acys activities in china and authorized the state department to deny visas to chinese officials involved in religious persecution but mfn opponents who favored tougher measures against china considered the porterdreier approach too mild referred to the international relations committee the permanent select committee on intelligence and the judiciary committee the bill received further action instead congressional attention quickly shifted to collection of separate bills each dealing with specific and fairly na rrow issue involving china the bills were introduced over period of months and by range of members but they b ecame known informally as the cox package si nce they were supported and put together by the chairman of the house republican policy committee representative chris cox who had also been member of the porterdreier task force the cox package measures either moderately or more seriously sanctioned china for things ranging from proliferation of weapons to abuses of human rights and religious liberty to use of prison labor for producing products for export many of the pending measures were strongly opposed by the ad ministration which was preparing for the first official sinous summit of the clinton presidency scheduled for october 28 29 199792 the china package bills ultimately passed the house by wide margins and are pending in the senate as of the date of this report members appeared divided over some tactical and substantive consid erations proponents of the package for instance put strong pressure on the house leadership to bring the bills to the floor during the late october summit visit of chinas president jiang zemin but the house did not act on the c hina package until early in november 1997 reportedly because senior house republican leaders acquiesced to white house request to keep the bills from the floor during the summit93 on substantive issues proponents of milder approach including several key house committees objected to some of the tougher provisions in the china pack age bills as introduced as result some of the bills were reintroduced in the h ouse without the more stringent provisions while others had the more sanctionoriented provisions deleted during committee consideration for further details on the china package see crs report 97933 pending legislation in the 105th congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98603crs38 conclusions and implications for the future over the past nine years the us po licy debate over chin as mfn status has undergone several changes while essentially an irrele vant issue in the 1980s the question of chinas mfn status took on increasing importance beginning in 1990 peaking in 1992 when congress came clos est to revoking or placing further conditions on chinas trade status afte r this highwater mark the annual mfn debate for china began to fade markedly in importance president clintons 1993 decision to link chinas mfn status to hum an rights progress appears to have been pivotal catalyst in this journey of d eclining importance confronted with the prospects of white house support congre ss has been more cautious and has seemed less vigorous in pushing to revoke or condition chinas mfn status instead members have broadened their search for more specific more targeted legislative alternatives an approach likely to continue having come long way from his initial position which seemed prepared to jettison american economic interests and broader strategic goals in favor of longstanding nd deeply held american values president clinton would also appear to be more committed than ever to his policy of engagement and hence to protecting chinas mfn status second trend evident since 1989 has been the increasing complexity of any potential legislative agenda concerning ch ina and the blurring of traditional party line alliances the 1990s have seen th shifting and regrouping of unusual congressional coalitions on the specific question of chinas mfn status as well as on the broader issue of us china policy on these issues conservatives have aligned with liberals republicans with democrats indus trial proponents with agricultural proponents so that it is difficult to make ge neralizations about opponents and supporters further complica tion to the legislative agenda involves the attitudes of key congressi onal committees those that are most crucial for the punitive measures available to us policymakers such as the house banking committee the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee have majorities w ho favor insulating us trade and economic policy decisions from other us policy goals in the past these committees have been able to stop more punitive measures on chin from reaching floor consideration if current trends continue it is likely to mean that the era has passed when chinas mfn trade status is in serious jeopardy because of bilateral problems in us china relations to the extent that mfn is perceived more and more to be normal trade relations rather than special preferen tial tariff status the stakes of terminating or further conditioning chinas trade status will be higher in the future mfn supporters backed by broad constituent in terests in support of continuing normal trade relations with china may begin pushi ng for overhaul of current jacksonvanik restrictions in the trade act of 1974 they are also likely to begin to support more vigorously permanent mfn status for china perhaps as condition of entry into the world trade organization wto but the fading role for the mfn debate in us policy does not necessarily mean that uschina relations will improve or become less controversial over the near term longstanding issues involving non proliferation human rights and trade are not likely to diminish members who have supported more assertive us stance against china are likely to continue to explore other avenues and legislative vehicleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98603crs39 for registering their views and maintaining pressure on the white house absent demonstrable changes in chinas policies congressional actions targeting china are likely to continue into the foreseeable future
