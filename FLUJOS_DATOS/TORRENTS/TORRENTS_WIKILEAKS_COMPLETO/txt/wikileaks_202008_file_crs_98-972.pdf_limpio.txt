number of civil service annuitants and the financial status of the civil service retirement and disability fund among the results presented in fy2004 70 of civilian federal employees were enrolled in the federal employees retirement system fers which covers employees hired since 1984 thirty percent were enrolled in the civil service retirement system csrs which covers only employees hired before 1984 in fy2006 24 million people received civil service annuity payments eighty nine percent of these annuitants were covered by csrs more than onethird of all federal employee annuitants and survivor annuitants reside in five states california florida texas maryland and virginia the average civilian federal employee who retired in 2006 was 59 years old and had completed 278 years of federal service the average monthly annuity payment to workers who retired under csrs in 2006 was 2452 workers who retired under fers received an average monthly annuity of 896 the fers retirees had shorter average length of service than csrs retirees they also earned social security benefits and received an employer match on their contributions to the thrift savings plan at the end of fy2006 the balance of the civil service retirement and disability fund was 690 billion an amount equal to 12 times the amount of outlays from the fund during 2006 the trust fund balance is expected to reach 702 billion by the end of fy2007 from 1970 to 1985 the number of people receiving civil service annuities rose by one million an increase of 105 between 1985 and 2006 the number of civil service annuitants rose

g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g156g561 the civil service retirement system csrs was established by pl 66215 in 1920 15 years before congress created the social security system for workers in the private sector because csrs was designed to provide both retirement and disability benefits federal employees were excluded from participating in social security state and local governments were permitted to bring their employees into the social security program in the early 1950s and today about three fourths of state and local government employees are covered by social security in the social security amendments of 1983 pl 9821 congress mandated participation in social security by all civilian federal employees initially hired on or after january 1 1984 because social security provides both retirement and disability benefits and because enrolling federal workers in both csrs and social security would have required each employee to contribute more than 13 of pay congress directed the development of new federal employee retirement system with social security as the cornerstone the result of these efforts was the federal employees retirement system fers created by pl 99335 and enacted on june 6 1986 the new system patterned after the retirement programs typical of large employers in the private sector is composed of three elements 1 social security 2 the fers basic annuity defined benefit plan and 3 the thrift savings plan defined contribution plan 1 all permanent federal employees whose initia l federal employment began after december 31 1983 are covered by fers as are employees w ho voluntarily switched from csrs to fers during open seasons in 1987 and 19982 former federal employees who have completed at least five years of service under csrs and are rehired after break in service of less than one year can either join fers or participate in both csrs an d social security through the csrs offset plan under this plan 62 of the employee payroll contribution and an equal share of the employer contribution are paid into social security in retirement these employees csrs annuities are reduced offset by the amount of the social security benefit under fers workers who have completed at least 30 years of service can retire at the minimum retirement age the minimum retirement was 55 for workers born before 1948 and it is scheduled to rise to 57 for those born in 1970 or later employees with 20 or more years of service can retire at age 60 and those with at least 5 years of service can retire at age 62 federal employees and former employees who have complete d at least ten but fewer than 30 years of service can receive reduced fers pension benefit at the minimum retirement age for those who choose this option the fers pension benefit is permanently reduced by 5 multiplied by the number of years between the workers age at retirement and age 62 for example the pension of federal employee who retires at age 56 with fewer than 30 years of service would be permanently reduced by 5 multiplied by six or 30 1 in defined benefit plan the amount of the retirement benefit is based on an employees salary and number of years of service with each year of service worker accrues benefit equal to fixed dollar am ount or percentage of pay defined contribution plan is like savings account maintained on behalf of each participating employee the am ount of retirement benefits that worker receives will depend on the balance in the account which is the sum of contributions plus interest dividends and capital gains or losses 2 pl 10561 oct 10 1997 authorized an open season to be held from july through dec 1998 during which employees still enrolled in csrs could transfer to fers

of federal service age 60 for those with 20 years of service and 62 for employees with at least 5 years of service csrs has provision for early retirement with reduced benefit except for special circumstances such as reduction in force agen cies undergoing reduction in force can with the approval of the office of personnel manage ment offer retirement to employees age 50 or older with 20 or more years of service or at any age with 25 or more years of service an employee under csrs who is offered and accepts an offer of voluntary early retirement has his or her retirement annuity permanently reduced by 2 multiplied by the number of years between the workers age at retirement and age 55 under both csrs and fers the amount of an employees retirement annuity is based on the average of the individuals highest three consecutive years of basic pay multiplied by their years of service and the rate at which benefits accrue for each year of service 3 under fers this accrual rate is one percent of base pay per year workers with 20 years or more of service under fers who work until at least age 62 are credited with an accrual rate of 11 for each year of service4 for example worker covered by fers who retires at 61 with 29 years of service will receive fers annuity equal to 29 of his high3 average pay delaying retirement by one year would increase the annuity to 33 of high3 average pay 30 x 11 330 accrual rates are lower under fers than under csrs because employees covered by fers also pay social security payroll taxes and earn social security retirement benefits under csrs the benefit accrual rate increases with length of service workers accrue benefits equal to 15 of high3 average pay for each of their first 5 years of service 175 of high3 pay for years 6 through 10 and 20 of high3 pay for each year of service after the 10th year this yields pension equal to 5625 of high3 average pay after 30 years of federal service under csrs for all federal workers covered by fers the agency where they are employed contributes an amount equal to 1 of the employees base pay to the thrift savings plan tsp even if the employee makes voluntary contributions to the tsp in 2007 workers covered by fers or csrs can contribute up to 15500 to the tsp5 workers age 50 and older can contribute an additional 5000 to the tsp all contributions to the thrift savings plan are made on pretax basis and neither the employees contribution nor any investment earnings are taxed until the money is withdrawn from the account in addition the first 5 of employee pay contributed to the tsp generates agency matching contributions for workers covered by fers6 workers covered by csrs may contribute to the tsp but t they receive matching contributions from their employing agency 3 the calculation of highthree average pay is based on nominal or current dollars rather than indexed or constant dollars 4 because fers coverage began in 1984 federal workers will have 30 years of service exclusively under fers until 2014 5 employee contributions to the tsp are subject to the annual limit on salary deferrals established under internal revenue code 402g 6 all employees covered by fers receive agency automatic contributions of 1 of pay employee contributions are matched dollarfordollar on the first 3 of pay and at 50 on the dollar on the next 2 of pay thus the maximum agency contribution is 5 of pay httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98972g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g7g150g153g149g152g162g142g142g156g514g561g20g142g157g146g155g142g150g142g151

full actuarial cost of the program minus employee contributions agency contributions to fers equal 112 of pay in 2006 these three sources of income are not cash transactions but intragovernmental transfers which result in an increase in the funds budget authority as recorded in the accounts of the us treasury the fund receives treasury bonds as record of this budget authority which it redeems periodically as annuity payments come due13 expenditures from the retirement and disability fund consist mainly of payments to retired federal employees and their surviving spouses and dependents

fund rose from 236 billion to 690 billion an increase of 192 see table 9 the balance of the fund has been rising partly because the civil service retirement programs are in longterm transition from payasyougo financing under csrs to advancefunding under fers for most of its history csrs benefits were funded on payasyougo basis with small reserve equal to about one year of benefit payments to meet unexpected contingencies employee contributions and agency contributions were less than the actuarial value of the benefits that were accrued each year by federal employees in 1969 pl 9193 mandated annual payments to the fund from the general revenues of the us treasury to make up most of this shortfall 14 when congress passed the legislation that created fers in 1986 it required that the full actuarial value of benefits accrued each year by federal employees covered by the program including the value of future colas must be funded by the sum of employee and agency contributions the office of personnel management estimates that at some time in the 21st century the trust fund will reach steady state in which it holds sufficient budget authority to finance about 20 years of retirement and disability benefits 14 the office of management and budget has estimated that employee and agency contributions and the transfers from the general fund are sufficient to meet all of the actuarial costs of csrs except for the increase in benefits represented by colas

doubled since 1970 but the rate of increase has slowed since 1985 see table 10 the rapid rise in the number of civil service annuitants from less than one million in 1970 to approximately two million in 1985 resulted from the increase in federal employment that occurred between 1940 and 1955 see table 11 throughout the 1930s civilian federal employment including postal employees was less than one million 1940 was the first year in which there were more than one million people in the federal workforce by 1955 civilian federal employment had reached 24 million there were brief upward spikes in federal employment during world war ii and the korean war but relatively few of these wartime workers remained in service long enough to become vested in pension benefits after 1955 civilian federal employment increased much more slowly it reached 29 million in 1970 due in part to the war in vietnam and the creation of such largescale social programs as medicare and medicaid in the 1960s the slower but still steady increase in the number of federal employees in the years between 1955 and 1970 had as one of its consequences the slower but steady increase in the number of civil service annuitants in the years since 1985 between 1985 and 2005 the number of civil service annuitants rose from around 2 million to about 25 million

will be approximately 29 million people receiving federal civil service annuities expenditures for civil service annuities have grown by greater percentage than the number of annuitants because they are affected not only by the number of people employed by the federal government but also by increases in average life span growth in real wages and inflation cost ofliving adjustmentswhich have been applied to civil service annuities since 1962do not represent an increase in the real value of these annuities they merely keep purchasing power from eroding due to the effects of inflation 15 under current law the real value of civil service annuity either remains constant csrs or declines fers during retirement16 therefore the increase in the real value of annuities has been the result of increases in the average value of the high3 average pay on which these annuities are based rates of increase in the high3 average pay of retiring federal employees are in turn affected by adjustments to pay for each gradeandstep level special pay increases such as locality pay adjustments the distribution of federal employees among various gradeandstep levels over time and average length of service since each additional year of service tends to increase the high3 average pay the average real value of civil service annuities per annuitant can be expected to decline in the future as
