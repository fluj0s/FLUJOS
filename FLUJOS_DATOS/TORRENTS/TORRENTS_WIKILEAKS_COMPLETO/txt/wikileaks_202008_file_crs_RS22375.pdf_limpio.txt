of federal tsa screeners in an effort to increase participation in this program by separating out tsas regula tory oversight functions from screening operations and promoting the use of private screening partners the bill seeks to address in part concern expressed by some over the tsas dual role as both the policymaker and regulator of aviation security at airports and the provider of screening services for airline passengers and their baggage this report will be updated as needed funding levels and priorities since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the federal budget for the transportation security administration tsa has grown to over 6 billion annually with large proportion about 87 going for aviation security operations chiefly the screening of airline passengers and baggage and the deployment of air marshals on passenger flights the tsas initial authorization for aviation security functions was set to ex pire at the end of fy2005 but was extended through fy2006 by the intelligence reform nd terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 that initial authoriz ation set forth in the aviation and transportation security act atsa pl 10771 allowed fo r such sums as may be necessary to carry out aviation securityrelated functions this language provided extensive flexibility tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22375crs2 appropriators and the administr ation to set budgets needed to meet the aviation security mandates set forth in atsa including the deployment of federa l screeners at all commercial passenger airports and 100 electronic sc reening of passenger bags objectives that were initially entered into with relatively high level of risk and uncertainty in the five years since the tsas creation the initial budgetary risk and uncertainty has declined considerably and will likely continue to stabilize therefore as congress examines and debates the first multiyear tsa reauthorization measure since its creation authorizing committees may seek to more explicitly define the tsas future funding levels nd priorities the transportation security improve ment act of 2005 s 1052 tsa reauthorization measure introduced by sena tor stevens does not seek significant changes to funding amounts for aviation secu rity compared to am ounts appropriated over the past two years but proposes proportiona lly larger increases for maritime and land security and tsas intelligence functions wh ich would nonetheless c ontinue to make up relatively small percent of the tsas overall budget the bill would authorize expenses for the tsa as outlined in table 1

tsa research development rd functions were moved to the science technology directorate and consolidated with other rd activities financing aviation security various alternative financing mechanisms may be debated during the reau thorization and appr opriations processes as present user fees fall well short of offsetting total federal costs for aviation security presently airline passengers pay 250 per leg fee not to ex ceed 500 per one way flight additionally airlines each contribute an aviation security infrastructure fee asif that has an overall cap equal to the amount that the airlines collectively spent on passenger and baggagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22375crs3 1 see title 49 usc 44940 2 see for example robert w poole jr airport security time for new model policy study 340 angeles ca reason public policy institute january 2006screening in calendar year 20001 when atsa was enacted many believed that these fees would cover large portion if not all of the cost for aviation security however in recent years passenger and airline fee collec tions have netted less than 35 of the direct costs for airport screening operations air ma rshals and airport security infrastructure the financiallytroubled airline industry gene rally opposes security fee increases arguing they will hurt revenues by increasing the total cost of airline travel forcing airlines to either cut ticket prices or passengers on the other hand unless the fee structure is changed lawmakers are faced with the prospect of continuing to pay for substantial amount of the total cost for aviation secur ity using general fund contributions during time of increasing pressure to reduce defi cit spending the fy2007 presidents budget proposal recommends replacing the current passenger fee schedule with flat per passenger fee of 500 for each oneway trip while fy2006 plan to raise the existing segmentbased fees failed to garner much support in congress the administration views the proposed fee based on oneway trips as being more palatabl because it would not impose higher fees on connecting passeng ers and would better reflect passenger utilization of the aviation security system since passengers typically undergo security screening only once for every oneway trip under plan proposed in s 1052 the tsa would be required to promulgate new rulemaking subject to congressi onal review before imposing air carrier security fees that would continue or replace the asif bey ond fy2006 additionally s 1052 would require the tsa to study alternative methods for coll ecting passenger security fees besides using the airlines to collect these fees as part of ticket purchases alternatives suggested in the legislative proposal include vending kiosks automated vending devices the internet and other remote vending sites if any of thes fee collection methods is determined to be feasible the tsa would then be required to develop systems utilizing these alternative collection methods for the purpose of assessing their efficiency the bill however does not propose to alter the existin g passenger fee schedule performancebased airport screening organization the house while not yet considering tsa reauthorization bill as such is considering measure that would more substantively alter the organizational structure of the tsa the transportation security administrati on reorganization act of 2005 hr 4439 introduced by representative lungren seeks to establish performancebased organization referred to as the airport screen ing organization aso to manage the day today passenger and baggage screening functions of the ts by separating out tsas regulatory oversight function of aviati on security from screening operations and promoting the use of private screening partners the bill seeks to address in part concern expressed by some over the tsa s dual role as both the policymaker and regulator of aviation security and the provider of airport security screening2 the proposed asos mission would be to improve these screening operations through increased efficiency better use of dvanced technologies reduced costs and more effective response to the needs of th traveling public while enhancing aviation security the aso would be run by chief operating officer coo and ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22375crs4 3 transportation security administration c ovenantlockheed team selected as private screening contractor at sioux falls press release december 16 2005organizationally similar to the performancebased air traffic organization ato recently created within the federal aviation administration faa to oversee air traffic operations and the acquisition and maintenance of air traffic facilities and equipment like the faas reorganization the proposed reorganization of the tsa would separate the operations and technology functions from regulatory development oversight and enforcement functions under the plan the coo would be responsible for developing 5year strategic plan outlining measurable performance goals for gauging the effectiveness efficiency nd productivity of aviation screen ing operations the existing senate proposal for tsa reau thorization s 1052 contains similar provisions for restructuring the tsa partnerships with private screening entities hr 4439 also seeks several modifications to the existing security scr eening optout program provision of atsa pl 10771 that allows airpor ts to request private screener s instead of federal screeners initially private screening contracts were tablished at five airports under pilot program and in november 2004 all commercial passenger ai rports became eligible to request that screening operations be handed over to private fi rms however while those airports already in the pilot program all elected to continue using private screeners few other airports have sought to convert to pr ivate screeners while the tsa has certified more than 30 vendors to provide security screening at airpor ts so far it has awarded only one contract to provide airport screening rvices under its screening partnership program spp at sioux falls regional airport south dakota3 it anticipates fully converting the five existing pilot program airports to the spp program by may 2006 variety of factors have contributed to the relu ctance of airports to switch to private screening operations including perceived program constraints concerns over potential repercussions from opting out of the federal screening program and concerns over potential liability exposure for airports that request private screeners the concerns over potential airport liability were largely addressed in the fy2006 department of home land security appropriations act pl 10990 sec 547 which extends liab ility protections to airport operators that request private screening contracts previously only private screening companies were covered under statutory liability limits set fo rth in the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 hr 4439 contains language to ensure that funding for aviation security is allocated among airports according to costbased formula without re gard to whether the airport is staffed with federal or private screeners the bill further requires the tsa to develop standard operating procedures and requirements for private sc reening operations private screening firms that meet these requirements will be issued certificates of conformance and liability protections provi ded to screening entities under provisions of the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 6 usc sec 443 would be extended to airport operators and other third pa rties although as noted bove liability protections for airports with private screeners were addr essed in pl 10990 hr 4439 would require the tsa to set performance goals for private screening operations and allows the tsa to provide incentives for private screening entities that meet or exceed performance expectations additionally to provide air ports with an incentive to request private screeners hr 4439 allows the tsa to awar d airports with grants to cover aviationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22375crs5 4 department of homeland security office of inspector general followup audit of passenger and baggage screening procedures at domestic airports unclassified summary oig0516 march 2005 5 ibid 6 s 1052 sec 203 p 11security costs of up to 90 of the annual cost savings realized by converting to private screeners subject to the availability of ppropriations the bill would also require each airport with federal screen ers to submit written notice to the tsa on an annual basis specifying whether the airport intends to submit request for private screeners or continue using federal screeners airport screening performance improving the quality and performance of the screener workforce was central element of the public policy debate leading to the creation of the tsa and the nationwide deployme nt of federal screen ers however the overall effectiveness of these efforts has been brought into question by audits indicating that improvements are still needed in the screening process to ensure that dangerous prohibited items are not being carried into the sterile areas of airports or do not enter the checked baggage system4 factors cited for the failures to perform adequately included screener training equipmen t and technology policies nd procedures and management and supervision of screening operations despite considerable attention to this area the most recent followup audit by the dhs office of inspector general noted that significant improvements in screening performance ma not be possible without systemwide deployment of new technologies such as back scatter xray explosive detection portals and document scanners5 several provisions in pl 108458 addresse d specific needs for checkpoint screening technologies and improved scr eener performance while c ongressional oversight of the tsas progress to address these specific screening technology and performance issues may heighten during the second session of the 109th congress hr 4439 addresses the issue from broader organizational manageme nt perspective specifically hr 4439 calls for the proposed aso to develop and ex ecute 5year strategic plan for improving screening effectiveness efficiency and pr oductivity and would set specific measurable performance goals in each of thes areas at various levels of the organization the senate bill s 1052 on the other hand contains provi sions more specifically addressing issues of screener training and r ecruitment s 1052 would requi re the tsa to report on the adequacy of screener training focusing on any multihour weekly training requirements assessing the degree to which such requireme nts are met and whether such requirements are appropriate workab and desirable6 s 1052 also calls for establishing pilot program at three or more airports for training highschool seniors hi red as student interns to perform airport screening functions s 1052 would also establish waiver process allowing convicted criminals to be hired as airport screeners after determining that they do not pose security or terrorism risk passenger identification and risk assessment longstanding objective since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 has been to evolve airline passenger screening into process that more fully cons iders the degree of risk posed by individual passengers the argument being that riskb ased assessments of passengers could aid inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22375crs6 focusing limited screening resources on those passengers that pose an elevated or unknown risk and may streamline the security screening for those passengers who pose little or security risk meeting this objective however has proved difficult partly because of lingering privacy and passenger data protection concerns an apparent inability to adequately address these concerns resulted in the tsa scrapping its controversial computer assisted passenger prescreeningii capps ii program and has led to delays in launching secure flight system designed to check passenger names against the consolidated terrorist watchlist while meeting the objectives of carrying out riskbased assessments of airline passengers was addresse d in the original atsa legisla tion and revisited in pl 108458 the current legislative proposals are more dir ectly focused on issues related to acceptable forms of passenger identification and the prescreening of passengers on inbound international flights specifically hr 4439 would require passenger s to present tamper resistant identification that includes the individuals full legal name date of birth gender photograph and signature such as drivers li censes and personal identification cards that meet the requirements of th real id act of 2005 49 usc 30301 note passengers unable to present acceptable identification would be subject to additional physical screening at checkpoints and passengers w ho knowingly present false identification would be subject to criminal penalties additionally hr 4439 would require the tsa to launch pilot program at two or more foreign airports utilizing automated systems to prescreen passengers against the consolidated terrorist watchlist prior to boarding international flights bound for the united states language in the bill also encourages the dhs to pursue international c ooperative efforts to set tec hnology standards for passenger data systems hr 4439 would also require the dhs to review the existing computer assisted passenger prescreening system capps passenger risk assessment tool run by the airlines and evaluate whether it should be continued after full deployment of secure flight also hr 4439 would require the development of processes to ensure that secondary screening is not conducted on passenger s who have either been cleared by fingerprint based background checks conducted by the dhs or hold security clearance issued by the dhs participants in the forthcoming registered traveler program for example may benefit from this by voluntar ily undergoing background checks in exchange for expedited screening without the chance of being singled out for secondary screening other possible issues variety of other lingering aviation security issues may arise during the tsa reauthorization process including air cargo security and general aviation security however the legislati on currently under consid eration appears to be more specifically focused on issues related to the security of passenger airline operations besides those issues already discussed bove hr 4439 proposes several modifications to the program to train and deploy armed pilots the federal flight deck officer ffdo program that are designed to improve the accessibility and reduce the cost of training for participating pilots increase the utilization of armed pilots on international flights and improve communi cations and exchange of securityrelated information to pilots in the program the senate bill s 1052 addresses continuing concerns over security risks at foreign aircraft repair stations by proposing to place moratorium on faa certification of these facilities unless the tsa reviews and audits them an unfilled statutory requirement mandate d by vision 100 the century of aviation authorization act
