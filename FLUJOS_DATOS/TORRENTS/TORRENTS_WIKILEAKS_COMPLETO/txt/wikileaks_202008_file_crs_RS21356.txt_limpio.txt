social security benefits legislative history before 1979 uc benefits were not subject to the federal income tax in the revenue act of 1978 pl 95600 uc benefits were made partially taxable for benefits received after december 31 1978 benefits were taxable only for tax filers whose agi exceeded 20000 single filers or 25000 joint filers7 taxation was applied to the lesser of 1 uc benefits or 2 onehalf of agi with uc benefits included in excess of the above mentioned agi thresholds8 6 for example for tax year 2005 an adjusted gross income of more than 11750 would disqualify single taxpayer with children an adjusted gross income of more than 37263 would disqualify married couple with two children investment income of more than 2700 would disqualify any taxpayer 7 if the thresholds were adjusted for inflation the comparable 2007 values would be 57120 and 71400 8 joint committee on taxation general explanation of the revenue act of 1978 hr 13511 continued crs4 during the 1970s some policy studies had shown that the proportion of wages replaced by uc benefits on an aftertax basis was large enough to erode claimants work incentive9 taxation of uc benefits served to reduce the degree of aftertax wage replacement and reduce the work disincentive effect however uc benefits of lower income claimants remained untaxed because their total income was under the tax threshold ie their standard deduction and personal exemptions offset their income in 1982 congress lowered the agi thresholds for taxation of uc benefits the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 pl 97248 reduced those thresholds to 12000 for single filers and 18000 for joint filers10 primary motivation of this legislation was to raise revenue but it left in place policy of protecting lower income claimants from taxation of uc benefits11 congress made uc benefits fully taxable in the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99 514 effective for benefits received after december 31 1986 although this action reversed the original policy of taxing uc benefits only above an agi threshold it occurred in the context of law that removed many lowincome filers from the tax rolls lowered the marginal tax rates for the majority of taxpayers and expanded eligibility for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21356 the earned income credit the rationale for full taxation of uc benefits was to treat uc benefits the same as wages and to eliminate the work disincentive caused by favorable tax treatment for uc benefits relative to wages12 concern about claimants cash flow problems caused by the lack of tax withholding from uc benefits arose during the 19901991 recession pl 102318 required states to inform all new claimants of their responsibility to pay income tax on uc benefits and to provide them with information on how to file estimated quarterly tax payments in 1994 pl 103465 required states to withhold federal income tax from uc benefits if claimant requested withholding and permitted states to withhold state and local income taxes pl 103465 set the federal withholding rate at 15 of the gross benefit payment amount the federal withholding rate was changed to 10 by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 effective august 7 2001 legislation in the 110th congress on september 9 2008 the suspension of federal income tax on unemployment benefits act of 2008 hr 6844 mchugh was introduced this bill would temporarily suspend the inclusion of uc benefits for federal tax purposes for 2008 and 2009 8 continued 95th congress pl 95600 march 12 1979 p 23 9
