the commission chamber in protest6 these instances significantly affected the commissions credibility critics claimed that countries used their mbership to deflect attention from their own human rights violations by questioni ng the records of others some members were accused of bloc voting and excessive procedural manipulation to prevent debate of their human rights abuses7 in 2005 the

reported that economic status ethnicity and racial discrimination were indicators for death penalty verdicts reportedly prompting thensenator jesse helms to declare the special rapporteurs mission an absurd charade12 in 2001 more controversy followed when the united states was not elected to the commission and widely perceived human rights violators such as pakistan sudan and uganda were elected

elections some council members and observers are worried that the process of elections by regional group does not allow for competition among member states running for council seats in the may 2007 elections for example three out of five regional groups nominated the same number of countries as there were seats av ailable this limited the number of choices and guaranteed the election of nominated member states regardless of their human rights records leadership from democratic countries some have noted that the council lacks leadership par ticularly from democracies and countries with positive human rights records36 some observers have speculated that prodemocracy council members are not pushing their initiatives as they have in the past because they need support from other council members pa rticularly the nonaligned movement in negotiations on c ouncil structure and mechanisms37 alternately some observers maintain th at the council can still change its current course and improve they emphasize th at the council has yet to fully implement some of the mechanisms that differentiate it from the commission most notably the universal periodic review process council supporte rs also maintain that the composition of council membership is significant improvement over the composition of commission membership th ey emphasize that the most egregious human rights

proportionate shares of its contributions to th regular budget for programs and activities it s opposed however withhol ding council funds in this manner would be largely symbolic policy action
