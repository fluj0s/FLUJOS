national government government and finance division the deeming resolution budget enforcement tool summary deeming resolution is term that refers to legislation deemed to serve as an annual budget resolution for purposes of establishing enforceable budget levels for budget cycle deeming resolution is used when the house and senate are late in reaching final agreement on budget resolution or fail to reach agreement altogether the congressional budget act of 1974 requires the annual adoption of budget resolution establishing aggregate levels of revenues spending the debt limit and the surplus or deficit as well as allocations of spending enforcement of the budget resolution relies primarily upon points of order and reconciliation procedures with regard to the enforcement of budget aggregates and committee spending allocations the major points of order are found in sections 311 and 302 of the act respectively the term deeming resolution is not officially defined nor is there any specific statute or rule authorizing such legislation instead the use of deeming resolution simply represents the house and senate employing regular legislative procedures to deal with the issue on an ad hoc basis the form and content of deeming resolution is not prescribed so it may be shaped to meet the particular needs at hand for example the house and senate have used simple resolutions as the legislative vehicle in the past but deeming resolution may be incorporated into bill such as an annual appropriations act as single provision at minimum deeming resolutions provide new spending allocations to the appropriations committees but they also may set new aggregate budget levels provide revised spending allocations to other house and senate committees or provide for other related purposes for fy1999 the first of four years that the two chambers failed to reach final agreement on budget resolution the senate adopted two deeming resolutions sres 209 on april 2 1998 and sres 312 on october 21 1998 and the house included deeming provisions in two resolutions dealing with other subjects as well hres 477 adopted on june 19 1998 and hres 5 adopted on january 6 1999 in the absence of budget resolution for fy2003 the house on may 22 2002 adopted deeming provision in hres 428 special rule for hr 4775 supplemental appropriations act the senate did not adopt deeming resolution during the session in related action the senate extended certain expiring budget enforcement provisions by adopting sres 304 on october 16 2002 for fy2005 and fy2007 the house and senate again used

7 the deeming resolution budget enforcement tool deeming resolution is term that refers to legislation which is deemed to serve as an annual budget resolution for purposes of establishing enforceable budget levels for budget cycle deeming resolution is used when the house and senate are late in reaching final agreement on budget resolution or fail to reach agreement altogether either chamber may initiate its own budget enforcement procedures by adopting deeming resolution in the form of simple resolution this report describes substantive enforcement procedures associated with the budget resolution explains the concept of deeming resolution discusses house and senate action on deeming resolutions and provides information on related topic waiving bar against the consideration of budgetary legislation for fiscal year before budget resolution for that fiscal year has been adopted substantive enforcement of the budget resolution the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 93344 as amended requires the adoption by april 15th of each year of concurrent resolution on the budget1 the annual budget resolution sets forth aggregate levels of revenues spending the debt limit and the surplus or deficit as well as allocations of spending both budget authority and outlays by each of major functional categories of the budget the congressional budget process was first implemented in 1975 for fy1976 with full implementation of the process occurring the following year over the years the time frame of the budget resolution has lengthened from one fiscal year to at least five fiscal years and sometimes as many as 10 fiscal years plus revisions to the current fiscal year enforcement of the budget resolution relies primarily upon points of order and reconciliation procedures pointoforder provisions contained in the 1974 congressional budget act which sometimes are supplemented by pointoforder provisions carried in annual budget resolutions allow any member in either chamber to prevent the consideration of legislation that would violate budget resolution 1 in its original form the 1974 congressional budget act required the annual adoption of two budget resolutions one in the spring and one in the fall the two required budget resolutions were adopted each year for the first seven years of the congressional budget process fy1976fy1982 beginning with fy1983 however the house and senate adopted the practice of acting on only one budget resolution year for more information see crs report rl30297 congressional budget resolutions selected statistics and information guide by bill heniff jr crs2 policies2 of course points of order are not selfenforcing and may be waived with sufficient majority thereby allowing legislation in violation of budget resolution policies to be considered in the senate most of the points or order pertaining to budget enforcement require the affirmative vote of threefifths of the membership 60 votes if seats are vacant in order to be waived with regard to the substantive enforcement of the budget resolution ie enforcement of budgetary levels the major points of order under the 1974 congressional budget act are found in sections 311 and 302 which deal with the enforcement of budget aggregates and committee spending allocations respectively house and senate rules and practices differ somewhat with regard to these two points of order section 311a generally bars the consideration of any spending measure that would violate the aggregate budget authority and outlays levels for the first fiscal year covered by the budget resolution and any revenue measure that would violate the aggregate revenue level for the first fiscal year or the sum of all fiscal years covered by the budget resolution section 302a generally requires that the aggregate amounts of spending recommended in the annual budget resolution be allocated by committee the house and senate appropriations committees receive an allocation for only one fiscal year but the remaining house and senate committees receive allocations for all of the years covered by the budget resolution3 section 302b requires the house and senate appropriations committees to subdivide their allocations by subcommittee4 section 302f generally bars the consideration of any spending measure that would violate the committee spending allocations made under section 302a or the appropriations committees suballocations of spending made under section 302b in view of the different time frames for making committee spending allocations the spending levels are enforceable for one year in the case of the appropriations committees but are enforceable for multiyear period in the case of the other house and senate committees the purpose of the budget reconciliation process is to change substantive law so that revenue and mandatory spending levels are brought into line with budget resolution policies reconciliation generally has been used to reduce the deficit through spending reductions or revenue increases or combination of the two in more recent years however the reconciliation process also encompassed revenue reduction generally and spending increases in selected program areas at the 2 for listing of the points of order see crs report 97865 points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturno 3 if the budget aggregates for the fiscal year in progress the current year are revised in the budget resolution then the currentyear spending allocations to committees are revised as well 4 the spending allocations to committees usually are included in the joint explanatory statement on the budget resolution the spending suballocations made by the appropriations committees are set forth in house or senate reports as appropriate crs3 beginning of the 110th congress the house and senate adopted rules restricting the use of reconciliation to deficit reduction5 reconciliation is twostep process6 under the first step reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution directing one or more committees in each house to develop legislation that changes spending or revenues or both by the amounts specified in the budget resolution if more than one committee in each house is given instructions each instructed committee submits reconciliation legislation to its respective budget committee which incorporates all submissions without any substantive revision into single omnibus budget reconciliation measure under the second step the omnibus budget reconciliation measure is considered in the house and senate under expedited procedures for example debate time in the senate on reconciliation measure is limited to 20 hours and amendments must be germane the process culminates with enactment of the measure thus putting the policies of the budget resolution into effect the deeming resolution when the house and senate do not reach final agreement on budget resolution in timely manner or fail to reach final agreement altogether during session they are faced with mixed situation regarding budget enforcement for upcoming fiscal years the multiyear budget levels in the prior years budget resolution remain in effect and provide some basis for enforcing points of order with respect to revenue and mandatory spending legislation changing economic and technical factors over the past year however may have rendered the prior budget levels out of date thereby undermining their value as realistic basis for enforcement of present policies further the house and senate must adopt new budget resolution each year in order for the enforcement of annually appropriated spending levels to be continuous if budget resolution is not adopted for fiscal year there is allocation of spending made to the appropriations committees under section 302a and basis for them to make the required spending suballocations under section 302b7 consequently when the house and senate have been presented with such situations they have resorted to the use of deeming resolutions to provide basis for updated enforcement the term deeming resolution is not officially defined nor is there any specific statute or rule authorizing such legislation instead the use of deeming resolution simply represents the house and senate employing regular legislative procedures to deal with the issue on an ad hoc basis 5 for additional information see crs report rl33818 federal budget process reform in the 110th congress brief overview by

shaped to meet the particular needs at hand for example the house and senate have used simple resolutions as the legislative vehicle in the past but deeming resolution may be incorporated into bill such as an annual appropriations act as single provision at minimum deeming resolutions provide new spending allocations to the appropriations committees but they also may set new aggregate budget levels provide revised spending allocations to other house and senate committees or provide for other related purposes deeming resolution may even declare that budget resolution in its entirety passed earlier in the session by one chamber is deemed to have the force and effect as if adopted by both chambers house and senate action on deeming resolutions both the house and senate have acted on several deeming resolutions in the past for purposes of this review distinction is drawn between instances in which the budget resolution was adopted in tardy manner and instances in which budget resolution was adopted at all tardy adoption of the budget resolution for 30 of the 34 fiscal years covering fy1976fy2009 the house and senate adopted at least one budget resolution as shown in table 1 the house and senate were not able to reach agreement on budget resolutions for fy1999 fy2003 fy2005 and fy2007 in most of the 30 years for which budget resolution was adopted final agreement on the measure was reached in april may or early june allowing the house and senate to bring the regular appropriations bills and other budgetary legislation to the floor with little or delay in some instances however the final budget resolution was not in place until late june or even until august or october the general practice of the senate in such years particularly with regard to the regular appropriations bills was to consider legislation within the framework of the senatepassed budget resolution but not to adopt deeming resolution for example spending levels provided in the appropriations bills generally were consistent with the spending allocations to the senate appropriations committee and the spending suballocations thereunder that would have been made had the senatepassed levels become the final ones consideration of the measures usually occurred by unanimous consent the tardy adoption of budget resolutions has been more of problem for the house than the senate especially because the house usually begins the consideration of the regular appropriations bills at an earlier point in the session in 1990 the house made procedural change to allow the consideration of the regular appropriations acts to begin if the budget resolution was not finalized in timely manner the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 title xiii of pl 101508 as amended added temporary provision to the 1974 congressional budget act authorizing the chairman of the house budget committee to issue provisional spending allocation to the house appropriations committee consistent with the crs5 statutory limits on discretionary spending set by the bea if the budget resolution were not agreed to by the april 15 deadline8 in 1997 the budget enforcement act bea of 1997 title x of pl 10533 repealed section 603 and all of the other sections in title vi of the 1974 congressional budget act but incorporated modified version of the provision into section 302 as permanent part of procedure9 the modification requires the allocation to the house appropriations committee to be consistent with the most recently agreed to budget resolution rather than the statutory limits on discretionary spending the statutory limits expired at the end of fy2002 table 1 dates of final adoption of budget resolutions fy1976fy2009 fiscal date fiscal date year adopted year adopted 1976

of the 1974 congressional budget act as added by section 10106 of the bea of 1997 111 stat 680681 crs6 notwithstanding the authority established in 1990 for making provisional spending allocations to the house appropriations committee based on prior budget resolutions the house on several occasions has adopted deeming resolutions so that consideration of regular appropriations acts could proceed under more updated spending allocations in 1990 1995 and 1996 several special rules10 on regular appropriations bills included provisions that deemed housepassed budget resolution to be in effect until superseded by final housesenate agreement on budget resolution or that deemed particular spending allocation to be in effect11 in 1990 when the final adoption of the budget resolution for fy1991 was delayed until october 9 while extensive negotiations were conducted in budget summit between the administration and congress the senate adopted deeming resolution to allow consideration of the regular appropriations acts for that year to proceed sres 308 which set forth fy1991 allocations of 680512 billion in new budget authority and 690606 billion in outlays to the senate appropriations committee for purposes of section 302a of the congressional budget act of 1974 was adopted by the senate on july 12 1990 by unanimous consent12 under the terms of sres 308 the spending allocations were effective pending final agreement on the budget resolution or the agreement to different spending levels in the budget summit negotiations failure to adopt the budget resolution as stated previously the house and senate failed to adopt budget resolution four times during the past 34 years in 1998 for fy1999 in 2002 for fy2003 in 2004 for fy2005 and in 2006 for fy2007 house and senate action on deeming resolutions for these years is summarized in table 2 and discussed in more detail below the appendix sets forth the text of the deeming resolutions as table 2 shows the house and senate have followed different patterns in terms of action on deeming resolutions for each of the four fiscal years the house used the same approach adopting deeming resolution in may or june month or

4939 which became public law 109234 source prepared by the congressional research service deeming resolution provisions were included in the resolution establishing the house rules at the opening of the congress crs9 the legislative vehicle for the deeming resolution in each instance was special rule reported by the house rules committee three of the special rules provided for the consideration of an annual appropriations act two regular appropriations acts and one supplemental appropriations act and the other provided for the consideration of conference report on budget resolution each of the special rules contained separate section setting forth the deeming resolution provisions at the beginning of the next session which started new congress additional deeming resolution provisions were adopted by the house as part of the openingday rules package usually numbered hres 5 in 2007 the rules package was hres 6 which was approved by separate vote on each title over the first two days these actions were required because simple house resolutions such as special rules reported by the house rules committee do not carry over into new congress thus the initial deeming resolution had to be renewed by the adoption of new resolution the initial deeming resolution first used by the house for fy1999 only provided spending allocations to the house appropriations committee in the other three years the initial deeming resolution had broader application putting into effect the entire budget resolution at its latest stage of action house passage or house agreement to the conference report in the two most recent instances for fy2005 and fy2007 the deeming resolution blocked the automatic engrossment of joint resolution increasing the public debt limit as provided for under house rule xxvii forcing debtlimit increase under regular legislative procedures13 subsequent deeming resolution provisions included in the openingday rules package for the 106th congress and the 108th110th congresses continued budget resolution policies and procedures into the new congress the senate has employed more varied practices than the house with respect to deeming resolutions for fy1999 it adopted two simple resolutions for this purpose in single session the first only provided spending allocations to the senate appropriations committee but the second had much broader application in the following instance for fy2003 the senate did not adopt deeming resolution despite several attempts to do so in the last two instances for fy2005 and fy2007 the senate included deeming resolution provisions in statute including regular appropriations act enacted in august and supplemental appropriations act enacted in june these latter two deeming resolutions focused principally on establishing new allocations of total discretionary spending to the senate appropriations committee and repealing or making inapplicable appropriations caps for the pertinent fiscal years included in the prior years budget resolution that were considered obsolete and too restrictive actions for fy1999 overall budget policy for fy1999 had been outlined the previous year in 1997 under the terms of fiveyear agreement reached between congress and president clinton although each chamber passed budget resolution in 1998 they could not reach agreement on final version 13 see crs report rs21519 legislative procedures for adjusting the public debt limit by bill heniff jr crs10 in order to impose binding restraint on annual appropriations acts and other budgetary legislation for that year the house and senate followed similar approaches the senate passed its version of the fy1999 budget resolution sconres 86 on april 2 1998 anticipating an impasse with the house the senate also that day agreed to sres 209 measure setting forth spending allocations to the senate appropriations committee until concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1999 is agreed to by the senate and the house of representatives14 on october 21 1998 several weeks after fy1999 had begun the senate agreed to sres 312 informally referred to as the deeming budget resolution15 the measure amended sres 209 by incorporating budget aggregates for fy1999fy2003 and authorizing the chairman of the senate budget committee to file committee spending allocations consistent with them the budget aggregates included in sres 312 reflected the policies of the previous budget resolution updated for enacted legislation and revised economic and technical assumptions and provided the basis for enforcement under section 302 section 311 and other sections of the 1974 congressional budget act on june 19 1998 the house adopted hres 477 special rule providing for the consideration of the military constructions appropriations act for fy199 hr 4059 section 2 of the resolution set forth spending allocations to the house appropriations committee for fy1999 on january 6 1999 at the beginning of the next session the house adopted hres 5 measure setting forth its standing rules section 2a of the resolution directed the chairman of the house budget committee to publish budget aggregates and committee spending allocations for fy1999fy2003 in the congressional record and stated that these levels should provide the basis for enforcement in lieu of budget resolution16 house budget committee chairman john kasich submitted the aggregates and allocations on february 25 and march 3 199917 actions for fy2003 as the prospect of second instance without final agreement of the house and senate on budget resolution became more likely both chambers turned to deeming resolutions as an enforcement alternative concern about budget discipline also was heightened by anticipation of the expiration toward the end of the session of statutory budget enforcement mechanisms under the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 ie the discretionary spending limits and payasyougo requirement which were enforced by sequestration and the senates payasyougo point of order and threefifths vote 14 the text of sres 209 is set forth on page s3160 of the congressional record of april

september 30 2002 his bill would have extended the discretionary spending limits and payasyougo requirement for five fiscal years through fy2007 the house did not take any action on such legislation in early october speaker dennis hastert indicated that the house might not act on such legislation until 200321 the senate budget committee reported budget resolution for fy2003 sconres 100 on april 11 2002 but it was not considered on the senate floor during the session22 during june 2002 several efforts were made in the senate to amend legislation with provisions serving as deeming resolution

19 but the senate did not consider it the house considered the conference report on the fy2005 budget resolution under the terms of special rule hres 649 hrept 108500 may 19 2004 the special rule was adopted on may 19 by vote of 220204 in anticipation of the possibility that final senate approval of the budget resolution might be delayed or might not occur at all deeming resolution provision was included in section 2 of hres 649 by adopting hres 649 the house put into effect the budget policies embodied in the conference report on sconres 95 as adopted by the house as well as the procedures under title iii of the 1974 congressional budget act used to enforce them accordingly in the house regular appropriations acts for fy2005 and other budgetary measures are subject to aggregate spending ceilings and revenue floors as well as allocations of spending to committees section 2b of hres 649 barred the automatic engrossment of measure raising the debt limit by the amount recommended in the budget resolution an action otherwise required under house rule xxvii whenever budget resolution is finally agreed to by the house and senate consequently the automatic engrossment of such measure could have occurred in 2004 only if the senate adopted the conference report on sconres 95 congress and the president enacted legislation raising the debt limit pl 108415 november 19 2004 under regular legislative procedures in most instances the house and senate use other means to enact debt limit legislation33 for the two months following house action on the deeming resolution provision the senate did not consider the conference report on the fy2005 budget resolution nor act on deeming resolution during this period however senate action on the regular appropriations acts for fy2005 was subject to ceiling of 814 billion on total appropriations for that year included in the prior years budget resolution which remained in effect the 814 billion ceiling for fy2005 presented the senate with two problems first the conference agreement on the fy2005 budget resolution revised the recommended level of appropriations for that fiscal year upward by 7 billion to new total of 821 billion in order for the senate to consider regular appropriations 33 see crs report rs21519 legislative procedures for adjusting the public debt limit brief overview by robert keith and bill heniff jr crs15 acts for fy2005 at level comparable to house action the 7 billion difference would have to be accommodated through procedure such as designating an equivalent amount of appropriations to be emergency spending course of action that was considered less desirable second the 814 billion ceiling applied to total appropriations only it did not provide basis for the enforcement of spending levels during the consideration of individual acts unless all 13 of the individual acts were packaged together into single omnibus act on july 22 2004 the senate resolved these problems by adopting the conference report on hr 4613 the defense appropriations act for fy2005 president bush signed the measure into law on august 5 2004 as pl 108287 section 14007 118 stat 1014 of the act which took effect upon enactment established the revised level of 821 billion as the allocation of new budget authority to the senate appropriations committee for purposes of section 302a of the 1974 act and repealed the outdated limit of 814 billion in the prior years budget resolution in 2005 the house took additional actions pertaining to budget enforcement for fy2005 on the opening day of the 109th congress january 4 2005 the house adopted hres 5 measure setting forth its standing rules separate orders pertaining to the budget process and other matters were set forth in section 3 of the resolution34 section 3a4 made the conference report on the fy2005 budget resolution sconres 95 adopted by the house on may 19 2004 but not considered by the senate effective for purposes of budget enforcement in 2005 pending adoption of fy2005 budget resolution the houses deeming resolution also provided for the continuation into the new congress of the section 302a allocations for fy2005 as made and adjusted in the prior session actions for fy2007 house and senate actions on deeming resolutions for fy2007 were similar to the pattern that occurred two years earlier the senate budget committee initiated action on the budget resolution for fy2007 by reporting sconres 83 on march 10 2006 in lieu of written report to accompany the measure committee print was issued sprt 109057 march 2006 three weeks later the house budget committee reported its version of the fy2007 budget resolution hconres 376 hrept 109402 march 31 2006 the senate passed sconres 83 on march 16 and the house passed hconres 376 on may 18 unlike the case for fy2005 however the house and senate did not take any conference action on the fy2007 budget resolution once again the house included deeming resolution provisions in special rule on an annual appropriations act on may 18 2006 the house agreed to hres 818 hrept 109469 may 17 2006 special rule providing for the consideration of hr 5386 the interior

rules changes affecting the congressional budget process in the 109th congress hres 5 by bill heniff jr crs16 policies embodied in the fy2007 budget resolution hconres 376 as adopted by the house as well as the procedures under title iii of the 1974 congressional budget act used to enforce them in addition section 2 barred the automatic engrossment of measure raising the debt limit by the amount recommended in the budget resolution an action otherwise required under house rule xxvii whenever budget resolution is finally agreed to by the house and senate congress and the president increased the debt limit in 2006 under regular legislative procedures pl 109182 march 20 2006 several weeks following house action on the deeming resolution provision the senate addressed the matter as well as had been the case two years earlier senate action on the regular appropriations acts for fy2007 was subject to cap established in the budget resolution for the prior year that was judged to be too tight the fy2007 budget resolution passed by the senate as well as by the house reflected cap on appropriations for the fiscal year of 873 billion but the cap for that fiscal year established in the fy2006 budget resolution was 7 billion lower at 866 billion this situation raised the same problems that the senate faced in 2004 on june 15 2006 the senate resolved the matter by adopting the conference report on hr 4939 the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and hurricane recovery for fy2006 president bush signed the measure into law the same day as pl 109234 section 7035 120 stat 489490 of the act which took effect upon enactment established the revised level of 873 billion as the allocation of new budget authority to the senate appropriations committee for purposes of section 302a of the 1974 act and made the outdated limit of 866 billion in the prior years budget resolution inapplicable further the 873 billion cap was made subject to provisions in the senatepassed budget resolution pertaining to limitations and adjustments applicable to emergency spending the following year in 2007 the house took additional actions pertaining to budget enforcement for fy2007 during the first two days of the 110th congress january 4 and 5 the house adopted hres 6 measure setting forth its standing rules separate votes were taken on each title of the measure rather than single vote on adoption of the measure in its entirety the first two titles were agreed to on january 4 and the remaining three titles were agreed to on january 5 title v which dealt with various special orders and miscellaneous matters was agreed to by vote of 232200 special orders pertaining to the budget process and other matters were set forth in section 511 of the resolution35 section 511a4a made the provisions of the fy2007 budget resolution adopted in the preceding year hconres 376 effective for purposes of budget enforcement in 2007 pending adoption of fy2008 budget resolution 35 for more information on this topic see crs report rl34149 house rules changes affecting the congressional budget process made at the beginning of the 110th congress by bill heniff jr crs17 in addition section 511a4b of hres 6 directed the chairman of the house budget committee when elected to have the committee spending allocations and other budgetary information printed in the congressional record on february 6 2007 representative john spratt the chairman of the house budget committee submitted the information required by hres 636 the house and senate reached final agreement on the fy2008 budget resolution sconres 21 on may 17 200737 in addition to recommending spending levels for fy2008fy2012 the measure revised the spending levels for fy2007 in the house the revised spending levels for fy2007 effectively superseded the levels established in the deeming resolution automatically because the deeming resolution was in effect only until the fy2008 budget resolution was adopted in the senate however affirmative action had to be taken to terminate the deeming resolution thereby avoiding any conflict with the newly revised spending levels accordingly section 208 of the fy2008 budget resolution stated that section 7035 of public law 109234 shall longer apply in the senate waivers of section 303 of the 1974 congressional budget act the tardy adoption of budget resolution or the failure to adopt it at all leads to another enforcement problem but one that involves timing issues rather than substantive enforcement under section 303a of the 1974 congressional budget act the house and senate generally may not consider spending or revenue legislation for fiscal year until the budget resolution for that fiscal year has been adopted the section poses less of problem for the house than it does for the senate first section 303b provides an exception in the house for general appropriations bills considered after may 15 but this exception does not apply in the senate second the house may include waivers of the section 303a point of order in special rules governing the consideration of individual measures section 303c also bars the consideration of appropriations measures in the senate until the spending allocation to the senate appropriations committee required by section 302a has been made unlike many other points of order under the 1974 act waivers of section 303a only require simple majority vote in the senate over the years the senate has waived section 303a dozens of times for various types of budgetary legislation in many years however the senate has chosen not to waive section 303a with respect to the consideration of regular appropriations bills instead the senate appropriations committee in these instances 36 see the remarks of rep john spratt in the congressional record of february 6 2007 at p h1234 37 see concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008 conference report to accompany sconres 21 hrept 110153 may 16 2007 crs18 generally delayed action on its bills until after the budget resolution had been adopted data collected from the 94th100th congresses show that with respect to regular appropriations bills section 303a waivers were granted in only 13 cases38 as follows fy1984 for three bills considered in june 1983 the fy1984 budget resolution was adopted on june 23 fy1985 for eight bills considered juneseptember 1984 the fy1985 budget resolution was adopted on october 1 and fy1986 for two bills considered in julyaugust 1985 the fy1986 budget resolution was adopted on august 1 in most of these 13 cases the waiver was obtained under successful motion directed specifically to waiving section 303a in several other instances the waiver was obtained under unanimous consent request the use of the waiver motions or unanimous consent requests in these cases attested to the consensus regarding the need to consider the regular appropriations bills after all such motions are subject to extended debate and any senator can raise an objection to unanimous consent request an extended debate on motion and an objection to unanimous consent request occurred only once both occurred in august 1984 in connection with the agriculture appropriations bill for fy1985 the extended debate on the waiver motion began on august 1 and was brought to close on august 8 when the senate voted 6834 to invoke cloture the subsequent vote to approve the waiver motion 6334 was the only rollcall vote taken on such motions the others were approved by voice vote in more recent years the budget resolution has been adopted in fairly timely manner during the period covering the 102nd congress through the 110th congress of the 14 budget resolutions that were adopted 10 were adopted in april or may the remaining four were adopted in june in addition in recent years the senate sometimes has deferred the initial consideration of some of the regular appropriations bills until late in the session due to political difficulties or even abandoned the consideration of individual appropriations bills in favor of consolidated appropriations measures accordingly in the 14 years during this period that budget resolutions were adopted the senate appropriations committee was able to avoid the need for waivers of section 303a during the four years in which the house and senate failed to agree on budget resolution regular appropriations bills generally were taken up by unanimous consent without any efforts to raise points of order under section 303a 38 see the following archived reports which are available from the author 1 crs report 8937 senate consideration of regular appropriations bills under waivers of section 303a of the 1974 budget
