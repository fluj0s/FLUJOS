programing cases part 1 lecture given on 29 may 1963 all right this is what the 29th twentynine may ad 13 saint hill special briefing course this is lecture on programing casesa subject that you dont know anything about never heard of before oddly enough its the least understoodyouve heard of it but its the least understood activity in dianetics or scientology the antiquity of this subject is as antique as the discovery of the engram because theres hardly any time at all intervened between the original discovery of the engram and the discovery of the mechanism of basic so these are hand in glove but because nobodys called it something different nobody really separates it out or pays enough attention to it programing is the overall action taken to resolve the case regulated by the state of the case and the necessary steps possibly not very neat definitioni could get you neater one and probably will let expand it little bit more guy has stubbed toe youre going to give him an assist you give him assist you get those steps now he has stubbed toe youre going to give him an assist you give him an assist you got that all right the stubbed toe is what youre directing the auditing toward in order to release it or benefit the case the fact that you said im going to give him an assist is the totality of programing see all of the steps of programing are inherent in that one little statement im going to give him an assist and then you give him an assist and that is auditing and you must separate programing out from auditing and if you dont understand these as separate subjects youre going to lay some ostrich eggs and its very hard to support ostriches now what goes into this statement im going to give him an assist how much adjudication goes into it well one of the first adjudications is time time you only got half an hour to audit him see your next adjudication is what will he stand for that is what will the case accept as auditing your next is what will the case progress on as auditing in other words what auditing will make this case progress your next one is is your order of actions and it comes back again to timewhen are you going to start the auditing now programing could be relegated to this dismal cutback i start my sessions at two and end them at four now i have programed the case well youd be amazed how often that is the totality of programing just time alone thats all ive only got half an hour to audit him so i will see totality of programing time limits it so that you cant do very much so thats the monitoring factor in programing and so on well all this is all very well but before youre going to make any clears you have to have very good grip on programing and theres lot to this business of programing its all right to have technique that will make clear if you dont program it it wont make clear people can walk up the front steps of central organizations all be run on the exact technology if programing is omitted for each case youre going to get yourself 60 70 80 percent and youre going to lose 20 30 percent of the cases on gains simple this is simple fact this is one of these idiot factsi mean everybody knows there is such thing as pavement so you walk on the pavement because its an everybody knows the next thing you know theres pavement and youre not walking on anything you see it has to be put there the programing has to be put there and one of the primary jobs of director of processing is programing not yakking with the auditor on what technique is going to be used now the funny part of it is it tends to stay on automatic because i know this subject so well handle its factors so rapidly that ive never bothered to put sidewalk there for you where you dont know of it its one of these things thats very easy to do you too will find it easy to do but unless you know its there to do you wont do it and therefore you will miss on lot of cases and youll say well technique xz 77hup doesnt work why well we ran it on eighteen cases and it only fixed up about fourteen of them and thats not good enough and so forth but was it programed theres the question to ask was it programed for the case it was being run on now thats very important this is something on the order of saying aircraft aircraft were going to fly aircraft and so forth and we just take for granted forever that theres sky so we dont bother to learn anything about the sky sooner or later we get into space opera and we find out weve run into the limitations of that and hohoholy cats now wed sure better know about the sky see weve got to know lot about the sky now orville and wilbur fresh out of the last space opera society they were with and anxious to get up in the air againhaving been well restimulated by theta traps which has the basic symbol an airplane oh you didnt know that i thought that was interesting see an airplane carries the symbolic message that thetan needs mass to rise which is lot of well its so the airplane becomes symbol of gravity having to bear on thetan do you ever notice how fly boys tend to put on mass when they get up around their thirties and so forth its quite an interesting fact but its just that the airplane is symbol of theta traps all right so they fly around in the sky and they go out and they make flight of hundred yards or something like that and its all up in the air and they dont crash when they landed and they must come down in place which is not lower than the place they took off from in other words they made flight and believe they sure took the sky for granted and boys have been going on now taking the sky for granted and so forth and they justit got this farthey program to this degree its raining and cloudy so we wont fly get that as world war i programing for flight idiocy see all right they get up to world war ii why theyre flying above the weather and theyre doing all sorts of interesting things so they have to have prediction of what the weather is going to be taking off and landing in rain didnt bother them so much anymore but targets and that sort of thingthey got more and more involved in what they laughingly call meteorology here on this planet the prediction of tomorrows weather bureau mistakes actually this whole subject is not in its infancy it hasnt been born yet on this planet i can take look at my desk barometer any day of the week and get better weather forecast than i get over the telephone theim being hard on the boys every year they get little bit better theyre finding the sky too and then all of sudden we get into passenger traffic left and right across the atlantic and we hear abovetheweather flight radarspotted weather you see and so on theyre still finding clouds they havent found the sky yet see then they shot off few cosmonauts who became naught in russia with great rapidity and they found great deal there called the sky and five dead cosmonauts later the russians must have decided that they should know something about it but because they had lots of cosmonauts they probably havent bothered but the point is they send people up into the van allen beltnamed after van allen who the hell heard of him andi dont know maybe he was the fellow who invented radiation fallout or something in other words they shoot people up into these areas and they get scorched or something happens or something of that sort and theyre in the big vagueness of there is sky theyre still on this thing here see in other words theyre just gradually one by one as they run into this getting aware of the fact that theres something out there called sky and theres lot to know about it and actually they havent even got the sevenyearoldchilds version of crime detection textbooks you know or something like that its just from nowhere yet its tremendous amount of technology yet they might know how to fly airplanes see they might do pretty good job these cosmonauts or astronautsyou notice all of them are getting slackjawed you know from this spinning around watch the pictures of them they spin them around in circles until they get slackjawed how do you become space jockey well you spin guy enough in wide circle to accustom him to being slackjawed as near as i can figure out what man was about there everybody knows hell get terribly sick unless you make him sick you see theyre well up on this kind of thing and they can fly these little capsules and jet planes and guided missiles are beginning to land here and there and so forth so they probably think theyre pretty sharp but what sky are they flying in what about this sky and thats just about the same relationship that auditing has with programing you can fly the pc through most anything see but is there any sky and if you dont know theres none there youre going to have an awful time and perfectly simple case is just going to go bzzt in your hands because it isnt programed and you can take this bird hes sitting right there you can get almost anything to fire you can get almost anything to run and at the end of fifty hours of auditing youve got pile of junk on your hands something went wrong what went wrong you did all of your auditing perfectly you did it exactly the way you were supposed to be taught and yet the pc crashed why programing programing its fine art its based on rather fantastic principles and it isnt any guesswork its based on some of the oldest auditing principles we have and the most neglected its very doubtful if there are very many auditors present who know these data and yet theyre some of the most aged data we have itssome of this data is onward to sixteen years old pretty creaky but these are the criteria yes you say ive run into that in book one and ive run into it here and so forth but you havent run into it as huge beacon in the middle of the sky youve run into it as little fact you might trip across and thats this the behavior of the time track and the disabilities of pcs in relationship thereto and the abilities of pcs in relationship to the time track and that is what forms the bulk of programing its just contained in those little data right there what is the time track well theres long bulletin on this subject mostive spoken to you about it recently actually its lineal 3d record of all the activities of thetan potentially in 3d full color with fiftytwo perceptions its long movie and as the film goes through some of it you could call an engram and some of it you could call lock and some of it you could call secondary and some of it you could call this but its all the same movie but some of these incidents are more powerful than others and some of them have capability of destroying the movie or appearing to destroy the movie so that you pick up reel sixteen and apparently the next consecutive picture is reel eighty what the hell goes on between reel sixteen and reel eighty this is way to conduct an entertainment everything missing between those two points and yet with improper programing you will never find sixteen to eighty you go ahead and audit with great industry reel eighty reel sixteen wheres the rest of it well just ignore that and dont undertake any programing that will arrive at that heyour pcsomehow or another hes getting lots of auditing but nothing is happening to his case because the programing is missing why is itwhy this tremendous effect well actually whats wrong with him is between reel sixteen and reel eighty and youre assiduously auditing let us say reel eighty to reel one hundred and you only audit reel eighty to reel one hundred quite interesting well the word programing is something you should remember because time track can be likened to very long motionpicture show so therefore theres nothing better than calling it programing but how do you get this thing exhibited now if it was just piece of film that you put in projector and ran through and you only had to patch it up occasionally youd be in clover but that isnt the kind of film it is this film can have total effect on the pc he lives this movie when somebody gets shot in the picture he feels the bullet well this is really very fantastically personal sort of motion picture that youre running theres nothing impersonal about it unless the pc is halfway around the bend and then he can be so detached you see that it doesnt have any effect on him he doesnt get well either in fact it goes so far as you can only run those portions of this motion picture which are totally personal to the pc and the moment you start to run things which are too impersonal to the pc you have hard time of it and thats what is knownyou run the pc at his reality well youd be surprised how far you can exceed the pcs reality and get something run you grab helatrobus implant and start running itglugh hes got reality hes lived but once see here he is living but once huhha every life he kicks the bucket and lives but once again and blind as bat on the subject of what hes done yesterday and cant do tomorrow and oh hes having hell of time you see here he goes and sometimes pc absolutely gets down and pounds the desk see hes so infuriated at your terrible doctrine that people have lived before and something scientologists believe you know that sort of thing you could take this character and throw him into the middle of helatrobus implant start running the implant some time later however fast you run the ris he suddenly looks up and says ive got news for you this didnt happen this lifetime and it happened to and thats whats so interesting about the helatrobus implantsthe personalness of them so your program is not monitoredthis is the other mistake you can makethe program is not monitored on what the pc has reality on before you audit the pc but is monitored by what the pc can obtain reality on during auditing and thats what we call the reality factor of programing what can you run on him that he can obtain reality on during auditing not what is real to this lunkthis guy you know hes been going around saying well everybody is machine and if i dont implant this pc in present time then he wont be able to run back to early incidents you see because hell have impulse to do so in other words you omit the volitional factor you omit the factor of change in the pc see you say the pc cant change the pc cant assume new viewpoint and the pc has very little volition in which to assume new viewpoint and so forth well if you neglect all of those thingsthen you would only run what the college faculties on this planet at the moment would permit see i know what they would permit they would permit the student life of the student body to be audited see thats all they would only permit to be audited on the pc that which they themselves fully and thoroughly agreed to be reality so never fall for that trap in programing you want to audit in the direction that the pc can obtain reality but you always want new reality on the part of the pc not the reality the pc has well it does you good actually to say well the pc has very good reality on this carpet so therefore we will audit him on this carpet for the next four or five intensives you see thats idiocy lets audit the pcwell lets just make forward program on this lets audit the pc up to being able to have reality on the composition of mest into carpets ah well that would be different trick wouldnt it oh just look at the number of complexities youd have to run into to get total reality on carpet and you probably could devote four or five intensives to it see now we dont then take off with the pcs reality as an accomplished fact this isyesterdays mental sciences made this mistake all the time all the time in their programing made this mistake continuously and they shouldnt have made this mistake they audited or processed or treated from the viewpoint of their own immediate reality and on other viewpoint and therefore came to the conclusion nobody could change its something like tying horse up and tying every hoof to the ground and then announcing to one and all that horses wont run and stand there and beat the horse and the horse doesnt run and you say you see it proves itself the horse cant run youve audited the pc then only and totally from the platform of the pcs current or extant reality and have not permitted the pc to exceed that in any way bum programing absolutely backwards now lot of remarks could be made along in this particular direction and mistakes that could be made in programing but it is not quite as esoteric even yet as you might think it is much more concise and much more scientific programing is based one hundred percent upon these exact things the capability of the auditor that is number one not number two the capability of the pc to receive auditing the amount of time available in the auditing and the maximum result to be obtainedgiven those upper factors that i just gave youthe maximum result to be thereby attained thats programing in other words it takes into effect what can be accomplished and you can add one more line to that end one that you put down increase of r and c in other words thats the maximum result that can be obtained is always measured in increase of r and c not just in the increase of arc increase of increase of r and increase of c thats different isnt it see weve gotten so portmanteau with arc we forget that its highly technical action in other words given those earlier factors that i gave you therethe capability of the auditor the capability of the pc and the amount of time availablewe can then determine the last factor which will be an increase of affinity now what the hell is an increase of affinity well theres the gno know to mystery scale and the wusser worse somebody is off the lower he is on the scale the whole tone scale is part of the know to mystery scale thats why i use the know to mystery scale rather than say tone scale the whole middle guts where it says emotion and so forth and so forth thats actually your forty tones in there and it goes below those see this you should know about the tone scale that person has personal reality but may have an intellectual reality on those tones above his position he has reality only on those tones below his position thatshis tone is known as chronic tone now there can be chronic tone as body plus thetan or there can be chronic tone as thetan and chronic tone of body plus thetan can be apparently at enthusiasm whereas tone of thetan is at unconsciousness and is off the tone scale do you get these data this is not brandnew data but its quite interesting because im punching it up to you hard this is not just nonsense data that its nice to know this is the breath of life when it comes to programing any level above the chronic tone is susceptible of being dramatized dramatization is thetan or thetan plus body performing evolutions not under the thetan or thetan plus bodys control nonvolitional action older mental studies so concentrated on nonvolitional actions they thought there was nothing else but nonvolitional actions so you just have to omit those particular studies because there are volitional actions and they lie below the chronic tone of the individual on the tone scale now youve got the volitional actions then of body plus thetansee chronic tone of body plus thetan and then youve got another position which is the chronic tone of the thetan which is lower than that of the body plus thetan so that tells you very often that you have to process the body plus thetan like mad to finally bring the thetan off the launching pad and they dramatizethe body plus thetan is susceptible of dramatizing any level above the chronic tone but is most susceptible to the halftone above that goes in harmonics as you go on up awe have just covered see thats affinity of the r and c in that last one what do you mean then by increasing the affinity well you mean definitely raising the person so that he is less susceptible to dramatization and has reality on more tone levels below him see if you raise him up one tone level then youve added one more level on which he has reality and youve subtracted one level that he may dramatize see so hell dramatize one tone level less and hell have reality on one tone level more you get the idea hes just gone up one slot on the ladder so therefore youve put another rung under him he wont dramatize the rung where he is and previously he was the effect of this rung now are you processing body plus thetan all right if youre processing body plus thetan then this gain is on the old finite scale that only goes up to about four body plus thetans never cycle above four thats apparent tone apparent tone that means that someday youre going to get an awful surprise youre going to have this boy really flying man just flying his affinity is way up there at four see affinity right up there at four enthusiasm everythings fine rah rah you know get the show on the road bang and all of sudden he comes down and he crashesapparently crashesand drags himself into session man trrrah tone arm hasnt even gone up nothing happened between sessions had good sleep last night and yet you can practically see the degradation dripping off of him degradation is kind of oily and greasy and you can practically see it drip off of him and he may go along like this for little while and then he may realize or you may realizehell get eventually reality on ityouve processed thetan up to degradation and maybe there were some intervening levels but he didnt notice and you didnt notice you processed him from unconsciousness to degradation only degradation is so spectacular that somebody noticed youre now processing thetan youre longer processing body plus thetan theres where he takes off if youre eventually going to go in for route one how far up that scale does he have to go to perform route one well he has to go as far up that scale as the chronic tone of the thetan has to go up that scale you see that so there is your portmanteau picture just an offhand sort of picture of an increase or gain of case as you call itcase gain in terms of affinity thats case gain so given those earlier three factors i gave you why youve got him up along as best you could there to that but you did not achieve case gain unless you did something with got it body plus thetan had to come up in tone or thetan had to appear or something had to happen here dont you see thats case gain thats real case gain rreality well everything was pretty unreal to this fellow what do we mean unreal oh well thats nice wonderful wordunreal thats just dirty word undefined and unclassified in any way its just dirty word you know you can measure the reality of person so fast itd make your head swim there is matter energy space time and significance those are the five elements which really compose universe and you can always use significance as measure even though you havent affected the matter energy space and time you can tell thei mean you havent observed them as changingyou can tell an observation of the significance this person when you start to process him cannot understand his life and conversation is full of cannot understand see he cannot assume any viewpoint but his own and his own is nonextant heseasily gets very reasonable about the most unreasonable things you can test somebodys reality rather easily simply in solution of problems all of psychological testing is directed whether they know it or not in the direction of observation of significance the realities of significance and they measure their changes that way its at that little bridge point where these two subjects collide that we can thereon use this because it is measure of the significance youll find out this fellow is capable of understanding little more now this is measured sometimes in terms of appearing overts his overts will appear hell realize that certain things he did were overts well why is this well thats because his understanding has increased he is more capable of taking the other fellows viewpoint and taking the other fellows viewpoint he realizes his overts can now knock his own block off see and therefore one of the symptoms of this is fellow begins to suffer an increase of realitythe fellow begins to suffer from his overts he suddenly realizes that something he never thought was so bad before was not quite so good you know thats big gain see thats bigthats reality gain get the idea so you know he had reality increase because he can understand more and the mechanism of understanding more of course puts him into the line of being more responsible and hes got different view of things and hell cognite on this and that now cognition is actually the process of changing reality of significance and that is what cognition is and why cognition is so necessary to case gain you yourself know by experience that that pc that doesnt cognite doesnt make case gain well whywhats the cognition you think its properly quantity of cognitions it isnt quantity of cognitions at all it isnt that hes simply giving you dress parade of significant reality changes seethe reality of significance i never realized before say what do you say uhhuh you know well ill give you an example i had one blacklast night i said you know the reason black mass affects thetan is because hes never taken responsibility for creating it what thetan would ever want to create black mass see i was trying to get rid of some black mass and i suddenly take look at it and it sort of faded away with that see but from such an observationalthough that seems to be veryactually is more fundamental observation than just cognition because ive been trying to get at what the hell black mass is for long time as technical fact but the auditor could have said at that point i have just made case gain see now you put down the goals and gains of the pc at the end of session did you ever look on it that you were doing sort of psychometric test at that moment its all contained in the significance of reality and the pcs few cognitions hes had in the session thats fine but he himself understands something more or sees something more or sees that he might or the future may be oryou know something thats measured your case gain for you you see what that is so you dont have to say he can see mest better the room all looks brilliantly bright to him so he has had case gain see you dont have to look at it like that as matter of fact i had people turn brilliantly bright to one time i was over in new york in 1950 i was doing quite bit of research and i hadnt been getting any sleep to amount to anything and it didnt have any great importance to it but i stepped off bus and all of sudden people went bright as could be they got awfully solid and awfully bright well an auditor if hed been using that to measure whether or not there was case gain in progress would have made hell of mistake what i had had happen was keyin of the helatrobus implants it was the action of getting off the bus and for moment everybody looked terribly brighti didnt like it and it went away in the next few minutes you get the idea though that wasnt case gain and that therefore isnt what we mean by reality that will come in due coursethe ability to mock things up and that sort of thingbut now youre talking about highscale thetan abilities and those are pretty obvious youre going to get most of your reality changes on pc at the level youre operating in are going to be at the level of significance and are going to turn out as case gains or cognitions and dont expect the pc to say i have had wonderful session and expect that to be case gain because it is notthe pc might have been audited down to propitiation but the pc all of sudden says you know i think my mother must have had hard time ahh ahh not because he realizes he is now guilty or something of the sort but because he is now little more capable of assuming the viewpoint of his mother and you say hey you know weve made quite gain in this session here quite gain right there see now lets take up c thats pretty obvious the pc wont talk to you at the beginning of session will talk to you at the end of session i mean thats so obvious that you almost specialize in it pc will talk to people pc will communicate better and theres where you get your solid walls actually it doesnt belong under reality it belongs in communication hes more willing to communicate so he can see better its not that he finds reality more palatable that he can see better its just simply his communication is better sight sound touchall of these various things one right after the other are phenomena of communication see the phenomena of reach and withdraw its the reach and withdraw of the light particle its the reach and withdraw of this and that its the ability and willingness to receive all of this sort of thing adds up into this factor of communication see reality can be reality even if you cant see it i think youve got pretty good idea right now that saint pauls is pretty solid hm therefore you can conceive of the reality of saint paulssee that its solid all right thats fine that isnt case gain well why isnt it case gain well you just conceived of the reality of saint pauls and saint pauls is solid andbut if you could see saint paul right now or if you got mockup of saint pauls or if you could just look at saint pauls right now or see saint pauls right now and see how solid it was and feel how solid it was thats communication gain see that now that can be fantastic thing youre taking off perhaps with totally delusory case he thinks the room is full of polar bears well at the end of session can he see them better have they cleaned up any im afraid that would be case gain but if youre operating from the platform of reality that the room is not full of polar bears circa freud you see so therefore you must get rid of the polar bears out of the room you of course have dropped his communication he cant communicate with you but he can communicate with these polar bears now if he could communicate with the polar bears well enough he wouldnt have to communicate with the polar bears and theyd depart thats the way to get rid of polar bears its horrible some psychiatrist picking bugs off of some patient on the basis that the patient doesnt have any bugs and therefore before hes got the bugs he must get rid of the bugs see thats operating from the platform of reality of there must only be this reality and unless we can hold the status quo of this reality we have not won in processing and i stress thatnot because its funny or that i want to clobber our poor sick brothersbecause it has been the criteria in all mental activities for the many trillennia and an auditor may be holding on to it with both fists and not realize it see that our only gain would be from the platform of where we are see if we can continue the alteration to making things more like they are here now then were getting case gains im sure thats the wonderful way to clobber people see because then one of the things youre doing is holding him on the time track now i am afraid the other side of where youre going and the other side of the coin lies through lot of hell and lot of dark canyons its whether or not the pc can get reality and can get reality enough on those dark canyons in order to get through them in other words whether his communication factor rises sufficiently to go through can he communicate with these things well it requires quite bit of him so theres your communication factor all contained in that fourth one that i just gave you now thats long and lugubrious and this is long and difficult subject programing its not something that you could wind up but theres what youre trying to achieve by programing and if i just tell you well program everything you know and then not give you anything youre trying to achieve in programing why itd be almost as bad as barking and condemning at you you see left and right for not doing something youre not told what it is see heres what youre trying to achieve youre trying to achieve case gain therefore ive gone at long length to tell you whats case gain how do you achieve that gain well the technical facts that have existed over these long and many years are very few you can almost put them in thimble theyre outside of the technology of auditing and therefore get forgotten overlooked because they belong in the subject of programing and that is these hard fast technical data and they are unburdening basics and disentangling basics and its in those actions that programing is done unburdening now ill amplify it little bit discovery of basics and eradication of the basic by discovering what basics can be found before basic that disentangled the basic youre trying to untangle ah i thought youd wake up basic on chain contains in it elements which are not basic to the basic youve got the basic engram that gives you the absolute basis of all laryngitis or fdaosis or something id better be careful to use healing things because they dont want by the way you know were going to have to have the fda arrested do you know why theyre the only people in the united states that are claiming that an emeter can heal and cure things and they mustnt maintain those things you see its criminal offense so were going to have to have them arrested since they are the only ones maintaining it poor old fda remember to whisper little prayer as youthat they all go to heaven at the time now youre running this basic and you run it as an engram it is basic on the chain that youre running lets say its automobile accidents and goddamn its got an elephant in it well it is the basic on the chain for automobile accidents and will release and everything in it will release except this confounded elephant so what are you going to do run this engram and leave an elephant sitting there saying well thats not part of the basic boy so we cant have anything to do with that you just go on and live with this elephant is that what youre going to do your pcs going to arc break why because when you found the elephant you found more basic chain not on automobile accidents but on elephants so youre running the engram through quite happily and then you run into an elephantyouve got to slip this elephants basic that could be done rather readily you can do it almost with dating you can find the first elephant and the amazing part of it is is the elephant will disappear out of the basic that youre running youve gotten rid of him hes gone do you understand the actual operation of running basics is not the same operation as running any other engram you run basic by finding everything basic to the basic and by the time youve got through youve practically cleared somebody unless youve got him so tangled up and lost your place in the book but you take basic apart in terms of basics if you really want to take it apart oh yes its basic on the chain of automobile accidents yes thats fine but it happens to have wife in it and an elephant and motorcycle now its less complicated than it looks because its also got pavement in it and its got emotion in it and its got suppresses in it and its got everything else and if you went ne plus ultra ad absurdum on the whole thing youd find basic for everything that was contained in the engram but even if you did and even if you found the basic for each one of those basics it would blow up it isnt that you can go too far its just simply that you can sometimes become too ridiculous by the time youve found basic on motorcycles and basic on wife and basic on an elephant this thing has went run what engram see its too init as basic will blow if the basics are blown of it do you understand because basic will almost blow by inspection unless its held down by an earlier basic but an earlier basic on what on something contained in the basic oh yes you can get the basic theta trap but its got particles of energy in it and the pc goes nattering about these particles of energy you havent got basics on particles of energy well you go bzzzz bzzzz clip tip pow pow the pcs very interested in it is your test of whether or not youd handle it and you go sloop doop bang basics on particles of energy oh yeah heres big overt in glare fight and i go brzzzz maw glu good god yeah what do you know about that well how terrible yeah well thats it and so forth yeah well all right and you say okay now lets go back and run some more of that basic and by the way he isnt bothered this time by the particles of energy thats gone in other words you slipped the basics out of the basic and this takes some very slippy engram running very interesting if you can keep track of it you are very successful if you cant why the whole track collapses and the pc goes mad but thats all right because youve still got another action now the first action that you should undertake on case is the most advanced actionthis is in programingis the most advanced action which can be undertaken in your estimation in other words always enter case more boldly than you think is absolutely necessary and you will nearly always be right just enter case more boldly than you think is wise got that otherwise if you dont maintain that point of view you will never find the ceiling at which the pc can operate because youll go at it at such graduals and your underestimations will cost so much time because going at it more boldly if you get away with it youre just fine if you get away with it youre way into it now man and youre all set and youre doing that with the helatrobus implants guy can run an implant hmmm go man go the pc falls on his head and cant manage it and so forth pull back run some implants later and that doesnt even really depend on whether or not the pc could run the implant itsremember its regulated by these other things could the auditor run the implant see and that sort of thing its just those little factors i gave you there on programing are all relative to this but always go in little more boldly give the auditor little more process than you think he can handle if you have to always run the case just little steeper than you think is absolutely wise and youll head for more gains faster see you can always pull back today you dont sacrifice case the case isnt ruined forever now these technical factsill go over them againare simply unburdening and running basics and taking basics apart now you could say unburdening finding chainand youd probably be more subtle about this more orderlyunburdening finding the chain you want finding the first basic of that chain and then slipping the first basic to pieces by finding some basics for that basic you understand now thats programing i dont care what case youre handling or if youre using cchs youre still on that program now its what part of that program can you enter now let be little more concise although i will give you full lecture on it tomorrow what part of that can you skimp and what can you press home on how many corners can you turn sharplyall within the reality of the factors of the auditor the pc and the arc gains the pc makes you got it but actually dont think there is more to auditing than unburdening finding chain finding the basic on the chain and taking apart basic because there is more to auditing than that i dont care what process youre using patacakefamous process used to be run in the foundation by people who couldnt audit sitting there having conversation with the pc being very carefuleverybody being very careful not to go anywhere near an engram its old name they used to give it was patacake all right they stillthey still have some programing their program is not to unburden because its too dangerous they didnt even think about going to engrams see they just wouldnt even unburden because theres telling what you might find underneath that rock see dont pick up any rocks man thats dangerous now what does it essentially consist of it essentially consists of taking off charge and the reason i gave you the first time unburdening finding basic and so forth because ordinarily you run back chain and run enough off chainrun enough off of it so that you can get earlier on it so that you can run enough off of it so that you can get earlier on it so that you could lay your paws on the basic and if the basic is too pistol hot and the pc cant sit there well just indicate that youre going to take care of this shortly and then you go forward from basic very rai mean go later than basic see very rapidly and you strip the charge off after basic now let give you an idea you find the first gpm implantheres programing to find the first implantthats your goal seeand to strip it down and knock it out thats what youre trying to do find the first gpm i dont care what else you think youre trying to do thats what youre trying to do and you get landed with pc that cantyou cant get single ri or goal to fire on of any kind whatsoever what do you do well you have to makethe fact that he might not have the helatrobus implants according to the estimation of how goosey he is as case you know can you remember yesterday what did you have for breakfast this morning oh that makes you nervous well hes got the helatrobus implants you get it not that he was nervous gave him the helatrobus implants but this guy has just got such heavily burdened case that hes just too goosey to go anywhere near anything dynamitey like that see so you see you have to unburden this to get to the implants well how long do you unburden well you unburden until you can get your hands on an implant and not one second longer and as soon as you get your hands on an implant we dont care if its the last one you run it how thoroughly do you run it well you run it thoroughly enough to blow charge of it off at least one dial wide disintegrating rr per item and that is the absolute minimum that you can run one you cant run one of those items less than that but you can sometimes run one unfortunately more than that you can grind the rest of it off grinding out the engram well you havent got basic if you have to grind grind it isnt releasing and nothings releasing and you grind and you call items and urhrrr nothing happening and so forth and nothing rrs and the pc is awake thats necessary to the auditing what do you do well youve probably got too early an implant you say hey were trying to go early youre trying to unburden well lets pick up the last one in the second chain if we know what it is and lets run that one with fast pass or lets do something with some straightwire that gives him some locks or lets find overts on this thing dont you see lets see if we can chase him earlier and find the first contact thats all unburdening dont you see well lets run the three command process for while and see if we can dish this out and lay open some other things were just trying to get our hands on an implant why are we trying to get our hands on an implant so we can run some charge of it off so we can find an earlier implant why are we trying to get that implant so we can run some charge of it off and find some earlier implant why are we trying to run that implant so we can find basic well whats basic thats the first implant what do you do when you get your hands on it sometimes its so pistolhot you cant run it you have to come running later and run some charge off some of them later and then lay your hands on it again you sometimes have to go later than basic not earlier why youre asking pc to walk through wall of fire back to an area hes never been at before between basic and present time theres this wall of fire and youre saying well go on through and he says but i cant find anything in here and you say oh you idiot go on and so forth what are you going to do just spend the rest of session after session after session well knowing your pcs not getting any gains in arc trying to push him through this wall of fire why try to push him through the wall of fire its the wrong mission youre trying to get him through the wall of fire hoohoo how do you get him through the wall of fire well put some fire out of course how do you put some fire out well you justlets get back here where the heat can be felt and lets get some of that pawed off and then lets get him little closer and lets get some charge off little closer finally hes got living flame in his hands and says ho ho there it is there it goes theres another one and so forth and i wonder whats back there you know scorch and retreats and so forth and you just take little more fire off the track its all quantitative charge it isnt what the pc can confront its how much you can get discharged its mechanical fact and you get him back through the wall of fire and he finds the fifteenth goal and you think its the first one and so does he but then you get that discharged and youll get the fifteenth goal and you get that one out and then you get that discharged and then you can find the thirteenth and then you can find the tenth and then you can find the fifth and he knows hes got the first goal now becausenothing before it so you get that discharged discharge it ris and you move up and all of sudden you find yourself sitting there with the front goal and this is hotter than pistol and its got basics and you have to take everything out of it that is basic theres theta trap in it that doesnt belong in it well lets put it back on the track where it belongs see lets date it and smooth it up and lets clean this area out by taking off prior charge to the basic all of sudden the basic collapses and what do you see next oh you may have to run these implants but heh its something on the basis of bzzzzt well thats that one run get the idea powpowpowpowpowpowpowpowpowpow pow yes ive got that one its tearing up dont you see it cant stay there if the basic is still inis not in place basic cant stay there if it doesnt have certain basics holding it in placebasic elements not basic engrams but basic elements holding it in place basic cant stay there without those basic elements with those basic elements gone basic cant stay there if basic is gone the rest of the chain cant stay there youre walking track backwards that cant be walked backwards and thats why scientology is magic but its always done in programing which will accomplish those ends unburden find the chain youre looking for unburden that chain get the basic youre looking for and then run back the elements in that basic clip those basics out that will disappear and the whole thing blows clean and thats what youre trying to do youre not trying to run 8765 gpms because george has got that many youre running enough gpm to let the pc earlier and youyoull underestimate how much charge youve gotten off and you very often are wrong you have to discharge another gpm before you can move up earlier again and everything now is going creakthe pc can just barely make it barely hold his position and so forth thats good enough got it thats what youre trying to do those are technical facts that have to do with the track and they fit in with programing not with auditing because they tell you what you audit youve always been wondering what you audit you audit what you have to program and how do you program just like ive been telling you and youre going to find some casesput them down they go halfway into the bank you unburden four or five gpms in the middle of the bank you can move it earlier ho thats easy why didnt i go up here in the first place well of course you couldnt have take that one apart move little earlier thats easy thats easy find the first one bang thats out gone boom whats these helatrobus implants what are they making so much fuss about well thats just part of his communication and reality factors which i gave you in the first schedule of programing see how its done without programing you can do nothing thats the pill system programing thats the dream of every army in the world this fellow walks up puts out his hand they put pill in it fellow takes pillbrilliant trained fighter dream of every army in the world dream of every civilization that has ever existed let point something gruesome out to you those armies have all lost and those civilizations are longer here thank you
