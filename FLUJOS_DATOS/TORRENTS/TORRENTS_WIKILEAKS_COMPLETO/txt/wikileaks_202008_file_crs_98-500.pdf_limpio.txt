domestic social policy division july 15 2005 abstract the dietary supplement industry has long been concerned about international activities that could have potential impact on supplement trade as originally proposed fda reform legislation contained provisions on mutual agreements and global harmonization that would have applied to most products under fda jurisdiction however congress explicitly exempted supplements from the ﬁnal provisions of the food and drug administration modernization act of 1997 pl 105115 which means that these products are not part of ongoing trade discussions however the perception of supplement proponents at that time was that such harmonization eﬀorts would limit access and availability of supplement products and was harbinger of their reaction to other international supplement agreements ever since the european commission adopted directive on vitamin and mineral supplements in 2002 although in april 2005 the advocate general declared it invalid in july 2005 the european court judges ruled in favor of upholding the directive in july 2005 the united nations codex alimentarius commission voted to adopt the guidelines on the composition of certain vitamin and mineral supplements once adopted however codex guidelines are not binding on any country unless the provisions are incorporated into the laws of that country more

105th congress 1st session hrept 105399 added to the final act that specifically ex cluded dietary supplemen ts from consideration in mutual recognition agreements and global harmonization initiatives those activities are intended to facilitate trade through discussion and subsequent consensus among governments on agreements that approximate the laws of th participating countries such agreements generally require consen on the general standards and selected peripheral issues on the subject under disc ussion the fdama97 provisions as passed affect drugs medical devices and foods see crs report 98263 the final language in section 410 of fdama97 entitled mutual recognition agreements and global harmonization am ended the existing provisions on good manufacturing practice requirements to ensure that fda regulations conform to the extent possible with internationally recognized standards for defining quality systems for medical device production in addition the w directed the secretary of health and human services to support the office of the us trade representative in consultation with the secretary of commerce in harmoniza tion meetings with representatives of other countries the secretary wa s required to determine whet her such harmonization would continue consumer protection c onsistent with us law in addition the secretary was directed to support efforts toward the acceptance of mutual recogn ition agreements related to the regulation of drugs biological pr oducts devices foods food and color additives and good manufacturing practices between the european union eu and the united states and finally the secretary was further directed to participate regularly in meetings with representatives of fore ign governments to discuss and reach agreement on methods and approaches to harmonize regulatory requi rements fdama97 directed the secretary to publish plan that established framework for achieving mutual agreement on inspections for good manufacturing practices the supplement industrys concern bout the original fdama97 global harmonization provisions was based on its view that through participation in harmonization discussions the united states would be required to meet the perceived strict regulations for dietary supplements of the eu or its member countries however the conference committee compromise resulted in dietary supplements being expressly exempted from the requirements of the harm onization provisions the final language in section 410 states that the four provi sions on mutual agreements and global harmonization do not apply to products define d as dietary supplements in section 201ff of the dietary supplement health and ducation act of 1994 dshea pl 103417 enacted october 25 1994 the exemption of supplements from th harmonization provisions of fdama97 resulted at least in part from concerns rais ed by dietary supplement proponents that the legislation would somehow limit access to and availability of supplements in the united states the conference report provides explanation of the congressional intent regarding the mutual recognition agreements and global harmonization provisions or the explicit exemption of supplements1 there is evidence that restricting access and availability was ever intended generally the intent of the harmonization efforts is to facilitate trade nd eliminate nontariff trade ba rriers that otherwise can limit access to products in international trade however the perception that these harmonizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98500crs3 2 the european commission health and consumer

reasons by supplement proponents about the european commission directive the codex alimentarius commission guidelines and the potential actions of the world trade organization and central american free trade agreement discussed in the rest of this report the european commission in 2000 the european commission ec announced that it had adopted proposal for directive on food supplements setting out harmonized rules for th sale of vitamins and minerals as dietary supplements2 the initiative was driven by concerns about the need for informed consumer choice and safe ty the objectives were to set general framework and safety rules for vitamins and minerals in the european union and to provide consumers with tailed information through labeling on recommended daily consumption warnings on side effects from ex cessive use and statement that the pills are not substitute for varied diet under this directive health claims are prohibited and products packaged in way that rese mbles pharmaceutical product must carry the statement that this is not medicinal product the propos contained positive list of chemical substances authoriz ed for the production of vitamin s and minerals and was part of package of measures bein g considered on food safety the european parliament and council of ministers had to agree to this dir ective for it to be imple mented allowing the marketing of products complying with its pr ovisions as of june 2002 and prohibiting the marketing of products that do not respect its rules later than june 2004 the directive was adopted and took immediate effect on j une 10 2002 allowing the statements to appear on products as stated in the directiv and requiring them to appear by june 2004 on april 5 2005 the advocate general in an opinion to the european court of justice declared invalid the european unions directive on food supplements3 according to the opinion the directive lacked clearly defined rules and norms for the ec to decide whether food supplement should be allowed and lacked clearly defined system for companies to appeal bans or re quest approval of new products the case was brought by group of united kingdom suppl ement manufacturers and health food stores who believe that the directiv would ban the use of about 200 nutrients affecting up to 5000 products sold in the united kingdom wh ile the advocate generals opinion on the directive is not legally binding on the rest of the european court judges these opinions generally are followed by the full court in majority of final rulings however on july 12 2005

guidelines on vitamin and mineral s upplements in november 2004 the committee adopted the guidelines on vitamin and mineral supplements having finally resolved the outstanding issue on the method for setting safe upper levels for individual vitamins and minerals in supplement products5 the full commission voted to adopt the guidelines on july 4 2005 the codex document on guidelines for vitamins and minerals reflects the concern of number of governments about the current level of regulation of dietary supplements the document represents agreement of the si gnatory countries that these products should be regulated at some baseline level th codex document is not binding on any member country unless the guidelines are adopted into the laws of that country many member countries already have adopted regulatory standards for supplements in some cases rules of the member country are more stri ct than the codex guideline provisions completion of the codex guidelines document does not dictate the sale availability or content of supplements marketed in the united states unless its provisions are enacted into law by congress the document may serv as guide for othe r countries that do not yet have but wish to develop their own st andards for the regulation of these products within their own borders the adoption of the guidelines into law by other countries could affect the export of usproduced suppl ement products to those countries if us manufactured supplements do not meet the standards set by the regulations of those countries there seems to be percepti on among supplement advocates that other countries have regulations th at adversely affect us ma nufacturers who wish to export supplements to those countries impact on us manufactured supplements the codex alimentarius commission activities are separate from those harmonization efforts with the european union addressed in fdama97 however during the debate on fdama97 there was some confusion within the supplement industry bout the effect on codex activities of implementation of the new law the codex has 156 member nations including the ited states as alr eady stated the codex guidelines are not binding on any nation unless the guidelines are incorporated into the laws of that nation the european union is composed of 15 member nations of western europe eu directives are developed by and applicable only to its member nationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98500crs6 codex guidelines or eu directives might ffect us manufacturers in situations where their products were being expor ted to countries that eith er have adopted the codex guidelines or are eu members that apply their individual countries rules to imported supplements since dietary supplements were expressly exempted from the fdama97 provisions on mutual recognition agreements and globa l harmonization these products are not part of those trade discussions however it is unclear at this time what impact the exemption might have on international tr ade of us supplement products ultimately it is possible that the exemption could have negative cons equences for usmad supplements since the secretary the us trade representative and the secretary of commerce are prohibited from including supplements in their agreements to facilitate trade since fdama97 was enacted the impact of its implementation has yet to be fully realized congress is unlik ely to make any changes soon in the global harmonization provisions with regards to dietary supplemen ts unless there is evidence that the current provisions negatively impact the supplement i ndustry while the codex guidelines have been adopted there is evidence to date that members in the 109th congress will take any action to implement the guidelines by adopting them into us law considerable concern has been raised bout action on dietary supplements in the world trade organization wto as result of the codex guidelines to date trade disputes on supplements have been taken up by the wto although it is conceivable that the body may do so in the future since the codex guidelines only received the final vote of adoption by the full codex commission on july 4 2005 they have not yet been adopted into the laws of any country to be the basis for such dispute while congress has been preparing the implementing legislation for the central american free trade agreement cafta questions have b een raised about the codex guidelines and cafta chapter 6 of cafta directs that committee on sanitary and phytosanitary measures be created to provide forum for the discussion of various matters of mutual interest including consulting on issues positions and agendas for meetings of various international bodies such as the codex limentarius commission on food safety human animal and plant health dietary suppl ements are not mentioned in the provisions on this committee nor does the language suggest in any way that the committee has the authority to adopt implement or mandate any set of guid elines standards codes of practice or other advisory positions of code x or any other international body that could affect the availability or access to dietary s upplements in the united states or elsewhere another issue related to the codex guidelines concerns us membership in the united nations withdrawal of us mbership in the would not change the codex vitamin and mineral guidelines or the adoption of them into the law of another country any country that adopts the guidelines into its laws will apply those laws to any supplement products being imported by the country and would affect us products regardless of the status of us membership in the if the us were to withdraw from the it would longer be committee member or have voice in the development of any guidelines codes of practice or ot her advisory provisions developed by the 31 codex committees or adopted by th full codex alimentarius commission
