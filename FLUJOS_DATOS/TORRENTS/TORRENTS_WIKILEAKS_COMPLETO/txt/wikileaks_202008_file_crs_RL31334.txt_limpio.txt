orders for one oef and oif of these 1265345 were serving on active duty as of january 17 2006 while 406005 had been demobilized prior to that date after completing their tours7 note however that the total mobilization and demobilization figures count reservists more than once if they have been mobilized 3 includes casualties which occurred in the following countries afghanistan pakistan

of the assistant secretary of defense reserve affairs 17 january 2006 crs3 more than once the total number of individuals mobilized is therefore lower than stated above and probably by significant margin due to the number of people who have been called up more than once8 these reservists were called to active duty under mobilization authority known as partial mobilization in time of national emergency declared by the president partial mobilization authorizes the service secretaries9 to order members of the ready reserve to active duty for period not to exceed 24 consecutive months up to 1 million members of the ready reserve may serve on active duty at any one time under this provision of law the president may declare national emergency and mobilize reservists under this provision of law without approval from congress this authority was also used to mobilize reservists during the later part of the persian gulf war 1991 dods general policy has been to keep reservists on active duty for more than one year and in the majority of cases to date mobilized reservists have not been required to serve more than one year however the policy does allow the service secretary to keep reservists on active duty for up to 24 cumulative months if they are needed to meet operational or other requirements it should be noted that dods policy capping reserve service at 24 cumulative months is more restrictive than the 24 consecutive month cap specified in law if dod were to change its policy to mirror the law reservists could be mobilized multiple times for tours of 24 consecutive months apiece also some members of the national guard have been called up to perform duties related to one in nonfederal status additionally in 2001 and 2002 thousands of members of the national guard were activated at the order of their respective governors to provide additional security at airports they were called up under title 32 of the us code which means they were under state control but with federal pay and benefits these distinctions have significant bearing on the type of pay benefits and legal protections to which the affected individuals are entitled for more information on this topic see crs report rl30802 reserve component personnel issues by lawrence kapp 8 based on the data available to the author it is unclear how many individuals have been involuntarily activated more than once 9 section 12302 of title 10 states in time of national emergency declared by the president or when otherwise authorized by law an authority designated by the secretary concerned may without the consent of the persons concerned order any unit and any member not assigned to unit organized to serve as unit in the ready reserve under the jurisdiction of that secretary to active duty other than for training for not more than 24 consecutive months the secretary concerned as defined in 10 usc 101a9is the secretary of the army with respect to the army the secretary of the air force with respect to the air force the secretary of the navy with respect to the navy marine corps and coast guard when it is operating as part of the department of the navy although the law assigns authority to mobilize reservists to an official designated by the secretary concerned the president in his capacity as commander in chief is ultimately responsible for the decision to order reservists to active duty crs4 what policies govern the deployment of sole surviving sons and daughters statute governs the deployment of sole surviving sons and daughters in todays allvolunteer military10 however the department of defense does have an administrative policy governing assignments of sole surviving or daughter this policy allows sole surviving sons or daughters to apply for protective assignment status which once approved prohibits his or her assignment to any overseas area designated as hostilefire or imminentdanger area nor to duties that regularly might subject him or her to combat with the enemy11 in addition to protective assignment enlisted personnel who become sole surviving sons or daughters after having entered service may also apply for and be granted discharge in most circumstances12 however the term sole surviving or daughter does not simply mean the only child in family according to dods definition sole surviving or daughter is the only remaining or daughter in family where the father or mother or one or more sons or daughters served in the armed forces of the united states and because of hazards with such military service either 1 was killed 2 died as result of wounds accident or disease 3 is in captured or missingin action mia status or 4 is permanently 100percent disabled is hospitalized on continuing basis and is not employed gainfully because of such disability13 10 however law prohibits the conscription of surviving sons not necessarily sole surviving sons in certain circumstances conscription also known as the draft is governed by the military selective service act located at 50 usc appendix 451 to 471 part of this law 50 usc appendix 456 states except during the period of war or national emergency declared by congress person may be inducted for training and service under this title sections 451 to 471a of this appendix unless he volunteers for such induction 1 if the father or the mother or brother or sister of such person was killed in action or died in line of duty while serving in the armed forces after december 31 1959 or died subsequent to such date as result of injuries received or disease incurred in line of duty during such service or 2 during any period of time in which the father or the mother or brother or sister of such person is in captured or missing status as result of such service as used in this subsection the term brother or sister means brother of the whole blood or sister of the whole blood as the case may be note however that the legal authority to induct men into the military which is contained in the military selective service act expired on july 1 1973 therefore this provision of law is not currently relevant 11 department of defense directive 131518 procedures for military personnel assignments paragraph e3101 january 12 2005 12 department of defense directive 131515 special separation policies for survivorship paragraph 4 november 21 2003 this policy does not apply during periods of war or national emergency declared by congress if the individual has courtmartial charges pending if the individual is being processed for involuntary separation for cause or if the individual voluntarily enlists reenlists or voluntarily extends his or her term of active duty after being notified of the family casualty on which the survivorship claim is made 13 department of defense instruction 131518 procedures for military personnel assignments paragraph e2144 january 12 2005 crs5 the sole surviving or daughter issue is different from the commonly cited albeit fictional sullivan act or sullivan law the sullivans were five brothers serving on board single us navy ship the uss juneau during world war ii their ship was sunk by the japanese on november 13 1942 and all of the brothers died in response to this tragedy some proposals were made to prohibit brothers from serving together on the same ship but congress did not pass any such law nor did the president issue an executive order to that effect in response to similar tragedy which occurred the previous year three brothers serving aboard the uss arizona perished during the pearl harbor attacks the navy did issue policy forbidding commanding officers from approving requests from brothers to serve together but the policy was apparently not enforced and did not prohibit the navy from assigning brothers to the same ship14 current dod policy states that concurrent assigning of service members of the immediate family to the same military unit or ship is not prohibited but requests for reassignment to different unit or ship may be approved for all but one service member approval of such requests however are contingent upon military requirements15 what policies govern the status of conscientious objectors statute governs the treatment of conscientious objectors currently serving in the military16 however the department of defense does have an administrative policy relating to this issue17 of course in todays allvolunteer military those who have moral objections to participating in war will likely choose not to join the 14 department of the navy naval historical center frequently asked questions sullivan brothers located at httpwwwhistorynavymilfaqsfaq721htm 15 department of defense instruction 131518 procedures for military personnel assignments paragraph 69 january 12 2005 16 however there is law which deals with the treatment of conscientious objectors during draft the draft is governed by the military selective service act codified in 50 usc appendix 451 to 471 part of this law 50 usc appendix 456j states nothing contained in this title sections 451 to 471a of this appendix shall be construed to require any person to be subject to combatant training and service in the armed forces of the united states who by reason of religious training and belief is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form as used in this subsection the term religious training and belief does not include essentially political sociological or philosophical views or merely personal moral code any person claiming exemption from combatant training and service because of such conscientious objections whose claim is sustained by the local board shall if he is inducted into the armed forces under this title said sections be assigned to noncombatant service or shall if he is found to be conscientiously opposed to participation in such noncombatant servicebe ordered to perform for period equal to the period prescribed in section 4b section 454b of this appendix such civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health safety or interest as the director may deem appropriate note however that the legal authority to induct men into the military which is contained in the military selective service act expired on july 1 1973 therefore this provision of law is not relevant to people serving in the military today 17 department of defense directive 13006 conscientious objectors november 21 2003 crs6 military nonetheless some people volunteer to join the armed forces with every intention of fulfilling their military obligations but later develop religious or moral objections to participation in war such people may apply for transfer to noncombat related duties or for an administrative discharge depending on the nature of their convictions following application formal investigatory procedure is initiated by the military to ascertain the facts and nature of the applicants claim based on this investigation and the criteria for granting conscientious objector status defined in the dod policy determination is made to either grant or deny the applicants claim with respect to the criteria for granting conscientious objector status crucial one is the requirement that the individual be opposed to participation in war in any form18 in other words the objection must be to all wars rather than specific war19 this standard precludes those who are opposed to some wars but not all wars from being classified as conscientious objectors in 2000 slightly over 100 servicemembers applied for conscientious objector status in 2004 this number was over 400 of those who apply approximately half are approved20 are there other exemptions from serving in combat zone yes if service member is killed dies or is declared captured or missing the other service members of the same family will be exempt upon request from serving in designated hostilefire areas or if already serving in such as area will be reassigned this also applies to those who are categorized as 100 disabled by the service or the veterans administration21 in addition wounded personnel who have been medically evacuated and hospitalized for more than 30 days outside the hostilefire area will not be returned during the same tour they may however be eligible for subsequent combat tours this provision does not apply to those hospitalized for injury accident illness self inflicted wounds or other noncombat causes22 what is stoploss and what is its effect on separations and discharges under federal law the president has the authority to suspend laws related to promotion retirement and separation of military personnel during period of time 18 department of defense directive 13006 conscientious objectors paragraph 5111 19 department of defense directive 13006 conscientious objectors paragraph 521 20 martha mendoza miami herald more soldiers trying to leave the military january 1 2006 21 department of defense instruction 131518 procedures for military personnel assignments paragraph e31111 22 department of defense instruction 131518 procedures for military personnel assignments paragraph e3112 crs7 when members of the reserve component have been involuntarily ordered to active federal service23 since 1990 this authority has been delegated to the secretary of defense by executive order24 secretary of defense donald rumsfeld delegated this authority to each of the individual military services on september 19 2001 allowing those services to stop loss by keeping individuals on active duty beyond their normal date of separation or retirement stoploss has usually been implemented to permit the military to retain people with critical skills during time of crisis since september 11 2001 all of the services have implemented such skill based stop loss for various lengths of time although none of the services currently have such policy in effect however the army has implemented stoploss policy which delays the departure of personnel from units deploying to iraq and afghanistan until 90 days after the unit returns from its deployment the purpose of this unit based stoploss is to maintain unit cohesion and thereby maximize military effectiveness among units headed for combat environment the army has both an active army and reserve component unit stop loss program under both soldiers are affected from 90 days prior to their units mobilizationdeployment date through their demobilizatioinredeployment date plus maximum of 90 days as of december 31 2005 stop loss impacted 12467 soldiers 7620 active component 2418 reserve and 2429 national guard25 most involuntary separations for example discharges due to criminal acts will not be affected by stoploss additionally the adoption of stoploss policy does not modify service policies or regulations which might lead to an administrative discharge eg for homosexuality or to medical discharge most recently congress has required the secretary of defense to report on the actions being taken to ensure that new enlistees are adequately informed concerning service stop loss policies26 compensation what types of special pays and benefits are available to military personnel participating in oef and oif many military personnel participating in oef and oif are eligible for hostile fire or imminent danger pay hfidp hfidp is authorized by 37 usc 310 which provides special pay for duty subject to hostile fire or imminent danger 23 10 usc 12305 24 executive order 12728 august 22 1990 this authority was originally invoked by president george h w bush during the persian gulf war and has remained in effect since then 25 information paper army g1 subject stop loss program historical with updated numbers of soldiers affected 24 january 2006 26 pl 109163 section 546 national defense authorization act for fy2006 january 6 2006 crs8 while dod regulations distinguish between hostile fire pay and imminent danger pay they are both derived from the same statute and an individual can only collect hostile fire pay or imminent danger pay not both simultaneously27 the purpose of this pay is to compensate servicemembers for physical danger28 iraq afghanistan kuwait saudi arabia and many other nearby countries29 have been declared imminent danger zones military personnel serving in such designated areas are eligible for hfidp to be eligible for this pay in given month servicemember must have served some time in one of the designated zones even if only day or less the authorizing statute for hfidp sets the rate at 225 per month30 military personnel serving in iraq afghanistan parts of the persian gulf region and certain nearby areas31 are also eligible for hardship duty pay hdp hdp is 27 dod regulations make clear distinction between imminent danger pay idp and hostile fire pay hfp which is only implicit in the statute idp is provided to servicemembers serving in specifically designated places deemed to pose threat of physical harm or imminent danger due to insurrection war or terrorism hfp is provided to servicemembers in any location where members of the uniformed services are actually exposed to hostile fire or explosion of hostile mines in practice however this distinction tends to be blurred areas where hostile fire events are likely to occur have usually already been designated as imminent danger zones and if not they usually become so designated if hostile fire events occur on even sporadic basis still the distinction was clearly evidenced in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 when military personnel located at the pentagon and the world trade center on the date of the attacks were given hfp for the month of september although part of the united states is designated an imminent danger zone idp and hfp cannot be collected simultaneously dod financial management regulation 700014r special pay duty subject to hostile fire or imminent danger december 2005

be eligible for family separation allowance fsa fsa is authorized by 37 usc 427 which provides special pay for those servicemembers with dependents who are separated from their families for more than

vocational schooling correspondence courses some types of onthejob training and certain other educational programs what types of compensation and benefits are available to military personnel who are severely wounded or injured in oef and oif casualties from ongoing combat operations in iraq and afghanistan have received media attention and members of congress have frequently expressed concern about the level of care for those severely injured or wounded service members and their families as result several new programs have been established traumatic injury protection while the servicemembers group life insurance sgli program has offered lowcost life insurance to military personnel there has not been until recently provision for disability coverage effective december 1 2005 all service members were insured for traumatic injuries at monthly premium of 100 unless they decline coverage this program colloquially referred to as tsgli or traumatic sgli provides an immediate payment between 25000 and 100000 to ease the financial burden associated with hospitalization recovery and rehabilitation61 those who are blind deaf paralyzed severely burned or multiple amputees will qualify for the 100000 maximum other severe injuries will be compensated on sliding scale of 25000 50000 and 75000 based on the severity and duration of the condition tsgli is not disability compensation and it has effect on veterans administration entitlements the office of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness is responsible for implementing the program with the services tsgli is retroactive to october 7 2001 if the loss was direct result of injuries received in oef or oif 59 codified in title 38 chapter 35 of the united states code 60 however recent change

combat zone as determined by the secretary of defense and who are medically evacuated will receive special pay of 430 per month during the period of their hospitalization recovery and rehabilitation the special pay will be reduced by any amount of hostile fire or imminent danger pay that is received and the pay is not retroactive meals in military medical treatment facilities because service members receive basic allowance for subsistence they have routinely been charged for meals while hospitalized in military medical treatment facilities previous legislation had temporarily waived this charge63 however with passage of the fy2006 national defense authorization act64 service members are longer required to pay for these meals while they are undergoing continuous care to include outpatient care for an injury illness or disease incurred in support of oef oif or other military operations designated by the secretary of defense this exemption is now effective from october 1 2005

manpower to conduct all of the missions it is currently assigned prior to the september 11th attacks there was serious debate between congress and the executive branch over whether the military was being tasked with more missions than it could realistically handle given its manpower levels congress was especially concerned that these missions in bosnia kosovo southwest asia the sinai and elsewhere might be producing personnel tempo perstempo levels67 high enough to have negative effect on retention68 as such congress passed laws requiring the services to track the perstempo of every servicemember to monitor individual perstempo levels more closely and to pay an allowance to servicemembers assigned lengthy or numerous deployments69 similar concerns about perstempo led general eric shinseki the army chief of staff to assert before the house armed services committee in july 2001 that given todays mission profile the army is too small for the mission load it is carrying during that hearing both shinseki and secretary of the army thomas white endorsed proposal to increase the armys end strength from 480000 to 520000 soldiers70 67 personnel tempo is the rate at which military personnel are deployed away from their home station 68 deployments can have positive effect on retention but some studies indicate that after certain threshold level high perstempo levels have negative effect on retention see for example james hosek and mark totten does perstempo hurt reenlistment the effect of long or hostile perstempo on reenlistment rand 1998 paul sticha paul hogan and diane maris personnel tempo definition measurement and effects on retention readiness and quality of life army research institute 1999 and peter francis optempo and readiness center for naval analysis

concerned may suspend the applicability of this section to member or any group of members under the secretarys jurisdiction when the secretary determines that such waiver is necessary in the national security interests of the united states on october 8 2001 deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz signed an order indefinitely suspending part of the perstempo legislation including payments authorized under 37 usc 436 70 nicholas j carter armylink news white shinseki army needs more soldiers july 24 2001 crs17 since september 11 2001 operations noble eagle enduring freedom and iraqi freedom have dramatically increased the manpower needs of the military services especially for the army which has shouldered the bulk of the manpower burden associated with the occupation of iraq these manpower needs have been filled primarily through the call up of over 500000 reservists longer duty days and higher perstempo rates for many active duty personnel and the use of contract personnel so far this response has enabled the military to perform its assigned missions but some observers note that it could cause problems in the future for example in unacceptably low retention rates unacceptable performance levels and difficulty responding to new crises if carried out over an extended period of time in order to prevent such problems from occurring congress and the executive branch have taken number of actions for example at the end of fy2003 and fy2004 the department of defense invoked statutory provision which allowed it to exceeded its authorized end strength71 additionally congress recently authorized an increase of 20000 to the size of the active army and an increase of 3000 to the size of the active marine corps in the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy200572 separate provision in that law gives the secretary of defense the authority to temporarily increase the size of the army by another 10000 people and the size of the marine corps by 6000 people73 most recently the fy2006 national defense authorization act provides for an active duty end strength as of september 30 2006 of 512400 for the army an increase of 30000 and an end strength of 179000 for the marine corps an increase of 400074 furthermore this legislation authorized additional annual increases of 20000 for the army and 5000 for the marine corps for each fy2007 through 71 congress regulates the maximum size of the armed forces by setting statutory limits on end strength of the military services end strength is defined by 10 usc 101b11 as the largest number of members authorized to be in an armed force component branch grade or any other category of the armed forces however there are several provisions of law which allow the services to exceed their authorized end strength under certain circumstances 10 usc 115e allows the secretary of defense to increase the active duty end strength for fiscal year for any of the armed forces by not more than three percent and the end strength of certain reserve component personnel by not more than two percent if he determines it to be in the national interest 10 usc 115f allows the secretary of military department to increase the authorized active duty end strength of the armed force under his or her jurisdiction by not more than two percent if he determines it to be in the national interest 10 usc 123a allows the president to waive any statutory end strength with respect to given fiscal year if at the end of that fiscal year there is in effect war or national emergency this latter provision was delegated by the president to the secretary of defense on september 14 2001 executive order 13223 72 pl 108375 section 401 and 402 october 28 2004 the increases for the army and marine corps specified in section 401 are subject to condition that the costs of the increases be paid out of funds authorized to be appropriated for that fiscal year 2005for contingent emergency reserve fund or as an emergency supplemental appropriation 73 pl 108375 section 403 october 28 2004 74 pl 109163 section 401 national defense authorization act for fy2006 january 6 2006 crs18 200975 however the army is having difficulty increasing its strength due to recruiting shortfalls another prominent initiative intended to reduce manpower strain is the armys ongoing effort to reorganize itself converting from divisional structure to one based on brigade sized units of action76 the army believes that this reorganization will increase its pool of deployable units which could help reduce perstempo rates the army is also shifting of some critical military capabilities from the reserve component to the active component thereby reducing the need to call up reserve units to support military operations and retraining personnel from skills in lower demand such as air defense and artillery to skills in higher demand such as military police other alternatives which have been suggested include contracting out more functions to the private sector increasing the use of technologies which reduce manpower needs securing greater participation in iraq and afghanistan by allied military personnel reducing us involvement in missions such as the sinai and kosovo and withdrawing us forces from iraq in relatively large numbers77 what would it take to reinstitute the draft is return to conscription in the us likely any attempt to reinstate the draft would require congressional approval the legal framework for conscription is codified in law but the law contains provision which prohibits actual induction into the armed forces after july 1 197378 to reinstate the draft congress would have to pass legislation reauthorizing inductions at the present time it appears unlikely that the us will reinstate the draft to meet its manpower needs while the army and some of the reserve components are having difficulty making recruiting goals the military is meeting its retention objectives and has large pool of trained personnel in the reserves that it can draw on to augment its active forces79 additionally while conscription is useful for 75 pl 109163 section 403 national defense authorization act for fy2006 january 6 2006 76 see crs report rl32476 us armys modular redesign issues for congress by andrew feickert 77 see for example thom shanker after the war the military rumsfeld seeking to bolster force without new gis new york times august 24 2003 1 78 the military selective service act 50 usc app 451 et seq 50 usc app 467c states notwithstanding any other provision of this title person shall be inducted for training and service in the armed forces after july 1 1973 except persons now or hereafter deferred under section 6 of this title after the basis of such deferment ceases to exist 79 although from historical perspective this pool has already been utilized quite heavily since september 11 2001 many members of the ready reserve have not been mobilized yet the total strength of the ready reserve which is made up of the selected reserve the individual ready reserve and the inactive national guard is currently about 113 million of these roughly 35 to 40 have been involuntarily mobilized crs19 producing large numbers of basically trained military personnel it is not very useful for producing high skill specialists which the military often has the greatest need for for example intelligence analysts linguists special operations forces civil affairs personnel and pilots these people need years of training and high motivation levels to become proficient in their military occupations however should reconstruction and counterinsurgency operations in iraq require major us presence for prolonged period of time the utility of draft might become more active consideration such mission could demand large numbers of military personnel who do not require the more specialized skills80 the draft might also be useful if congress decided to dramatically expand the size of the army over short period of time see also crs report rl31682 the military draft and possible war with iraq by robert goldich for more detailed discussion of arguments for and against draft for federal service in oneoefoif under 10 usc 12302 still it appears that over half of the ready reserve has not been activated since september 11 2001 on the other hand if one looks only at the selected reserve the mobilization ratio is higher and if one looks at just the selected reserve of the army reserve and army national guard the mobilization ratio is higher still based on the best available data it appears that about 50 of the currently serving members of the army national guard and the army reserve have been involuntarily mobilized for federal service in oneoefoif under 10 usc 12302 since september 11 2001 80 examples would include junior level security guards and personnel with basic construction skills however some would argue that these tasks are not inherently military and could be performed by iraqi civilians rather than by us military personnel others would argue that these tasks take on military character in hazardous environment
