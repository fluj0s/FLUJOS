copyright terms in 1790 the first congress created copyright term of 14 years for existing and future works subject to renewal for total of 28 years by 1909 both the original and the renewal term had been extended to 28 years for combined term of 56 years additional ex tensions were enacted between 1962 and 1974 when the current copyright act was enact ed in 1976 congress revised the format of copyright terms to conform with the berne c onvention and internati onal practice instead of fixedyear term the duration of copyri ght was established as the life of the author plus 50 years in the

lower court held without trial in br ief decision in favor of the defendant the us attorney general finding constitutional infirmity in ctea4 the dc court of appeals which affirmed the district court observed that the case marks the first occasion for an appellate court to address whether the first amendment or the copyright clause of the constitution of the united states constrains the congress from extending for period of years the duration of copyrights5 issues in an opinion written by justice ginsburg the court addresses two issues first whether the cteas extension of existing copyrights exceeds congress power under the copyright clause and second whethe r the cteas extension of existing and future copyrights violat the first amendment6 does the cteas extension of existing c opyrights exceed congress power under the copyright clause the copyright clause of the cons titution art i 8 cl 8 authorizes congress to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclus ive right to their respective writings and discoveries the court reviewed the history of congress creation and extension of copyright and patents going back to the first congress and concluded that history reveals an unbroken congressional pr actice of granting to authors the benefit of term extensions so that all under copyright protection will be governed evenhandedly under the same regime7 the court found that cteas addition of twenty years to the term of existing copyrights is fully consistent with this historic practice hence it rejected the petitioners argument that the limited time requirement requires forever fixed or inalterable copyright term ultimately the court found that th unbroken congressional practice for over twohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21179crs3 8 id at 785 citation omitted 9 id at 78283 10 feist publications inc v rura l telephone serv co 499 us 340 345 1991centuries of applying adjustments to copyright term to both existing and future works is almost conclusive8 the court then considered whether ctea is rational exercise of congressional authority under the clause it found that th act falls squarely within the type of judgments that congress typically makes and is well within its legislative domain the court noted that much of the impetus for th extension was desire to harmonize us copyright law with the practices of the europ ean union the goal of which is to promote international protection of us copyrights in addition the legislative history of the act indicated rationallybased judgment that longer terms would encourage copyright holders to invest in the rest oration and public distribution of their works although the court felt compelled to defer to the legislative prerogative to implement the copyright clause it did not endorse the wisdom of the extended term in sum we find that the ctea is rational enactment we are not at liberty to secondguess congressional determinations and policy judgments of this order however debatable or arguably unwise they may be accordingly we cannot conclude that the ctea which continues the unbroken practice of treating future and existing copyrights in parity for term extension purposes is an impermissible exercise of congress power under the copyright clause9 the court then considered several novel ar guments advanced by the petitioners all of which they found to be unpersuasive namely that permitting congress to extend existing copyrights allows it to evade the limited times constraint by creating effectively perpetual copyrights through re peated extensions and that congress may not extend an existing copyright absent new c onsideration from the author the court dismissed the former with the observation that regime of perpetual copyrights was not the situation before it with respect to quid pro quo or new consideration th petitioners argued that the public receives nothing in exchange for the rm extension which violates the intent of the preamble to the clause to promote the progress of science and useful arts although the clause itself does not explicitly require originality in copyrighted work the requirement is implicit by virtue of gran ting protection to the works of authors and inventors the us supreme court has called originality the sine qua non of copyright10 plaintiffs argued that the ctea s term extension does not promote originality but merely increases the value of work already created and it violates the requirement that copy righted subject matter be original when it extended the term of subsisting copyrights with respect to the clauses charge to congress to promote originality and creativity the court found that the constituti onal command is satisfied by establishing system of copyright with regard to the requirement that copyrighted material be original the court found ther to be nexus between the originality requirement for granting copyright and the duration of the copyright term httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21179crs4 11 123 s ct at 787 12 id at 78990 13 id at 788 14 17 usc 107 15 123 s ct at 81314 16 id at 813the court also rejected any similarity between the quid pro quo behind the grant of patent and copyright in exchange fo r the monopoly gr ant suppor ting patent the inventor discloses to the public information regarding an invention with substantial utility in contrast for the author seeking copyri ght protection disclosure is the desired objective not something exacted from the author in exchange for the copyright11 is ceta contentneutral regulation of speech that fails inspection under the heightened judicial scrutiny appropriate for regulation under the first amendment although the court acknowledged that the d c circuit court of appeals spoke too broadly when it declared copyrights cat egorically immune from challenges under the first amendment12 it nevertheless affirmed the cour t of appeals holding the court observed that the proximity in time between the framers adoption of the copyright clause and the first amendment evidences their compatibility both the ideaexpression dichotomy and the fair use defense are builtin first amendment accommodations13 the ideaexpression dichotomy pr ecludes the grant of copyright to ideas and facts only to form of expression of them and the fair use defense allows the public to use copyrighted expression in certain circumstances such as criticism comment news reporting teaching scholarship or research14 the court concluded that when congress has not altered the traditional contours of copyright expre ssion further first amendment scrutiny is unnecessary the dissent justices breyer and stevens filed dissenting opinions justice breyers dissent is premised on the cont ention that cteas 20year extension is essentially an economic regulation that has the practical effect of making the copyright term virtually perpetual because the monopoly grant inherent in copyright does have an effect on free dissemination of speech ju stice breyer would apply more rigorous scrutiny to the laws rationality finding th at the law bestows only private not public benefits that it undermines th expressive values that th copyright clause embodies and that it cannot be justified by any signif icant clauserelated obj ective he concludes that it falls outside the scope of legislative power that the copyright clause read in light of the first amendment grants to congress15 he concludes that t his particular statute simply goes too far16 unlike justice breyers economicallybased finding that ctea goes too far justice stevens based his dissent on legal an alysis which is at odds with the majority he concludes that any extension of an existing copyright exceeds congress authority under the copyright clause with respect to the history of cong ress unbroken pattern of applying copyright extensions retroactively he asserts that the fact that congress has repeatedly acted on mistaken interpretation of the constitution does not qualify our duty to invalidate an unconstitutional practice when it is finally challenged in an

publication and distribution of the wind done gone finding that it was unlikely that the plaintiffs would ov ercome the defendants fair use defense to infringementcase17 the constitutionallymandated quid pro quo for the grant of limited copyright monopoly is public access through the public domain therefore an extension of an existing copyright is in his view merely gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public to authors publishers and th eir successors in interest18 implications eldred is an important case both for its precedential value interpreting the copyright clause and the policy implications for the duration of copyright the power of copyright holder to control protected material is great it grants the owner exclusive right to c ontrol reproduction di stribution performance display and adaptions of the protected work the right to control adaptions is in and of itself broad right it permits the holder to extend his reach to works that do not merely duplicate the original but borrow critical elements from it it was the right to control adaptive works that lead the estate of margaret mitchell to challenge publication of parody of gone with the wind entitled the wind done gone19 critics of copyright term ex tensions contend that they are advocated by large corporate interests with an eye to profits and ever tighter control over protected works to the detriment of the public they argue that because it already extends beyond the life of the author the current term exceeds that necessary to encourage creation and permit creators to exploit the value of their work rather than promoting creativity withholding material from the public domain diminishes the richness of the nations cultural and intellectual life the decision of the us supreme court in eldred indicates that challenges to the wisdom of copyright term duration will be addressed in the congress not the courts
