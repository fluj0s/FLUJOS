the 109th congress summary federal support for child care comes in many forms ranging from grant programs to tax provisions some progra ms serve as specifica lly dedicated funding sources for child care services eg the child care and deve lopment block grant or ccdbg while for others eg temporary assistance for needy families or tanf child care is just one of many purposes for which funds may be used in many cases federal programs target lowincome families in need of child care assistance but in the case of certain tax provisions the benefits reach middle and upperincome families as well this repor t provides an overvie w of federal child care and related programs as th ey were addressed by the 109th congress the 109th congress inherited several child carerelated agenda items from the previous congresses but resolved only few efforts to reauthorize the ccdbg and tanf block grants as well as the head start program had started in the 108th congress and ultimately in february 2006 after 12 temporary extensions the tanf block grant and the mandatory portion of ch ild care funding was reauthorized for fiveyear period via the deficit reducti on act pl 109171 whereas bills to reauthorize the child care and devel opment block grant itself hr 240 and s 525 and the head start program hr 2123 and s 2206 failed to make their way to enactment in law and re main on the agenda for

created in 1990 and reauthorized and substan tially expanded in 1996 as part of welfare reform the ccdbg has been due to be reauthorized since the end of fy2002 and remained an incomplete agenda item at the close of the 109th congress see the legislative activity section of this report for more on the unsuccessful reauthorization efforts the ccdbg is administered by the department of health and human services hhs and provides formula block grants to states which use the grants to subsidize the child care expenses of families with children under ag 13 if the parents are working or in school and family income is less than 85 of the state median in practice many states establish income eligibility levels that are lower than this federal threshold child care services are provided on sliding fee scale basis and parents may choose to receive assistance through vouchers or certificates which can be used with provider of the parents choice including sectarian providers and relatives states receiving ccdbg funds must blish child care licensing standards although federal law does not dictate what these standards should be or what types of providers must be cove red in addition states mu st have health and safety requirements applicable to all providers receiving ccdbg subsidies that address prevention and control of infectious diseas building and physical premises safety and health and safety training for care give rs however federa l law does not dictate the specific contents of these requirements the ccdbg is funded through both disc retionary and cappe d entitlement grants referred to in combination as the child care and development fund ccdf and state maintenanceofeffort moe and matc hing requirements apply to part of the entitlement funds4 states must use at least 4 of their total funds to improve the quality and availability of child care and according to statute must target 70 of entitlement funds on welfare recipients work ing toward selfsufficiency or families at risk of welfare dependency howeve r because all families falling below the 85 of state median income requirement can be categorized as at risk the 70 targeting of the welfare or atrisk population does not necessarily mean welfare families must be served in theory all funds may be used for low income nonwelfare working families however state plans indicate that many states guarantee child care to welfare families more than 5 of state allotments may be used for state administrative costs the fy2006 appropriations act for the departments of labor hhs and education pl 109149

rules the transfer from the fy2005 tanf allotment to the ccdbg totaled 20 billion representing 12 of the fy2005 tanf allotment child and adult care food program cacfp the cacfp provides federal funds

not all the proposals have been adopted however g ood start grow smart focuses on three overall areas 1 strengthening head start 2 partnering with states to improve early childhood education and 3 providing information to teachers care givers and parents in the presidents fy2004 budget he proposed to transfer the head start program to the department of education as well as to provide states with the option to administer the program the head start reauthorization bill passed by the house during the 108th congress hr 2210 did not include the proposal to transfer the program to ed but did include provisions to allow maximum of eight states to administer the program provided they m eet designated requirements the head start reauthorization bills of this 109th congress hr 2123 and s 2206 emphasized increased coordination among early childhood programs but neither proposed either departmental transfer of the program or state demonstration projects the administration has moved ahead with two other efforts that are in keeping with the good start grow smart initiative but that did not require legislative changes to the head start act one is the strategic teacher education program also known as project step described by the head start bureau as comprehensive multifaceted sequential professional devel opment endeavor to ensure teachers use researchbased strategies to implement early and emergent literacy as part of this development during summe r and fall 2002 3000 head start staff and 100 state child care administrators received 32 hours of traini ng in strategies to support childrens emerging literacy those who were trained are expected to serve as mentor coaches for staff within their respective head start programs the second effort is the development nd implementation of national reporting system that can be used to assess the effectiveness of head start programs in achieving successful outcomes for child ren in terms of school readiness particularly the areas of literacy and nu mber knowledge th is national reporting system was implemented starting in the fall 2003 and assesses h ead start 4 and 5 yearolds twice year on educational performance
