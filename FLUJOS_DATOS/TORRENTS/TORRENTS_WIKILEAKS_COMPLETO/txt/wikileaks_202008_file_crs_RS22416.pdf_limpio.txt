computed in two stages first funds were distributed to each state and territory ba sed on the states or territorys proportion of the average number of uniform crime report ucr part i violent crimes committed in the united states the average number of ucr part i violent crimes was calculated using the three most recent years available each state and territo ry received minimum allocation of 025 of the total funds available in the second stage some of the funds awarded to each state were directly awarded to units of local government each unit of local governments share of the state allocation was based on the jurisdictions proportion of the average number of ucr part i violent crimes committed in its respective state however funding was only directly awarded to unit of local government if it was eligible to r eceive 10000 or more in funding the funds that remained after direct allocations were made to units of local government were administered by the state the state could choose to award funds to units of local government that did not receive direct allocation 8 hr 728 was passed by the house but the bill never passed the senate 9 us congress house committee on the judiciary

states by usin g formula the formula allocating jag funds to the 50 states the district of colu mbia puerto rico guam the virgin islands america samoa and the northern marinara islands combines elements of the formulas used in the byrne formula grant program nd llebg see discussion below under the current jag formula the total allocated to state is based on the states population and average reported uniform crime report ucr part i violent crimes specifically half of states allocation is based on states respective share of the us population and the other half is based on the states respective share of the ucr part i violent crimes in the united states for the three most recent years for which data are available under current law each state and territory receives gu aranteed minimum amount of funding set at 025 of the total jag funds available if any state does not receive the minimum allocation after calculating each states allocation using the formula then each state receives the minimum allocation the balance of the total funds available is then allocated to states that did not receive the minimu m allocation of 025 by using the formula discussed above when the remaining funds ar allocated to states that did not receive minimum allocation the population and ucr part i crime data from the states receiving the minimum allocation is not considered for the purposes of calculating the allocations like llebg jag funds are directly awarde d to local jurisdictions in the state after the initial state allocation is calculated 40 of the states allocation is directly awarded to units of local government13 awards to units of local government under jag are made the same way they were under lle bg namely each unit of local governments award is based on the jurisdictions proporti on of the average number of ucr part i violent crimes committed in its respective state only units of local government that would receive 10000 or more are eligible for direct allocation the balance of funds not directly awarded to units of local government is administered by the state also like the byrne formula grant program each state is required to pass through certain percentage of the funds directly awarded to the state14 for jag the passthrough percentage is calculated as the ratio of the total amount of expenditu res on criminal justice by the state for the most recen t fiscal year to the total amount of expenditures on criminal justice by both the state and all units of cal government in the past fiscal year jag program purpose areas pl 109162 consolidated
