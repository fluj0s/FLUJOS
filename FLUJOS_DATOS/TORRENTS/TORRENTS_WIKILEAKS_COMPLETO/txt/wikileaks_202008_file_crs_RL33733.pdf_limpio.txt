and on occasion nies have proved unreliable because they were based on insuﬃcient evidence or contained faulty analysis this was demonstrated in the nie produced in 2002 on iraqi weapons of mass destruction parts of which were signiﬁcantly inaccurate nies can provide insights into the likely eﬀects of certain policy approaches but they are not usually made to take into account the details of

principal consumer of nies but now appears increasingly interested in obtaining nies on crucial security issues despite or perhaps because of the experience with the 2002 iraq nie the fy2007 defense authorization act pl 109364 section 1213 specifically requested comprehensive nie on iran in february 2007 the intelligence community also released an nie on prospects for iraq s stability in response to congressional request in early december 2007 the director of national intelligence released the key judgments of national intelligence estimate iran nuclear intentions and capabilities the new nie judged with high confidence that in fall 2003 tehran halted its nuclear weapons program even though the nie did recognize that with moderatetohigh confidence that tehran at minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons this dramatic release of the key judgments on iran heightened interest in the nie process and its relevance to policymaking some observers assert however that public discussion on specific nies may not adequately reflect the process by which they are prepared or their inherent limitations this report will be updated when new information becomes available

us intelligence community they are by definition forwardlooking as one participant in the estimative process has written estimates are not predictions of the future they are considered judgments as to the likely course of events regarding an issue of importance to the nation sometimes more than one outcome may be estimated 1 nies focus on foreign developments they are not net assessments that directly compare us and foreign capabilities and plans the responsibility for producing nies rests on the national intelligence council nic an entity within the office of the director of national intelligence dni2 the nic consists of senior analysts from the intelligence community and substantive experts from the public and private sector after decision is made to prepare an nie terms of reference tors that define the major issues and drafting responsibilities are circulated to relevant intelligence agencies one or more analysts either from the odni or an intelligence agency is asked to prepare draft nie the draft estimates is then coordinated by senior officials of all intelligence agencies in process that can be quite lengthy thereafter nies are formally considered by the heads of relevant intelligence agencies and the dni the national security act requires that nies include whenever the council considers appropriate alternate views held by elements of the intelligence community 3 thus they may contain text or footnotes that pose alternative views from the judgments in the nie the conclusions of nies however are understood to reflect the official position of the dni4 once approved the nie is forwarded to the president senior policymakers and the two congressional intelligence committees in drafting nies analysts marshal evidence from all sources available to the intelligence communityhuman intelligence signals intelligence overhead surveillance and others including the exploitation of open sources foreign media and increasingly websites the lengthy drafting and coordination process includes participation by agency analysts and occasionally outside experts with varying perspectives at their best nies provide careful assessment of an international situation based on extensive collection and careful analysis that 1 mark m lowenthal intelligence from secrets to policy washington dc cq press 2000 p 88 2 for background on the nic and the national intelligence officers see httpwwwdnigovnicnic_homehtml the nic was established by director of central intelligence dci stansfield turner in 1979 statutory basis was included in the intelligence authorization act for fy1993 pl 10249 6 106 stat 3191 though composed of analysts from various government agencies and the public and private sector the nic has always depended heavily on cia analysts for research and drafting nies the nic originally reporte d to the dci in his role as head of the intelligence community but the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 transferred the nic to the newly created office of the dni many if not most current nios are not cia career analysts and some observers believe that cias preeminent analytical role has diminished nevertheless cia has the broadest analytical coverage of any agency and the largest number of analysts and is likely to be heavily involved in the preparation of future nies 3 50 usc 4033b2a 4 yet according to robert gates then deputy director of central intelligence writing in 1987 more than once the late director of central intelligence william casey and probably his predecessors approved an estimate with which he disagreed personally and separately conveyed his personal view to policymakers robert gates the cia and american foreign policy foreign affairs winter 19871988 p 227

risks that the united states will face in general nies on topics that involve sensitive collection or analysis of trends that are largely unknown to outside experts are the most valuab on the other hand nies addressing broad topics as the future of democracy in the middle east or the likely evolution of china in the next 20 years may not necessarily yield more accurate conclusions or more perceptive insights than the work of leading academic experts some observers argue that intelligence estimates that deal with such topics inevitably suffer from the absence of scrutiny by the wide and disparate community of scholars that challenges and debates conclusions of scholarly works in the open literature and ultimately has an important influence on public opinion most nies on the other hand describe the environment in which national security policy choices will likely be made in the foreseeable future with analysis incorporating information that is not available to the general public at minimum nies require that differences among analysts be confronted and described this is an important contribution as policymakers need to know what is known by the intelligence community and what remains unknown and what conclusions drawn by the governments most experienced analysts historically some nies have been essential to national security policymaking during the cold war nies on soviet strategic forces provided an agreedupon set of figures that were an integral part of plans for us force structures and negotiations of series of arms control treaties 5 us policymaking however occasionally is based on directives by presidents or senior officials that have not been coordinated throughout the executive branch or with congress some policy makers assume that their own long experience and extensive personal contacts gives them better insights than even the most senior intelligence officials in considering major new initiatives there can be an obsessive concern with the potential for leaks that limits discussion to very small circle of advisers and excludes much of the intelligence community which is independent of political appointees there are other inherent limitations to the nie pr ocess nies are often prepared on broad issues that may involve not just foreign states or international groups but also the influence of us policy or the interplay of us with foreign actors although some nies will address the implications of several broad policy options detailed treatments of us plans have traditionally been defined as beyond the cognizance of intelligence agencies in many cases other agencies will have little inclination to share sensitive planning with the substantial number of intelligence analysts involved in the preparation of nies in other cases us plans will depend more on future initiatives such as legislation that intelligence analysts would be unable to predict with accuracy 5 in an oftreported comment in 1967 president lyndon johnson stated i wouldnt want to be quoted on this but weve spent 35 or 40 billion dollars on the space program and if nothing else had come out of it except the knowledge weve gained from space photography it would be worth 10 times what the whole program has cost b ecause tonight we know how many missiles the enemy has and it turned out our guesses were way off we were doing things we didnt need to do

professional integrityto prepare analyses that are unbiased and nonpartisan at times the bureaucratic process that produces nies can shape the conclusions in ways that reflect agency perspectives this can be the case for instance when intelligence judgments about threat environments have significant implication for us military force structure moreover if nies are tied too closely and too publicly to public debates there is concern that intelligence agencies will either be inclined to emphasize evidence supporting an administrations preferred policy options or avoid controversial issues 7 furthermore it has been argued that nies are not necessarily the most important contribution of intelligence agencies which produce thousands of assessments of varying complexity in given year 911 commission staff statement noted some officials including deputy dci director of central intelligence john mclaughlin are skeptical about the importance of comprehensive estimates mclaughlin has been in charge of the estimate process he told us such estimates are timeconsuming to prepare judgments are watered down in negotiations conclusions may duplicate those already circulated in more specific papers 8 review of intelligence on iraq by senior intelligence officials undertaken for the thendci in mid2004 noted nies rarely represent new analysis or bring to bear more expertise than already exists in analytic offices indeed drafters of nies are usually the same analysts from whose work the nie is drawn little independent knowledge or informed outside opinion is incorporated in estimative products the preparation of an nie therefore consists primarily of compiling judgments from previous products an d debating points of disagreement the fundamental question is whether national intelligence estimates add value to the existing body of analytic work historically with few exceptions nies have not carried great weight in policy deliberations although customers have often used them to promote their own agendas 9 6 50 usc 4033a2 7 when an administration is in the process of choosing policy option there can also be temptation for intelligence analysts to become advocates robert gates claims that far from kowtowing to policymakers there is sometimes strong impulse on the part of intelligence officers to show that policy or decision is misguided or wrong to poke an analytical finger in the policy eye policymakers know this and understandably resent it to protect the independence of the analyst while keeping such impulses in check is one of the toughest jobs of intelligence agency managers the cia and foreign policy p 221 8 national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission the performance of the intelligence community staff

and aris pappas to support an internal evaluation of intelligence analysis associated with the war on iraq it is available on the cia website at httpswwwciagov csistudiesvol49no3html_filescollecti on_analysis_iraq_5htm some observers believe that the intelligence communitys greatest contributi on may lie in the area of specialized studies or shortterm reports that are based on information that only intelligence agencies have acquired and that needs to be analyzed and disseminated within relatively short time frame such analytical products do not in most cases provide the basis for an entirely new policy but can have an important influence on the development of policy or military campaigns they can contribute invaluable new information and analys is that will shape the policymaking

not just executive branch officials10 accordingly nies are forwarded to the two congressional intelligence agencies the senate select committee on intelligence ssci and the house permanent select committee on intelligence hpsciand on occasion other congressional committees11 use of nies by committees will vary the two intelligence committees oversee the activities of all intelligence agencies including their analytical efforts and thus they review nies on continuing basis other committeesespecially the armed services and international relations committeesmay along with the intelligence committees be especially interested in nies that deal with issues that directly affect upcoming us foreign and military decisions although usually nies have been produced at the request of executive branch officials and have been used primarily by executive branch policy makers nies have at times been the subject of considerable congressional interest 12 congress has from time to time informally requested nies as was the case with the nie on iraqi wmds produced in 2002 as discussed below but the house intelligence authorization b ill hr 2082 for the current fiscal year included provision section 407 mandating an nie on global climate change the administration has resisted this provision this section sets harmful precedent the production of intelligence products on topics of interest to the executive branch or congress should be left to cooperative relationships and established dialogue and should not be reflect ed in law particularly in manner that impinges on the flexibility of ic intelligence community professionals to approach task in the most appropriate manner 13 subsequently the conference report on hr 2082 omitted the statutory requirement for an nie but noted that the dni had stated that an assessment on the effects of global climate change was being prepared and the conferees expect that the national intelligence assessment will be transmitted to congress in timely manner14 congress included requirement for an nie on iran in the fy2007 defense authorization act pl 109364 section 1213 to be submitted in classified form the statute also stated that

accompanying statement by principal deputy dni donald kerr stated without reference to the statute the decision to release an unclassified version of the key judgments of the nie was made when it was determined that doing so was in the interest of our nations security15 some observers suggest that nies could better s upport congressional deliberations if they were the subject of further hearings by relevant committees more extensive hearings by relevant committees would provide opportunities for members to assess the validity of the information on which the nies were based and the extent of support for conclusions reached by the drafters of the nie although there would inevitably be concerns about enlarging the number of persons exposed to highly sensitive intelligence especially detailed discussion of intelligence sources and methods other observers caution in addition that making sensitive nies the subjects of congressional hearings especially when an impor tant vote is approaching could focus media attention on intelligence judgments that are only part of complex decisionmaking process there is concern that hearings have the potential to undermine the statutory mandate that national intelligence be objective and independent of political considerations 16 it is also possible that the mechanics of an nie might be misinterpreted especially the ways in which main and alternate views are set forth and that debate could result in cherry picking views that are congenial to one position or another nie production schedules could also be more closel coordinated with the legislative branch to ensure that the intelligence community addresses major topics on which congress expects to consider legislation on the other hand some observers argue that congress might draw up lists of nies that would overly tax limited analytical resources and infringe on the presidents authority to direct the work of the intelligence community the influence of intelligence assessments on congressional debates offers cautionary lessons in late 1990 intelligence assessments albeit not an nie concluded that operation desert storm that became the persian gulf war of 1991 would last at least six months and cause many casualties largely on the basis of these dire predictions several senators on the ssciincluding its chairman david l boren of oklahomaas well as the armed services committee chairman sam nunn of georgia ultimately voted against the resolution authorizing the president to send troops to the gulf later wh it turned out that coalition forces achieved immediate air superiority and the ground war ended in matter of days with relatively few american casualties the senators who had voted in the negative were understandably upset some had lost considerable political support in their home states as result of their votes senator nunn later said the vote not only had hurt his credibility as chairman of the sasc senate armed services committee but also had removed any thoughts he might have had about running for president knowing that his vote would have been major debating point in any election campaign after all they were senators supposedly in the know and yet 15 statement by the principal deputy director of national intelligence dr donald m kerr december 3 2007 the previous month dni mcconnell had indicated that unclassified key judgments of the iran nie would not be released he explained i dont want to have situation where the young analysts are writing something b ecause they know its going to be public debate or

sandbagged by the intelligence community17 former staffer was quoted as saying that the real problem for the committee was that it was never given blue team information information on us military capabilities it was never advised for example that stealth aircraft were to be used it was never provided an assessment of our forces versus theirs 18

of intuition these qualities are usually not quantifiable nor can they be simply mandated erroneous estimates can occur and have occurred in recent years the history of the iraq nie prepared in 2002 iraq s continuing programs for weapons of mass destruction is instructive in this regard the fact that iraq had had wmd in the past and had previously used them both against iran and regime opponents within iraq was well known that iraq had violated agreements made after the conclusion of desert storm in 1991 and expelled international inspectors in 1998 was also incontestable it was also evident that saddam husseins regime had demonstrated eagerness to comply with more recent mandates of the and to cooperate with inspectors because however much of the public debate focused on iraqs thencurrent wmd capabilities the leadership of the senate intelligence committee asked for an nie on the status of iraqs programs to develop weapons of mass destruction and delivery system the status of the iraqi military forces including their readiness and willingness to fight the effects usled attack on iraq would have on its neighbors and saddam husseins likely response to us military campaign designed to effect regime change in iraq 19 the nie was requested on an immediate basis operating under intense pressure the nie was drafted and made available to congress four weeks later on october 1 200220 an unclassified white paper containing many of the nies judgments was issued shortly thereafter21 in large measure the nie reinforced judgments that had previously been made in earlier intelligence products the nie maintained iraq has continued its weapons of mass destruction wmd programs in defiance of resolutions and restrictions baghdad has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of restrictions if left unchecked it will probably have nuclear weapon during this decade baghdad hides large portions of iraqs wmd efforts revelations after the gulf war starkly demonstrate the extensive efforts undert aken by iraq to deny information 22 17 snider sharing secrets with lawmakers p 49 arguably fullscale nie may have been more reliable 18 quoted in

determined to reconstitute their wmd programs and had made some progress in this effort this judgment was pervasive among intelligence analysts in this country and abroad indeed even some senior iraqi military leaders believed iraq had wmds in setting forth the evidence for wmd reconstitution however the nie relied on evidence and analysis that was subsequently determined to be deficient to large extent the judgment that iraq had begun reconstituting its nuclear capabilities depended on information regarding aluminum tubes that most but not all agencies judged to be designed for uranium enrichment effort there was fairly wide agreement that saddam hussein planned to reconstitute the wmd programs once iraq got out from under the sanctions regime in retrospect few would deny that saddam hussein had not relinquished his ultimate goal of having viable wmd capabilities and his failure to comply with obligations regarding inspections but it is clear that the intelligence community did not adequately flag the inherent uncertainties of the evidence supporting iraqs wmd capabilities in mid2002 23 intelligence agencies had provided copious information ab out iraqi wmd programs but ultimately did not reach accurate conclusions in part this failure resulted from the difficulty of the target but it is apparent in retrospect that intelligence officials provided congress with an overgeneralized estimate that relied heavily on widelyaccepted judgments tendency that has been described as cognitive bias highly limited collection from human sources and some of this reporting was wrong and did not offer better sense of the ambiguities and limitations of the available evidence in particular in this view the intelligence community conveyed sense of dynamism in regard to iraqi wmd programs that was not justified by evidence available this nie has been much debated the senate in telligence committee has reported two extensive and highly critical assessments of the nie 24 in 2004 the committee concluded that most of the major key judgments in the intelligence communitys october 2002 national intelligence estimate nie iraqs continuing programs for weapons of mass destruction either overstated or were not supported by the underlying intelligence reporting series of failures particularly in analytic trade craft led to the mischaracterization of the intelligence 25 23 significantly the nie did not offer contrarian case that saddam hussein did not have an active wmd program underway and was bluffing as far as is known one in the intelligence community made the assessment that iraq had only minimal wmd capabilities apparently one asked the question posed by joseph nye former chairman of the national intelligence council what would it take for this estimate to be dramatically wrong what could cause radically different outcome nye noted experts often resist this exercise since they know their country or region and have already presented all the plausible scenarios why waste any effort on scenarios that are by definition highly unlikely the answer is that such questions help to alert the policymakers to lowprobability but highimpact contingencies against which they might plan it also informs intelligence agencies about obscure indicators about which they should be collecting information joseph s nye jr peering into the future foreign affairs

states regarding weapons of mass destruction headed by laurence silberman and former senator charles robb also devoted attention to the nies shortcomings26 after the collapse of the saddam hussein regime the iraq survey team composed of experts from various us agencies looked at all evidence available on the ground in iraq and did not find evidence that iraq had an active wmd effort they did agree that there was likelihood of reconstitution once sanctions were lifted the iraq survey team concluded that saddam hussein saw many benefits to an ongoing wmd progra m but was primarily concerned with seeing sanctions lifted the team concluded that saddam hussein viewed iran as iraqs principal enemy in the region and that he believed wmd were necessary to counter iran 27 an important question is the extent to which the faulty nie influenced the congressional vote on the legislation that was enacted as the authorization for use of military force against iraq pl 107243 the nie made firm judgments about iraqs continuing wmd programs its links to terrorists etc and these judgments were reflected in the legislation28 pl 107243 did not however focus solely on wmd it emphasized long pattern of iraqi violations of resolutions and its brutal repression of its civilian population thereby threatening international peace and security in the re gions it also cited iraqs support of terrorist organizations that threaten the lives and security of united states citizens29 problem for the intelligence community was the heavy emphasis on wmd programs in the public debate prior to congressional consideration of the resolution that tended to obscure other factors that were not dependent on technical analyses of highly limited evidence30

1 29 28 one clause of pl 107243 argued that iraq remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by among other things continuing to possess and develop significant chemical and biological weapons capability actively seeking nuclear weapons capability nd supporting and harboring terrorist organizations another clause stated whereas iraqs demonstrated capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction the risk that the current iraqi regime will either employ those weapons to launch surprise attack against the united states or its armed forces or provide them to international terrorists who would do so and the extreme magnitude of harm that would result to the united states and its citizens from such an attack combine to justify action by the united states to defend itself 29 in addition to wmd concerns there has been ongoing controversy on the planning for stabilizing iraq once saddam husseins military had been overcome and the regime

g351g561after several accounts had appeared in the media the nies key judgments reflected the intelligence communitys conclusion that the global jihadist movement is spreading and adapting to counterterrorism efforts the jihadists the nie concluded will use improvised explosive devices and suicide attacks focused primarily on soft targets to implement their asymmetric warfare strategy and that they will attempt to conduct sustained terrorist attacks in urban environments much public commentary on the nie was directed towards its conclusions that the iraq conflict has become the cause celebre for jihadists breeding deep resentment of us involvement in the muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement the detailed analysis that supported these conclusions has not been made public but it worth noting that the nie does give some generalized attention to policy approaches for the united states and its allies that could affect the future of jihadist terrorism 32 the nie referred to the possibility of greater pluralism and more responsive political systems in muslim majority nations and the possibility that jihadists in iraq will be perceived as having failed it maintains that countering jihadists will require coordinated multilateral efforts that go well beyond operations to capture or kill terrorist leaders33 these brief references hardly exhaust the factors that will affect trends in global terrorism over the next decade the nie did not apparently address the question that has been the focus of much outside academic analysisthe overall religious and philosophical challenge by radical islam to western values arguably dialogue between western intellectuals and islamic leaders could be part of the equation the conclusions of this nie may suggest number of possible responses although nies can lay out in general terms the possible ramifications of different options some observers believe that neither the drafters of the nie nor the intelligence community as whole should be viewed as best placed to propose alternative approaches for us policy makers intelligence analysts can provide tentative assessments of the potential effect of various us initiatives but according to this perspective the full range of options will have to be developed elsewhere ultimately policies are frequently based not only on an appreciation of the international environment and the threat but also on the capabilities of the united states and its allies and budgetary and political constraints that they face these latter factors are not the responsibilities of intelligence analysts

now required to submit formal assessmen ts that highlight the strengths weaknesses and overall credibility of their sources used in developing the critical judgments of the nie in addition textbox is to be included in future nies to explain the meaning of terms such as we judge or we assess and the differences between high moderate and low confidence in various judgments the use of such terms has occasionally been source of confusion when they had come to have accepted meanings among analysts that were not well understood by policymakers written at time of intense congressional concern about the future of iraq and in response to congressional request the nies key judgments included finding that the overall security situation in iraq will continue to deteriorate unless serious efforts are made to reverse existing conditions the nie reviewed the various challenges facing the iraqismutually antagonistic ethnic communities the weakness of iraqi security forces and the extremist groups such as qaeda that act as accelerators of the inters ectarian struggle the nie maintained that coalition capabilities including force levels resources and operations remain an essential stabilizing element in iraq looking at the re gional environment the nie noted that although some of iraqs neighbors provide support that clearly intensifies the conflict in iraq the involvement of outside actors is not likely to be major driver of violence or the prospects for stability because of the selfsustaining character of iraqs internal sectarian dynamics undoubtedly the classified nie provides the evidentiary background of these judgments and discussion of the extent of the intelligence communitys confidence in the nies conclusions

december 3 2007 the office of the director of national intelligence released unclassified key judgments of nie prepared in november 2007 iran nuclear intentions and capabilities 35 donald kerr the principal deputy dni stated in covering memorandum that numerous statements based on 2005 assessment36 had been made on the record since our understanding of irans capabilities has changed we felt it was important to release this information to ensure that an accurate presentation is available37 the key judgments of the 2007 nie state that we judge with high confidence that in fall 2003 tehran halted its nuclear weapons program we also assess with moderatetohigh confidence that tehran at minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons the nie assessed that the program was was halted primarily in response to international pressure and argued that this assessment suggests that iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously 38 35 available at

g343g343g561the dramatic shift in analytical conclusions received extensive attention from the media and members of congress given iranian policies in the region iranian president ahamdinejads campaign against israels legitimacy and the efforts of the us and european allies to impose sanctions on iran until it complies with united nations security council demands that it cease uranium enrichment factor in the background may have been media reports that us strike against iranian nuclear sites had been under consideration39 the nies key judgments did not indicate that iran had ceased its nuclear efforts but in the view of some observers it undermined the urgency of the administrations efforts few would argue that the conclusions drawn by the nie should not have been brought to the attention of policymakers in the executive branch and congress but number of observers have argued that the key judgments overemphasized the importance of the nuclear weapon design and weaponization work at the expense of ongoing ur anium conversion and enrichment efforts that would be essential to achieving nuclear weapons capabilities dennis ross retired diplomat with long experience in the middle east noted while nothing has changed the nie has created new story line 40 according to ross the nie will unwisely focus public attention on nuclear weapons per rather than irans larger nuclear effort he writes weaponizing is not the issue developing fissionable materials is because compared with producing fissionable material which makes up the core of nuclear bombs weaponizing it is neither particularly difficult nor expensive41 former secretary of state henry kissinger argued we could be witnessing not halt of the iranian weapons programas the nie assertsbut subtle ultimately more dangerous version of it that will phase in the warhead when fissile material production has matured42 focus of the key judgments was the assessment iran ended its nuclear program in fall 2003 primarily in response to international pressure observers have noted that the key judgments did not indicate whether such international pressure included the collapse of saddam husseins regime in april 2003 it is plausible that iranian officials like the us intelligence community may have believed that iraq had wmd capabilities and when that turned out to be not the case made decision that its own nuclear program was longer necessary the released key judgments do not however address this issue the nies key judgments also suggest that some combination of threats of intensified international scrutiny and pressures along with opportunities for iran to achieve its security prestige and goals for regional influence in other ways mightif perceived by irans leaders as credibleprompt tehran to extent the current halt to its nuclear weapons program this judgment is based on an unacknowledged assumption being that irans goals can be accommodated by other countries including the us if they are pursued without an active wmd program this crucial issue also is not addressed in the released key judgments 39 see for instance tim shipman w ill he bombor is he bluffing george bush has ramped up

g343g344g561to what extent the release of the key judgments of the nie has changed the story line of us policy remains uncertain observers suggest that intelligence analysis with all its inevitable uncertainties and ambiguities seldom yields watertight argument for new policy policy builds upon the factual base that intelligence analysis provides but it is also built upon assessments of our own national interests that are beyond the mandate of the intelligence community recognizing that any iranian success in testing nuclear weapon in the near future would seriously undermine confidence in its core capabilities the intelligence community has presented important evidence about current iranian nuclear efforts these facts do not change us interests but only how they are pursued and how they are explained to the public although the story line may have to be adjusted the realities of us interests and the failure of the iranian regime to abide by its treaty commitments remain

g3g153g153g155g142g140g146g138g157g142g141g561 congress is and will continue to be an important consumer of national intelligence but there are concerns that heavy emphasis on mandating nies may not support the legislative process to the extent that some anticipate nies can provide the intelligence communitys best evidence and analysis on major issues of national security and can highlight areas where information is lacking but they usually require lengthy preparation and coordination before they can be disseminated the history of the nie on iraqi wmd suggests that compressing the production schedule can be counterproductive moreover conclusions of nies may not be informed by knowledge of initiatives planned or underway by others in the executive or legislative branches more public role for nies in debates on national security policy issues could obscure their inherent limitations and distort the discussion of the policy issues in some cases congress may find intelligence assessments or briefings prepared in less structured way and within tighter time constraints better serve its legislative needs than formal nies the creation of the office of the dni provides focal point from which the analytical capabilities of all intelligence agencies can be brought to bear on given issues even ones that are narrowly focused it is considered likely that combination of nies on some topics supplemented by more limited assessments supported by an ongoing dialogue with intelligence analysts may provide the most effective support to the legislative process nies are only one element of the national security decisionmaking process they can outline the effects of various policy approaches in general terms but it is unlikely that they will become the vehicles for detailed consideration of options that depend on the interrelationships of executive branch and congressional decisionmaking nies will arguably be most useful when they provide thorough assessment of given
