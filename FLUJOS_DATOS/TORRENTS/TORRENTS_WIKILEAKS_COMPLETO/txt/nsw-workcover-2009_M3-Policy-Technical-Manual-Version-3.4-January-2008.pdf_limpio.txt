written during the reporting period defined on the header reco rd and all changes to policy data that have not been previously reported to workcover workcover requires that only changed data records be reported ie policy term detail record that has not changed since last reporting period will not be reported in this reporting period regardless of other information that may need to be reported to workcover eg premium detail workcover requires claims data to be reported with corresponding policy reported to workcover it will be necessary to ensure that rele vant policy data has been reported to workcover in advance of related claims data where policy submission is provided on the same day as claim submission workcover will schedule the processing of the policy submission as priority where an abort err or prevents the loading of all policy data on submission including new policies or fatal error means the prevention of new policy being loaded to the workcover database related claims information for the new policypolicies on subsequent claims submission will not be accepted 21 identifying policies workcover requires and uses unique identifiers for policies policy terms and policy term transactions these identifiers are workcover policyholder identification number policy number agentinsure r number period commencement date and transaction date 211 policy workcover uses the policy and agentinsurer numbers to uniquely identify policy the policy number an agentinsurer reports to workcover for an employer must remain the same for all policy t erms 212 policy term the period commencement date with policy and agentinsurer numbers uniquely identifies the policy term workcovers computer system records data for each term of policy that is for each policy renewal year that the policy is in force agentsinsurers cannot amend the commencement data except by nulling refer to section 23 reporting of null policy terms agentsinsurers must submit data separately for each transaction on policy or policy term if activity occurs during the same submission period on two separate terms of the policy two separate sets of data are required one for each policy term it is also possible for data on the one policy term to be reported more than once in submission period hence there will be two or m ore sets of policy data on the submission for the policy term transaction date is used to uniquely identify each transaction with policy term and policy and to ensure they are processed in the correct sequence 213 policy term transaction agentsinsurers mu st only supply one transaction per day per policy term if the agentinsurer has processed two or more sets of data on one policy term on the same day that is with the same transaction date only the latest set of data for that day is required if more than one set of data is sent for the same policy term with the same transaction date that policy submission will be rejected document name policy technical manual version

the submission is written to the database reports of the errors will be emailed to the insurers data exchange email address after each submission has been validated agents must correct errors identified for policy in their computer system and resubmit the amended policy to workcover on the next data submission there is one report produced from the abort error process pol401 policy submission validation report layer 1 file abort 43 fatal and suspect er ror processing and r eporting this process is only run if the submission has passed the abort error checking it checks for data errors that the agent must correct in subseque nt submissions the submission is processed to workcovers database irrespective of the number of errors generated from the process workcover reserves the right to reject submissions which pass the abort error check but generate large number of fatal r suspect errors or contain other problems the agent will be required to correct and resubmit such submissions validation rules are divided into categories based on the severity of the error the validation rule categories are fatal and suspect fatal error processing fatal errors are major data errors such as incorrect format in an expected field individual policy terms in the submission file will be rejected where any fatal errors are detected the process checks the whole file for errors up to s pecified limit if this limit is exceeded the process will terminate under these circumstances n policy data from the submission is written to the database although header information is recorded suspect error processing suspect errors formerly kn own as non fatal errors identify suspect or potentially incorrect data these errors are less severe than fatal errors the agent must correct these errors if found to be incorrect in subsequent submissions 44 validation layer 1 file abort this validatio n layer will identify if the file is formatted correctly and acceptable for further validation criteria any file abnormalities will be identified during this layer of validations with the result being the return of the file to the agent for correction t his validation layer targets the accuracy
