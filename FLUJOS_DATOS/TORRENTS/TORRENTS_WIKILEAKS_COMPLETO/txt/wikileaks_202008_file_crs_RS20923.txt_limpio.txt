life insurance recent issues david l brumbaugh specialist in public finance government and finance division summary many life insurance policies contain both an insurance component and an investment element termed inside buildup the inside buildup receives favorable tax treatment under current law tax deferral postponement if policy is surrendered for cash prior to death or tax exemption if paid out as part of death benefits in the past the tax treatment of inside buildup has received attention in the context of congressional consideration of legislation to repeal the federal estate tax under current law assets transferred at death receive favorable tax treatment in the form of stepup in basis if repeal of the estate tax were to limit or repeal the stepup in basis tax planners might consider investment in insurance policies with large inside buildups as an alternative taxsaving strategy taxation of the inside buildup of insurance would rule out such tax planning strategy and would thus reduce the revenue loss associated with repeal of the estate tax however provisions taxing the inside buildup of life insurance were not included in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 the omnibus tax cut bill that included phaseout of the estate tax subsequent legislation passed by the house but not the senate to extend the estate tax repeal have not included taxation of the inside build up this report will not be updated inside buildup in life insurance policy occurs when the premiums on policy are more than sufficient to pay for cost of the insurance during the period covered by the premium for example the actual cost of insuring persons life is generally lower in the early years of lengthy whole life policy than in the later years when person is older yet such policies frequently are accompanied by level premiums that is the policies premiums are the same throughout the policys life so that premiums paid early in the policy are higher than the actual cost of providing insurance the excess is generally invested earning return the inside buildup that contributes to the cash value of the policy subject to certain restrictions inside buildup is not taxed under current law as it accrues the ultimate magnitude of the tax benefit depends on the policyholders congressional research service the library of congress crs2 disposition of the insurance policy if person surrenders policy in exchange for cash he or she is taxed on the cash value minus the value of premiums that have been paid in this case the inside buildup receives benefit in the form of tax deferral or postponement tax is ultimately paid on the inside buildup but not until the policy is cashed in note that the taxpayer receives an added tax benefit from the deduction of the premiums if person keeps policy until death the proceeds of the policy are not subject to tax in this case the inside buildup is never taxed1 taxpayers basis in an asset is best defined by reference to its practical function it is the amount that can be deducted from the assets sales proceeds when the asset is sold it is the portion of the sales proceeds that represents the return of capital itself rather than the return to capital frequently the basis is the assets acquisition cost when person sells an asset for example stock he is generally taxed on the sales proceeds minus his basis in the asset or what he paid for it under current law an heirs basis in an inherited asset is generally the assets fair market value at the time of death rather than the decedents basis in the asset thus if the asset appreciated during the decedents lifetime the heir receives step up in basis equal to the amount of that appreciation if the heir subsequently sells the asset he can therefore deduct the amount of appreciation that occurred during the decedents lifetime and is effectively not taxed on that appreciation2 bills that propose repeal of the estate tax frequently place restrictions on the stepup in basis the restrictions reduce the revenue cost of repealing the estate tax in particular both the house and senate bills to repeal the estate tax that were passed in the first part of 2001 would limit the stepup in basis to 13 million plus 3 million of assets transferred to surviving spouse during the early consideration of the estate tax legislation some suggested that any revenue gain from repealing or restricting the stepup in basis would be limited by the adoption of alternative taxsaving strategies by taxpayers seeking alternative ways to pass appreciated assets on to their heirs free of tax in particular some suggested that taxpayers might divert investments to life insurance policies with large inside buildup component as noted above if kept until death such policies would not be subject to tax in effect they could transmit appreciation to heirs free of tax accomplishing similar taxsaving function as the stepup in basis3 the insurance industry has generally opposed subjecting the inside buildup of polices to tax neither the house nor the senate versions of the omnibus tax cut bill congress passed in may 2001 contained provisions taxing inside buildup of life insurance policies nor did the version of the bill signed into law on june 7 as the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act 1 for

enactment in 2001 congress has actively considered making the estate tax repeal permanent the house has passed number of such measures including hr 8 108th congress in 2003 and hr 8 109th congress in 2005 also in july 2006 the house passed compromise reduction of the estate tax hr 5970 that would apply at the point egtrras repeal expires none of these bills contained provisions altering the tax treatment of the inside buildup in life insurance policies the inside buildup of life insurance was addressed in one of the two fundamental tax reform plans set forth by the presidents commission on tax reform in its final report of november 1 2005 under its simplified income tax plan two new expanded vehicles for taxfavored savings would be implemented one would be linked to retirement and one would not these expanded accounts would generally replace current laws taxfavored savings mechanisms such as individual retirement accounts and the inside buildup of insurance policies under the plan the increase in value of insurance policies would be treated as current income and subject to tax on an annual basis although insurance policies could also receive preferential treatment if purchased through one of the plans savings vehicles according to the commissions report such treatment would constitute more neutral treatment of saving through insurance compared to other savings instruments4 congress has not yet begun to actively consider legislation that embodies the commissions proposal 4 presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform simple fair and progrowth proposals to fix americas tax system washington 2005 p 123 the report is posted on the internet at httpwwwtaxreformpanelgovfinalreport the second of the commissions tax reform plans is generally consumption tax under whose terms the inside buildup of insurance like income from other savings would implicitly be tax exempt for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20923
