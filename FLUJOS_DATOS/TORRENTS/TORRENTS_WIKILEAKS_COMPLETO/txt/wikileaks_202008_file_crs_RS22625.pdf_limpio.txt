2007 p 75 3 michael d griffin testimony before the senate committee on commerce science and transportation subcommittee on space aeronau tics and related sciences february 28 2007the vision for space exploration on january 14 2004 president bush announ ced new goals for nasa the vision for space explorati on often referred to as the moonmars program the president directed nasa to focus its efforts on re turning humans to the moon by 2020 and some day sending them to mars nd worlds beyond twelve u s astronauts walked on the moon between 1969 and 1972 humans have vi sited mars the president further directed nasa to fulfill commitments made to the 13 countries that are its partners in the international space station iss in the 2005 authorization act congress endorsed the goals of the vision and directed nasa to establish program to accomplish them nasa is developing spacecraft called orion formerly the crew exploration vehicle and launch vehicle for it called ares i form erly the crew launch vehicle an earth orbit capability is planned by 2014 alt hough nasa consid ers early 2015 more likely with the ability to take astronauts to nd from the moon following later than 2020 nasa stresses that its strategy is to go as we can afford to pay with the pace of the program set in part by the available funding in 2004 the president proposed adding 1 billion to nasas budget for fy2005 through fy2009 to help pay for the vision but subsequent administration budgets more th an eliminated this increase and actual appropriations by congress have been even less most funding for the vision is thus being redirected from other nasa activities to free up funding for orion and ares i the space shuttle program will be terminated in 2010 and us use of the iss will end by 2017 nasa has not provided cost estimate for the vision as whole its 2005 implementation plan estimate s that returning astronauts to the moon will cost 104 billion not including the cost of robotic precursor missions or 20 b illion to use orion to service the iss1 report by the government ccountability office gives total cost for the vision of 230 billion over two decades2 the exploration systems mission direct orate esmd is responsible for implementing the moonmars program the fy2008 request for esmd was 3924 billion although this was substantia l increase from fy2007 the fy2007 appropriation was 750 million less than had been requested after adjusting for accounting changes nasa administrator michael gr iffin has testified that the fy2007 funding reduction and other factors will delay the schedule for orion and ares i by four to six months with an initial operating capability ie first crew ed flight now expected in early 20153 the house provided the requested amount for md while the senate provided 49 million increase for development of ares i the final appropriati on was 3821 billion or 103 million less than the request along with host of impleme ntation challenges the visi on creates issues about the balance between human space exploration and nasas other activities in science and aeronautics nasa administrator michael griffin has reportedly said that i will

keeping shuttle and station on track and then after that well fill up the bucket with our other priorities4 the 2005 authorization act emphasize d that nasa should have balanced set of programs including science and aeronautics as well as activities related to the vision the house and senate appropr iations committee reports for fy2008 again expressed concern about nas as programmatic balance nasa science programs the fy2008 request for the science ssion directorate smd was 5516 billion 5 increase from fy2007 after adjusting fo r accounting changes the request reflected net change from nasas previous plans which projected 1 growth in science funding each year through fy2011 in response to critics who note that 1 growth is less than inflation nasa officials sa that funding for science at nasa grew faster than the agencys total budget during the 1990s and early 2000s and that sustaining such increases is impossible they also st ate that the 32 share of nasa s budget allocated to science in the fy2008 request is significantly more than the 24 allocated to science programs in fy1992 accurate comparisons between current programs and fy1992 are difficult because of numerous intervening change s in how nasa presents its budget and categorizes expenditures the house and nate provided increases for science of 180 million and 139 milli on respectively the final appropriation was 5547 billion an increase of 31 million relative to the request in late 2006 nasa announced reorganizati on of the science mission directorate creating four divisions where previously ther had been three the main result of the reorganization was to create separate earth science division in the fy2006 and fy2007 budget cycles there was separate budget for earth science at nasa and supporters were concerned that this was adversely affecting the field the national research council nrc reco mmended in january 2007 that the united states should renew its investment in earth observing system s and restore its leadership in earth science and applications5 although the fy2008 request included increased funding for earth science and projected furthe r increases in fy2009 and fy2010 relative to previous plans most of the proposed increases were to cover cost growth and schedule delays in existing missions the house provided an increase of 60 million relative to the request to begin development of new missions based on the nrc survey as well as 60 million more for research and analysis to be allocated in an equitable fashion among the four science divisions the senate provided 138 million mo re than the request including 25 million to begin implementation of the nrc surv ey and 96 million more for earth science research the final appropriation for ea rth science was 27 million more than the request it included 40 million for nrc survey missions in the astrophysics division the fy2008 reque st reinstated funding for the sofia airborne infrared telescope but deferred the space interferometer mission sim beyondhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22625crs5 6 national research council decadal survey of civil aeronautics foundation for the future 2006 httpwwwnapeducatalog11664htmlfy2012 an initial operational capability for so fia is now expected in about 2010 and full operational capability in about 2013 the requested funding for sim in fy2008 was 22 million down from projected 139 milli on with further reductions projected in future years according to the budget request the lower funding level for sim would support engineering risk reduction mission desig n and core scientific expertise but actual development work the house pr ovided 72 million for sim which it said is ready for development in contrast the senate provided reductions in the navigator program which includes sim and urged nasa to reformulate navigator toward smaller mediumclass satellite development program the final appropriation for sim was 60 million nasa aeronautics research the fy2008 request for aeronautics res earch was 554 million although that was 163 million less than the fy2007 appropr iation it was 49 million more than nasa had projected for fy2008 in its previous plan s the house provided an increase of 146 million the senate provided the requested amount the final appropriation was 622 million an increase of 68 million relative to th request these funding changes follow significant changes in the structure and content of the program the release of major policy report on the future of aeronautics at nasa and the establishment of new national policy on fede ral aeronautics resear ch and development in late 2005 the nasa aeronautics program was refocused on core competencies in subsonic supersonic and hypersonic flight the former vehicle systems program was renamed fundamental ae ronautics to reflect its new char acter the other two programs aviation safety and airspace systems had their content reorganized fourth program the aeronautics test pr ogram was created to ensure th availability of wind tunnels and other test facilities whose c ontinued viability has been under pressure for several years in june 2006 the national research council re leased decadal st rategy for federal civil aeronautics activities with particular emphasis on nasas research program6 along with other recommendations the repor t identified 51 technology challenges to serve as the foundation for aeronautics research at nasa for the next decade the house committee report and the explanatory statement for the final bill both directed nasa to apply portion of its funding increase to the topranked priorities of the decadal survey in december 2006 as required by the fy 2006 appropriations act pl 109108 sec 628 president bush issued new nationa l aeronautics resear ch and development policy httpwwwostpgovhtmlnationala erordpolicy121906pdf the policy establishes general principles and goals for federal aeronautics activities lays out the roles and responsib ilities of nasa and other agencies nd directs the national science and technology council to issue national aer onautics rd plan by december 2007 and at least every two years thereafter the house committee report urged nasa to continue to support the principles and objectives outlined in the policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22625crs6 7 michael d griffin testimony before the senate committee on commerce science and transportation subcommittee on space aeronautics and related sciences november 15 2007the space shuttle and the international space station construction of the iss suspended after the columbia disaster in february 2003 resumed in september 2006 nasa plans 10 s huttle flights in 2008 2010 to complete the iss plus one mission in 2008 to service the hubble space telescope nasa has also allocated 500 million over five years to help privatesector companies develop lowcost space transportation systems that could serv ice the iss after the shuttle is retired the gap between the end of shuttle flight s in 2010 and the expected availability of orion in 2015 raises several issues some an alysts are concerned that placing fixed termination date on the shuttle may create schedule pressure similar to that identified as contributing factor in the columbia disaster some question whether the united states should be dependent on russia to launch us astronauts to the iss during the gap period major concern is how nasa will retain its skilled workforce during the transition from shuttle to orion especially if orions sc hedule slips and the gap lengthens the explanatory statement for the final bill directed the gove rnment accountability office to review nasas transition plans and provide qua rterly updates administrator griffin has testified that orions first flight could be moved forwar d to september 2013 at the cost of an additional 2 billion7 considering the modest iss research agenda that remains some question is whether completing the iss is worth the cost more than 2 billion per year plus about 4 billion per year for the shuttle alternatively some want to restore the iss research program for example the 2005 authorizati on act directs that 15 of iss research spending be used for nonvisionrelated researc h fulfilling us commitments to its international partners in the iss russia japan ca and 10 countries in euro pe is seen as essential by some observers others find this rationale insufficient to justify the expense the fy2008 request included 6792 billi on for the space operations mission directorate which consists of the space shuttle the iss and the space and flight support program this was an increase of about 11 above the fy2007 ppropriation but almost the entire increase was previously planned to reflect the schedule of iss construction new funding for two add itional tracking and data relay system tdrs satellites required for ground communications with nearearth sp acecraft was approximately offset by reductions in reserves for the shuttle and the iss the senate provided approximately the requested amount the house provided 20 million less for the iss mostly from reserves provided 80 million less for space and flight support and rejected the requested increase for tdrs procurement the final appropr iation was 6734 billion including 27 million less than the request fo r the shuttle and 30 million less for the iss senate floor amendment provided an additional 1 b illion in emergency funding for the post columbia shuttle returntoflight effort the final appropriation did not include this provision
