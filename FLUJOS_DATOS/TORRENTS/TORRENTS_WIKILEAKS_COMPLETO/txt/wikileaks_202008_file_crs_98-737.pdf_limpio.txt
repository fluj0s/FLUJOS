for the report along with joint explanatory statement of the managers to be presented to the house and senate for consideration conference report must be filed and considered in one chamber at time when chamber is in possession of the official conference papers in the senate rule xxviii allows conference reports to be presented or filed at almost any time the chamber is in legislative session provided that the senate is in possession of the conference papers exceptions to this procedure include time when the journal is being read question of order or motion to adjourn is pending during quorum call or while the senate is voting for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml the presentation of conference report includes its reading and conference report must be read on the demand of any senator typically the senate routinely dispenses with the reading by unanimous consent under standing order adopted by the senate at the end of the 106 th congress the reading of conference report is not required if the report is available in the senate under senate rule xxviii conference reports are required to be printed as senate reports however when conference report has already been printed by the house the senate also routinely dispenses with this requirement g6g142g139g138g157g146g151g144g561g5g152g151g143g142g155g142g151g140g142g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g156g561 the consideration of conference report is highly privileged and after it is read conference report may be called up for consideration at almost any time another matter is not pending motion to proceed to the consideration of conference report is not debatable the conference report itself however is debatable and consideration follows normal senate procedures senate rule xxviii clause 5 provides that if time for debate on the consideration of conference report is limited by unanimous consent agreement the time allotted for debate is to be equally divided and controlled by the majority and minority parties the chamber that agrees to request for conference is normally the one to consider conference report first this is significant because the first chamber to act can agree or disagree to conference report or it can agree to preferential motion to recommit the report to conference however after one chamber has acted on report its conferees are discharged and the other chamber may only accept or reject the conference report if the second house rejects conference report the measure is left in the procedural situation it was in before the conference was requested in such circumstance one house could propose new position to the other house as an amendment between the houses or it could request new conference in the event that conference report is recommitted or rejected and the measure submitted to new conference committee all of the matters originally sent to conference are again before the conferees novo for consideration httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98737g8g149g152g152g155g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151

senate point of order may be made against conference report at any time during its consideration prior to its adoption but it cannot be made until after the conference report has been read or the reading dispensed with points of order may be made against conference reports on variety of grounds for example the limitations established in the congressional budget act generally apply to conference report as well as to bill during initial consideration points of order that are either waived or not raised during initial consideration are not implicitly waived for the conference report senate rule xxviii provides that conferees may not insert in their report matter not committed to them by either house nor shall they strike from the bill matter agreed to by both houses any conference report to the contrary would be subjec t to point of order when one house strikes everything after the enacting clause and inserts substitute for the entire bill the conferees have wide latitude to effect compromise in such case senate precedents permit the conferees to report any germane modification as long as it does not include new matter entirely irrelevant to the subject of the bill sent to conference point of order against conference report is not debatable although an appeal of ruling of the presiding officer would be point of order may only be made against the conference report and not against the language in the joint explanatory statement if the senate is the first chamber to act on conference report the effect of point of order being sustained is for the conference report to be recommitted to the conference committee if the senate is the second chamber to act on conference report the effect of successful point of order is that the conference report falls and any further consideration of the measure must follow some alternate route in the same manner as if the report had been defeated
