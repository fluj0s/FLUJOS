standards act flsa persons with various physical or mental disabilities or persons who have vision impairment or are blind can be employed at rates below the otherwise applicable federal minimum wage under certificates issued by the secretary of labor their wages are set at level commensurate with their productivity and reflective of rates found to be prevailing in the locality for essentially the same type quality and quantity of work for these workers under current law there is other statutory wage rate the origins of section 14c treatment of persons with disabilities go back at least to the national industrial recovery act nira of 19331935 under the nira productivitybased sub minimum wage arranged through system of ce rtificates was established for persons with disabilities in competitive industry such workers were payable at 75 of the industry minimum in sheltered workshops there was wage floor the nira was declared unconstitutional in 1935 with passage of the flsa in 1938 the certification system was reestablished under section 14 of the act statutory wage floor was set for persons with disabilities though administratively minimum wages for the disabled in competitive industry came to be set at 75 of the federalflsa minimum in the sheltered workshops the floor was productivitybased with lower limit under the 1966 flsa amendments the system was modified the rate for persons with disabilities was set in statute at not less than 50 of the flsa minimum both in competitive industry and in workshops except that in separate work activities centers where employment was largely therapeutic and its economic content inconsequential there was statutory floor charges of inequities followed together with rapid expansion of employment in the work activities centers some suggested that workers with vision impairment should not on that basis alone be included under the section 14 reduced wage option number of studies subsequently reviewed operation of the system congressional hearings on the issue were conducted repeatedly through the years in 1986 section 14c was amended to remove the separation of workshops and work activities centersand to eliminate any statutory wage floor for persons with disabilities in certificated employment in theory such workers were to be paid wage commensurate with their productivity in 1994 further hearings were held and it was asserted that the entire system of productivitybased subminimum wage rates was inequitable and unworkable the law however supported by empl oyers of workers with disabilities was not altered the issue resurfaced in the 107 th congress but action was taken on the proposal new legislation dealing with section 14c was introduced in either the 108th or 109th congressesand none as yet in the 110th congress

14c of the flsa to the extent necessary to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment the secretary of labor may permit payment of wages lower than the otherwise applicable federal minimum to persons whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by age physical or mental deficiency or injury the reduced wage option operates under system of certificates issued by the secretary specific wage floor is mandated however the section 14c rate is to be broadly commensurate with those wages paid to nonhandicapped workers employed in the vicinity in which the individuals under certificates are employed for essentially the same type quality and quantity of work the section 14c wage is to be related to the individuals productivity1 section 14c of the flsa is narrowly focused it deals only with workers who because of disability are deemed to have their productivity for the particular type of work in which they are engaged reduced below that of nondisabled workers because of that putative diminished productivity they are payable at wage below the otherwise applicable federal minimum where such workers earn in excess of the federal minimum wage section 14c is not applicable2 some section 14c workers are employed in sheltered workshops others in regular firms by the mid1990s there were 5912 certificated rehabilitation centers employing about 241000 disabled workers in competitive employment there were 1809 certificates for authorized employment of 6807 workers3 of the universe of workers with disabilities covered by section 14c only small number list visual impairment as their primary disability the most numerous categories being retardation or mental illness stat istical measurement in this area is complicated in that workers may have single disability or may have multiple disabilities further with training or placed in specialized work environment they may be able to overcome one of their disabilities but not another and those employed under section 14c represent relatively small proportion of persons with disabilitiesor for that matter of persons with disabilities who are employed but who are outside the section 14c system 4 1 section 214c of the fair labor standards act as ame nded the act is the primary federal statute dealing with minimum wages overtime pay child labor and related issues 2 this report focuses narrowly upon section 14c of the flsa for broader consideration of issues involving persons with employment disabilities see crs report 98921 the americans with disabilities act ada statutory language and recent issues by nancy lee jones 3 us department of labor employment standards administration minimum wage and overtime hours under the fair labor standards act 1998 report to the congress required by section 4d1 of the fair labor standards act washington june 1998 p 42 hereafter cited as dol section 4d1 report the certificates the department notes include temporary certificates for trainees that were issued by state vocational rehabilitation agencies and the veterans administration and certificates issued for school workexperience programs where workers have multiple disabilities an accurate count with di stinction as to primary andor sec ondary disability may prove difficult further disabled workers like others may move in and out of the workforce it is not always clear how long disabled worker may remain engaged in sheltered employment or how many persons may find sheltered employment shortterm expedient wage data are similarly problematic wages for such workers are in theory commensurate with their productivity but since productivity may vary with shift from one production process to another their commensurate wage can be flexible specific wage data are not readily available 4 estimates of the number of persons with disabilities and of their employment status vary substantially depending upon the definition of disability and of employment concepts that appear to differ from one context to another in 1997 there would seem to have been about 14 million persons with disabilities in the labor force see john m mcneil employment earnings and disability paper

whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by physical or mental disability including those relating to age or injury for the work to be performed italics added such disabilities may include blindness mental illness mental retardation cerebral palsy alcoholism and drug addiction the regulations acknowledge that disability which may affect earning or productive capacity for one type of work may not affect such capacity for another5 employment is defined broadly in the flsa to suffer or permit to work the existence of an employment relationship does not depend upon the level of performance or whether the work is of some therapeutic benefit patients working within an institutional context may be classified as employees if the work performed is of any consequential economic benefit to the institution 6 some difficulty may arise in distinguishing strictly charitable or therapeutic activity from marginally profitable work casebycase judgments are necessary disability is not unilateral judgment on the part of an employer the nature and extent of the disability must be assessed together with the precise relationship between the disability and reduced productivity disability unrelated to productivity is insufficient for section 14c purposes comparison must be made between the productivity of the workers with disabilities and the norm established for nondisabled workerswith careful documentation maintained by the employer for each of these measurements carefully structured system has to be in place 7 continued disabilities federal da ta sources and trends by dennis m roth under executive order 13078 of march 13 1998 president clinton established national task force on employment of adults with disabilities to be chaired by the secretary of labor inter alia the task force bls and the census bureau was directed to design and implement statistically reliable and accurate met hod to measure the employment rate of adults with disabilities and to report pr ior to termination of the task force in 2002 5 concerning regulatory language see 29 cfr 525 6 there is specialized certificate program for patient workers in 1996 376 certificates were issued for authorized employment of 14472 see dol section 4d1 report p 42 cited above 7 whether such systems actually are in place and the extent to which they are feasible is part of the continuing debate

workers with disabilities the terms of the certificate are to be made known to the worker and where appropriate parent or guardian of the worker when disabled worker is hired an initial evaluation of his or her productivity shall be made within the first month after employment begins in order to determine the workers commensurate wage rate italics added further the employer must agree to review the wage rates paid to such workers at least once every six months and b to review the wages of all section 14c employees at least once each year to insure that the section 14c wages reflect changes in the prevailing wage paid to experienced nondisabled individuals employed in the locality for essentially the same type of work the worker or the parent or guardian of the worker may appeal to the secretary concerning the circumstances of his or her employment under the commensurate rate there is effective floor it can vary from zero to the full flsa minimum where workers are paid in excess of the regular flsa minimum wage the wage requirements of section 14c are basically moot

during the early years of the flsa has sparked range of questions for example is the subminimum wage commensurate rate equitable and appropriate does it lend itself to abuse and has the section 14c program been monitored effectively by the dol beyond these concerns some have questioned whether the blind based upon their vision impairment alone ought to be included under the section 14c commensurate wage option might approaches other than the sub minimum wage option under section 14c be more effective in providing income rehabilitation and other services to persons with disabilities within sheltered employment within the context of section 14c other more technical queries have also been raised the regulations implementing section 14c require substantive standards for measurement of the locally prevailing wage rate upon which in part the commensurate wage paid the disabled worker is based in methodological terms such determination can be complex for firm or agency employing persons with disabilities to secure comparable wagebenefit data from competing firmsin the locality and engaged in essentially the same type of workalso presents problems comparability may pose question namely finding the same or similar production processes product lines equipment work organization managerial input etc when is worker disabled for section 14c purposes how is impairment measuredand by whom while there must be relationship between the specific disability and the type of work performed with resultant diminished productivity would the worker be equally disabled in all occupational circumstances what if the work were more carefully structured or if specialized equipment were utilized are all deviations from the norm equally burdensome and equally an impairment for example physical disability mental retardation loss or partial loss of vision continued with respect to section 14c and is discussed below

circumstances where workers have multipledisabilities significant sophistication and staff training may be required disabled persons in sheltered workshops often work as teams which raises further questions concerning wage rates dol regulations note employers may pool earnings only where piece rates cannot be established for each individual worker as for example in team production where each workers individual contribution to the finished product cannot be determined separately in such situations the employer is admonished to make every effort to objectively divide the earnings according to the productivity level of each individual worker 8 such disaggregation however may be impossible even though most operators of sheltered workshops are charitable or nonprofit institutions or governmental entities they are nonetheless empl oyers and have labormanagement relationship with section 14c workers where such workers are not covered by collective bargaining agreement who bargains for them who negotiate s for them in the employment process their disabilities may reduce their options for other employment shaping the power balance in the labormanagement relationship where section 14c workers are represented by parent or guardian there may be subtle conflict of interest allowing the disabled person to engage in useful activity even if largely custodial may be of primary importance whether that activity is also economically productive may be of less concern to the parent or guardian the section 14c reduced wage option is permitted though certification by the secretary of labor but how closely does dol monitor the ac tual wages and working conditions of such employees and inspect sheltered workshops or work activities centers when an inspection is made are the concerns of the workerssome blind some perhaps unable to speak clearly others emotionally disturbed or mentally retardedgiven appropriate weight visavis those of the supervisory staff is there similarity of interest among all section 14c workers regardless of the severity of their disabilities 9 are differences of individual productivity adequately taken into account when structuring workand with respect to wages while there is complex system through which worker or his or her parent or guardian can appeal to the department is the process effective and effectively available to

much else about the flsa are linked to the nira of the early new deal under the nira 19331935 codes of conduct which normally included minimum wage overtime pay and related standards were written for most industries once in place they provoked flood of complaints that employer s took advantage of the codes to break down decent standards some charged that ordinary workers were artfully classified in order to exempt them from otherwise applicable standards while categories of work traditionally performed by the older workers and by minorities were defined as beyond the reach of the codes 11 on february 17 1934 president roosevelt issued an executive order defining the treatment of persons with disabilities under the nira he decreed that person whose earning capacity is limited because of age physical or mental handicap or other infirmity might with dol certification be employed on light work at wa ge below the minimum established by code wage floor was established other than that specified in the certificates for employment dol set about development of methods of determining who are substandard workers but then delegated actual operation of the programoption to the several state agencies 12 to prevent manipulation of the system by employers seeking lowwage labor under the pretense of helping persons with disabilities certificates specified the nature of the disability of each individual worker his or her work history pr ospective wage etc with place for doctors estimate of the specific physical or mental condition13 linkage between impairment and productivity was necessary with the wage reduction proportionate to the reduction in their the workers efficiency14 with time these workers came to be divided into three classifications under the nira first there were employees of sheltered workshops where the wage floor was set by the charitable institution15 second there were disabled workers in the private forprofit sector where the floor in the absence of special code provision could not be less than 75 percent of the minimum wage in the industry such workers could not constitute more than 5 percent of the working 11 these assertions may need further

afforded certain persons who by virtue of disability were employed in industrial homework17 when the nira was declared to be unconstitutional may 27 1935 its requirements were largely set aside18 two years later in may 1937 president roosevelt called for enactment of federal wage and hour legislation proposal that touched off year of debatepart of which focused upon workers who might be regarded at outside the mainstream during hearings on the legislation labor secretary frances perkins endorsed reduced wage option for substandard workers whom she understood to include persons who by reason of illness or age or something else are not up to normal production 19 as consideration of the legislation progressed it became less clear how substandard workers and or something else might be interpreted some argued that in certain regions of the country namely in the south workers tended to be slower of movement and less oriented toward production and thus they should be payable as substandard workers others saw the option as device through which to di scriminate against negro workers as was done under nra 20 such concerns set the stage for ongoing debate over subminimum wages for various segments of the workforce in general reduced wage for workers with disabilities under the flsa seemed to provoke little concern largely following nira practice the 1938 statute read section 14 the employment of individuals whose earning capacity is impaired by age or physical or mental deficiency or injury under special certificates issued by the administrator at such wages lower than the minimum wage and for such period as shall be fixed in such certificates thus for persons with disabilities the wage floor was whatever the administrator determined was appropriate president roosevelt signed the flsa on june 25 1938 the wage and hour administrator dol sensitive to issues raised during the hearings affirmed special certificate will be issued fo r worker because he is shown to be slow or inexperienced unless he is handicapped within the meaning of the act and these regulations administratively he set wage floor of not less than 75 of the standard 25 cent federal minimum wage ie 17½ cents per hour however fearing that the 17½ cent rate might disrupt the work of rehabilitation being carried on by charitable groups he ruled that the wages in the sheltered workshops would be set on the basis of earning capacity 21 thus in practice dual standard was established productivity wage in sheltered workshops specific minimum rate for other sheltered employment 16

the program that would evolve as section 14c under the nira special sheltered workshop committee had been established with representatives of charitable institutions and social work organizations one it appears was specifically representative of workers with disabilities22 under the flsa the department again called for counsel from leaders in the field of rehabilitation among the handicapped but it was not clear who spoke for the persons with disabilities as workers institutional spokespersons inevitably wore two hats first as representatives of charitable institutions or related organizations and second as employers of the disabled or associates of such employers in the latter context they were employers of unorganized workers by definition suffering disability likely disadvantaged economically and perhaps unable effectively to represent themselves in the labormanagement relationship calling upon the social services and sheltered workshop community for leadership had certain logic but it also presented potential conflict of interest the pattern would persist to the end of the century

transitional period and b to require that the more severely disabledstill under dol certificationbe paid not less than 50 of the otherwise applicable minimum 23 employers of the disabled were critical of the morse proposal branding it unrealistic and drain on the economy and forecast that its enactment would deprive severely disabled people of the opportunity for employment24 during these debates cleavage developed between the blind and other workers with disabilities in the early 1960s there had been movement by some organizations for the blind and others to eliminate the minimum wage

1966 it appears the number of persons with disabilities served under section 14 increased substantially further clients enrolled in sheltered programs appear to have had higher level of severity of disability than those of prior years there seems also to have been increased pressure with respect to productivity and outplacement and enhanced tension among groups of disabled workersclients at the same time the average hourly earnings in workshops had not kept pace with the statutory minimum 31 perhaps for all of these reasons congressional oversight in 1978 seems to have focused upon sheltered employment of persons with vision impairment should they continue to be part of the sheltered programs and if so upon what basis and through how long period in june 1977 representative phillip burton dca introduced legislation to prohibit payment of section 14c subminimum wages to individuals who are blind or whose sight is impaired the burton bill was not intended to exclude persons with vision impairment from sheltered employment merely to insure that were they so employed they would be paid at least the federal minimum wage the sheltered industry argued that such payment would be

engaged in team production when person who is victim of cerebral palsy or who had some other disability is being paid according to his ability to produce i would suggest he said that it is not33 proponents of the burton bill suggested that bli nd workers were often victimized by their employers sometimes by indirection even by nonprofit and quasicharitable employers they argued that sheltered workshops perhaps because of their charitable and welfare orientation were often not structured for profitability and production managerial practice in such establishments it was argued tended to be soft with managers failing to manage further it was argued employment in the workshops could have negative impact on workers skills and self confidence retarding transition to competitiv employment for example payment of sub minimum wage could be constant reaffirmation of the workers putative inability to produce they noted conflict of interest where the workshops are expected to compete in the market while transitioning their best workers to competitive industry the system of certification is open to abuse and has been abused gashel stated it is confusing and cumbersome how can blind worker have any confidence that he or she is receiving what the law allows he noted the complex structure of certification and argued that only lawyer an accountant or perhaps federal bureaucrat can determine how they relate and apply in any particular case 34 it should be noted that while these arguments were made by advocates for the blind they could be used as well to argue against subminimum wage rates for certain other disabled workers industry tended to oppose the burton bill as managers with responsibility for diverse groups of clientworkers they saw different set of opportunities and challenges and tended to emphasize the therapeutic value of work not its economic rewards some blind persons they conceded may be fully competitive with sighted individuals others may need an opportunity to work in sheltered employment where the pace is restrained supervision is readily available and accommodation can be made for idiosyncracies such opportunities are costly both in terms of staff and of diminished overall production subminimum wage helps offset those costs what some may perceive as managerial inefficiency the industry suggested may well be adjustment by staff to the special needs of workers in different stages of skill development similarly while an absence of sophisticated equipment may reflect the fiscal constraints of quasi charitable institutions it may also be an accommoda tion to the skill levels of workforce that is by definition and recruitment disabled finally team approach to work institutional witnesses suggested provides context for learning and grow th there may be utility in mixing workers of differing levels of growth in single production process so that they learn from each other the hearing also focused on dol administration of the

entered the job market through socalled sheltered workshopssheltered by law that is from having to pay the blind workers the minimum wage further many of the blind workers feel they are working at coolie wages helping to fatten the profits not only of the charities that run the workshops but also of the big companies that contract with them workshop administrators they stated justify the low rates on at least two grounds that blind workers produce less and that in any case most blind workers receive other benefits through social security payments and tax exemptions they wrote about low wages and adverse working conditionsand about blind workers allegedly fired for prounion activity management had opposed unionization the journal reported it suggested that to management its blind workers arent employees but clients italics added kwitny and landauer went on to discuss administrative and financial practices within the workshops and the related institutions the allegedly high salaries for administrators some said to be military personnel on pension and the relationship between the workshops and the business community were the workshops operating under an unfair competitive

beard dri conducted two days of oversight hearings on section 14c and on legislation reintroduced by representative burton the hearings produced little consensus among worker and employer witnesses but did suggest overall that something was amiss dol confirmed that its oversight of the program had been inadequatebut it offered little hope of substantive improvement internally the system of sheltere d employment seemed conflicted with growing tensions between the least and most severely disabled the wage rate determination process it was argued was inadequate nor did employers of the disabled provide totally clear picture of who they were and what their mission was as the lead witness representative patricia schroeder dco charged that the industry was guilty of workshop schizophrenia it was critical issue that would infuse debates on the issue through the next two decades she noted that some workshops consider themselves to be both rehabilitation center providing services to their clients and place of employment providing work to their employees the dichotomy could not be ignored with impunity she called for top to bottom reorganization of the system with the crucial first step that workshops come to regard their clients as employees 39

dol administration of the section 14c program the primary departmental witness was donald elisburg assistant secretary for employment standards since the beginning of the cart er administration with responsibility inter alia over section 14c elisburgs opening comments were largely factual and routine he assured the subcommittee that dol cares about the welfare of workers in sheltered workshops and is committed to the vigorous enforcement of fair labor standards in those workshops he noted there were then 4000 certificated workshops employing nearly 180000 workers with work activities centers accounting for slightly over twothirds of all sheltered workshop employment increasingly he stated certificated employment was of the severely handicapped thus he stated the yardstick for measuring the success of workshop cannot simply be how many leave to enter competitive employment but must also be measured in more human termsthe sense of accomplishment and selfrespect as well as income earned 40 elisburg acknowledged that the workshop program had long been considered routine and had suffered from lack of attention by the policy makers of several successive administrations the program he said was relatively obscure with little attention focused upon it applications for subminimum wage employment were rout inely approved the wagehour division had demonstrated low priority for investigations compliance staff were not afforded the specialized training needed for dealing with the special procedures and technical problems 39 us congress house subcommittee on labor

division did not have an accurate barometer against which to measure the productivity of the handicapped worker41 this was not an indictment from new appointee assessing the neglect of his predecessor elisburg here was three years into his tour of duty his performance was under review although workers with disabilities apparently were not primary concern for dol elisburg recognized need to strengthen the management of the program and to commit more of our resources to its enforcement in fy1979 he reported dol had found 57 of workshops investigated were in violation of the wage requirements of the flsa but he also acknowledged that the department expected to investigate only 10 of the 4000 wo rkshops during fy1980 that is that workshop employer of the disabled could expect to be investigated only once in decade 42 he stressed the need for highly trained investigators better training for workshop managers heightened awareness on the part of workers of their rightsand increased computerization to help with monitoring certification we believe that we are now moving in the right direction our managers he stated now understand that we expect the sheltered workshop program to be more than paper processing operation 43 what could workers with disabilities expect from dol chairman beard challenged elisburg was reassuring if we are properly running this workshop program if we are carefully looking at these applications and the standards against which individuals are measured those people with disabilities who are in these workshops should not be impeded in their productivity pointing to hearing room packed with people who he argued feel that the law had not functioned properly chairman beard queried what guarantees can you give them elisburg again was reassuring it is hard to give anyone total guarantee but we have stepped up our investigations we are very responsive to complaints then he added to the extent there has been exploitation it should never have been allowed we are simply not going to allow it in the future 44 g3g156g156g142g155g157g146g152g151g156g496g561g18g155g152g561g138g151g141g561g5g152g151g561 divisions of philosophy were

therapy or wages it means that there is place to go where people are friendly understanding and accepting place where the person has the chance to make real contribution to be appreciated as valuable member of team effort and to participate in meaningful and stimulating environment 45 but to pay such people minimum wage daugherty argued would be disastrous46 he noted that sheltered workshops survive on contract work much the same way as small businesses do and they must be efficient and wellmanaged to survive without profits from the market where the workshops compete their clientemployees would not receive the counseling and training services that are necessary adjuncts to productive employment47 the goods and services provided by sheltered workers must be available at fair market price explained charles w fletcher committee for purchase from the blind and other severely handicapped the subminimum wage under sectio n 14c he stated permits workshops to maintain direct labor costs which are generally competitive with the direct labor costs for commercial industry48 the impact of raising the wage of workshop employees he argued would have an adverse impact upon the ability of the workshops to compete49 dean phillips goodwill industries viewed workshop s as very special kind of enterprise with special type of employee or client the basic purpose is not to make money or to be the most efficient producers but to provide real work setting for evaluation and training and further to provide employment for persons who cannot find or retain work in the competitive labor market because of disability or disadvantaging condition 50 phillips added we are certainly in favor of paying our handicapped clients the minimum wage and more when and where they can earn it but sheltered workshops must operate in the real world in the last analysis he seemed to say the workshops are businesses with due respect for the bottom line when workshops face wage increases due to new minimum wage levels the workshop must face the same problem that businesses face they must 1 increase efficiency 2 obtain more productive workers or 3 raise the price of the goods and services produced to get more productive and efficient clients often means getting clients with less severe handicaps 51 the workshops he noted are not immune to the fluctuations of the marketplace they are separate entities operating in an economic environment to obtain capital labor and commodities to deliver their services are the disabled then clients or lowwage labor or both phillips observed we are in reality special type of small business competing in free enterprise system to maintain solvency to sustain growth and to continue providing services to handicapped people

stated the issue differently if the disabled were unable to earn substantial portion of the minimum pay they received it might rob these workers of the incentive to exert their best efforts if they were to receive the minimum wage regardless of their productivity larkin reasoned it could inhibit his motivation toward increased upward mobility and in reality encourage less productivity53 as professionals in the rehabilitation and welfare of blind people armand leco rhode island association for the blind suggested it is better for those requiring sheltered workshop situation to have employment at lower wage than wage at all 54 g25g152g155g148g142g155g550g5g149g146g142g151g157g561g18g142g155g156g153g142g140g157g146g159g142g156g561 not unexpectedly workers viewed the issue differently kenneth jernigan of nfb challenged that the agencies which serve the blind and the workshops which employ the blind have often assumed the status of selfappointed spokesman for the blind 55 he urged the subcommittee to be alert to that distinction and pointed to the myth of diminished productivity to which the blind are subject and which provides the basis for an elaborate network of agencies societies and associations which purport to help the blind while paying them the lowest possible wages56 productivity jernigan stated rests largely with management section 14c he charged unfairly discriminates by setting up class of workers who are blind or handicapped and then forcing the members of this class to justify every penny of their paychecks by means of productivity ratings while working under conditions and with equipment over which they have control workshop productivity he argued is impacted by factors which are exclusively within the hands of management and is largely depend ent on what management does or conversely on what management fails to dopoor job layout deliberate workstretching by the workshop during periods when contracts are slow assembly lines slowed down to the lowest common denominator 57 establishment of normal productivity rates using the prevailing standards for similar work in similar industry as base he contended is also unfair sheltered work has little resemblance or parallel to the tasks which can be found commonly in open industry and even where there are similarities you will find marked differences in production methods workshops tend to be labor intensive where more mechanized production is used in the competitive industry contracting practices also pose problem with small contracts and intermittent work which means that the workshops barely have time to work out the bugs in the production line before the project is over these industries he noted are generally not specialized yet their productivity standards are based on the prevailing rates in plants which are 58 thus data from which to develop commensurate wage rates are dubious finally he suggested there is the matter of labor standards compliance since dol is not exceedingly knowledgeable in what 53 ibid pp 166167 ralph sanders blind industries and services of maryland observed that employees without regard to their vision respond to reward

there w ould be especially strong disagreement between representatives of blind workers and the industry the role of work activities centers and calculation of commensurate wage rate the place of work activities centers in 1966 congress had provided for separation of work activities centers wacs from the regular workshops the nfb agreed if the concept of work activity center where primarily therapeutic and rehabilitation functions are performed is valid then it is markedly different from regular sheltered workshop where productive business activity predominates 61 if physically separate from the workshops and some argued that they were not62 how were wacs treated in other respects were wacproduced goods of inconsequential value marketed with products from the regular workshops where services counseling rehabilitative assistance were available in both settings were they arranged separately did this result in redundancy did the presence of less impaired workers in wac provides positive role models for severely disabled wac workers aiding in their socialization to the worldofwork might workers informally or by assignment move from wac to workshop and what of funding james cox national association of rehabilitation facilities testified that some believe separation of wacs from the regular workshops inhibits productivity and upward mobility for wac clients we believe he stated that facilities holding both types of certificates should not be required to integrate clients but should be permitted to integrate less productive and more productive workers when the results will be higher productivity and wages and facilitation of the rehabilitation goals of wac clients 63 but in practice how are wacs and workshops distinguished one from the other the nfb would argue conversely that wacworkshop integration inhibits productivity results in lower wages and could discourage the more severely disabled who might not be able to compete prevailing wage and commensurate

trade associations trade unions and government agencies but if the workshop cannot afford to pay the hourly rate because of the extent of submarginal workers it then applies to dol for certification for payment of lower wage64 thus several elements are immediately involved any one of which can distort the appropriateness of the wage to be paid first are the locally prevailing wage rate determinations accurate since these seem to be made by each individual workshop for each product line and for each production process the burden could be substantial it could also require high level

made presumably by the employer as to whether the workshop can afford to pay the locally prevailing rate fourth the entire process must be reviewed by dolunless certification is more or less automatic complexities abound is the sheltered workshop even roughly comparable to competitive industry are the production processes similar jones remarks piece rates from industry are rarely used because workshops operations are usually modified in order to adapt to the capabilities of blind workers 65 since rates apply to individual production processes and product lines is new certificated rate developed with each change of activity are the rates shaped to fit the capability of each individual worker what happens when workers are employed in teams how is general production standard modified to fit submarginal workforce applied to the individual worker occasionally jones notes production standard is not developed and an individuals productivity is determined by observation or performance rating performance ratings are generally done by the individuals foreman along with rehabilitation counselor they observe the worker for an extended period he explained and determine how his productivity compares with nonhandicapped worker66 how often observation is used instead of more precise method is not clear where comparison is made with outside industry the process assumes at least implicitly that the prevailing wage data are accurate that the evaluators observe both the disabled worker and the outside employee and that the supervisory personnel are competent to render such judgments but who are the supervisors in sheltered employment are they trained professionals is the workshop foreman simply less severely disabled worker how high is the turnover rate for supervisory staff in sheltered workshops wagehour compliance inspections in competitive industry may be reasonably straight forward in sheltered workshop the task is more complicated jones notes it is difficult to verify the appropriateness of workshop wage rates to do so he explains it is necessary to go over each individual shops records operation by operation and do wage rate survey in the area comparisons of industry averages average wages from annual reports and average wages by product can be very misleading even the wage paid may be complicated the records he 64 ibid p 525 65 ibid p 525

that tended to underscore the issues raised during the hearings that separation of the wacs from the workshops may have been more nearly chimera than institutional real ity and that development of an accurate and fair commensurate rate was certainly difficult if not impossible but the extent to which either the hearings or the gao report or the dol report before it would affect public policy was not immediately clear recalling the intent of congress 1966 to generally provide guaranteed wage of 50 of the statutory minimum wage to handicapped persons working in sheltered workshops the gao report concluded the goal has not been realiz ed exemptions evaluation training etc had allowed for payment of lower rate further with the shift toward wacs it found that less than 17 percent of the handicapped workers employed in the workshops were eligible for the federal subminimum wage guarantee 68

instances be substantiated by current sheltered workshop operating practices many wacs did not appear to exclusively provide therapeutic activities and it did not appear that the production of most handicapped workers was inconsequential69 further the available data from the workshops do not provide an accurate or reliable measure of workshops compliance70 even for gao hard data were difficult to develop it found often that the available records did not differentiate between handicapped workers employed in center and those employed in regular workshop program maintain appropriate wagehour data keep separate information on dollar volume of sales for the work activities center or permit data to be retrieved within reasonable time frame71 separation of wacs from workshops was problem and federal criteria were sometimes not complied with some facilities were located in separate rooms or buildings others were separated by an aisle or temporary barrier in the same room with wac and

as for dol enforcement policy gao encountered series of complexities stricter interpretation of the work activities center concept would probably result in additional paperwork and administrative costs with minimal benefit for handicapped workers 73 the disabled often have little knowledge of their rights under the flsa while workshop managers may inadvertently violate the acts provisions or not understand the steps necessary for compliance74 during fiscal years 19771979 gao found between 38 and 59 of the universe of sheltered workshops had been investigated annually of those it found that 60 had underpaid their workers most violations involved failure to pay commensurate wages and to conform to the terms of workshop certification 75 gao acknowledged that compliance with the acts commensurate wage provision is not easily achieved but it found that in all of the workshops visited for its study there were problems in computing piece and hourly rates and in determining the appropriate prevailing wage rates in addition to faulty recordkeeping practices76 establishment of piece rates one standard upon which the commensurate rate rests involves time studies in practice gao found such studies ranged from simple counting to more sophisticated methodologies but that they were irregular and not strictly applicable to real work conditions77 straight hourly rates were equally difficult to determine for purposes of comparison productivity had to be measured not only for the disabled worker but also for those in competitive industry range of systems often flawed was in place the report noted there are two fundamental shortcomings 1 high degree of subjective judgment is required by someone who may or may not have any background in performance evaluation and 2 workers may switch jobs but retain the same hourly rate even though the individuals ability and level of productivity will probably vary for different jobs 78 some assigned value to the task not to the productivity of the worker some workers were paid on modified seniority basis where outside workers may have received wage increases with fluctuations in the cost of living those in the workshop

left up to the individual workshop but local firms gao noted may be reluctant to provide wage information beyond dollar amount comparability of production processes must be determined not surprisingly gao found prevailing wage data and thus the commensurate rate not entirely adequate 80 assessing the accuracy of such determinations depends upon documentation which was not always kept productivity records time studies performance evaluations and hours worked81 dol resources for enforcement were found to be minimal with compliance to large extent voluntary with the workshops by the nature of the section 14c program specially trained staff seemed almost essential but gao found fluctuating body of compliance officersonly intermittently and infrequently involved with section 14c assignments it

disabled coworkers would remain central to the debate through the remainder of the century86 industry supported the nickles proposal walter j payne national association of rehabilitation facilities argued that separation of wacs from workshops creates artificial barriers both physical and psychological between programs pa yne acknowledged that quite often similar work is being performed in both programs except for the fact that persons able to produce at higher rate are in the regular workshop rather than in work activities but then separation he said tends to stigmatize those persons in work activities centers 87 others suggested that elimination of the requirement would enhance productivity and individual growth allow more effective use of available facilities staff and dollars88 increase the productivity of work activity center clients89 and send message to the severely handicapped that we do believe in the american way and that everyone does have the opportunity to accomplish and work to the best of their ability90 admiral david cooney goodwill industries added that the whole emphasis in successful workshop is on arranging the work so that it suits the individuals best needs91 james gashel of nfb in opposition to the nickles bill noted that it would effectively repeal the 50 percent minimum wage standard applicable in the regular workshops further he maintained that mixing of wac and workshop employees would result in lower productivity and lower wages as the more productive workers were forced to slow down in order to match their output with that of the more severely disabled since wages would be productivitybased the workers in regular workshops would take pay cut in order to accommodate slower or less skilled workers the fundamental purpose of separation he argued had been to prevent exploitation of the members of either groupclients or workers gashels statement senator nickles observed presented the legislation as for the benefit of the managers at the expense of the individual the senator denied that intent rather he stated it was intended to open up doors of opportunity 92 critics had also suggested that the clientsworkers were subject to exploitation premise that senator nickles questioned gashel responded that in some of those workshops actual exploitation does occur some of it is unintentional some of

proposed by representative thomas petri rwi hearings were convened on october 3 1985 by austin murphy dpa chair of the subcommittee on labor standards in an opening statement representative petri stated that the issue was not labor standards but rather service to the disabled its not the intent of this legislation he said to lower or change what anyone is paid section 14c mr petri observed has been called an administrative nightmare it creates tremendous paperwork burden and there longer appears to be much purpose to it 96 therefore representative petri called for an end the distinction

facilities noted the unnecessary burden on the employers created by the minimum wage and separation features of section 14c and basically ignoring the data problems raised during earlier hearings and reports endorsed the commensurate wage concept97 other management witnesses concurred arguing further that the section 14c program was too complex for effective administration that dol focused too

with the floor and then having the records be addressed to the actual productivity of the individual99 gashel of the nfb opposed the petri bill we dont support the present form of section 14c he stated branding it indefensible in philosophy theory or administration he urged that the regular workshops continue to be separated from the wacs but that the latter be redesigned exclusively for therapeutic benefit for the clients he suggested ban on subminimum wage payments in the case of blind and visually impaired workers and that other groups of persons with disabilities be allowed to opt out of the section 14c program as well 100 however where workers remained in sheltered employment the paperwork requirements he urged were essential employers of the disabled he reminded the members were seeking the right to pay their workers subminimum wage with floor the least we owe these people he protested is some form of protection to be sure that theyre not being exploited the petri bill he charged would result in lower wages for handicapped workers 101 g21g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g343g346g507g140g508g561g3g150g142g151g141g142g141g561g507g343g351g350g348g508g561 in march of 1986 senator nickles introduced legislation parallel to the petri proposal noting that it would end an inadvertent form of discrimination against the most severely disabled and eliminate minimum wage requirement that has also been burdensome 102 period of gestation followed in september 1986 new legislation was introduced s 2884 for senator howard metzenbaum doh and hr 5614 by mr murphy103 s 2884 expanded upon the petrinickles legislation ie eliminating the distinction between wacs and regular workshops and replacing the minimum wage requirement with commensurate wage by adding provision for an administrative system within dol for contesting wage and related employment standards associated with the certificated disabled as well employers would be required regularly to re view the special minimum wage rates paid to their employees and were precluded from reducing the wages of current employees prior to june 1988 without dol approval 104 gashel offered his qualified endorsement for the metzenbaum bill for blind persons he observed the appeal rights provided by an am endment would be distinct improvement over current law but this he added does not alter our opposition to subminimum wages for all blind workers 105 the senate quickly approved the legislation106 five days later on october 1 the committee on education and labor was discharged from further responsibility for hr 5614

colleagues that the bill would greatly reduce the amount of bureaucratic red tape involved in certifying sheltered workshops and offer greater protection to the disabled employee the legislation was necessary he said because the present system for regulating sheltered workshops has not worked he argued that the bill would hopefully insure against exploitation of this vulnerable sector of our work

worked out entirely as planned by the mid1990s the parties pro and had resumed the battle new legislation was introduced early in 1994 and almost immediately the subcommittee on labor standards conducted oversight hearings on the impact of the1986 amendments g22g145g142g561g22g155g138g143g146g140g138g151g157g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g561 in march 1994 representative james traficant doh introduced hr 3966 the blind workers wage equity act blind workers he stated have proven to be as productive as their sighted coworkers yet quality employeesare denied minimum wage and they are denied it for one reasonthe workshops are legally permitted to do it employers he continued decide the prevailing wage for job then pay the blind worker mere percentage of that wage hr 3966 would have prohibited dol from issuing certificate under section 14c to authorize payment of wages to anyone by reason of such individuals impaired vision or blindness then it defined blindness 109 although the traficant proposal would be discussed at least tangentially during oversight hearings in the 103rd congress and would be adversely critiqued by employers of sheltered workers it would not be acted upon g22g145g142g561g15g158g155g153g145g162g561g10g142g138g155g146g151g144g156g561 in midmarch of 1994 representative murphy convened an oversight hearing on experience under the 1986 legislation mr murphy explained that in 1986 we listened primarily to the nonprofit employers who were encumbered with complicated system of permits and programs then required to administer sheltered workshop we carefully considered the explanations of the workshop administrators and learned about white lines painted on the floor to separate workers of differing levels of disability in return for employer flexibility workers in sheltered environments received right to an expedited hearing on any complaint of inadequate wages however he noted the experience of dol since then has shown that few petitions by or on behalf of workers are filed whether that is indicative of lack of problems or of the difficulty of bringing such administrative action is something we hope to learn at todays hearing 110

was structural management is empowered to gather all of the facts and make all of the decisions which end up justifying their determinations the blind enter workshop under the presumption of low productivity their employers who control the work process then monitor the workers every move and create workproductivity fileone that can be extremely negative then when there is dispute the individual worker is left to c ontest not only the inappropriateness of the wage rate determination but also documentation the employer has systematically developed over an extended period the workers gashel concluded can challenge the subminimum wage in hearing but they are almost certain to lose112 employer spokespersons focused their counter arguments in part upon the traficant bill admiral cooney goodwill industries for example termed hr 3966 illadvised and stated that it would reduce employment for thousands of workers with visual impairments terming charges of exploitation merely unsubstantiated allegations he noted that section 14c allows workers with disabilities andor their guardians to appeal wage determinations to the secretary of labor113 patricia beattie national industries for the blind inter alia taking note of the appeals process under the 1986 amendments thought the workers well protected114 but she stated there were other protections as well we nib visit each associated agency at least once every three years for comprehensive onsite review of their compliance with dol regulations where they are not being complied with we strongly urge that the agencyworkshop take appropriate action though nib does not have the legal authority similar to dol to enforce the payment of back wages she added the associated agencies are quite receptive 115

elisburg who had been assistant secretary of labor in the late 1970s was in 1994 an attorney in private practice116 elisburg commenced by stating that the present system for challenging workshop abuses is study in futility he characterized the procedures included in the 1986 amendments as not only not helpful they are useless117 the problems under current law he regarded as systemic as he proceeded with his testimony he pointed specifically to the following issues the absence of class action option in pursuing an appeal and redress the unrealistic constraints of time for dealing with section 14c cases imposed upon public entities the need for evidence that likely neither disabled plaintiff nor his or her employer will have lack of clarity with respect to the responsibilities of the several parties ie the department of labor the courts the employer etc and that provision was made for payment of attorneys feeseven when plaintiff is successful in his or her litigation the structure he seemed to suggest was stacked against the aggrieved person with disability 112 ibid p 11 113 ibid pp 3233 114 ibid pp 2627 115 ibid pp 3738 116 during his tenure as assistant secretary he

secretary seeking review of the special minimum wage must be filed by the employee the employees parent or guardian which he argued presents serious problem basically the individual workers who are required to sign complaint are put at tremendous risk of conflict with their employers under difficult employment circumstances118 time constraints were identified as another serious problem in an attempt it would seem to assure prompt adjudication of complaints congress provided that the secretary has ten days after receipt of petition to assign the case to an administrative law judge who then must hear the case within thirty days this process elisburg viewed as an illusion from his own experience with litigation in texas he observed it had taken 15 months to bring comparable case to closure119 evidentiary requirements and procedures were ci ted as troublesome further the court would necessarily become involved in the commensurate rate and prevailing rate determinations the 1986 amendments mandated that the employer shall have the burden of demonstrating that the special minimum wage rate is justified as necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment but in turn the administrative law judge would be required to assess the validity of the evidence put forth by the employer in addition he must take into account the productivity of the employee and the productivity of other employees performing work of essentially the same type and quality for other employers in the same vicinity 120 from his own experience elisburg found that the sheltered workshop personnel and management had little understanding of the rules the records they had were virtually nonexistent to support the exemption and they had little economic justification for the wage scales they set to make matters worse it was also clear during the litigation of these cases that the administrative law judges did not fully understand or accept the notion that the employer had the burden of establishing the data to defend the exemptions claimed and such confusion would impact on the judges decision he raised concerns about the proper role to be filled by dol in these cases ie in providing technical support for the judge the department elisburg stated did not really have well defined role as to how they were supposed to help in this case or as matter of fact whom they were supposed to help but if the system imposed technicalevidentiary burden upon judge he suggested it was even more onerous where the plaintiffs were concerned where workshop records are inadequate or nonexistent then workers claim must be established by that workers testimony of hours worked and wages paid on piece work basis ye t the disabled worker has almost way of keeping separate counts of pieces produced or of hours worked the responsibilities the system imposed upon the disabled worker and his or her family he viewed as overwhelming it is virtually impossible to proceed without the aid of an expert economist and experts in time and 118 ibid p 20 119 ibid pp 2122 representative murphy termed the time constraints in the 1986 amendments as the administrative

on the administrative law judge who is not trained in wage and hour or any of the related kinds of issues is also impossible finally elisburg noted there were the dollar costs of the entire proceeding with provision having been made for attorneys fees congress has created law that is not speedy is extremely technical permits below minimum wages to be paid to people whose only disability is that they are blind insists that individuals pursue claim on their own behalf and then must pay legal fees even if the employer is at fault the persons filing these complaints elisburg reminded the subcommittee were fighting for the option of being paid at least the federal minimum wage how in good conscience can we ask these workers to also foot the legal bill he stated his doubt that the guarantees of section 14c can be enforced by any agency and to suggest that worker earning 205 an hour can afford legal counsel is likewise ludicrous121

committee on education and the workforce and later to the subcommittee on workforce protections the bills were essentially the same as the traficant proposal of the 103rd congress like the traficant

representative isakson introduced hr 881 which was referred to the committee on education and the workforce subcommittee on workforce protections like its counterpart in the 106th congress hr 881 would have prevented the secretary of labor from issuing certification for the payment of subminimum wage to persons who are visionimpaired solely on the basis of vision impairment the bill would not however have prevented the issuance of such certificate where potential workers have multiple disabilities one of which may be vision im pairment action was taken on the isakson proposal the issue did not resurface during the 108 th congress when the primary issue was concern with overtime pay124 nor has the issue reemerged during the 109th or the 110th congresses if congress perceives that the revision of section 14c is appropriate new proposals could emerge at any timeeither as freestanding legislation or as part of more general umbrella measure dealing broadly with overtime pay and related ma ttersof which some suggest the employment of people with disabilities may be logical part of course there is statutory requirement that congress revisit this issue

support services to workers w ith disabilities but labor should improve oversight 125 the agency focused upon the characteristics of employers that employ individuals with disabilities at less than the minimum wage under the section 14c program b the characteristics of workers with disabilities who earn less than the minimum wage and c the dols management of the special minimum wage program gao indicated that there were about 5600 employers of workers with disabilities it found that about 84 percent are work centers established to provide employment opportunities and support services to individuals with disabilities it also found that 74 percent of the workers paid special minimum wages by work centers have mental reta rdation or another developmental disability as their primary impairment and 46 percent have multiple disabilities gao reported that dol has not effectively managed the special minimum wage program to ensure that 14c workers receive the correct wages it noted that in past years the department had placed low priority on the program dol it asserted lacks the data it needs to manage the program and determine what resources are needed to ensure compliance by employers gao concluded that the department has not done all it can to ensure that employers comply with the law and that it has provided little training to its staff that would enable them to work with the several program participants 126 124 on march 31 2003 the department of labor proposed revision of section 13a1 of the fair labor standards act dealing with executive administrative and professional workers that issue remained active until late august 2004 when formally implemented see crs report rl32088 the fair labor standards act historical sketch of the overtime pay requirements

sheltered employment even concern about separation of the workshops from the wacs notwithstanding discussion of role models has been largely wagebased the wages in question have always been minimal when in 1986 cong ress moved from statutory minimum rate not less than 50 of the flsa minimum to commensurate wage standard the highest statutory rate required would have been approximately 168 per hour since 1986 the rate for disabled workers has been productivitybased commensurate as noted above the wage rests upon foundation of individual worker productivity however measured such rates because they are productivitybased may fluctuate from one production process to the next and from one day to the next in practice it would appear wage rates are set essentially at whatever the employer determines the economic value of the worker to be and can document 127 much of the administrative structure supportive of section 14c similarly has been created with the wage issue in mind it involves complicated measurement of disability of productivity of comparability with production in competitive in dustryand for enforcement purposes oversight by the department of labor finally in theory there are options for appeal of wage determinations some however have questioned the value of these processes do they result in accurate findings are they unduly cumbersome 128 since the mid1960s at least concern has been voiced pro and about separation of the wacs from the regular workshops this is often argued in terms of role models chance for the severely disabled to work alongside less disabled workers and in terms of the dignity and self esteem of the severely disabled on the other hand the needs of the less severely disabled may not be served as well by ignoring difference s in ability levels and mixing workers of significantly different levels of ability may produce tensions within each group where the severely disabled may find themselves striving to meet challenges that are beyond their capabilities the less severely disabled may find themselves subjected to collectively calculated subminimum wage though workshop managers may find it economically useful to deal with the disabled as homogenous group it may be reasonable to distinguish between levels of disability as the congress judged it to be in 1966 and to structure work and rehabilitation not necessarily the same things to meet specific needs of the disabled clients andor employees 127 as noted elsewhere in the report methodologies for calculation of relative productivity vary substantially among places of employment partly reflecting the sophistication of the employer as well disabled workers are often engaged in group work in which their individual productivity may well be beyond their own individual ability to control although there is testimony largely anecdotal that the workers engaged in sheltered employment through r ecent years are more severely disabled than those of earlier periods such comparisons are difficult to document 128 the degree of worker satisfaction with sheltered employment probably can not be shown with any reasonable accuracy individual sheltered workers may be unhappy in their work and dissatisfied in the program of which they are part but on the other hand their parent or guardian may have praise for the arrangement assessment must take into account degrees of articulateness where the disabled are concerned even complaints per may be difficult to assessfor all of the reasons suggested by donald elisburg during the 1994 hearings discussed above should complaint to supervisor be credited and given weight comparable to that lodged with dol where complaint even if raised with dol is not pursued perhaps because of the cost or difficulty of doing so should it be discounted as representative murphy noted at the commencement of the 1994 hearings it is not clear whether the paucity of official complaints is indicative of lack of problems or of the difficulty of bringing such administrative action

premise that in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment wage rate lower than the otherwise applicable flsa minimum may be justified there appears to be little hard evidence whether or not reduced wage rate prevents curtailment of opportunities for employment unfortunately the data are sparse and provocative of further questions would all types of disability be equally impacted by reduced wage option and in which types of employment that employers in competitive industry actually hire persons with disabilities at the subminimum rate whom they would not have hired had they been required to pay full minimum wage is difficult to document the option of paying lower wages some argue encourages employers more readily to hire the disabled and to spend the time to deal with their presumed idiosyncracies whatever their productive level it is argued the subminimum wage opens the door to employment thus an opportunity wage 129 others view the issue differently they point out that in theory the disability must be linked directly to diminished productivity in practice that linkage may not be obvious some argue that the subminimum wage option inflicts an additional burden the disabled worker in the context of section 14c mu st prove that he is sufficiently productive to merit at least the minimum wage worker without recognized disability is presumed to be worth at least the flsa minimum it has been argued that on several levels dichotomy has been built into the section 14c program from the hearings it has not always been clear for example how clients were distinguished from workersor for that matter that they always have been some may view the progression from the client to the worker in the workshop and to the worker in competitive industry as continuum it appears that in practice differentiation is not always made the issue becomes more complex in light of other internal program conflicts while the workshops are normally nonprofit institutions they compete in the world of commerce for contracts through which to sustain their nonprofit activities thus while they seek to transition their clients into competitive industry they may at the same time be reluctant to lose their best workers in terms of public policy while the workshopwac community may be the beneficiaries of public subsidies tax concessions special marketing arrangements charitable contributions etc they may also compete with private sector firms and their employees in practice do the managers of workshops and wacs regard themselves as corporate ceos as social services workers or bothand do these several identities sometimes clash making commensurate wage rate determinations is technically challenging task it is not clear from review of the various hearings and reports that workshop operatorsmanagers have the expertise effectively to implement such wage structure nor is it clear that the dol were it to place priority upon compliance with the spirit motivating section 14c has the means necessary to effect compliance it seems reasonable to assume that section 14c will continue to be focus of debate as discussed above variety of policy options might be considered by congress in dealing with this matter in addition to legislative proposals suggested through the years other options might include developing additional financial subsides for those in sheltered employment an attempt to establish clearer distinction between rehabilitation on the one hand and work on the other with different patterns of activity for workers and for clients or patients engaged under section 14c reconsideration of the concept of minimum compensation and commensurate rates in the 129 these arguments have also been used with respect to other segments of the workforce notably youth workers
