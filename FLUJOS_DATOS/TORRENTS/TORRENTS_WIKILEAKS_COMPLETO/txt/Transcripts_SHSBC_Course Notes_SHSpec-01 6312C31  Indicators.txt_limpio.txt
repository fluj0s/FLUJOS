6312c31 shspec1 indicators this was the year in which we achieved the technology of ot and in which we laid the bridge with all the older processes from dianetics on it is the year in which we had our hardest attacks since 1950 these attacks are losing or have lost the irs lost its suit on lrh and msh irs means infernal ravening the work for 1964 should include codification of materials writing textbooks for the different levels etc several techniques have been developed for higherclassed auditor to run on lowerlevel pc we are ready to open the door wide on the subject of psychosomatic healing we could put it on an ethical basis by saying that if you dont get results on patient you refund his money anybody who is receiving level vi auditing see p 550 above for description of this level from an auditor who flubs goes through more illnesses and psychosomatics than anyone can count lrh understands the phenomenon of psychosomatics and is consequently little contemptuous of doctors treatment of these conditions it is rather horrifying from an auditors viewpoint to see what is thought of the illness and how it is treated the auditor would like to be able to see what goal it is what ri what service fac etc when chaos reigns caused by misalignment of the psyche this is fascinating in its complexity and disillusioning in the simplicity of its cause the technology for handling the bank has finally been worked out it is complex it takes expert auditing and an educated pc but the result is an ot this is far higher result than was expected before 1962 to degree that it is unreal to most people at times it is even unreal to lrh even when the auditor and the pc have tremendous skill they can make huge mistakes for instance lrh has been looking for his pt gpm for months he has found seven so far each one thought to be the pt one he has been unburdening the track by running them as they were found he is aware of good case advance since starting out now his goals lists go for five or six items one rocketreading then it goes on by stacking it up putting the gpm on top of it listing in to the top oppterm to see if there was anything there to see if there was gpm closer to pt we handled four of them like they were old sacks of straw he finally got the pt gpm for the first time he looked forward and saw nothing there he woke up wondered if couple were backwards creak got his considerations creak this is far cry from few months ago when he was wrapped around telegraph pole with regularity you made the early gpms without having body so it is tough on bodies to run into ris etc it is nice to be outside not subject to the bodys intolerance of temperature extremes the problem lrh ends the year with is as an ot how do you drink cocacola it doesnt evaporate like liquor and lrh is too big to get into the bottle he thought of putting it in tub with ice if you have wondered whether you will ever make it all the way while you are making it all the way you will have many other periods when you will be certain that you will never make it all the way that is the greatest certainty that lrh can give you he has known many times that it was impossible for you to make it but he has recovered the final end product of scientology or of thetan in this universe has been achieved in 1963 whatever else can be said for the year indicators this is new subject routine 6 this is probably the procedure given in the last tape see hcopl 5may64 summary of classification and gradation and certification p 4 see also p 562 above for summary of this procedure cannot be run without knowledge of indicators and of the proper actions to do when certain things are present or not present indicators are present at every level there are good indicators and bad indicators to know about bad indicators you must know what good indicators are one needs to know both in order to have datum to compare with for instance you dont cut the pcs itsa because you want the good indicator of smooth needle and cheerful pc not because of fear of instructors in the field of say music one has some standards and expectations of how it should sound on hifi equipment etc that is the comparative datum the good indicator the standard test for hifi equipment is how should it sound poor hifi equipment sounds like you are in the lobby of the theater when the aisle doors are closed if you walk down the aisle to about the center of the theater and listen that is what good hifi equipment should sound like people watching lrhs auditing on demos have shown that they dont have standard to judge the session by lrh worked out good and bad indicators to make the standards known and explicit if you know what is right with session you can tell what is wrong with one good indicators people should be happy in session the only frame of mind that you can asis in is cheerful hightoned one the pc should be cheerfully itsaing to the auditor if he runs secondary he runs grief off of it and comes out of it etc we get picture of what the session should be with good indicators if they are not there then bad indicators are there these bad indicators should be handled so as to get the good indicators back gis mean that the auditor should continue what he is doing bis show that the auditor should so something else the particular bis that are present determine what the auditor must do eg if the pc makes critical remark about the auditor pull missed withhold do session arc break assessment or run ow how the pc should look and sound how the bank should respond how the meter should behave all these are the good indicators note that at levels v and vi the male and female clear reads longer apply since thetan doesnt have sex the time to do something about bad indicator is when you cant go on with good indicators not just whenever bad indicator shows up the broad range of optimum ta range is 20 to 40 the common range of ta excursion is 275 to 35 there are three grades of bad indicators light medium and heavy they compare to the suddenness with which you must take action 1 the light indicator shows you that something is wrong so that you can be alert for need for action but nothing necessarily needs to be done 2 on moderate bis action must be taken as soon as it can be comfortably done 3 on heavy bis emergency crash action must be taken right now an example of grade 3 bi would be the pc not wanting auditing 4 grade 4 bi would be something like car going over cliff you hear dwindling scream this pc is never going to be audited again gis mean expected not extraordinary wanting auditing is more common than you would expect it is gi we take for granted if lot of gis are present few bis dont matter too much an ordinary bi not vbi would be the fact that the pc has ptp you tend to it promptly since pc with ptp makes progress pc with an arc break gets worse with auditing so that is vvbi that is the only time that auditing worsens case so the gis are pc in session with ptp and arc break this is something that one should know for auditing supervision you cannot supervise by bis only by gis because when gis cease to exist your action must be directed towards recreating them not just at eradicating bis you could base your expectations of case progress on how many gis are present for every gi not present some bi is present do the appropriate thing to remove the bi and get the gi back know gis more by heart than bis since if there is bi you can always go to the textbook to figure it out for instance you notice that the pc keeps having ptps you eventually think of the datum that when the pc keeps having ptps his goals must be totally divergent from the auditors goals and the session itself becomes the ptp dont act when bis are not present only correct what needs correction dont let win on repairing one pcs bis become the stable datum for all pcs who dont have the same bis this disposes of the idea that some pcs are auditable and others arent you are an auditor and the standard procedures on which you are being trained are the way in which you materialize gis in session they are all calculated to bring about gis in the pc the gains of auditing are astonishingly automatic these days you just audit the pc on standard program if bis pop up always take care of the worst one first naturally you want to get the heaviest bpc out of the way first and keep patching up the case only until you can get back on the road the gi on an auditing question is 1 the pc has received something to inspect 2 he inspects it 3 he tells you what he has inspected he answers the question fully as far as he is concerned 4 then you acknowledge it doesnt matter if you gave him one command and he inspected fully and took half an hour to answer or if you gave him many repetitive commands and he fully answered the question he is going through an electronic circuit and he comes out the other end free of it having inspected it if you cut his itsa along the way he gets lost in the middle of the labyrinth of electronic material this gives rise to dirty needle just keep the pc going with gis building his confidence and not cutting his itsa moving him along up the line
