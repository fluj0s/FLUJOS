chairman of the constitution subcommittee hearings on hr 5018 and two other bills hr 4987 the digital privacy act and hr 4908 the notice of electronic monitoring act were held by the subcommittee on september 6th1 hr 5018 was approved by the subcommittee on september 14th by unanimous voice vote similar bill has not been introduced in the senate the purpose of hr 5018 is to modify certain provisions of title 18 federal criminal laws relating to the interception of communications hr 5018 was drafted to address some of the legal issues that the internet raises and update the statutory framework for conducting digital surveillance on the internet the premise for the legislation is that traditional concepts of wiretapping and the fourth amendment were developed in an era of centralized telephone networks2 not the packetized decentralized environment of the internet according to the fbi it has encountered an increasing number of criminal investigations in which criminal subjects used the internet to communicate for which internet service providers isp lacked the ability to discriminate communications to identify particular subjects messages to the exclusion of all others carnivore the legislation was prompted in part by privacy concerns over the fbis carnivore internet surveillance system3 widespread knowledge of the existence of the fbis new surveillance tool for internet communications carnivore occurred with the publication on july 11th of an article in the wall street journal4 carnivore had been deployed by the fbi in hacker counterterrorism and drugtrafficking cases for over year reportedly to monitor the communications of individuals who were targets of criminal investigations the fbi must obtain court order to deploy carnivore to monitor communications carnivore is installed on the network of an isp it monitors communications on the network and records messages sent or received by targeted user this is presumably designed to respond to an electronic wiretap order served on an isp carnivore can also provide the origin and destination of all communications to and from particular isp customer this is designed to be the equivalent of pen register and trap and trace orders which in the telephone contex t provides digits dialed and incoming phone numbers the fbi dubbed it carnivore for its ability to get to the meat of what would otherwise be an enormous quantity of data the fbi says the system allows investigators to tailor an intercept operation so it can pluck only the digital traffic of one person from among the stream of millions of other messages according to the fbi its design and development of carnivore provides the fbi with surgical ability to intercept and collect the communications which are the subject of the lawful order while ignoring those communications which they are not authorized to intercept5 critics of carnivore say that the problem with carnivore is not what the fbi is currently using it for but rather what it has the capacity to do carnivore enables law enforcement officials tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20693crs3 6 in one case federal judge overruled an isps refusal to allow the fbi to install carnivore and required it to grant the fbi access to its network the case was resolved when the isp and the government reached an accommodation in which the device was installed and further assurances were made about network security and about protecting the privacy of subscribers generally see case history installation of pen register and trap and trace device at an isp from testimony of robe rt cornrevere esq before the subcommittee on the constitution of the committee on the judiciary on the fourth amendment and the internet apr 6 2000 7 httpwwwhousegovjudiciarycon0724htm 8 httpwwwsenategovjudiciaryw196200fhtmsift through all of the traffic that passes through an isps network and is capable of capturing both numbers and limited amount of content eg the subject line of emails and the urls of web sites visited because carnivores capacity is so broad critics argue that its use goes beyond the limited wiretapping authority that congress granted law enforcement officials under the electronic communications privacy act ecpa generally requires law enforcement to minimize its interceptions of nonincriminating communications carnivore however has the potential to do the opposite since knowledge of carnivores existence became widespread it has been at the center of controversy privacy advocates civil libertarians and the computer industry immediately expressed concerns over carnivores threats to the privac and security of internet communications the carnivore system has disturbed many in the internet industry because when deployed it must be hooked directly into internet service providers computer networks and as result would give the gover nment the ability to eavesdrop on all customers digital communications from email to online banking and web surfing the system also troubles internet service providers who are resistant to outside software being plugged into their systems in many cases the fbi keeps the secret carnivore computer system in locked cage on the providers premises and makes daily visits to retrieve the data captured from the providers network legal challenges to the use of carnivore are few and judges rulings remain sealed because of the nature of the investigations6 congressional attention followed shortly after publication of the wall street journal article on carnivore with hearing july 24th held by the house judiciary subcommittee on the constitution on carnivores challenge to privacy and security online7 the senate judiciary committee also held hearing on the carnivore controversy electronic surveillance and privacy in the digital age on september 6th8 electronic communication s privacy act of 2000 hr 5018 as introduced would make three significant changes to the law i it would amend the laws governing how law enforcement may obtain noncontent information under pen registertrap and trace statutes ii extend the statutory exclusionary rule to electronic communications in transit realtime and to stored electronic communications and iii extend title iiis the wiretap statute reporting requirements to stored electronic communications justice department officials have raised serious concerns about the bill arguing that it could undermin law enforcements ability to combat cyberterrorism internetbased fraud and theft online child pornography and many other cybercrimes the

markups and votes sep 20 2000 12 electronic wiretap bill clears house panel 106 markup hr 5018 national journal markup reports sep 26 2000worked closely with justice department officials to address some of these concerns during markup extension of reporting requirement section 3 of hr 5018 amends section 2703 of title 18 to require the compilation and publication of annual reports of data regarding government acquisition of stored data such as email in 1968 when congress adopted title iii the wiretap statute it required the administra tive office of the united states courts to compile and publish annually report on wiretap activity9 in 1986 when congress adopted the electronic communications privacy act ecpa realtime interception of email electronic communications in transit was included under title iii so that interception of email is reported under the title iii reporting provisions of section 2519 however ecpa created new chapter 121 for government access to email and other electronic communications in storage10 section 2703 is the main section setting out standards for government access to electronic communications in storage however cong ress did not include reporting requirement in the stored records chapter and therefore data is collected on the amount of email seized under the stored communications chapter section 3 of hr 5018 requires the compilation and reporting of basic information on the activity of federal state and local agencies in seizing email and other customer records privacy advocates and civil libertarians support the extension of the reporting requirements to stored electronic communications as method to improve government accountability and as means to assess the scope and effectiveness of government wiretapping the department of justice testified that the bills reporting requirements would place significant burden on law enforcement officials according to published reports11 the reporting requirement was simplified in committee12 extension of statutory exclusionary rule section 2 of hr 5018 creates two new statutory suppression remedies by bringing electronic communications within the scope of the statutory suppression rule of title iii 18 usc 2515 current law provides that illegally intercepted voice communications cannot be used in court or in agency hearings when congress adopted title iii in 1968 it established certain protections for interception of communications that went beyond fourth amendment requirements congress then established statutory suppression rule to exclude evidence seized in material violation of those protections 18 usc 2515 in 1986 when congress passed the electronic communications privacy act and added the word electronic to most of title iiis provisions it did not do so in section 2515 section 2 of hr 5018 addresses this omission hr 5018 extends the statutory exclusionary rule to electronic communications in transit realtime and also extends the statutory exclusionary rule to stored electronic communications in addition section 2 adds reference to stored electronic communications disclosed in violation of chapter 121 extending the statutory suppression rule to illegal seizures of email in violation of chapte r 121 in other words section 2 makes clear that the exclusionary rule apples to electronic communication the

as well as to wire and oral communication the original phrase from the 1968 act according to published reports managers amendment offered by the bills chief sponsor eliminated stored email from the exclusionary rule amendmen t13 several committee members opposed the elimination of stored email the panel voted 97 to bar that provision and to include stored email under the statutory exclusionary rule pen registers and trap and trace amendments section 4 of hr 5018 would amend the pen register and trap and trace statute for email to require showing of specific and articulable facts that reasonably indicate that crime has been is being or will be committed and information likely to be obtained by such installation and use is relevant to an investigation of that crime this evidentiary standard tracks the current standard for court order authorizing the acquisition of stored electronic data under 18 usc 2703d current law provides that the court shall issue an order authorizing the placement of pen register or trap and trace device whenever any attorney for the government or an investigative officer certifies in an ex parte proceeding that information likely to be obtained through the order is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation there is widespread agreement that the current legal standard does not offer meaningful privacy protection the legal standard that law enforcement agencies must satisfy to obtain authorization to secure list of the telephone numbers of incoming and outgoing calls on surveillance subjects line are less demanding than the standards for interception of telephone conversations the electronic communications privacy act establishes less demanding standards for capturing telephone numbers through the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices pen registers record telephone numbers of outgoing calls14trap and trace devices record telephone numbers from which incoming calls originate15 ecpa requires law enforcement agencies to obtain court orders to install and use these devices rather than the strict probable cause showing necessary for wiretaps pen register orders require only certification from law enforcement officer that the information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation16 hr 5018 would introduce the requirement of judicial review of the factual basis for such orders specifically hr 5018 would require such applications to contain specific and articulable facts that would justify the collection of the data hr 5018 would apply the heightened standard only to devices that identify an email addres s the justice department had several concerns about these changes specifically it was concerned with the technologyspecific manner in which the bill would implement this change the lack of an emergency exception and the geographic limitations that restrict such orders in the present law the fact that hr 5018 would apply the heightened standard only to devices that identify an email address does not take into account other ways that electronichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20693crs6 17 electronic wiretap bill clears house panel 106 markup hr 5018 national journal

use of technology neutral language and desires authorization for law enforcement to use pentrap devices in emergency situations without getting approval from court so long as they obtain court approval within 48 hours finally the department of justice would like the wiretap statute to be amended to ensure that federal courts have the authority to order all telecommunications carriers providing service in the united states to provide law enforcement authorities the information needed to trace both voice and electronic communications to their source some hearing witnesses have criticized section 4 of hr 5018 because it explicitly authorizes access to email address information under the reasonable indication standard and leaves in place the lower standard of relevancy for issuing pen register or trap and trace order for voice communications instead they recommend strengthening the standards for issuing pen register and trap and trace orders by requiring finding that factual evidence reasonably indicates that crime has been is being or will be committed they would defer for the time being the question of whether that standard is appropriate for email addresses and other electronic communicat ions in order for full debate to occur on whether the pen register statute should apply to the internet and if so what information should be collected and what the standard should be other provisions it was also reported that the committee approved an amendment that would require police to get warrant to obtain suspects email whether stored or realtime17 the committee also approved an amendment that would extend from six months to one year the period of time in which warrant would be needed to access suspects stored email from an internet service provider18 published reports also indicate that the committee approved an amendment that would make it more difficult for law enforcement officials to get location information from cell phone providers except in emergency circumstances19 another amendment the committee adopted would make it illegal to deface or destroy website even if the damage amounts to less than 500020
