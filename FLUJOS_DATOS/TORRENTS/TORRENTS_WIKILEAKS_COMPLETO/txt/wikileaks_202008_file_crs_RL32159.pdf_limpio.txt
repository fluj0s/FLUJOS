that is carefully prepared thoughtfully planned and concisely packaged the potential applicant generally seeks first to become familiar with all of the pertinent program criteria of the funding institution before developing proposal the potential applicant may refer to the information contact listed in the agency or foundation program description to learn whether funding is available when applicable deadlines occur and the process used by the grantor agency or private foundation for accepting applications grant seekers should know that the basic requirements application forms information and procedures vary among grantmaking agencies and foundations federal agencies and large foundations may have formal application packets strict guidelines and fixed deadlines with which applicants must comply while smaller foundations may operate more informally and even provide assistance to inexperienced grantseekers however the steps outlined in this report generally apply to any grantseeking effort individuals without prior grant proposal writing experience may find it useful to attend grantsmanship class or workshop applicants interested in locating workshops or consulting more resources on grantsmanship and proposal development should consult the internet sites listed at the end of this report and explore other resources in their local libraries local governments may obtain grant writing assistance from states office of council of governments csg or regional council the primary mission of csg is to promote and strengthen state government in the federal system by providing staff services to organizations of state officials grassroots or small faithbased nonprofit organizations can seek the help and advice of larger more seasoned nonprofit organizations or foundations in their state internet and library resources can be consulted to identify them

concise description of the proposed project to develop convincing proposal for project funding the project must fit into the philosophy and mission of the grantseeking organization or agency and the need that the proposal is addressing must be well documented and wellarticulated typically funding agencies or foundations will want to know that proposed activity or project reinforces the overall mission of an organization or grant seeker and that the project is necessary to make compelling case the following should be included in the proposal nature of the project its goals needs and anticipated outcomes how the project will be conducted timetable for completion how best to evaluate the results performance measures

volunteers and preliminary budget covering expenses and financial requirements to determine what funding levels to seek when developing an idea for proposal it is also important to determine if the idea has already been considered in the applicants locality or state thorough check should be made with state legislators local government and related public and private agencies which may currently have grant awards or contracts to do similar work if similar program already exists the applicant may need to reconsider submitting the proposed proj ect particularly if duplication of effort is perceived however if significant differences or improvements in the proposed projects goals can be clearly established it may be worthwhile to pursue federal or private foundation assistance g5g152g150g150g158g151g146g157g162g561g21g158g153g153g152g155g157g561 for many proposals community support is essential once proposal summary is developed an applicant may look for individuals or groups representing academic political professional and lay organizations which may be willing to support the proposal in writing the type and caliber of community support is critical in the initial and subsequent review phases numerous letters of support can influence the administering agency or foundation an applicant may elicit support from local government agencies and public officials letters of endorsement detailing exact areas of project sanction and financial or inkind commitment are often requested as part of proposal to federal agency several months may be required to develop letters of endorsement since something of value eg buildings staff services is sometimes negotiated between the parties involved while money is the primary concern of most grantseekers thought should be given to the kinds of nonmonetary contributions that may be available in many instances academic institutions corporations and other nonprofit groups in the community may be willing to contribute technical and professional assistance equipment or space to worthy project not only can such contributions reduce the amount of money being sought but evidence of such local support is often viewed favorably by most grantmaking agencies or foundations many agencies require in writing affiliation agreements mutual agreement to share services between agencies and building space commitments prior to either grant approval or award two useful methods of generating community support may be to form citizen advisory committee or to hold meetings with community leaders who would be concerned with the subject matter of the proposal the forum may include the following discussion of the merits of the proposal development of strategy to create proposal support from large number of community groups institutions and organizations and generation of data in support of the proposal httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32159g10g152g160g561g157g152g561g6g142g159g142g149g152g153g561g138g151g141g561g25g155g146g157g142g561g138g561 g9g155g138g151g157g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g561 g561

research appropriate funding sources both the applicant and the grantor agency or foundation should have the same interests intentions and needs if proposal is to be considered an acceptable candidate for funding it is generally not productive to send out proposals indiscriminately in the hope of attracting funding grantmaking agencies and foundations whose interest and intentions are consistent with those of the applicant are the most likely to provide support an applicant may cast wide but targeted net many projects may only be accomplished with funds coming from combination of sources among them federal state or local programs and grants from private or corporate foundations the best funding resources are now largely on the internet key sources for funding information include the federal governments catalog of federal domestic assistance cfda httpwwwcfdagov and the foundation center httpwwwfoundationcenterorg the clearinghouse of private and corporate foundation funding for summary of federal programs and sources see crs report rl34012 grants information for constituents by merete f gerli and other crs reports on topics such as community or social services block grants to states rural development assistance federal allocations for homeland security and other funding areas may be requested from senator or representative review of the government or private foundations program descriptions objectives and uses as well as any use restrictions can clarify which programs might provide funding for an idea when reviewing individual cfda program descriptions applicants may also target the related programs as potential resources also the kinds of projects the agency or foundation funded in the past may be helpful in fashioning your grant proposal program listings in the cfda or foundation information will often include examples of past funded projects many federal grants do not go directly to the final beneficiary but are awarded through block or formula grants to state or local agencies which in turn distribute the funds for more information crs report rl30705 federal grants to state and local governments brief history may be requested from representative or senator there are many types of foundations national family community corporate etc for district or community projects as general rule it is good idea to look for funding sources close to home which are frequently most concerned with solving local problems corporations for example tend to support projects in areas where they have offices or plants most foundations only provide grants to nonprofit organizations those registered by the internal revenue service as having 501c taxexempt status though the foundati on center publishes information about foundation grants to individuals once potential grantor agency or foundation is identified an applicant may contact it and ask for grant application kit or information later the grant seeker may ask some of the grantor agency or foundation personnel for suggestions criticisms and advice about the proposed project in many cases the more agency or foundation personnel know about the proposal the better the chance of support and of an eventual favorable decision sometimes it is useful to send the proposal summary to specific agency or foundation official in separate cover letter and ask for preliminary review and comment an applicant may check httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32159g10g152g160g561g157g152g561g6g142g159g142g149g152g153g561g138g151g141g561g25g155g146g157g142g561g138g561

government agency or foundation first to determine its preference if this approach is under consideration if the review is unfavorable and differences cannot be resolved the grant seeker may ask the examining agency or founda tion official to suggest another department agency or foundation which may be interested in the proposal personal visit to the agencys or foundations state or regional office or headquarters if available may also be beneficial visit not only establishes facetoface contact but also may bring out some essential details about the proposal or help secure additional advice or information federal agencies are required to report funding information as funds are approved increased or decreased among projects within given state depending on the type of required reporting also grant seekers may consider reviewing the federal budget for the current and future fiscal years to determine proposed dollar amounts for particular budget functions the grant seeker should carefully study the eligibility requirements for each government or foundation program under consideration see for example the applicant eligibility and rules and regulations sections of the cfda program description federal department and agency websites generally include additional information about their programs cfda program descriptions and websites include information contacts applicants should direct questions and seek clarification about requirements and deadlines from them the applicant may learn that he or she is required to provide services otherwise unintended such as service to particular client groups or involvement of specific institutions it may necessi tate the modification of the original concept in order for the project to be eligible for funding questions about eligibility should be discussed with the appropriate program officer for federal grants funding opportunities notices appear on the website grantsgov httpwwwgrantsgov applicants can search and sign up for email notification of funding opportunities and download applications packages to submit applications registration is required deadlines for submitting applications are often not negotiable though some federal programs do have open application dates refer to the cfda program description for private foundation funding opportunities grant seekers contact foundations themselves or check the foundation centers website for daily postings of requests for proposals rfps at httpfoundationcenterorgfindfundersfundingsourcesrfphtml specified deadlines are usually associated with strict timetables for agency or foundation review some programs have more than one application deadline during the fiscal or calendar year applicants should plan proposal development around the established deadlines g9g142g157g157g146g151g144g561g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g142g141g561g157g152g561g25g155g146g157g142g561g157g145g142g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g561 the grant seeker having narrowed down the field of potential funders may want to approach the most likely prospects to confirm that they might indeed be interested in the project many federal agencies and foundations are willing to provide an assessment of preliminary one or twopage concept paper before formal proposal is prepared the concept paper should give brief description of the needs to be addressed who is to carry out the project what is to be accomplished by what means how long it will take how the accomplishments will be measured plans for the future how much it will cost and the ways this proposal relates to the mission of the funding source developing concept paper is excellent preparation for writing the final proposal the grant seeker should try to see the project or activity fr om the viewpoint of the grantmaking agency or foundation like the proposal the concept paper should be brief clear and informative it is httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32159g10g152g160g561g157g152g561g6g142g159g142g149g152g153g561g138g151g141g561g25g155g146g157g142g561g138g561 g9g155g138g151g157g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g561 g561

is not seen as the end of the process but only as the midpoint the funder will want to know what will happen to the project once the grant ends for example will it be selfsupporting or will it be used as demonstration to apply for further funding will it need ongoing support for how long and what are the anticipated outcomes if the funding source expresses interest in the concept paper the grant seeker can ask for suggestions criticism and guidance before writing the final proposal feedback and dialog are essential elements to successful funding proposal throughout the proposal writing stage an applicant may want to keep notebook or file handy to write down or gather ideas and related materials and review them the gathering of documents such as articles of incorporation tax exemption certificates and bylaws should be completed if possible before the writing begins at the end of this report useful websites review cover proposal writing give sample grant proposals including template for writing proposal and link to federal program information and grants management circulars

presentation things to be considered include the following all of the requirements of the funding source must be met prescribed format necessary inclusions deadlines etc the proposal should have clear descriptive title the proposal should be cohesive whole building logically with one section leading to another this is an especially important consideration when several people have been involved in its preparation language should be clear and concise devoid of jargon explanations should be offered for acronyms and terms which may be unfamiliar to someone outside the field each of the parts of the proposal should provide as brief but informative narrative as possible with supporting data relegated to an appendix at various stages in the proposal writing process the proposal should be reviewed by number of interested and disinterested parties each time it has been critiqued it may be necessary to rethink the project and its presentation while such revision is necessary to clarify the proposal one of the dangers is that the original excitement of those making the proposal sometimes gets written out somehow this must be conveyed in the final proposal applicants are advised make it interesting httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32159g10g152g160g561g157g152g561g6g142g159g142g149g152g153g561g138g151g141g561g25g155g146g157g142g561g138g561

the organizations highest official it should be addressed to the individual at the funding source with whom the organization has dealt and should re fer to earlier discussions while giving brief outline of the needs addressed in the proposal the cover letter should demonstrate familiarity with the mission of the grantmaking agency or foundation and emphasize the ways in which this project contributes to these goals g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g561g21g158g150g150g138g155g162g497g561g17g158g157g149g146g151g142g561g152g143g561g18g155g152g147g142g140g157g561g9g152g138g149g156g561 the grant proposal summary outlines the proposed project and should appear at the beginning of the proposal it could be in the form of cover letter or separate page but should definitely be briefno longer than two or three paragraphs the summary should be prepared after the grant proposal has been developed in order to encompass all the key points necessary to communicate the objectives of the project it is this document that becomes the cornerstone of the proposal and the initial impression it gives will be critical to the success of the venture in many cases the summary will be the first part of the proposal package seen by agency or foundation offi cials and very possibly could be the only part of the package that is carefully reviewed before the decision is made to consider the project any further the summary should include description of the applicant definition of the problem to be solved statement of the objectives to be achieved an outline of the activities and procedures to be used to accomplish those objectives description of the evaluation design plans for the

applicants describe their organization and demonstrate that they are qualified to carry out the proposed projectthey establish their credibility and make the point that they are good investment in more than page statements made here should be carefully tailored pointing out that the overall goals and purposes of the applicant are consistent with those of the funding source this section should provide the following brief history of the organization its past and present operations its goals and mission its significant accomplishments any success stories reference should be made to grants endorsements and press coverage the organization has already received with supporting documentation included in the appendix qualifications of its professional staff and list of its board of directors indicate whether funds for other parts of the project are being sought elsewhere such evidence will strengthen the proposal demonstrating to the reviewing officer that all avenues of support have been throughly explored an individual applicant should include succinct resume relating to the objectives of the proposal what makes the applicant eligible to undertake the work or project

should make clear concise and wellsupported statement of the problem to be addressed from the beneficiaries viewpoint in more than two pages the best way to collect information about the problem is to conduct and document both formal and informal needs assessment for program in the target or service area the information provided should be both factual and directly related to the problem addressed by the proposal areas to document are as follows purpose for developing the proposal beneficiarieswho are they and how will they benefit social and economic costs to be affected nature of the problem

applicant or organization came to realize the problem exists and what is currently being done about the problem stress what gaps exist in addressing the problem that will be addressed by the proposal remaining alternatives available when funding has been exhausted explain what will happen to the project and the impending implications most important the specific manner through which problems might be solved review the resources needed considering how they will be used and to what end one of the pitfalls to be avoided is defining the problem as lack of program or facility ie giving one of the possible solutions to problem as the problem itself for example the lack of medical center in an economically depressed area is not the problemthe problem is that poor people in the area have health needs that are not currently being addressed the problem described should be of reasonable dimensions with the targeted population and geographic area clearly defined it should include retrospective vi ew of the situation describing past efforts to ameliorate it and making projections for the future the problem statement developed with input from the beneficiaries must be supported by statistics and statements from authorities in the fields the case must be made that the applicant because of its history demonstrable skills and past accomplishments is the right organization to solve the problem there is considerable body of literature on the exact assessment techniques to be used any local regional or state government planning office or local university offering course work in planning and evaluation techniques should be able to provide excellent background references types of data that may be collected include historical geographic quantitative factual statistical and philosophical information as well as studies completed by colleges and literature searches from public or university libraries local colleges or universities which have department or section related to the proposal topic may help determine if there is interest in developing student or faculty project to conduct needs assessment it may be helpful to include examples of the findings for highlighting in the proposal

been described proposed solutions have to be outlined wherever possible in quantitative terms the population to be served time frame of the project and specific anticipated outcomes must be defined the figures used should be verifiable if the proposal is funded the stated objectives will probably be used to evaluate program progress so they should be realistic there is literature available to help identify and write program objectives it is important not to confuse objectives with methods or strategies toward those ends for example the objective should not be stated as building prenatal clinic in adams county but as reducing the infant mortality rate in adams county to x percent by specific date the concurrent strategy or method of accomplishing the stated objective may include the establishment of mobile clinics that bring services to the community

the program design refers to how the project is expected to work and solve the stated problem just as the statement of objectives builds upon the problem statement the description of methods or strategies builds upon the statement of objectives for each objective specific plan of action should be laid out it should delineate sequence of justifiable activities indicating the proposed staffing and timetable for each task this section should be carefully reviewed to make sure that what is being proposed is realistic in terms of the applicants resources and time frame outline the following 1 the activities to occur along with the related resources and staff needed to operate the project inputs 2 flow chart of the organizational features of the project describe how the parts interrelate where personnel will be needed and what they are expected to do identify the kinds of facilities transportation and support services required throughputs 3 explain what will be achieved through 1 and 2 above outputs that is plan for measurable results project staff may be required to produce evidence of program performance through an examination of stated objectives during either site visit by the grantor agency or foundation andor grant reviews which may involve peer review committees 4 it may be useful to devise diagram of the program design such procedure will help to conceptualize both the

undertake each part of the plan wherever possible justify in the narrative the course of action taken the most economical method should be used that does not compromise or sacrifice project quality the financial expenses associated with performance of the project will later become points of negotiation with the government or foundation program staff if everything is not carefully justified in

consideration at every stage of the proposals development data collected for the problem statement form compar ative basis for determining whether measurable objectives are indeed being met and whether proposed methods are accomplishing these ends or whether different parts of the plan need to be finetuned to be made more effective and efficient among the considerations will be whether evaluation will be done by the organization itself or by outside experts the organizations will have to decide whether outside experts have the standing in the field and the degree of objectivity that would justify the added expense or whether the job could be done with sufficient expertise by its ow n staff without taking too much time away from the project itself methods of measurement whether standardized tests interviews questionnaires observation etc will depend upon the nature and scope of the project procedures and schedules for gathering analyzing and reporting data will need to be spelled out the evaluation component is twofold 1 product evaluation and 2 process evaluation product evaluation addresses results that can be attributed to the project as well as the extent to which the project has satisfied its stated objectives process evaluation addresses how the project was conducted in terms of consistency with the stated plan of action and the effectiveness of the various activities within the plan most federal agencies now require some form of program evaluation among grantees the requirements of the proposed project should be explored carefully evaluations may be conducted by an internal staff member an evaluation firm or both many federal grants include specific time frame for performance review and evaluation for instance several economic development programs require grant recipients to report on quarterly and annual basis in instances where there are specified evaluation periods the applicant should state the amount of time needed to evaluate how the feedback will be disseminated among the proposed staff and schedule for review and comment evaluation designs may start at the beginning middle or end of project but the applicant should specify startup time it is desirable and advisable to submit an evaluation design at the start of project for two reasons convincing evaluations require the collection of appropriate baseline data before and during program operations and if the evaluation design cannot be prepared at the outset then critical review of the program design may be advisable

progresses it is much easier and cheaper to modify good design if the problem is not well defined and carefully analyzed for cause and effect relationships then good evaluation design may be difficult to achieve sometimes pilot study is needed to begin the identification of facts and relationships often thorough literature search may be sufficient evaluation requires both coordination and agreem ent among program decision makers above all the federal grantor agencys or foundations requirements should be highlighted in the evaluation design also grantor agencies may require specific evaluation techniques such as designated data formats an existing information collection system or they may offer financial inducements for voluntary participation in national evaluation study the applicant should ask specifically about these points also for federal programs consult the criteria for selecting proposals section of the cfda program description to determine the exact evaluation methods to be required for specific program if funded g8g158g157g158g155g142g561g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561 the last narrative part of the proposal explains what will happen to the program once the grant ends it should describe plan for continuation beyond the grant period and outline all other contemplated fundraising efforts and future plans for applying for additional grants projections for operating and maintaining facilities and equipment should also be given the applicant may discuss maintenance and future program funding if program funds are for construction activity and may account for other needed expenditures if program includes purchase of equipment

depending upon the nature of the project and the requirements of the funding sour ce complete wellthoughtout budget serves to reinforce the applicants credibility and to increase the likelihood of the proposal being funded the estimated expenses in the budget should build upon the justifications given in the narrative section of the proposal wellprepared budget should be reasonable and demonstrate that the funds being asked for will be used wisely the budget should be as concrete and specific as possible in its estimates every effort should be made to be realistic to estimate costs accurately and not to underestimate staff time the budget format should be as clear as possible it should begin with budget summary which like the proposal summary is written after the entire budget has been prepared each section of the budget should be in outline form listing line items under major headings and subdivisions each of the major components should be subtotaled with grand total placed at the end if the funding source provides forms most of these elements can simply be filled into the appropriate spaces generally budgets are divided into two categories personnel costs and nonpersonnel costs in preparing the budget the applicant may first review the proposal and make lists of items needed for the project the personnel section usually includes breakdown of the following items httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32159g10g152g160g561g157g152g561g6g142g159g142g149g152g153g561g138g151g141g561g25g155g146g157g142g561g138g561 g9g155g138g151g157g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g561 g561

such as health insurance and retirement plans and consultant and contract services the items in the nonpersonnel section will vary widely but may include spaceoffice rental or leasing costs utilities purchase or rental of equipment training to use new equipment and photocopying office supplies and so on some hard to pin down budget areas are utilities rental of buildings and equipment salary increases food telephones insurance and transportation budget adjustments are sometimes made after the grant award but this can be lengthy process the applicant should be certain that implementation continuation and phasedown costs can be met costs associated with leases evaluation systems hardsoft match requirements audits development implementation and maintenance of information and accounting systems and other longterm financial commitments should be considered wellprepared budget justifies all expenses and is consistent with the proposal narrative some areas in need of an evaluation for consistency are as follows salaries in the proposal in relation to those of the applicant organization should be similar if new staff persons are being hired additional space and equipment should be considered as necessary if the budget calls for an equipment purchase it should be the type allowed by the grantor agency if additional space is rented the increase in insurance should be supported in the case of federal grants if an indirect cost rate applies to the proposal such as outlined by the office of management and budget omb in circulars such as numbers a122 a21 and a87 httpwwwwhitehousegovombgrants grants_circularshtml the division between direct and indirect costs should not be in conflict and the aggregate budget totals should refer directly to the approved formula if matching funds are required the cont ributions to the matching fund should be taken out of the budget unless otherwise specified in the application instructions in learning to develop convincing budget and determining appropriate format reviewing other grant proposals is often helpful the applicant may ask government agencies and foundations for copies of winning grants proposals grants seeker s may also search the internet under keywords such as sample grants budget for examples such as the following

httpwwwuwrfedugrantsbudgetshtm in preparing budgets for government grants the applicant may keep in mind that funding levels of federal assistance programs change yearly it is useful to review the appropriations and average grants or loans awarded over the past several years to try to project future funding levels see financial information section of the cfda prog ram description for fiscal year appropriations and estimates and range and average of financial assistance for prior years awards however it is safer never to anticipate that the income from the grant will be the sole support for larger projects this consideration should be given to the overall budget requirements and in particular to budget line items most subject to inflationary pressures restraint is important in determining inflationary cost projections avoid padding budget line items but the applicant may attempt to anticipate possible future increases for federal grants it is also important to become familiar with grants management requirements the cfda identifies in the program description the office of management and budget circulars applicable to each federal program applicants should review appropriate documents while developing proposal budget since they are essential in determining items such as cost principles administrative and audit requirements and compliance and conforming with government guidelines for federal domestic assistance omb circulars are available full text on the web at httpwwwwhitehousegovombgrantsgrants_circularshtml to coordinate federal grants to states
