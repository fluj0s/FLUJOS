the wake of the disaster signed into law by president nixon on january 1 1970 nepa was the first of several major environm ental laws passed in the 1970s it declared national policy to protect the environment and created council on environmental quality ceq in the executive office of the president to implement the national policy nepa required that detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment the detailed statement would ultimately be referred to as an environmental impact statement or eis for many federal actions undertaken in response to an emergency or major disaster nepas environmen tal review requirements ar exempted under provisions of the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act stafford act ceq regulations also allow for emergency alternative arrangements for the preparation of eiss in the wake of the ka trina and rita congressional interest in the nepa process has focused primarily on projects for which exemptions or the potential for alternative arrangements exist some members of congress ve discussed the need for legislation that would provide waivers to or streamline methods of compliance with nepas environmental review requirements the need for thos provisions some members of congress assert originates from two areas of concern the role that neparelated litigation may have played in delaying past floodcontrol projects t wo projects in particular have been widely reported in the press and nepas role in high energy prices caused by delays in energy development projects ch as oil exploration projects and refinery permitting others argue that nepa is being used as scapegoat after the new orleans flooding further they charge that delays in energyrela ted projects are often unfairly attributed to nepa when delay may represent the time it takes for multiple agencies to coordinate response to complicated project proposals that may require compliance with multiple local state and federal environmental laws this report provides an overview of nepa requirements relevant to the hurricanes response and recovery effort s its

pamela baldwin 2 40 cfr 150827nepa and hurricane response recovery and rebuilding efforts introduction in the wake of hurricanes katrina and r ita the federal gove rnment has engaged in variety of actions in response to the disaster and will conti nue to be involved in actions to help the gulf coast states recover and rebuild many of the actions proposed in relation to the disaster would require compliance with local state and federal environmental laws and regulations the requirements of the national envi ronmental policy act of 1969 nepa 42 usc 4321 et seq have drawn par ticular attention fro m some members of congress and other interested stakehol ders eg professi onal associations community organizations and environmen tal groups among other provisions nepa generally requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of an action before proceeding with it emergency response actions such as pr oviding essential relief to victims managing disaster debris and repairing or restoring public facilities damaged by the disaster are exempted from nepas requi rements under provisions of the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act stafford act nepas environmental review requi rements may however be applicable to longterm recovery projects such as the constr uction of new flood control mechanisms nepa provisions relevant to the hurricanes nepa requires all federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of proposed action before proceeding with it to document such consideration nepa requires the preparation of an environmen tal impact statement eis for federal actions that will significantly impact the environment1 the significance of an actions environmental impacts must be determined casebycase based on an analysis of the context and intensity of the impacts2 if it is not clear whether project would have significant impacts an environmental assessment ea must be prepared in order to ma ke that determinationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33104crs2 3 40 cfr 1500 et seq 4 two agencies that will play significant role in response and recovery actions are the federal emergency management agency fema and the us army corps of engineers the corps each agency has its own regu lations to guide its implementation of nepa those environmental regulations can be found at 44 cfr 10 fema and 33 cfr 230 the corps 5 ceq is charged with providing oversight nd guidance to agencies with regard to eis preparation epa is required to review and comment publicly on the environmental impacts of proposed federal activities including those fo r which an eis is prepared epa is also the official recipient of all eiss prepared by federal agencies however neither agency has enforcement authority with regard to an ag encys environmental review requirements regulations that specify how agencies must implement nepas eis requirements were promulgated in 1978 by the council on environmental quality ceq in the executive office of the president3 in addition ceq regulations directed federal agencies to adopt and enforce their ow n regulations or procedures implementing nepas environmental review requirements that are specific to typical classes of actions undertaken by that agency4 the ceq regulations also directed agencies to develop categories of actions that are determined through agency experience to typically have signific ant environmental impact and thus may generally be categorically excluded from th requirement to prepare an ea or eis such actions are referred to as categorical exclusions nepa has been interpreted to be pr ocedural statute th at does not require agencies to elevate envir onmental concerns above othe rs instead nepa requires only that the agency assess the environmental consequences of an action and its alternatives before proceeding if the adverse environmental effects of the proposed action are adequately identified and eval uated the agency is not constrained by nepa from deciding that other benefits outweigh the environmental costs and moving forward with the action most agencies use nepa as an umbrella statute meaning it is framework to coordinate or demonstrate compliance with any studies reviews or consultations required by any other environm ental laws the use of nepa in this capacity can lead to confusion the need to comply with nother environmental law such as the clean water act or endangered species act may be identified within the framework of the nepa process but nepa itself is not the source of the obligation unlike other environmentrelated statutes individual agency has enforcement authority with regard to nepas environmental revi ew requirements5 this lack of enforcement authority is sometimes cited as the reason that litigation is chosen as an avenue by individuals andor groups that disagree with how an agency meets nepas mandate or eis require ments for given project eg they may charge that an eis is inadequate or that the environmental impact s of an action will in fact be significant when an agency claims that they are not critics of the nepa process charge that individuals andor groups w ho disapprove of federal project will use litigation to delay or halt it others argue that litigation only results when agencies do not comply with nepas procedural requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33104crs3 6 local state and federal environmental laws and regulations may still provide some exemption or regulatory allowance in the event of an emergency 7 40 cfr 150611 the corps has regulatory provisions similar to ceqs that address emergency actions femas regulations refere nce statutory exemptions provided under the stafford actnepa exemptions and alternative arrangements in responding to emergencies and major disasters existing provisions of the stafford act or ceqs regulations either statutorily exempt certain activities from nepa or allow for alternative means of complying with ceqs regulatory provisions certain response actions sp ecifically excluded from nepa by the stafford act at 42 usc 5159 include the following the provision of certain federal re sources or assistance essential to meeting immediate threats to life and property resulting from major disaster see actions speci fied under 42 usc 5170a and 5170b the repair restoration and replacem ent to predisaster condition of public facilities or certain private nonprofit facilities damaged or destroyed by major disaster see 42 usc 5172 debris removal from public or private land after major disastersee 42 usc 5173 it is important to understand that as with actions that are cat egorically excluded an action statutorily excluded from nepa is not exempt from the requirements of the other environmental statutes an agency would still be respons ible for complying with all other applicable local state and federal laws and regulations relating to health safety and the environment 6 this would encompa ss federal environmental statutes including among others the cl ean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the coastal zone management act the coastal barrier resources act the endangered species act and the national historic preservation act in addition to statutory exclusions to nepa ceq regulations allow for alternative arrangements in the event of an emergency7 in such circumstances the federal agency taking an action s hould consult with ceq about what those arrangements may be and the time frame within which they must be completed these alternative arrangements do not waive the requirement to comply with nepa regulations but establish an alternative m eans of compliance agencies and ceq are to limit such arrangements to actions n ecessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency for example in 1998 the us forest service worked with ceq to establish alternative regulatory compliance arrangements to implement emergency actions to restore portions of approximately 103000 acres of forested lands on the national forests and gr asslands in texas that were damaged by windstorm the agency believed it would have taken up to six m onths using normal nepahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33104crs4 8 march 23 1999 statement of sandra key associate deputy chief programs and legislation us

repair or reconstruct critical infrastructure in the new orleans metropolitan area10 critical infrastructure includes hospitals and healthcare facilities utilities and wastewater treatment plants permanent police and fire stations government and court administration buildings detention centers jails and permanent schools if the reconstruction at issue simply rest ored previously existing facilities to pre disaster conditions the action would be exempt from nepa under the stafford act see discussion of 42 usc 5159 above however fema anticipates that grant applications from louisiana will more strongly reflect future demands than returning to predisaster conditions proposed projects w ill not necessarily be the same size nature or location will use current building codes and

acc ounts is whether or not nepa related litigation played role in delaying new orleans hurricane and flood protection projects14 lake pontchartrain and vicinity barrier project t h l k pontchartrain and vicinity barrier proj ect was approved by congress in the flood control act of 1965 the original design would have involve d the construction of barrier system at the entrances to lake pontchartrain to protect new orleans from storm surges in 1974 the corps issued fi nal eis for the project in response group of community and environmental organizations including group called save our wetlands filed suit asserting th at the corps eis did not comply with nepa15 the group argued that the corps had not considered the impact that the barrier system would have on local fisher ies and that they argued alternative hurricane protection measures such as building up existing levees had not been considered in 1977 judge charles schwartz jr rule d that the corps final eis did not comply with the requirements of nepa ho wever in his ruling the judge stated this opinion should in way be construed as precluding the lake pontchartrain project as proposed or re flecting on its advisability in any manner the courts opinion is limited strictly to the finding that the environmental impact statement of august 1974 for this project was legally inadequate upon proper compliance with the law with re gard to the impact statement this injunction will be dissolved and any hurri cane plan thus properly presented will be allowed to proceed in response to the court injunction th corps conducted reevaluation study of the project the study concluded that the barrier plan should be abandoned in favor of highlevel plan the highl evel plan included variety of elements including raising and strengthening existing hurricane protection levee systems completing certain hurricane protection levee systems repairing and rehabilitating seawalls and building new hurricane levees16

18 terms of the consent decree in this case were provided in september 22 2005 telephone interview with melissa samet an atto rney with american rivers party to the caseupon reevaluating the project alternativ the corps found that making more protective levees and flood walls would be more cost effective than inlet barriers17 the outcome then was that the corp s pursued alternative flood protection systems it is difficult to know whether the corps would have ultimately proceeded with the original barrier plan absent the requirement to improve its eis and the opposition to the project by some members of the public nor is it possible to know whether the original plan would have been more successful in protecting new orleans mississippi river flood control project the second project discussed in the press relates to mississippi ri ver flood control project involving over 1610 miles of flood control protection comple tion of the entire project will require construction of 128 parate components across seven states including louisiana the primary purpose of the project is improved flood protection from the mississippi river not hurricane protection eg st orm surge from the gulf of mexico the final eis for the project was completed in 1976 in 1996 the mississippi river basin alliance with other conserva tion groups filed suit on the basis that supplemental eis was needed to account fo r new information and new circumstances that had arisen over the previous 20 years and changes to the project since the final eis was issued settlement negotiations in the case resulted in consent decree that obligated the corps to prepare supplemen tal eis the consent decree included provision that allowed the corps to proceed with project components scheduled for construction while supplemen tal eis was being prepared for the segment of the levee at issue18 according to the parties in this case the levee segment at issue is located primarily between vicksburg ssissippi and baton rouge louisiana 100 miles north of new orleans after distributing the supplemental eis and receiving public comment on it the corps issued its final eis in july of 1998 subsequently the mississippi

standard of review in the case the circuit court stated that nepa exists to ensure process not result20 the corps was free to continue with this proj ect and it is now in the construction stage there is information available to suggest that the corps work on the segment of the project in southern louisian that could affect river flooding in new orleans was delayed by this litigation nepas role in longterm response actions nepas role in two broad categories of federal actions has drawn the attention of some members of congress the fi rst category includes projects intended to facilitate the longterm recove ry of the impacted region these actions include those taken in direct response to katrina and r ita examples of such projects may include floodcontrol or hurricane protection project s eg new wetlands restoration projects or new levee construction projects nd federallyfunded c onstruction of new housing as opposed to federal funding of th repair or reconstr uction of previously existing housing or projects that were c overed under an existing nepa analysis the second category of actions may include those undertaken as an indirect result of the two hurricanes primarily these incl ude energy development projects undertaken in response to increased oil and natural ga s prices eg oil exploration projects and expedited refinery permitting and construction both classes of projects would not likel qualify for the stafford act exemptions or alternative arrangements that apply under emergency conditions however it is not unprecedented for congress to provide statutory exemptions to nepa or to specify changes in environmental review requirements for specific projects21 such exemptions and changes to the nepa pr ocess are found in variety of current legislative proposals that would either wa ive nepa or streamline its provisions for certain hurricane recovery projects or energy development projects two of which are discussed below legislative proposals regarding hurricane recovery projects current legislative proposals go beyond the existing provisions of the stafford act that exempt from nepa activities that repa ir restore and re place public facilities or private nonprofit facilities damaged or destroyed by major disaster introduced on september 22 2005 in the senate s 1765 and on septembe r 28 20 05 in the house hr 3958 the louisiana

environmental regulationsreferred to as the pelican commission would be established one duty of the pelican commission would be to enter into contract with the corps to develop work plan for the

for naviga tional interests22 in developing the work plan projects within the major disaster area declared by the president on august 29 2005 would be considered priority projects also included as priority projects are at minimum certain hurricane protection projects including the lake pontchartrain and vi cinity barrier project discussed above louisiana coastal area ecosystem restora tion and storm surge protection projects flood control projects nd navigation projects projects implemented by the pelican commission in accordance with the work plan would be deemed to comply with all applicable re quirements of nepa23 in addition to waivers of nepas requireme nts 502 of the bills would allow the president for the twoyear period after enactment of the bill to issue an emergency permit for any project carried out in response to or as part of the reconstruction effort relating to hurricane katrina or rela ted condition as the president determines to be in the best interests of the united states the types of projects that would qualif for an emergency presidential permit are broader than the types of projects th at may qualify for nepa waiver under the pelican commissions work plan these projects would also be exempted from nepa under 652 authority to facilitate r econstruction24 under that section it is specified that the presidents emer gency permitting authority applies to the authority of the administrator of the environmental protection agency and the secretary of agriculture with regard to the application of pesticides to control the mosquito population under the federal wate r pollution control act and the federal insecticide fungicide nd rodenticide act 7 usc 136 et seq and the secretaries of agriculture and the interior with regard to laws to expedite salvaging timber in the area and securing timber supply for the pulp and paper industry further with regard to the presidential emergency permitting process any project or activity relating

certain energy development projects wa s debated it was charged by some members of congress that changes to the nepa implementation process were needed to reduce delays and more efficiently facilitate delivery of needed projects other members of congress argued that delays attributed to the nepa process may be the result of variet of factors such as poor implementation of alreadyexisting regulations either individual agency or ceq regulations the energy policy act of 2005 includes va riety of provisions that are intended to expedite the process for completing or complying with nepas environmental review requirements for more informati on about these provisions see crs report rl32873 key environmental issues in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 hr 6 coordinated by brent d yacobucci in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita some members of c ongress have begun to look at additional legislative proposals to expedite nepa the projects drawing the most attention are those that involve expanding refinery capacity th is may include waiving environmental requirements including nepa for siting and permitting new and expanded refineries the first such bill the f uel supply improvement act of 2005 hr 3836 was introduced by congressman shadegg on september 20 2005 the bill specifies expedited refinery permitting requirements that would be applicable to refinery repair or reconstruction at an existing refinery undertaken in the area affected by hurricane katrina and undertak as result of hurricane katrina on october 7 the gasoline for amer icas security act of 2005 hr 3893 passed in the house the stated intent of the bill is to expedite the construction of new refining capacity in the united states among other measures the bill would provide for presidential desi gnation of potential refinery sites on federal lands and military bases that are closing the bill would also expedite the process for complying with certain environmental requirements by establishing process coordination procedures for obtaining certa in federal authorizations the bill defines federal authorizations as permits special use authorizations certifications opinions or other approvals required under federal law the process coordination procedures including the authorization to establish deadlines and certain limits on judicial review would apply at the request of state governor to the process for obtaining necessary federal authorizations for the sitin g construction expansion or operation of any new refining capacity 101102 and the siting of crude oil or refined petroleum product pi peline facilities 201202 the process coordination pro cedures appear to apply only to the procedures for obtaining federal authorizations not to the environmental review process under nepa however under 102b the bill w ould designate the department of energy as the lead agency for coordinating applicab federal authorizations and any related environmental reviews for refineries s imilarly under 202b the federal energy regulatory commission would be designated as the lead agency for coordinating applicable federal authoriza tions and any related envir onmental reviews for pipeline facilities
