quality of life for servicemembers and guard and reserve construction for fy1998 the administration has requested budget authority of 84 billion this is down from the fy1996 level of 111 billion and the fy1997 level of 98 billion the house and senate appropriations conference committee added 800 million and 129 additional projects to the request on october 6 1997 the president exercised his line

in their appropriations conference report hrept 105247 both chambers added 800 million and 129 projects to the presidents request for the military construction bill hr 2016 the president signed the bill on september 30 1997 creating pl 10545 on october 6 the president exercised his line item veto authority by targeting 38 projects in 24 states added by congress totalling 287 million both the senate appropriations committee and the house national security committee held hearings in october on the decision process for the presidents line item veto of the military construction bill the congress considered two disapproval bills the senate passed s 1292 which would have reversed the cancellation of 36 of the 38 projects on october 30 the house passed bill to reinstate all 38 projects hr 2631 on november 8 then the house passed version was approved by the senate on november 9 obviating the need for conference committee the president vetoed the bill on november 13 the projects were restored by veto override of hr 2631 in the second session of the 105th congress on february 5 1998 the house took the first step by voting 34769 to overturn the presidents veto on february 26 1998 the senate overrode the veto by vote of 7820 background content of military construction appropriations and defense authorization bills the military construction appropriations bill funds construction projects and real property maintenance of the active army navy marine corps air force and their reserve components defensewide construction us contributions to the nato security investment program formerly called the nato infrastructure program and military family housing operations and construction the bill also provides funding for the base realignment and closure account which finances most base realignment and closure costs including construction of new facilities for transferred personnel and functions and environmental cleanup at closing sites the military construction appropriations bill is only one of several annual pieces of legislation that concern funding for national defense other major legislation includes 1 the defense appropriations bill that provides funds for all military activities of the department of defense except for military construction 2 the national defense authorization bill that authorizes appropriations for national defense1 and 3 the energy and water development appropriations bill that provides funding for atomic energy defense activities of the department of energy two other appropriations bills vahudindependent agencies and commercejusticestate also include small amounts for national defense in addition the energy and water development appropriations bill provides funds for civil projects carried out by the us army corps of engineers the annual defense authorization bill authorizes all the activities in the defense appropriation measures described above therefore major debates over defense policy and funding issues including military construction can be also found in the authorization bill since issues in the defense authorization and appropriations bills intertwine this report highlights salient parts of the authorization bill along with the military construction appropriation process most funds appropriated each year must be expended in that fiscal year military construction appropriations are an exception since these funds are made available for obligation for five fiscal years the separate military construction appropriations bill dates to the late 1950s when large defense buildup occurred in response to intercontinental ballistic missile threats and the soviet launch of sputnik defense construction spending soared as facilities were hardened missile silos were constructed and other infrastructure was built the appropriations committees established military construction subcommittees to deal with this new level of activity consequently the separate military construction bill was created the first stand alone military construction bill was in fy1959 pl 85852 previously military construction funding was provided through annual defense appropriations or supplemental appropriations bills military construction appropriations are the major but not the sole source of funds for facility investments by the military services and defense agencies the defense appropriations bill provides some funds for real property maintenance in operation and maintenance accounts in addition funds for construction and maintenance of morale welfare and recreationrelated facilities are partially provided through proceeds of commissaries recreation user fees and other income consideration of military construction budget starts when the presidents budget is delivered to the congress in late february or march for fy1998 the presidents budget requested 84 billion 14 less than the 98 billion appropriated for fy1997 status table 1 shows the key legislative steps

president exercised his lineitem veto authority2 on the military construction appropriations law pl 10545 eliminating 38 projects in 24 states totalling 287 million see table 6 the 287 million savings will go directly to deficit reduction and not to the department of defense the chair of the presidents national economic council gene sperling explained to the press on october 6 that the main savings from the line item veto comes not from what you lineitem but from the savings that you get by encouraging fiscal discipline in future bills he continued that for the line item veto to have its power as deterrent effect on unnecessary spendingthe president has to be willing and is willing to use it when necessary the president used three criteria to line item veto projects added by congress 1 the projects were not in the department of defenses future years defense plan fydp 2 design work for the projects was not completed and therefore the project could not be executed in the coming fiscal year 3 the projects would provide substantial contribution to improving the quality of life of us troops the congress can send the vetoed items back to the president with majority vote this is called disapproval bill if the president vetoes them again twothirds majority is needed to override disapproval bills the congress considered two disapproval bills s 1292 which would have reversed the cancellation of 36 of the 38 projects see senate action below for details and hr 2631 which reinstates all 38 projects the house passed hr 2631 on november 8 1997 by 36264 vote then the house passed version was approved by the senate on november 9 1997 by voice vote obviating the need for conference committee the president vetoed hr 2631 on november 13 1997 despite the white houses admission that they used erroneous data for some of the canceled projects the office of 2 see the line item veto act procedural issues by louis fisher and virginia mcmurtry crs report 97973 for details on the line item veto process management and budget omb has refused to confirm which projects or how many were vetoed by mistake the projects were restored by veto override of hr 2631 during the second session of the 105th congress on february 5 1998 the house took the first step by voting 34769 to overturn the presidents veto on february 26 1998 the senate overrode the veto by vote of 7820 with the veto overturned funding is restored for the 38 targeted projects senate action on october 9 the senate appropriations committee held hearing on the use of the line item veto on the military construction appropriations bill the witnesses were military budget officials from the army air force and navy chairman stevens stated that the purpose of the hearings was to gather factual information on the criteria used for the 38 projects that were vetoed the senators also stated their opinions on the presidents use of the line item veto on the bill according to the clinton administration the vetoed projects needed to meet all three criteria see above to be put on the veto list the criteria did not hold up to the data the military officers provided on particular projects first the data showed that 33 of the 38 projects were in the pentagons fydp second some of the projects did have design work in progress and that the original information that president received on design work for some projects was incomplete also these were executable projects defined in the testimony as contracts that could be started in fy1998 third the committee questioned the white houses judgement of the quality of life merit of the 38 projects most of the 38 projects did not meet two out of three criteria for inclusion on the veto list chairman stevens stated that based on these facts that he would introduce disapproval bill to overturn the veto on october 24 the senate appropriations committee approved s 1292 to overturn 34 of the 38 line item vetoes in the military construction appropriations hr 2016 pl 105 45 four items from indiana wisconsin and south dakota were left out of the disapproval measure since senators from these states did not want to vote for veto override or go on record opposing the line item veto on october 30 the senate passed s 1292 as amended with two more indiana projects by 6930 vote see the disapproval bills section above for information on passage and the veto override process house action on october 22 the house national security committee hnsc held hearing on the line item veto and canceled projects in the military construction and defense appropriations bills although jurisdiction for remedying line item vetoes resides in the committee on appropriations the hnsc stated that it was important to investigate the data and process that the president used to choose projects to veto as in the senate appropriations committee hearing on the line item veto the witnesses for the hnsc hearing were military budget officials from the army air force and navy hearing testimony is located at httpwwwhousegovnsc the purpose of the hearing was to establish the record on the specific items that were vetoed the rationale for the cancellation and the effect the delay of the projects may have on the armed forces the hnsc was concerned about the use of the line item veto and some members called for repeal of the law others focused on the chronic underfunding of the defense budget and that the savings from the canceled projects went to us treasury and out of the defense budget members were irked that the vetoed projects were considered pork by the president and media those members pointed out that the added projects went through rigorous screening process by the hnsc were requested by facilities as priority projects and that many of the projects were in the presidents future years defense plan fydp the military budget officers admitted that erroneous data on the design status was passed from the pentagon to omb the members were distressed that their congressional offices had more uptodate data on the design of projects than the pentagon and president inadequate and outofdate data highlighted the flaws of the decision process to cancel projects the hnsc invited the deputy secretary of defense john hamre and the director of omb franklin raines to the october 22 hearing however both declined to testify some members of the hnsc were incensed these top officials did not attend the hearing especially after it became clear that the process questions the members were interested in could only be answered by hamre and raines the house national security committee would like to have another hearing on the line item veto with john hamre and franklin raines in attendance representative skeen from new mexico introduced hr 2631 in early october which would reverse the cancellation of the 38 vetoed projects the house called up the bill under suspension of the rules on november 8 the measure passed by 35262 vote see the disapproval bills section above for details on passage and the veto override process conference agreement the conference committee hrept 105247 added 800 million to the presidents request the house approved the conference report by vote of 41312 on september 16 the senate passed the report by vote of 973 on september 17 the bill was signed into law pl 10545 by the president on september 30 the conference agreement used savings of 1088 million from reestimations of inflation and adjustments of foreign currency fluctuations these savings were taken as lumpsum from the military construction appropriations bill total see table 4 the conference committee rejected the practice of using prior year savings for current fy1998 program and instructed the pentagon to use the traditional method of requesting rescissions of funds by account and fiscal year see prior year savings for current year programs section below for more information the conference committees report also highlighted base realignment and closure brac construction projects historic preservation and unified design guidance the conference report emphasized that defense committees must be notified of the transfer of brac construction money and that construction money cannot be reprogrammed the conference was concerned that historic family quarters are costly and tasked the pentagon to work with appropriate federal agencies to reduce the cost the conference report also directed the dod and armed services to report on possible unification of military construction design guidance and procedures house action on july 8 the house approved without amendment the 9183 billion recommended by the house military construction appropriations subcommittee hr 2016 hrept 105150 by vote of 39514 the house added 7998 million to the presidents request of the money appropriated 42 is for family housing 35 is for general military construction projects such as the construction and revitalization of barracks medical facilities day care centers environmental compliance and energy conservation and 23 is to meet the obligations of base realignment and closure brac accounts to view fact sheet on the subcommittee markup and full committee markup go to the press release section of representative packards home page httpwwwhousegovpackard house floor consideration had two themes first rep packard emphasized servicemembers quality of life as connected to the quality of military facilities second rep bereuter noted that the army national guard budget did not receive any additional money from the house since the guard did not clearly communicate its plans to the military construction appropriations subcommittee senate action the senate appropriations committee sac marked up their version of the military construction appropriations act on july 17 the subcommittee did not go through the markup process the bill went directly to the full committee the sac bill provides total of 9182 billion for military construction which exceeds the presidents request by 7997 million and is 100000 under the house appropriation of the money appropriated 41 is for family housing 36 is for military construction and 23 is for the obligations of the base realignment and closure accounts see table 4 or srept 10552 for chart comparing the presidents request the house bill and the senate bill in section 125 of their bill the senate appropriations committee used june 1997 inflation numbers from office of management and budget to reduce military construction nato infrastructure and base realignment and closure accounts by 31 million the sac directed that the inflation savings be applied to family housing accounts on pro rata basis therefore the 31 million inflation savings is taken as lump sum over the entire military construction and family housing budget see table 4 the senate appropriations committee highlighted barracks construction programs medical facilities and environmental compliance projects in their bill the sac approved 6599 million for the barracks construction program to provide single service members better barracks and dormitories this recommended level is 172 million over the budget request and 919 under the fy1997 level an additional 2085 million for medical facilities and 1036 million for environmental cleanup projects were added by the senate although the bill totals are almost the same active and reserve forces fared differently in the house and senate bills in the house active forces fared better than reserve forces the reverse is true in the senate bill which added 392 million for guard and reserve facilities compared to the houses increase of 155 million on july 22 the senate approved the sac recommendations for the fy1998 military appropriations act the vote was unanimous except for the votes cast by the senators from arizona mccain and kyl in the senate floor debate sen mccain protested against what he called the additional lowpriority and unrequested military construction projects which totalled 682 million he asked that the additional projects 42 active duty and 50 reserve guard be printed in the record sen mccain also worried about the trend for senators to earmark design and planning funds which previously were left for the discretion of the armed services departments budget resolution the budget resolution sets the stage for the appropriations process this years agreement hconres 84 passed on may 18 1997 and set ceilings on budget authority and outlays for functional categories of the budget the national defense budget function called 050 was set at 2682 billion in budget authority and 2660 billion in outlays for fy1998 the department of defenses budget accounts for 95 of the 050 budget function3 3 see crs report 97294 defense budget for fy1998 data summary by stephen daggett and continued in the framework of the budget agreement the chairs of the house and senate appropriations committees allocate the budget function according to appropriations subcommittees the amounts given to each subcommittee are called the 602b allocations the house appropriations committee approved its 602b allocations on june 18 with the senate appropriations committee approving theirs on june 19 the military construction subcommittees received similar allocations 9183 billion in the house and 92 billion in the senate these levels are down from the currently funded fy1997 level of 98 billion for military construction authorization process conference agreement on october 23 the conference committee for the defense authorization bill filed its report h rept 105340 the conference committee agreed on 92 billion 800 million more than the presidents request for military construction over 55 percent 441 million of the increase is for quality of life projects4 the defense authorizing conference report passed the house on october 23 and the senate on november 7 1997 the president signed the authorization bill on november 18 1997 creating pl 10585 house action the house of representatives approved the 91 billion for military construction as recommended by the house national security committee hnsc in the fy1998 defense authorization bill which is 750 million more than the presidents request the hnsc reported that over 60 472 million of the increase is dedicated to quality of life enhancements the committee highlighted additions to family housing troop housing child development centers education and training and the public and installation safety initiative senate action on july 11th the senate approved approximately 707 million more than the administrations fy1998 budget closely following the senate armed services committees sasc recommendation of 700 million addition the sasc designated 218 million of the additional money for unaccompanied personnel quarters child development centers dining facilities education centers and military family housing the remaining 189 million is for high priority projects submitted by the military services that were not funded in the presidents request many of them guard and reserve projects amendments to the defense authorization bill added 7 million to the sasc recommendations for military construction accounts the chairman and ranking member of the sasc senators thurmond and levin offered an amendment to reduce army family housing and navy military construction by 15 million to partially offset additional projects in missouri hawaii new mexico and vermont which totaled 22 million in face of antiquated facilities which are important to quality of life for servicemembers both the hnsc hrept 105132 and the sasc srept 10529 reports remarked on the low budget request compared to prior years 25 less than the fy1996 request the 3 continued mary t tyszkiewicz for more information on the 050 budget function and definition of budget authority and outlays 4 for more detailed information the fy1998 conference report and house authorization bill see the press releases and committee reports bills sections on the house national security home page at httpwwwhousegovnsc authorizing committees noted the continuing low priority military facilities received despite maintenance and modernization backlogs the house and senate have rejected the administrations proposal for two more base closure rounds and other reductions as proposed in the quadrennial defense review qdr5 the dods may 19 report to congress on longterm defense strategies the house did not consider more base closure rounds in committee or on the floor in the senate base closure amendment was defeated in committee on tie 99 vote on july 9 the senate passed an amendment to the fy1998 authorization bill to direct the dod to conduct major review and cost analysis before more bases could be closed this amendment sponsored by senators dorgan and lott defeated competing amendment by senators mccain and levin to require two more base closing rounds in 1999 and 2001 key policy issues past debates over military construction priorities have centered around congressional additions to the administration request and the debate over added projects the mccain criteria current issues in defense committee reports and appropriation authorization hearings and legislation on the fy1998 military construction budget have highlighted overseas expenditures prior year savings for current year programs base realignment and closure brac concerns government performance and results act honest budgets and the future years defense plan for military construction housing as important to the quality of life for servicemembers improving the utility infrastructure of military facilities vision 21 consolidating testing evaluation centers and laboratories and real property maintenance reporting requirements past debates congressional additions to the administration request in recent years the congress has added significant amounts to annual administration military construction budget requests this year is exception for example the congress added 479 million in fy1996 and 850 million in fy1997 to the military construction accounts in appropriations action on the fy1998 request the house and senate added approximately 800 million more than the clinton administrations request in authorization action the house added 750 million and the senate added 707 million congressional additions to the military construction budget have been common and controversial throughout the 1990s three themes explain the pattern of reoccurring congressional additions first some members of the military construction subcommittees have believed that military construction has been chronically underfunded and therefore 5 see appropriations for fy1998 defense by stephen daggett crs report 97205 for details on the quadrennial defense review qdr additional funds are needed this theme was echoed in the fy1998 reports from the house appropriation committee and the defense authorizing committees second often congress has different priorities than the administration as reflected in frequent congressional cuts to overseas construction requests and contributions to the nato security investment program third other members of congress as senator bond commented during the floor debate on fy1996 military construction appropriations believe that dod counts on congress to add money to guard and reserve programs in recent years congress has added large amounts for national guard and reserve construction projects as much as 4018 million in fy1995 see table 5 debate over congressional additions to the military construction budget involves several overlapping issues military construction proponents including facility advocates in the military services argue that military facilities have been systematically underfunded for many years even some say in the midst of the buildup of the early to mid1980s this line of argument was prominent during house appropriations committee markup of the fy1996 military construction bill some complained that the funding level was up 28 from the prior year while others defended the increase as simply making good previous shortfalls in funding for new construction and maintenance the house report on the fy1997 bill hrept 104 591 cited current dod backlog of deferred maintenance and repair for family housing alone that totaled over 45 billion dollars dod facility managers have fallen below their goal to allocate 3 of the plant replacement value of dod facilities for annual construction and maintenance although this 3 goal is below the average for public facilities nationwide actual dod funding has typically run at 1 to 2 of plant replacement value therefore the replacement cycle for defense facilities is 50 to 100 years and facility proponents welcome any congressional additions6 finally congressional military construction subcommittees authorization as well as appropriations subcommittees have frequently taken issue with administration military construction priorities in the early 1990s for example the committees frequently reduced amounts requested for construction overseas on the grounds that troop levels abroad should be reduced and that allied burdensharing contributions should increase and reallocated the funds to domestic projects in addition congressional committees have added unrequested funds for quality of life improvements such as day care centers and barracks renovation the congress has argued that the military services have tended to neglect these areas in favor of warfighting investments the debate over added projects the mccain criteria in 1994 the senate debate on the military construction appropriations bill focused the amount of congressional additions to the request despite constraints on overall defense spending senator mccain in particular objected to the provision of substantial amounts for projects that the administration had not requested he argued that such projects largely represent pork barrel spending and come at the expense of higher priority defense programs in senate floor consideration of the military construction bill that year the managers accepted mccain amendment that called for criteria to be applied to additional projects his amendment included provision that any added project should be on the military lists of critical yet unbudgeted projects the mccain amendment was not incorporated into the final conference 6 for discussion of this and related issues see crs report 91669 military construction current controversies and longterm issues by martin cohen and stephen daggett version of the bill however and the conference agreement provided over 900 million for unrequested construction projects the national defense authorization act for fy1995 pl 103337 however incorporated senator mccains criteria as sense of the senate provision providing that the unrequested projects should be 1 essential to the dods national security mission 2 not inconsistent with the base realignment and closure act 3 in the services future years defense plan see below 4 executable in the year they are authorized and appropriated and 5 offset by reductions in other defense accounts through advice from the secretary of defense the purpose of the criteria is to help the congress rate the relative importance of different projects though sense of the senate provision does not have the force of law the mccain criteria have been used in senate authorization and appropriations debates for fy1996 and fy1997 the criteria were also cited in the house fy1997 debates by members of the porkbusters coalition in practice debates have focused on justifying projects according to the first four criteria while ignoring the offset criteria in debate on the fy1997 military construction appropriations senator mccain noted that since fy1990 congress has added nearly billion dollars year in unrequested military construction projects hr 3517 the fy1997 military construction bill exceeded the administration request by 900 million in the house version and by 700 million in the senate bill during house floor debate on the fy1997 bill representative minge cochair with senator mccain of porkbusters coalition conceded the house bill largely adheres to the mccain criteria he voted against the measure however because it exceeded the presidents request by 900 million including 300 million for 42 projects not in the dods longrange plan in debate on the fy1998 military construction appropriations conference report senator mccain continued to point out congressional adds he noted that the congress added 129 projects totalling 941 million the national guard and reserve received 268 million of the additional congressional money senator mccain presented the list of extra projects in the congressional record in letter to the president and on his web page httpwwwsenategovmccainmilconftxt current issues overseas expenditures the house national security committee noted in its title 28 of its report hrept 105132 that it believes that the current level of burdensharing with the korean government is insufficient given the conditions of the facilities and their importance to security of the region with the expiration in 1998 of the special measures agreement sma the hnsc urges the secretary of defense to work with the secretary of state to improve the level of burdensharing in the followon agreement the senate appropriations committee is also concerned about overseas construction with the likelihood of reductions in the size of the us military overseas military presence may decrease the sac noted that the request of 600 million for overseas construction is 24 of the construction budget therefore the committee cautioned the pentagon to be conservative in committing funds and consider leasing facilities or sharing with the host nations the sac also instructed the pentagon to report by october 15 on the new funding demands that would be made on the nato infrastructure account because of nato expansion in the senate debate over the military construction act senator murray the ranking member of subcommittee mentioned instruction to the administration to execute burdensharing agreement with qatar for prepositioning of equipment in southwest asia prior year savings for current year programs the defense authorizing committees disallowed the practice of funding current programs with prior year savings the authorizers reduced military construction title by approximately 55 million the amount of prior year savings budgeted for fy1998 in their report srept 10529 the senate armed services committee noted that this trend started in the fy1997 budget request with 12 million of prior year savings which escalated to 55 million of prior year savings budgeted for fy1998 programs dods use of prior year savings reinforces the committees concern that the pentagon is trying to overprogram the limited amount of money budgeted for military construction budgeting prior year savings in the sasc view limits the flexibility to fund cost variations and complete projects with justifiable cost increases the senate and house authorizing committees expects the dod to fully fund future military construction requests without using savings the house appropriations committee objected strongly to this method of financing but allowed it in the this years budget request the senate appropriations committee also rejected the practice of prior savings for current programs in its report base realignment and closure brac concerns the senate appropriations committee asked the general accounting office to continue its annual review of the base realignment and closure accounts to help the committee validate requests for individual projects the report would be due may 15 1998 the senate appropriations committee noted that many of the housing privatization initiatives contain various mechanisms that shift financial risk and liability to the government some of these guarantees insulate private interests against future brac actions force reductions or extended deployments the committee commented that housing projects with these guarantees could be an advantage to base in future brac rounds therefore the committee has added provision for the pentagon to notify the congressional defense committees of all privatization agreements which contain any clause providing consideration for brac force reductions and extended deployments government performance and results act the house and senate appropriations committees inserted language into the military construction appropriations act report hrept 105150 and srept 10552 stating that implementation of the government performance and results act gpra pl 10362 is to be priority for all agencies of government starting with fy1999 gpra requires agencies establish performance goals and measures the hac report states that they will consider these measures in the fy1999 appropriations cycle it is likely that this report language will appear in each of the thirteen fy1998 appropriation bills the sac noted that the dod has begun to incorporate gpra into the departments planning programming and budgeting system ppbs see section on honest budgeting below for more information on ppbs honest budgets and the future years defense plan for military construction the department of defense uses formal process called the planning programming and budgeting system ppbs to create its budget for congress7 the ppbs process is also used to prepare dods internal longterm financial plan the longterm plan extends over sixyear period and is known as the future years defense plan fydp in the fy1998 hearings the chairman of the house subcommittee on military construction representative ron packard chastised the department of defense for repeatedly failing to submit honest budgets reflecting real service priorities he complained that the military construction request traditionally leaves out necessary projects especially for the national guard and reserve and yet the services expect congress to add them mr packard wanted the subcommittee to get out of the business of adding money for projects that the administration had not requested but yet supposedly needs he also wanted dod and services to use the future years defense plan fydp rigorously to set priorities for their construction projects and integrate guard and reserve needs in testimony on the fy1998 request to the military construction subcommittee of the house appropriations committee the dod comptroller john hamre admitted that dod needs to undertake good detailed planning for the military construction budget and has not done this in the past hamre also conceded that the dod has not evaluated the accuracy of the military construction fydps and that he sees need for that assessment in the fy1998 house committee on appropriations report hrept 105150 the committee supported coherent future years defense plan fydp for military construction at the project level of detail and encouraged efforts to reconcile annual adjustments in this plan this report language echoed themes heard in the fy1998 hearings which asked for coherent planning for guard and reserve facility needs guard and reserve project additions the ranking minority member of the house subcommittee on military construction representative bill hefner stressed in the fy1998 hearings the importance of the guard and reserve forces in the bosnian operation he then questioned whether the guard and reserve should have better and more professional budget system to reflect that role hamre admitted that there is history of the guard not being able to get projects they think are crucial for their mission into the armys fydp and that he is working with the services to get more forthright budget including the guard and reserves dod comptroller hamre agreed that if the dod is going to honor the total force concept that the pentagon needs to go better job of building budget that includes the guard and reserves the house committee on appropriations in their report hrept 105150 directed the army national guard to report backlog facility requirements develop nationwide armory infrastructure plan and submit future years defense plan fydp with the army national guard and air national guard military construction budget request in contrast to the negative opinion of the house the senate appropriations committee commended the army national guard installation philosophy but also required fydp plan from the guard by march 30 1998 the house national security committee added 154 million to the presidents request of 173 million for guard and reserve forces facilities however the army national guard received additions from the hnsc in their title 26 of their report hrept 105132 the committee notes its concern about the instability of the army national guard budget and 7 for discussion of the formulation of the defense budget proposal by the dod see crs report 93317 defense budget primer by keith berner and stephen daggett planning process since 60 of the projects in fy1997 plan are longer in the immediate fy1998 budget plan the committee directed the army to insure that the army national guard adheres to an integrated departmentwide budget and planning process housing as important to the quality of life for servicemembers housing has emerged as key quality of life issue in the pentagon and in congressional debates over military construction the department of defense has found that about twothirds of military housing both family quarters and barracks are substandard because of size safety or condition8 the fy1998 pentagon construction plan includes money for 5900 new housing units and 11000 barracks living spaces in 1995 thendefense secretary perry established an external advisory committee and an inhouse executive committee to look at quality of life issues two major housing initiatives emanated from those committees private sector financing and methods for family housing were proposed and implemented in the fy1996 defense authorization act also new standard was set for barracks called 1 1 this standard provides each servicemember at sergeant or below an individual room plus shared bathroom with an adjoining room9 in their fy1998 report hrept 105150 the house appropriations committee states that it will take 143 billion and 20 years to reach the 1 1 standard because of the need for better military housing some members of congress were critical that the budget request reduces the family housing budget for fy1998 by 10 to 37 billion compared to the fy1997 enacted amount of 41 billion representative hefley chairman of the house national security military installations and facilities subcommittee said he felt betrayed by the reduction since he had the understanding that the privatization concept was to augment not replace government funding10 defense officials defended their proposal since the pentagon was leveraging defense dollars to build three times the amount of dod financed housing units military unaccompanied housing improvement fund in their fy1998 report hrept 105150 the house appropriations committee recommended appropriation for the dod military unaccompanied housing improvement fund this is equal to the budget request but 5 million less than last year the purpose of the fund is to encourage the use of private capital to develop barracks housing more quickly yet the requirements were identified for the fy1997 money by the dod the hac would like the dod to aggressively apply these privatization authorities to modernize servicemember housing housing revitalization support program working with the administration the congress in the fy1996 defense authorization act pl 104106 approved the housing revitalization support program which gives incentives for the private sector to provide military housing the incentives include guarantees of mortgage or rental payments by military families commercialstyle lease arrangements and joint ventures with developers of new housing on bases 8 maze rick the new congress whats in store for you navy times january 20 1997 p 6 9

slow start with construction underway on only one 400unit project in corpus christi and ingleside texas11 other bases with planned projects include lackland air force base texas everette naval station washington fort carson colorado camp pendleton california and albany marine corps logistics base georgia there have been complex issues to work out with these new partnerships in the lackland air force base case for example the dod and local community needed to sort out whether the private developer would pay local taxes the house appropriations committee noted in its in its fy1998 report hrept 105 150 that the housing revitalization support office hrso has just completed its first year of operations for managing the dods military housing privatization efforts the hac is concerned with heavy use of consultants by the office since it believes that the hrso should develop inhouse expertise in private sector operations to effectively manage this program improving the utility infrastructure of military facilities hearings on the fy1998 military construction request also reflected the interest of the committees in the potential savings from improving utility infrastructure of military facilities the fy1998 budget has requested funds for the energy conservation improvement program which will fund capital projects intended to lower the energy use in military facilities members expressed interest in investigating whether privatizing or outsourcing utilities and other underground infrastructure such as pipes on bases could save money the house appropriations committee noted that in their fy1998 report hrept 105 150 that infrastructure such as water and sewer systems electrical systems communication systems and transportation systems do not receive sufficient priority in military construction plans the hac encouraged the dod to look at installationwide infrastructure projects and to program and budget for the work and to study the feasibility of privatizing utility systems the senate armed services committee added section 2802 in s 936 to their defense authorization act on the sale of utility systems of the military departments the provision authorizes the service secretaries to convey all or part of government utility systems located on military installation to commercial or public utilities the types of utilities that may be conveyed include but are not limited to electrical generation and supply water treatment water supply wastewater collection and treatment steam hot chilled water generation and supply and natural gas supply vision 21 consolidating testing evaluation centers and laboratories the house appropriations committee expects the vision 21 report by november 1998 this report is the dods 5year plan to consolidate and restructure all defense testing evaluation and labs to achieve effective intraservice and crossservice organizational arrangements the hac directs the secretary of defense to certify any new activities before funds are obligated because of the consolidation process real property maintenance reporting requirements the house national security committee limited facility repair with operations and maintenance funds through legislative provision section 2801 in hr 1119 the house appropriations committee supported the hnscs action and directed that the defense committees be notified before carrying out any repair project with an estimated cost of over 10 million 11 jowers karen housing tops qualityoflife list for 97 navy times january 13 1997 p 6 major funding trends the

fy1997 98 billion level approved by congress in action on the fy1998 request the house and senate added approximately 800 million to the request on the authorization side the house added 750 million
