uspakistan strategic dialogue islamabad 00000385 0013 of 003 classified by anne w patterson for reasons 14 bd 1 c summary as foreign minister qureshi and his team arrive in washington for coordination on the holbrookeriedel strategic review post offers the following thoughts on issues for strategic engagement in the coming weeks post will detail our suggestions on how to expand political economic security and intelligence engagement with pakistan from the current 2 billion annually to 4 billion beginning in fy2011 end summary 2 c as we work to prevent pakistanbased attacks on the us and its forces we should be clear that alqaida aq now wants more than just safehaven in pakistan and defeating growing witches brew of aq taliban local extremists and criminals will be long 1015 year fight president zardari has summed it up by saying the militants now are after and my job the militant takeover of swat in the northwest frontier province nwfp is the most striking example of how far and how fast the government is losing control over its territory as the fight continues we expect aq to increase both its offensive and defensive operations to protect its equities it simply has nowhere else to go understanding swat 3 c talks continue between tehrik nizam shariat mohammed movement for sharia or tnsm leader sufi mohammad and his soninlaw maulana fazlullah who works with the tehriketaliban movement headed by baitullah mehsud the army appears unwilling or unable to control the area and the population is fed up with both indiscriminate army shelling and talibanimposed terror so the awami national party anp and the army are trying new version of failed strategy through sufi mohammad the nwfp provincial government is trying to split the population from fazlullahs taliban by offering adherence to form of sharia law interpreted locally as swift justice the nwfp offer on sharia has not been signed by president zardari and is conditioned on establishment of peace in swat the army has not withdrawn from its positions and it insists it will not withdraw until peace is established 4 c few pakistanis believe the deal will hold for more than twothree weeks similar deal failed in 2008 post does not believe that sufi has the clout to deliver fazlullahs taliban are not going to lay down their armsthey have already violated their alleged ceasefire anps weak argument is that even failed deal will expose fazlullahs real intentions the armys view is that the deal at least buys them some time to regroup forces posts concern is that by signaling its willingness to surrender the deal has made it even harder for the inevitable army reengagement in swat while talks continue however we are working through stateusaiddod with agencies and icrc to get relief supplies to the beleaguered swati population we also are working with the ministry of interior to provide the nwfp police with shortterm support salary supplementsdeath benefits hardening police stations while we implement longerterm plan to deliver additional equipment and training needed to back up army action establishing trust 5 c the pakistani team will come hoping once again to forge longlasting ties with the us as vice president biden has noted however the relationship for too long has been transactional in nature it also has been based on mutual mistrust pakistan hedges its bets on cooperation because it fears the us will again desert islamabad after we get osama bin laden washington sees this hesitancy as duplicity that requires we take unilateral action to protect us interests after 911 then president musharraf made strategic shift to abandon the taliban and support the us in the war on terror but neither side believes the other has lived up to expectations flowing from that decision the relationship is one of codependency we grudgingly admitpakistan knows the us cannot afford to walk away the us knows pakistan cannot survive without our support supporting democracydefeating extremism islamabad 00000385 0023 of 003 6 c militants will exploit either weak civilian government or return to military rule that lacks popular legitimacy so we should help the zardarigilani government complete its full fiveyear term in office we can work with nawaz sharif if he wins the next election but zardari is our best ally in pakistan right now and us interests are best served by preventing another cycle of military rule qureshi will remind us that the gop needs an international democracy dividend in the form of economic aid improved governance and effective law enforcement 7 c we can respond first by offering robust us support at the imfworld bank donors conference in april we now are providing approximately 2 billion annually to pakistan including 12 billion in coalition support fund reimbursements 150 million to improve socioeconomic conditions in fata 300 million in esf aid for the rest of pakistan over 10 million for internally displaced persons fleeing combat in bajaur mohmand and swat 300 million not yet received and an imminent 15 million in aid to the nwfp police 8 c if approved and financed the kerrylugar legislation will enable us to triple nonmilitary aid to 15 billion per year we will plan in fy 2010 to spend over 100 million to augment civilian police and 873 million to build counterinsurgency capability this means giving police protective vests and rapid reaction capability teaching the military how to coordinate ground and air operations and helping the army keep more than two attack helicopters in the air at one time we can build trust address the issue of alleged us strikes and help pakistanis target militants through enhanced dodbased intelligence cooperation at the torkham joint coordination center we need to help the gop implement an effective strategic communications plan changing mindsets 9 c president zardari and pm gilani recognize pakistans greatest threat has shifted from india to militancy concentrated on the pakafghan border but is spreading to nwfp and beyond the army and isi however have not turned that corner we should press the gop on the need to stop using militanttribal proxies as foreign policy tools it is now counterproductive to pakistans own interests and directly conflicts with usg objectives in afghanistanwhere haqqanis network is killing american soldiers and afghan civiliansand the regionwhere mumbai exposed the fruits of previous isi policy to create lashkaretaiba and still threatens potential conflict between nuclear powers however we should preface this conversation with pledge to open new page in relations chief of army staff general kayani who headed isi from 20042007 in particular wants to avoid reckoning with the past and we will not shift pakistani militaryisi policy without his support 10 c given recent events in swat the army needs to decide if it is truly prepared to commit the troops and suffer the casualties required to win and accept the training needed to shift from conventional war with india to coinbased strategy along the pakafghan border we should probe the team for what pakistan needs from india to enable it to redeploy badlyneeded pakistani forces from its eastern to its western border making afghanistan success 11 c we should ask what kind of government islamabad can accept in kabul and how pakistan plans to help the usnato succeed in afghanistan the team will be concerned about the effect of troop buildup in southern afghanistan across from balochistan where pakistan has meager forces to defend long and unpopulated border we should discuss the reality that the us will be doubling cargo shipments through pakistan both the torkham and chaman crossings in support of our troop buildup in afghanistan 12 c as isi general director pasha has said we cant kill all the militants qureshi noting recent comments by defense secretary gates will suggest it is time to review efforts to reach out to taliban reconcilables on both sides islamabad 00000385 0032 of 003 of the border if this initiative progresses we should consider establishing disarmament demobilization and reintegration ddr process in both pakistan and afghanistan for taliban lashkaretaiba and other militant fighters thinking regionally 13 c pakistans principal strategic focus remains fixated on india afghanistan as strategic depth in the fight against india and the core kashmir issue however the current civilian and military leadership is the most proindian that new delhi is likely to see and we should not allow mumbai to derail rapprochement both sides should resume composite dialogue negotiations reestablish backchannel negotiations and increase trade across both the wagah border and the kashmir line of control 14 c this presumes that pakistan with continued usg pressure proceeds with prosecution of the mumbai suspects pakistan also needs more clearly to shut down its support for lashkaretaiba militancy in kashmir qureshi will want to hear usg commitment to press the indians to respond to the gops list of followup questions on the investigation we should encourage islamabad to send and new delhi to receive pakistani police investigatory team to collect evidence in support of successful mumbai prosecutions 15 c qureshi likely will repeat zardaris pleas for usg intervention with saudi arabia uae and other gulf states to deliver oil at concessional prices to date our efforts have been rebuffed but the upcoming donors conference would provide another avenue to press for assistance 16 c we should leverage chinas interest in stable pakistan by urging its continued support at the donors conference but reminding beijing that efforts to block 1267 designations and give pakistan two unsanctioned civilian nuclear reactors are not helpful zardari would like to accept irans offer of financial assistance but we doubt he will proceed without us blessing patterson
