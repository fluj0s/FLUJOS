more money from the general fund fede ral funding available to support both highways and transit will slow in the short term and may decline in the medium term because of the growth in authoriz ed spending in safetea and the spending down of unexpended balances over the last few years however the transit account is expected to go into deficit in fy2011 or fy2012 at the spending level provided for in safetea in fy2009 the fuels tax dedicated to the transit account would need to be raised by pproximately 1 cent per gallon to remedy the current deficit in transit funding this would allow for growth in the program to deal with grow ing needs or inflation the us department of transportation dot however estimate s that the country needs to spend 25 more annually over the next 20 years than is currently being spent to maintain the current conditions and performance of tr ansit systems and 73 more to make substantial improvements at the current federal share of overall transit finances this translates to an additional 06 cents per ga llon in the federal fuels tax for transit to maintain the system and 18 cents per gallon to improve the system without new revenue congre ss may have to modify tr ansit program priorities or alternatively may want to reexamine the federal role in the financing of transit systems some of the options that may be considered include reducing the federal matching share encouraging more privat esector involvement including the use of publicprivate partnerships and innovative financing encouraging improvements in transit system productivity and the broad re structuring of current federal transit programs the report outlines several ways of restructuring federal public transit programs each an alternative to the possibility of l eaving the

suggests that if total govern ment spending is not increased above current levels the physical conditi on and operational performance of system elements may decline dot makes recommendation about the

billion in fy2009 an alternative view of the overall leve l of government tr ansportation spending in general and of transit sp ending in particular is that it has not been dramatically deficient in terms of the nations transit systems the dot needs analysis shows that total government spending on capital and operations exc luding farebox and other revenue grew by approxima tely 80 between 1980 and 2004 in real terms much faster than passenger trips and passenger miles which grew by 12 and 23 respectively23 however it is true that federal spending grew relatively slowly over this period particularly when compared w ith state and local spending 4 and 129 respectively in real terms consequently the federal sh are of total spending over the period declined from 42 to 25 the federal share of capita l spending has also declined from approximate ly 50 in the mid1990s to 39 in 2004 since 1995 federal spending has slightly outpaced stat and local spending growing by 43 and 39

years and had an overall ra ting of 38 in 2004 one area of concern according to the dot study is transit ra il stations as about half are rated substandard27 third view on the overall level of transit funding is that governments including the federal government spend too much on public transit relative to the benefits it provides28 it is often pointed out that while transit spending amounts to about 16 of all government highway and transit spending and about 14 of federal highway and transit capital expenditure in 200429 only about 2 of all trips are made by this mode30 even for commuting trips for which transit is bettersuited transit only accounts for 5 nationwide share that has changed little over the past two decades only in two cities new rk and chicago does the transit share rise

number of critics of federal transit policy argue that it focuses too much on financial support for buildin g new rail systems these critics contend that such systems are expensive to build and maintain less flexible compared with regular bus transit and illsuited to todays lowde nsity dispersed metropolitan areas these critics contend that rail transit may only be worth the cost in highdensity corridors and that few of these corridor s remain without rail service33 moreover critics contend that construction of new rail syst ems in search of discretionary riders primarily suburban commuters have worked to the detriment of busdependent populations in the central city overall these critics argue the effect has been to switch those riding buses to riding rail with little net gain in transit patronage34 even the environmental benefits of new rail lines have been called into questionbecause many new rail riders must drive to station to access the system consequently the reduction in emissions from building new rail lines has been found in many cases to be negligible 35 in the view of some federal support for new transit capacity would be better spent on brt in which express buses run over roads with some sort of priority system ranging from signal preemption to an exclusive busway others argue that brt projects while cheaper than rail systems are still more expensive and less effective than conventional bus service for instance one analyst contends that modest improvements to basic bus services combined with an attractive fares policy have shown they can secure substantially greater ridership increases than capital intensive projects involving either light rail or bus way construction36 others note that brt projects favor suburban commuters over more centrally located transit such as streetcars lighter cheaper but slower type of light rail37 counter argument to these critics nd one in favor of increased transit spending is that transits worth must

mobility for nondrivers and congestion management by this measure according to proponents transit investment is highly productive often more productive than an alternative highway investment the implication for transits detractors is that the reality that transit cannot as rule make it financially seems to have created belief in some quarters that it cannot make it economically either39 this has been an issue in the new starts program as some have argued that federal funds should be used to support projects that provide the most transportation mobility benefits such as bus rapid transit and others have contended that funding ought to be available for projects that have fewer mobility benefits but may provide greater economic developmen t benefits such as light rail and streetcars40 highway trust fund issues the amount of funding available for tran sit programs at least in the short to medium term is likely to depend on deci sions surrounding the highway trust fund at the moment about 80 of federal transit funding comes from the mass transit account of the highway tr ust fund with the rest coming from general funds in early 2008 the congressional budget offi ce cbo estimated that with current revenues and outlays at the level provided for in saf etea with adjustments made for inflation after fy2009 the transit account would go into deficit in fy201241 problems with the highway account are mo re immediate however as cbo estimates that this will go into deficit in fy2009 at funding levels provided for in safetea cbo estimates that expenditures from the highway trust fund will exceed revenues by 66 billion in fy2009 with 47 billion difference in the highway account and 19 billion difference in the transit account expenditures from the transit account do not become problem until fy2012 howev er because of previously accrued unexpended balances the unexpended bala nce in the highway account is being exhausted more quickly hence the more immediate problem this presents funding shortfalls in the highway and tr ansit programs are related to few key underlying factors to begin with the fuels tax has not been increased since 1993 when 43 cents per gallon were added as general budget deficit reduction measure this tax increment was redirected to th highway trust fund beginning october 1 1997 in addition the fuels tax is not i ndexed to inflation

february 29 2008one current estimate suggests that the fuels tax would need to be increased by about 10 cents per gallon to restore its 1993 purchasing power43 despite increase in the federal fuels tax and the problem of infla tion which has been especially severe in construction materials and fuel over the past few years safetea authorized funding increases based primarily on spe nding down the unexpended balances that had accrued in the highway trust fund accounts these balances have been eliminated more quickly than estimated when safetea was enacted although receipts from the fuels tax are s ubject to good deal of uncertainty as they depend on projections of travel mand and fuel usage the current rule of thumb is that 10centpergallon tax in crease generates appr oximately 16 billion to 2 billion in revenue for the highwa trust fund as whole and 03 billion to 04 billion for the transit account assuming 20 of the increase goes to the transit account at the funding level currently provided for in fy2009 with expenditures exceeding revenues by 66 billion in total and by 19 billion in the transit account and assuming revenue at the hi gher end of the range the fuels tax would need to be raised by approximately 5 cents per gallon to close the gap with 1 cent per gallon dedicated to the transit account this llows for growth in the program to deal with growing needs or inflation indexing the fuels tax to inflation would allow the programs to remain at the fy2009 level in r eal terms one estimate of indexing the fuels tax beginning in fy2010 predicts th at this alone would raise the current 183 centpergallon tax excluding the 01 cents dedicated to the leaking and underground storage tank trust fund to 218 cents per gallon by fy201744 cbo estimates that expenditures from th transit account will exceed revenues by about 19 billion in fy2009 but under the current assumptions this gap is expected to continue widening over time cbo estimates that the difference will be 40 billion by fy2012 45 billion by fy2015 and 50 billion by fy201845 another way to look at fuel taxes and futu re funding needs is to assess the fuels tax in relation to the dot needs ssessment discussed above there is requirement that the fede ral government provide ex tra funding to alleviate deficiencies in highway and transit infrastructure identified in the dot report but at the level of its current share the federa l government would have to raise an extra 13 billion per year from 2005 though 2024 for capital expenditures to maintain the current condition and performance of the system to improve the current condition and performance would require an extra 36 billion annually assuming revenue at the higher end of the range again thes estimates suggest 06 to

approximate calculations based on estimates of travel fuel use and other factors that may change in the future moreover these calculations are based on assigning 20 of any fuels tax to the transit account as has been the case ce 1983 and which transit supporters are very keen to maintain in any future legislation46 number of highway advocates however argue that highway user fees s hould be used to improve the condition and performance of highways these highway advocates note that the trust fund was created in 1956 to provide money for the construction of the interstate highway system and for other highway programs they note that over time however an increasing share of trust fund revenue has been diverted to other purposes particularly to public transit but also to historic pr eservation recreati onal trails air pollution mitigation and through earmarking to projects that reward specific constituencies to the detriment of transportation mobility continued largescale federal funding they argue has also co at the price of burdensome federal regulation in number of areas that raises costs and stifles innovation47 rate of return aside from consideration of tax rates and receipts into the highway trust fund reauthor ization may also involve greater debate about each states rate of return from the trans it account the socalled donordonee issue this issue concerns the amount of funds each state r eceives from the trust fund relative to the amount paid in by states dr ivers state that pays in more than it receives is known as donor stat state that pays in less than it receives is known as donee state highway legislation at least as far back as the surface transportation assistance act of 1982 s been marked by such concerns48 transit funding on the other hand has generally been immune to this issue mainly because of the heavy concentration of transit service and ridership in just few states and because such concerns have been assuaged with relatively large increases in highway and transit spending in an era of fis cal austerity however the debate surrounding each states share of transit f unding may appear as an issue49httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34183crs14 50 ibid 51 utt r heritage foundation backgrounder 1643 april 7 2003 52 us department of trans portation research and innova tive technology administration

instances is predicated on sharing project costs with states and loca lities from very ear ly on federal funding for highway and later transit infrastruct ure was conceived as providing support to programs run by state and local government consequently most federal aid must be matched with state or local money in ratio determined by federal law these matching shares vary from program to prog ram and have occasionally been adjusted according to the goals of federal policy because of this some suggest that one way to deal with the impending federal transportation funding shortfall is to shri nk the size of the federal role this is particularly true in the area of transit wh ich is often viewed as local not national mode of transportation why it is so metimes asked should driver in

support for transit programs and w ith it federal regulations particularly the labor prot ection provisions enacted as section 13c of the urban mass transportation act of 1964 now sec tion 5333b of title 49 might even spur transit innovation and ridership and lowe r costs under this labor protection provision some argue it is difficult for tran sit agencies to reduce the number of staff through the introduction of new technologies or by contrac ting out some or all agency functions see the discussion under t ransit system produc tivity below51 supporters of continued and in some cases an even greater federal role in transit argue that transit is part of national system in that it provides link at the beginning and end of interc ity trips moreover they argue transit can provide congestion relief in major c ities and in major travel corridors metropolitan areas with large transit systems are viewed as drivers of the national economy for instance the top 10 metropolitan areas in terms of transit ridership account for 25 of the nations population and 30 of gross domestic product52 consequently transit supporters argue that improvement s in transit systems may predominantly

changed in authorizing legislation throughout the history of the federalaid program before passage of istea transit advocates often complained that the federal matching share for transit projects was lower than that for highway projects biasing state and local decision making toward highway projects so as to receive the extra federal money istea did away with that supposed inequity by rais ing matching shares in various transit programs including the new starts program to 80 the great demand from transit agencies for federal funding from the new starts program has led some to argue for lowering the cap on the federal share for such projects supporters of this view argue that lowering the cap would allow federal funding to be shared among more worthwh ile projects moreover supporters argue that lower cap would encourage states and localities with more of their own money at stake to advance only the stronges t projects gao found that more economic analysis of the costs and benefits of project is typically done when more local funding is required54 in addition supporters point out that although the maximum share is 80 prior to safetea it was fta policy to rate project as low if it sought federal share of more than 60 this policy was response to house appropriations committee reports that wer share was warranted because demand for funding help was outstrippi ng the available

publicprivate partnerships ppps or private development two types of ppps in the development of transit projects are joint development and turnkey procurements such as designbuildopera temaintain dbom joint development involves the construction of private f acilities on or over transit agency land in exchange for some kind of benefit such as onetime payment rent or improvement of transit facilities61 the principal argument for these mechanisms is the increased ridership that results from the new uses and the direct financial benefits prominent example of joint development is the mixeduse facilities offices retail and hotel surrounding the washington metropolitan area transit authoritys wmata bethesda md station completed in 1985 th airrights lease fo r this development generates 16 million annually in rents for wmata62 turnkey procurements such as dbom involve publicprivate agreements that turn over more control to private entities in exchange for lower cost faster project delivery or both in these types of procur ements the public sector contracts with private contractor to deliver construction project at certain time for certain price the rationale for this is that the contractor is better able to ma nage the risks involved whereby cost and time overruns reduce the contractors profit but delivering early and under budget increases profit project s can range from designbuildtransfer where the contractor designs and builds the project and then transfers it to the owner to more complex agreements such as dbom where the contractor may be involved for decades

transit is the vegas m onorail fourmile system that connects hotels and other attractions on the ve gas strip the original segment operating between two hotels opened in 19 95 was expanded in 2004 by nonprofit corporation financed by taxexempt bonds and financial and inkind contributions from hotels and resorts65 proposal to extend the syst em to mccarren international airport was approved by cl arke county in november 2006 despite this approval the project does not appear to have ttracted the approximately 500 million needed to finance construction66 financial problems with the existing system may be to blame newspaper reports have stated that the system is failing to meet its operating and debt expenses by about 30 million annua lly and that the company may exhaust its reserve funds by 201067 one estimate suggests that while the monorail carried about 22000 passengers day in late 2007 it needs to carry about 35000 day to break even68 number of legislative and regulatory initiatives have improved the environment for privatesector involvement in transit these include among others the explicit authorization for dbom in istea new joint development policy issued by fta in

available for highways and transit71 as noted earlier however financial accounting largely ignores the economic benefits that transit can generate for local areas through land development job creation and an increase in the tax ba among other benefits72 others prefer therefore to focus on the wider economic benefits that jo int development and transitoriented development more ge nerally can provide innovative financing related to the discussion of privatesector involvement in infrastructure financing is the use of socalled innovative financing several innovative financing mechanisms have been developed in the past two decades to leverage existing federal resour ces or to develop new revenuegenerating assets federal laws have been modified to broaden the ways in which states can match and obligate fede ral funds this has enabled st ates and localities to use their resources more efficiently to use private funds for the nonfederal share on project and for projects to be completed more qui ckly moreover several mechanisms have been created to allow states to issue bonds against future federal aid making it easier to complete large projects more quickly nd cost effectively than would be possible on payasyougo basis in transit grant anticipation notes gans have been used in this way state infrastructure banks sibs have also been set up to create mechanism to leverage other resources th rough lending instead of granting federal aid funds in the case of generating new revenuegenerating assets state and local governments and nonprofit corporations ar allowed to issue taxexempt bonds on behalf of private project velopers for example in the case of the vegas monorail the state of nevada issued 600 million of taxexempt bonds on behalf of the private developers these bonds were secured by farebox and advertising revenue73 again although there have been successes in innovative financing in transportation the ability of these mechanisms to generate extra resources

transportation third edition new york guilford press 2004from 89 in 1970 to 47 in 200077 the struggle for market share has been exacerbated in particular by the growth of lowdensity suburbs that are relatively difficult to serve with transit in 2000 bout 50 of the nations population lived in suburbs up from 36 in 197078 although total transit ridership has grow n to level not seen since the late 1950s the supply of transit service has grown more quickly and productivity output divided by input has declined even if the costs of providing transit service had remained constant therefore total outla ys would probably have risen faster than revenue at the same time the cost of producing transit service has not stayed constant but has risen over time the biggest drop in productivity most likely occurred between the mid 1960s nd the mid1980s by one estimate the cost of running transit bus per hour nearly doubled in real terms between 1964 and 198579 over the past 15 years according to fta data produc tivity improved until 1998 when productivity began to slowly decline again80 several reasons are typically given for the drop in transit productivity over the past 40 years first there has been lot of pressure to expand transit to areas that are costly to serve particular ly lowdensity suburbs and to support variety of social service needs and other community goals th at often boost costs second some argue that transit service is overcapitalized as cities have been encouraged to build rail lines where buses would make more sense and to use fullsized buses where small buses or vans would be more appropriate third according to some work rules and other labor protections have made it relatively costly to staff transit agencies fourth governments have pushed to keep transit fa res low in an effort to boost ridership additionally transit agencies are increasingly using simple or flat fare structures despite great variations in the cost of providing service depending on location direction of service and time of day81 fifth large infusions of government support including from the federal government ve tended to weaken the constraint on transit management to aggressi vely manage co sts and revenues82 as noted earlier some argue that transit should be evaluated in terms of all the economic benefits it genera tes for an area as whole including all the

productivity suggest that less public funding including less federal funding would be necessary if transit operations could be made more financially selfsustaining much of this comes down to policies pursued at the state and local level and by the transit agencies themselves however congress may also want to consider several broad policy options during reauthorization that addre ss the issue of financial sustainability some suggest that transit agencies shoul d stop many of the expansions of fixed route transit service particularly in difficulttoserve areas and that the federal government should encourage them to do so83 according to this view transit agencies may also need to consider cutting services that lose the most money except perhaps paratransit service in cases wher new transit services are appropriate such as along densely populated and congested co rridors agencies might look to invest in less costly transit modes particul arly buses and bus rapid transit84 others have suggested that public assistance includi ng federal funding should go mainly to support transits core mission of improvi ng mobility particularly for transit dependent populations instead of supporting profusion of policy goals in energy and the environment economic deve lopment and highway congestion85 for example although about half of the fundi ng in the congestion mitigation and air quality cmaq improvement program goes to fund trans it projects the available evidence appears to show that such projects are not particularly effective in reducing vehicle emissions86 another suggestion is for states and localities to inject more competition into the provision of transit service or to find other ways to reduce costs this usually entails proposals to competitively bid trans it service provision and to allow private operators to provide new services to compete with public transit agencies87 this could be accomplished according to some advocates by making the elimination of local barriers to privatization condition of federal funding88 in many places these local barriers take the form of state and local laws and regulations that provide

moreover contracts with transit workers unions often do not allow transit agencies to employ parttime workers or to require splitshifts to cover the peaking of demand in the morning and evening90 in addition some argue that federal labor protections in transit commonly known as section 13c should be bolished or modified position rejected by unions representing transit workers91 gao report released in 2001 found that 13c labor protections had minimal impact on labor costs and other fact ors in transit operations except in the ability of transit agencies to contract out for fixedroute transit services92 trb report on contracting in the pr ovision of bus service found that few transit managers mentioned federal or stat laws or policies including 13c as reason to contract out or not93 another potential way of reducing the need for public assistance is to increase fares where possible to cover costs fa res need not necessarily be increased across the board but could be adjusted to more accurately reflect the cost of providing particular service the federal government might encourage transit systems to do this particularly with the use of electr onic fare payment technology that makes it relatively easy to collect variable fares it might also be possible to reduce the need for government assistance of public transit by making automobile use more expensive one way to do this is to institute new highway tolls particularly ones that vary based on traffic levels such road pricing schemes usually make the most sense in severely congested regions where good transit options exist congress therefore might encourage congested metropolitan areas to design comprehensive congestion management schemes that incorporate highway pricing and transit as dot is doing

finally some have proposed that th federal transit program include performance incentive element that rewards transit agencies for providing more service per dollar of public subsidy du ring the reauthorization of tea21 the administration proposed 13 billion incen tive program with funding going to agencies with the largest in creases in transit ridership95 transit industry representatives argued against this propos noting that it might unfairly penalize agencies that cannot increase transit ridership because of factors beyond their control such as capacity limitations or local econo mic downturn moreover they noted that several of the formula programs already include factors that reward systems with levels of ridership that are high relative to operating costs96 new performance incentive program was not enacted in saf etea but some observers maintain that it is an option worth considering again federal public transit program priorities if federal funding for transit remains flat or possibly even declines over the next decade congress may opt to adjust the structure of the programs based on reexamination of its prior ities under safetea 43 of funds are authorized for the capital investment program 42 for the urbanized area formula grants program and 15 for several other form ula programs such as the other than urbanized area formula program commonl referred to as the rural formula program state and metropolitan planning research and fta operations97 several possible ways of restructuring federal pub lic transit programs among many othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34183crs24 are outlined below each an alternative to the possibility of leaving the existing system unchanged one way to reorder federal priorities would be to focus more resources on major capital expenses for the rehabilitation and ex pansion of transit service in places that are best served by this m ode primarily the densely populat ed parts of large and often heavily congested cities this would require expanding the programs that make up the capital investment program the new starts program the rail modernization program and the bus capital program and cutting back on the more broadly spread grants under the urbanized and nonurbanize d formula programs that are going for smaller and more routine type s of expenses this change would likely result in concentration of resources in few large cities where transit usage is already relatively high alternatively congress may decide that the era of retrofitting large and mediumsized cities with new transit rail systems is largely over and that resources should now go to supporting nd rehabilitating existing serv ices this could entail reduction in spending on the new starts program currently about 18 of the federal transit program and more suppor t for the other capital programs and the formula grants programs the effect of these changes on the distribution of funds is likely to be more mixed nd would depend on the share of funds dedicated to the rail modernization program program that includes relatively few cities and the share dedicated to buses and formula programs that incl ude much larger number of places third alternative would be to eliminate the capital programs altogether to be replaced with simple block grant that could be distributed based on transit ridership or population this would allow state and local governments to decide how best to allocate transit funding suppor t among existing and new services funds distributed according to transit ridership would reward areas that commit their own resources successfully to providing transit rvice the distribution of funding in this way would again depend on how this progra m would be structured but it might also depend on how states and loca lities react to the changes in terms of how aggressively they promote transit ridership much of this presupposes that federal tr ansit funding may cease to grow or even decline in real terms in the next r eauthorization which might take surface transportation programs through fy2015 this need not be the case if the federal fuels tax is raised and some of this new reve nue dedicated to trans it or if other types of dedicated revenues are created or if c ongress decides to fund transit programs at higher level from the general fund re venue and spending growth may make programmatic decisions good deal easier to make but that does not necessarily preclude congress from making changes in the way the federal government supports public transit provision
