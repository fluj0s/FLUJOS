boards if that technology is in place while each plan sets its own parameters most follow guidelines set by the national center for missing and exploited children ncmec typical amber alert would include an emergency alert system eas broadcast alerts on highway message boards and notifications to public service partners such as police highway patrols and the field crews of public utilities number of counties and cities have amber alert programs that notify local residents using email or telephone alert systems to aid in the recovery of abducted children alerts can also be sent by text messages to cell phones and other wireless devices cingular sprint nextel verizon wireless and tmobile are among the wireless service providers that participate in the amber alert network subscribers

systems for example can be blocked by callscreening technologies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21453 amber alerts and allhazards warnings some states participate in consortium that uses internet technology customized for amber alerts4 information about an amber alert is sent to web portal and reconfigured for different types of broadcasting including cell phones pagers email highway signs tv news websites and emergency communications center the technology allows police officers to transmit details and photos through encrypted computer systems in patrol cars information therefore is disseminated both more quickly and more widely maximizing the opportunity to find missing child in the critical first three hours the alert system is managed from dedicated web portal that can be accessed by statewide or local systems the software recognizes the reported locations of abductions and sends emergency messages to targeted areas emergency alert system eas5 eas sends emergency messages with the cooperation of broadcast radio and television and most cable television stations its most common use is for weather alerts eas technology is also used in the amber alert programs administered in some states and communities to facilitate transmittal eas messages are classified by types of events which are coded these event codes speed the recognition and retransmittal process at broadcast stations for example tornado warning is tor evacuation immediate is evi civil emergency message is cem when message is received at the broadcast station it can be relayed to the public

coded as civil emergencies for transmission new equipment installed by broadcast and cable stations after february 2004 however must be able to receive and transmit the new codes6 although broadcaster participation is mandatory for national alerts the participation of broadcast and cable stations in state and local emergency announcements is voluntary presidential initiatives and the department of
