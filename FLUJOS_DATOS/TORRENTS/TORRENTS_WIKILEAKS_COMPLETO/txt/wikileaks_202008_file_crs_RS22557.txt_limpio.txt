wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22557 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rs22557 public housing fact sheet on the new operating fund formula maggie mccarty domestic social policy division january 26 2008 abstract the local public housing authorities phas that administer the federal public housing program began receiving their annual federal operating subsidies under new formula in january 2007 as result some phas experienced an increase in their eligibility for funding and others experienced decrease although both increases and decreases will be phased in over two and five years respectively however the amount that pha qualifies for under the new formula whether it is an increase or decrease will be reduced if congress appropriates less money than is necessary to fund all agencies at 100 of their eligibility order code rs22557 updated january 26 2008 public housing fact sheet on the new operating fund formula maggie mccarty analyst in housing social policy division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22557 the local public housing authorities phas that administer the federal public housing program began receiving their annual federal operating subsidies under new formula in january 2007 as result some phas experienced an increase in their eligibility for funding and others experienced decrease although both increases and decreases will be phased in over two and five years respectively however the amount that pha qualifies for under the new formula whether it is an increase or decrease will be reduced if congress appropriates less money than is necessary to fund all agencies at 100 of their eligibility this fact sheet will be updated the federal government supplies subsidies to phas to help make up the difference between what lowincome tenants pay in rent and the cost of operating lowrent public housing the formula for providing these operating funds changed in january 2007 under the new formula some phas are eligible to receive an increase in federal operating funds and others qualify for decrease both increases and decreases will be phased in phas facing decreases will have an opportunity to limit their formula eligibility losses through the adoption of management changes however the amount that pha qualifies for under the new operating fund formula whether it is an increase or decrease is reduced if congress appropriates less money than is necessary to fund all agencies at 100 of their eligibility as congress has done in most recent years this report is designed to provide brief overview of the changes to the public housing operating fund formula that began taking place in january 2007 background public housing costs are divided into two main categories capital costs and operating costs capital costs are the costs of major renovations or modernizations operating costs are the daytoday costs of running building such as utility administrative and routine maintenance costs operating costs vary based on many factors including the age of building its heating and cooling systems and its location in the early years of the public housing program phas were expected to meet their crs2 operating costs through the rents they collected over time tenant rents were longer sufficient to cover public housing operating expenses in part because tenants became poorer and therefore unable to pay as much in rent and in part because the costs of maintaining the buildings increased as they aged in the late 1960s congress began providing operating subsidies to phas to supplement the low rents paid by tenants the system in place for providing those subsidies until 2001 was the performance funding system pfs in 1998 public housing reform law congress responded to criticisms that the pfs formula was outdated by creating new public housing operating fund1 the law required the department of housing and urban development hud to use negotiated rulemaking to develop new formula for distributing the funds negotiated rulemaking committee convened in 1999 involved phas and other stakeholder groups during deliberation it was agreed that sufficient data were not available to determine the true costs of operating public housing and that study should be undertaken2 until the results of the study were available the committee agreed to use modified version of the pfs to create an interim operating fund formula this interim formula took effect in 20013 hud contracted with the harvard graduate school of design to conduct the public housing operating cost study its results were published in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22557 20034 another negotiated rulemaking committee was established to use the results of the study to develop final formula to replace the interim formula hud published proposed rule in the spring of 20055 but the rule was criticized for differing significantly from the agreements made during negotiated rulemaking hud published final rule in the fall of 2005 which more closely resembled the initial agreement of the negotiated rulemaking committee6 the new formula took effect in january 20077 operating fund formula the operating fund provides subsidies to phas to make up the difference between what it costs to run public housing and what lowincome tenants pay in rent under the interim formula the calculation for determining phas operating subsidy eligibility used two components formula expenses meant to represent the cost of running public housing and formula income meant to represent the amount collected in tenant rents hud subtracts phas formula income from its formula expenses and the amount by 1 sec 519 quality housing and work opportunity responsibility act 1998 pl 105276 2 hud revisions to the public housing operating fund

initially scheduled implementation for 2006 but implementation was delayed by the hud notice revisions to the public housing operating fund program correction to formula implementation date 70 federal register 61366 october 24 2005 crs3 which the income is short of the expenses is the phas operating subsidy eligibility the new operating fund formula uses the same principle but more complex equation with changes to the way certain components are calculated formula expenses formula expenses are the sum of three categories of estimated expenses nonutility expenses utility expenses and other addons nonutility expense levels nonutility expense levels are per unit estimates of the basic nonutility operating costs of maintaining public housing8 under the old formula the nonutility expense levels set for pha were called allowable expense levels aels they were set for most phas under the pfs in 1975 and subsequently updated for inflation the aels were modified in 1992 and again in 2001 when the interim rule was adopted9 to calculate the nonutility expense component of phas formula expenses under the interim operating fund formula the number of public housing units in phas inventory10 was multiplied by the agencys ael the new operating fund formula sets new nonutility expense levels for phas based on the data from the harvard study and adjusted for inflation these new project expense httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22557 levels pels are not applied at the agency level as under the interim rule rather they differ for each project within phas portfolio based on the characteristics of that project11 to calculate the nonutility expense component of phas formula expenses under the new operating fund formula the number of eligible public housing units12 in each project in phas inventory is multiplied by each projects pel and those amounts are then summed13 for cy2007 hud developed weighted average project expense levels wapels for each pha and applied the wapel to all pha units for cy2008 hud will use individual pels14 utility expense levels utility expense levels uels are estimates of the utility costs that can be attributed to unit of public housing they are calculated for each utility based on phas consumption level and the applicable rates for that utility the interim formula had aspects designed to encourage phas to adopt more energyefficient practices and reduce consumption the harvard cost study did not make recommendations for changing utility expense levels citing lack of available data15 the final rule largely 8 examples of nonutility operating costs include administrative costs advertising the availability of units processing of applications safety and security costs and routine maintenance 9 see interim rule 24 cfr 990105 10 eligible units were units available for occupancy long term vacancies and vacancies above 3 are not considered eligible for occupancy see interim rule 24 cfr 990102 11 projects are not necessarily individual buildings rather they are groupings of units established by phas under 24 cfr 990665 final rule 12 eligible units are occupied units units with an approved vacancy and other vacant units not to exceed 3 of the phas inventory see 24 cfr 990125 final rule 13 see 24 cfr 990165 final rule 14 because hud has experienced technical difficulties with data system for the first several months of cy2008 phas are receiving funding based on their cy2007 eligibility 15 harvard graduate school of design benchmarking public housing utility funding to private norms feasibility study draft march 22 2002 crs4 maintains the existing formula for calculating uels although the rule does state that hud will study options for calculating utility costs and will convene negotiated rulemaking committee in 2009 to come up with new formula for 201116 addons in addition to basic utility and nonutility expenses the interim operating fund formula included some addon costs that phas could qualify to include in their formula expenses some of these addons were flat perunit permonth or perunit peryear fees others were openended reimbursements the new operating fund formula includes several new addons including the reasonable cost of self sufficiency program an asset management fee for phas in compliance with asset management requirements 4 per unit per month for phas with more than 250 units and 2 per unit per month for phas with 250 units or less information technology fees 2 per unit per month asset repositioning fees for units being removed from the public housing stock that are not eligible for operating funds reasonable costs for energy conservation measures and payment in lieu of taxes pilot costs which were included in the aels under the old formula17 formula income formula income represents the income pha collects from httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22557 rents under the interim rule formula income was calculated by computing phas average monthly rental charge per unit applying an upward trend factor and multiplying it by the number of units expected to be occupied18 under the new operating fund rule formula income will be calculated by taking the average rent charged by each pha in its 2004 fiscal year and multiplying it by the phas eligible units19 each phas formula income will be frozen at this 2004 level through fy200820 because tenants in public housing pay an incomebased rent as their incomes rise so does the amount they pay in rent with formula income frozen at the fy2004 level under the new rule phas will have an incentive to encourage families to increase their incomes as the increased revenue from rents will not be used when calculating phas operating fund eligibility until after fy2008 phasein under the new formula some phas will be gainers meaning that they will be eligible for an increase in funding while others will be decliners meaning that they will qualify for decrease in funding hud analysis found that 74 of phas would have qualified for higher funding if the new operating fund formula had been in place in fy2004 26 of phas would have qualified for less funding21 to help ease the transition losses will be phased in over five years gains will be phased in over two years see table 1 for the phasein schedule to implement the phasein hud has calculated 16 see 24 cfr 990170185 final rule 17 see 24 cfr 990190 final rule for former addons see interim rule 24 cfr 990108 18 see interim rule 24 cfr 990109 19 see 24 cfr 990195 final rule 20 pha can appeal to have its formula income adjusted if it can show that severe local economic hardship is affecting its ability to maintain some semblance of its formula income 21 hud new operating fund formula rule transition analysis report available at httpwwwhudgovofficespihprogramsphamoftransitionanalysxls crs5 transition amount for each pha the transition amount is the difference between phas operating subsidy eligibility in fy2004 and what the phas eligibility would have been if the new formula had been in effect the transition amount for each pha will be adjusted by each years phasein level and then either added or subtracted to each phas operating subsidy eligibility level for that year for example if phas operating subsidy eligibility was 500000 in fy2004 but would have been only 450000 if the new formula had been in place the pha would be considered decliner and its transition amount would be 50000 under the phasein schedule declines are limited to 5 in the first year and so 47500 50000 x 95 adjusted for the number of eligible units would be added to the phas fy2007 operating subsidy eligibility if the situation were reversed and the pha would have gone from 450000 under the old formula to 500000 under the new formula the pha would be considered gainer its transition amount would still be 50000 but since gains are limited to 50 in the first year 25000 adjusted for the number of eligible units would be subtracted from the phas fy2007 operating subsidy eligibility table 1 phasein rates for operating subsidy funding changes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22557 year phasein for declines phasein for gains 1 2007 5 50 2 2008

register 68404 november 24 2006 phas that wish to limit their losses can transition to assetbased management in advance of the 2011 deadline discussed below22 phas that transition to assetbased management in the preceding year will stop their losses for the following year and thereafter at that years phasein rate23 for example pha that has adopted assetbased management by the deadline in the first year will limit its losses to 5 meaning that hud will add 95 of its transition amount to its operating subsidy eligibility each year assetbased management24 one major recommendation of the harvard study was that phas should transition to assetbased management in the past phas budgeted and were funded on an agencywide basis rather than on projectbyproject basis they were also permitted to manage all of their units from central office this system differed from private market multifamily housing norms where each property is treated 22 see hud public housing operating fund program revised transition funding provision for federal fiscal year 2007 proposed rule 71 federal register 68408 november 24 2006 23 initially hud stated that phas were required to comply before april 15 2007 to limit their losses to 5 in the first year hud notice pih 200635 hud later stated that it would extend the deadline to october 15 2007 for the first year in the second year phas will have to comply by april 15 2008 if they wish to stop their losses at 24 in the third year phas wishing to stop their losses by 43 will have to comply by october 15 2008 24 see 24 cfr 990 subpart h final rule crs6 as an individual asset and managed on an individual basis in the final operating fund rule hud directed phas to adopt projectbased budgeting and projectbased accounting by pha fy2007 and projectbased management by pha fy2011 operating subsidy funding the amount of operating subsidy pha is eligible to receive is not necessarily the amount of funding it will actually receive the amount of funding appropriated by congress for the operating fund is generally less than the amount necessary to fund all phas at 100 of their eligibility as result hud must apply an acrosstheboard cut to phas operating subsidy levels in order to stay within the amount appropriated by congress the percentage of formula eligibility phas receive after the acrosstheboard cut is referred to as the proration level as shown in table 2 proration levels have been declining in recent years meaning that phas have been receiving smaller and smaller share of the total funding for which they are eligible table 2 operating fund prorations fy19982007 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22557 appropriation proration fy in millions of nominal 2007 3864 834 2006 3564 860 2005a 2437 888 2004 3579 981 2003

database proration levels are taken from data available on huds website httpwwwhudgovofficespihprogramsphamofprorationlevelspdf httpwwwhudgovofficespihprogramsphamof2006prorationexpl_sept06pdf and httpwwwhudgovofficespihprogramsphamof2007prorationexplfnlpdf in 2005 congress enacted budgeting change that led to onetime appropriations savings without corresponding decrease in the program level the harvard operating cost study found that on the whole the government has been underfunding the operating costs of phas huds own transition analysis indicated that if the new formula had been in place in fy2004 phas would have been eligible for an additional 264 million that means that if the new formula had been in place in fy2004 with the same appropriations level the proration level for fy2004 would have been lower and phas would have received less than 98 of their funding eligibility because in aggregate phas will qualify for more funding under the new formula than under the old formula unless appropriations increase proration levels can be expected to continue to decrease
