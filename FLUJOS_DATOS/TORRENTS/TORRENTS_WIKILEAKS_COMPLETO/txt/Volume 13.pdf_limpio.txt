data in 1964 three or four persons promptly used it on pcs knowing well it was forbidden the pcs became ill or misemotional toward us and just the day i write this original writing 4 october 1965 i myself encountered pc very ill who had had some original r6 data misused on her and did not suspect why her case and health had worsened she was not ready for it at all the issue earlier was trial balloon in sense i found certain persons small minority were not up to responsibility for the material of april 1964 therefore our firm action will be that the moment we find the material of the clearing course or ot course has escaped or been misused we will quickly trace the person who was insecure and cut off all further or any future clearing or ot data issue to that person the likelihood of independent discovery even with clues has proven to be nonexistent by actual review of auditors trying to find pieces of it when they had over half of the answers already you must realize that we suffer all of us from the misuse of knowledge concerning the mind at very early period to place this data near such people as psychiatrists or even states places them in position to enslave people or repeat the original action and cave people in very small minority receiving incorrect data did promptly use it harmfully on others after april 1964 until we ourselves have climbed well out of the hole we must safeguard the materials our case gains depend on it and others could make our salvage of people impossible we do not safeguard these materials from any commercial consideration our futures those of each of us and those of all scientologists depend on our keeping this material under lock and safeguarded from abuse until we are well away as group and can handle things better as individuals as well as group the road is wide open to anyone to come up the grades and obtain them but it is shut to any who misuse them or injure their security students of the advanced courses the advanced course cs and supervisor ethics officers and all hco and org staff have it in their personal interest to enforce security of materials to the limit these restrictions apply to data up to grade v from power processing on up the data is confidential up to there you can release scientology data as you always havefreely and to everyone but this last bit is dangerous in unskilled or uneducated or unscrupulous hands and it is purely ours it belongs to the scientologists who keep the show on the road and must be available to them when they are ready lrhbwlrsbrd flag advanced

the 3 new power levels i recently developed until they have on staff review cl vl personnel who have interned at saint hill in the saint hill dept of review the processes require the most skilled and exact application and have exact phenomena to be observed which becomes impossible to supervise outside the above departments only class vi auditors may audit these processes first only at saint hill and only under the supervision of mary sue hubbard until they have learned them perfectly training on such processes can be undertaken only by provisional class vi auditors after leaving the course and only enrolled on staff as internes in the department of review or the hgc orgs not having personnel so trained by interneship may not use these processes in their review departments the fact of having review personnel trained in review at saint hill does not permit an org to train new review personnel in the org anybody in an orgs review who will be using or supervising the use of power processes must have been interned at saint hill such training however gives right to train others holding this policy firmly guarantees the full success technically in all cases in any org in the world avoiding it in any way jeopardizes that success these power processes are simple but so is tnt the reason for this is that there is adequate repair for errors made in running these processes if their existing remedies are also goofed the strongest swiftest ethics action must follow any slightest violation of the above for these processes alone guarantee sweeping success for scientology on the roughest cases everywhere any auditor who discovers that the pc he is auditing has been illegally audited previously on power process or any higher level process for which the pc is not graded must report the matter at once to the nearest hco ethics section by collect wire or phone call r6 new students before enrollment in the r6 unit of the shsbc all students who have not been run on the power processes and who have any slightest difficulty with r6 ew must be ordered at once to the review case cracking section for power processes any student not showing adequate case gain on the

with the lettering neatly printed on it in black preferably sheathed in plastic it is to be issued to the pc and pinned noticeably on lapel breast pocket or similar place by pc administrator at the commencement of his power processing cycle and collected back when he completes pc administrator is to tell the pc to wear this badge throughout his power processing his power auditor is responsible

processes the power processes or any version of them may not be used by persons not trained at class vii at saint hill the data on this overwhelmingly demands this policy be firmly applied with exceptions these wonderful processes are capable of making release from even 34 in every case to which they are applied run by new class vi auditors who have been starchecked at saint hill on them goofs of huge magnitude have been made in orgs without full class vii trained auditors the power processes just wouldnt work at all pcs would be folding up like accordions releases just wouldnt happen tremendous experience and the closest supervision preceded by full training in the d of p ing of the processes as well as running them is vital to success they are easy but until every faintest kink is taken out of an auditors auditing and every possible eventuality has been shown to him and until he has seen what misuse can do the auditor cannot handle them thus ethics must be very alert to illegal use of power processes and must be very severe about it otherwise there will be some very sick pcs around and administrative chaos there are then two grades of processes which demand the highest quality of training before they produce results one is class vi materials the other is class vii materials the power process this is effort to make monopoly it is simply responsibility after all auditing on them is available right now training for class vi and vii is available this very minute at saint hill the technology will be passed on for training use in an org when an org is class vii org22to wit when it is fully qualified to teach and use them and when its executive secretaries of hco and the org and its division secretaries are clears and its tech and qual personnel are

always start off with secondaries the moment sufficient charge is off the case hell automatically go into the engrams at that moment you cease running secondaries for that particular bracket only and

hubbard what is power how do you get it how do you control it so it doesnt backfire or disappear man has searched for the answers to these questions for eons history books are glutted with tales of political intrigue and gory battles fought to capture that elusive goal power but has anyone ever really gained power with sword or gun can person maintain power even if its given to him if he knows not how to use it real power comes from being oneself when person has knowledge and certainty of himself and can hold his position then he is truly powerful but how can person hold his own position when the reactive mind works against him making him forget his true goals and his true identity the answer exists on power processing the power processes are major step towards getting rid of the reactive mind these knock out all factors of the track that force person back into the r6 bank the reactive mind and leave the person able to go into or get out of the r6 bank easily the person ceases to respond like homo sapiens and has fantastic capability to learn and act l ron hubbard on power youll find out what the forces are that drive person back into his bank and youll become free from their bad effects what is more youll find yourself on the first of the confidential grades of scientology from power on up through clear and ot the processes are confidential26hubbard communications office saint hill manor east sussex hco bulletin of 11 may ad 15 by hand saint hill only scientology v i i confidential issue qualifications division only starrated checkout the power processes there are three power processes being run at this time they are known as the source existence and the conditions process i source definition source that from which something comes or develops place of origin cause source process commands 1tell source 2tell about it 3tell source 4tell about it flattening the source process the source process is ended when the preclear experiences brightness and solidity changes in the auditing room the preclear will comment that the room is brighter and more solid source process auditing of commands 1clear the word source and the word source by having the preclear look up the definition in the dictionary 2clear the command tell source 3clear the command tell source 4clear the command tell about it theory of the source process the source process is used to get preclear not only to answer the auditing command and tell where it is coming from but also to handle the preclear on the entire scale from source to total source to awareness of sources27the source case one of the lowest levels of cases is the case who has never caused anything and who does not recognize that anyone else can cause things this case is one of totally fixed attention units all of which are completely fixated on something which is not there but which is meaningful and malevolent therefore this case has sought the refuge of the non existence of source to avoid this something to such case there is existence and conditions recognizing source this preclear therefore has auditor is not himself there either and of course has never done anything preclears in this state can quite easily admit to having done most anything because in actuality they have not ever done anything further cases at source have awareness of any emotion or sensation although they can exhibit physically the manifestations of emotion and sensation but their awareness of doing so is nil or at the most slight curiosity that their bodies are reacting in an odd manner everything is pointless to such case as there is source and therefore way to effect any changes such case is selfinvalidative irresponsible and speaks in total generalities such reflecting the source of causation this person too is haunted by ghosts delusions and false beings all of which are phenomena of source the individual is quite theetyweety the perception of such case as the source case is that the environment is either rather dark or transparent an auditor to get reality concerning how the world looks to such case should look at the reflection of room as mirrored in window the total source case up scale to degree from the source case is the total source case the case which is pretending to be total source when obviously the person is not here we have the megalomaniac the selfassertive case the pathological braggart and the guilt case such cases think they cause everything or pretend to cause everything or think they have caused things they havent or pretend to cause things which they havent such cases are continuously making false assignments of cause such cases tend in two directions because they are cause of everything they are guilty for all that has happened or is happening or because they are cause of everything they are in state of fighting everyone else in their environment as fancied threats to their own false cause in the latter case falls the paranoid who is certain that he is being donein because he is so important that the fbi is after him such case if he recognizes other source at all recognizes it only as threat to him or as bad causation which only he can right usually such cases as the total source case flipflops between the two extremes in his considerations he is either guilty horrible blameworthy creature or he is genius fantastic being whom others are trying to get at in auditing such case as the total source case the auditor for this preclear does not exist either as such preclear can admit of other source or if the auditor does exist the auditor is only to this preclear source of distraction or source of bad cause if he is in propitiation to the auditor it will be those above the auditor who are the source of bad cause what the auditor must recognize and know about both the source case and the total source case and the various harmonics of such as dramatized on various dynamics is that neither case can asis either because there is source at all or because source is misassigned asisness can only occur with the proper assignment of source or28authorship since the ability to perceive source is the key to solving problems such people have enormous numbers of problems but never seem to describe the real problem thus they seem quite baffling definitions attention unit theta energy quantity of awareness existing in the mind in varying quantity from person to person fixed attention units attention units which are caught somewhere down the time track in one incident or another in the form of entheta generality general or nonspecific statement which is applicable to all and used to connote statement made in an effort to either hide cause or to overwhelm another person with the allinclusive megalomaniac person who has delusions of grandeur wealth power etc delusion belief in something which is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or misassignment paranoid person with delusions as of grandeur or especially persecution ii existence definition existence an existing state or fact of being life living continuance of being an occurrence specific manifestation existence process commands 1what is 2what isnt flattening the existence process the existence process is ended when the preclear gets into present time some preclears are stuck in present time in such cases they will begin answering in present time and then cycle back on the time track and back into present time many times repeating the cycle from present to past to present to past to present each time going less far into the past until they are finally in present time for many commands existence process auditing of commands 1clear the word is and clear the word isnt by having the preclear look up the definition in the dictionary 2clear the question what is 3clear the question what isnt theory of the existence process the existence process is used to unburden the engram the preclear is stuck in so the29preclear can appear to come to present time this process handles obsessive pretense chronic alteris and dubin both in present time and on the track or objective dubin and subjective dubin with the source process the auditor improved the preclears ability to be aware of the sources of things now with the existence process the auditor is to improve the preclears ability to be aware of the existence of the actual and the nonexistence of the inactual this process removes the extraneous incidents off the engram in which the preclear is stuck so that the preclear apparently comes to present time definitions pretense claim profession or allegation which is falsely made or assumed or stated asisness this is the basic statement of reality in the technology of auditing and one of its major contributions instead of puzzling as to who made the universe or what made it the auditor simply perceives that it is however if you attempt to erase an engram that didnt happen dubin or get relief by running problem that never existed there is case gain why because one can only confront or erase what is not an alteration of what is to asis something is to look at it as it is really without decoration excuse embellishment dubin lies twists and all that the alterations prevent the erasure of the actual isness of the existence or the past or problem etc one has to confront the truth of it without twists to erase it preclear who twists things looks at birds and calls them birds when they are really chickens or was punished every day when one actually touched him can not erase any part of the bank thus one sees range arm or improvement the pc is working on fantasy or reputational excuses and isnt asising this must be cured before preclear can make any real gains the way to handle it is by getting the preclear to gradually come to looking at things as they are when the preclear can do this he or she can now asis which is to say erase bank by looking at it this is the purpose of the existence process the pc does not have to understand why it works to have it work it just works alteris to introduce change and therefore time and persistence into an as isness to obtain persistency an introduction of an alteris is therefore the addition of lie to the real which causes it to persist and not to blow or asis objective dubin the manifestation of putting unknowingly perceptions which do not in actual fact exist in the environment subjective dubin the manifestation of putting unknowingly perceptions which do not in actual fact exist into incidents on the time track iii conditions definition condition anything called for as requirement before the performance completion or effectiveness of something else provision stipulation anything essential to the existence or occurrence of something else anything that modifies or restricts the nature existence or occurrence of something else external circumstances or factors manner or state of being proper or healthy state conditions process commands301tell an existing condition 2tell how youve handled it flattening the conditions process the conditions process is ended when the preclear has revivification of the engram in which heshe is stuck on the time track it is preceded at times by anaten or secondary engram misemotional or both conditions process auditing of commands 1clear the words existing and condition by having the preclear look up the definitions in the dictionary 2clear the command tell an existing condition 3clear the word handled by having the preclear look up the definition in the dictionary 4clear the command tell how you handled it theory of the conditions process the conditions process handles the engram the preclear is stuck in and knocks apart the stuck point on the time track it is aimed at the preclear who is out of present time but who is fighting back track enemy as though it was in present time and who is therefore solving problem in present time which has ceased to exist in life because of this the preclear is hostile covert and antagonistic the case of the continuing perpetrations in present time is resolved with the conditions process all of this cases continual perpetrations in present time are efforts to solve the engram in which the preclear is stuck the conditions process results in revivification of this engram in which the preclear is stuck and thereby frees the individual on the time track so he can now really be in present time while the preclear will recall or remember many incidents and while he seems to be in many he is in actual fact only in one and has been there for long time with other incidents piling up on it the pc will eventually revivify relive the actual engram briefly and come for the first time to present time that is the end of the process secondary misemotional incident has to have an engram moment of pain and unconsciousness under it to be secondary and remain in place that is why it is called secondary preclear commonly goes through the secondary misemotional charge before he revivifies thus the appearance of secondary is sign that one is approaching the engram one does not run the secondary or engram as auditor one just goes on running the conditions process commands it is severe goof to stop or change processes just because the pc has hit secondary or the key engram one runs the process exactly when the pc revivifies few more commands usually gets him into pt and ends the process it is severe goof to overrun or underrun the process31end words sometimes persons who couldnt run r6 well have had end words fly off for while when run on one or another of the power processes this soon ceases and the pc runs quite normally its just their r6 auditing coming off however the major symptom of overrunning the process is that the pc his time track blown by revivification begins to clear off real end words much like r6ew if pc has revivified and the process is overrun it can become quite severe in reaction as the pc will stick into the r6 bank however preclear can be overrun for several days without being smashed but dont do it further definitions present time the time which is now and which becomes the past almost as rapidly as it is observed it is term loosely applied to the environment existing in now as in the preclear came up to present time meaning the preclear became aware of the existing matter energy space and time of now the point on anyones time track where his physical body if alive may be found now stuck in present time the condition of person being incapable of moving on the time track into the past in actuality the preclear is in some incident which forces him to be in the apparent present revivification the bringing back to life of an engram in which preclear is stuck the engram or some portion thereof is being acted out in present time by the preclear it is called revivification because the engram is suddenly more real to the preclear than present time has ever been he relives that moment briefly he does not merely recall or remember it an engram mental image picture of an experience containing pain unconscious ness and real or fancied threat to survival it is recording in the mind of something which actually happened to the preclear in the past which contained pain and uncon sciousness both of which are recorded in the mental image picture called an engram anaten composite of two words analytical attenuation or partial or complete dilution or weakening of the functions of the analytical mind the preclear goes unconscious for moment in the session secondary secondary engram is mental image picture of moment in the past containing misemotion anger fear grief apathy where loss either is threatened or accomplished however secondary can not exist unless an engram underlies it time track the consecutive mental image pictures recording the consecutive moments of now through which the individual has lived it consists of locks second aries and engrams l ron hubbard lrh msh cs copyright c 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved32the power processes power process 1aa pr pr 1aa 1what have you done

february 70 floating needles and end phenomena when i hear of power being run pr pr 4 5 6 and the three steps of va in ten minutes or so on pc i wonder who is kidding the purpose of power is not to see how many pcs one can audit in an hour but to give lasting gains to the pc in the first place the case has to be set up for power all dn triples must have been run and the pc must have gone whole track without whole track dont expect power or anything else to last all qscn triples must have been successfully run any and all preparatory actions to make the case sure of full gains and all psycho somatic illnesses must have been handled by auditing given those requisites one comes to power each power process has its own end phenomena pr pr 4 5 and 6 you dont run power to just an fn you audit it to 1fn 2the end phenomena for that power process 3vgis the old saw all clearing practitioners talk too much was never truer than in power the first fn you see on the process in power finds the pc still introverted looking inward if you just carry on maybe one more command or so you will see the pc hit the end phenomena and extrovert39then vgis will come in the fn will broaden widely and really float now tell him his needle is floating if you like but dont use i would like to indicate to you your needle is floating to chop off the end phenomena speed and result somewhere somebody got the idea that really good clearing practitioner can go from grade 0 to iv in 15 minutes and pr pr 4 to va 1c in 20 minutes speed has nothing to do with it as long as you dont have pc waiting for commands speed is worthless commodity in auditing one audits for results the results of pr pr 4 5 and 6 are the end phenomena each of these 3 processes has its own particular end phenomena and if that isnt obtained you have not delivered power i reresearched all this very recently and these end phenomena occur shortly after the first appearance of the fn and when they occur you get really wide float and very happy pc the pc may or may not say what happened but he sure will extrovert look outward sometimes with awe well awe is not vgis what you really see is relief and then vgis so let him get his end

office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 1 february ad 13 central orgs missions air mail class iii iv auditors routine 3 urgenturgenturgent all class iii iv auditors communicators get this data into the hands of any auditor running goals on pcs fast there is probable bug in the listing of all previous routine 3 processes i have been studying this for some time to solve why we are getting too few clears after the goal is found and why they are sometimes unclear after their needle frees the answer comes out of routine 212 never represent rock slamming item rocket read as on goal often follows this rule and becomes never represent rocket reading item ln all previous r3 we were representing the rocket reading goal in two of the four lines and opposing it backwards in the remaining two people went clear on the four sixteen and other multiple lines but something must have been wrong as others didnt therefore abandon at once any listing on any older line series goal may be listed only on who or what does the goal oppose never on who or what would want or not want the goal as that approximates represent line to some cases do not list anything but goaloppose never list even opposegoal i learned all this shaping up routine 2 ___________ wrong goals are still dynamite but this newly developed listing below helps prove goal out goal reliable items rocket read if goal wont yield rr reliable items its probably wrong in routine 2 you use rock slams the bigger the rock slam the better it will go for the pc55in routine 3 you use rocket reads never rock slams routines 2 and 3 therefore do not mix while you may encounter and use rocket reads in routine 2 dont mix goals into it goals just naturally emerge in doing routine 2 when they check out get the pc run on routine 3 in routine 3 you wholly ignore rock slams and use only rocket reads to fill the gap i have put routine 3mx together as theoretical process ___________ old goals use your pcs alreadyfound goal prepcheck it back to rocket read and use routine 3mx from there on ___________ routine 3mx for experimental use by class iii and iv auditors and z unit shsbc introduction routine 3mx is released as experimental it is however already well worked out and as soon as i find any and all bugs the x will be dropped r3mx uses all ive learned about listing items in r2 and applies it to listing out goals for the moment z unit of the shsbc will use only r3mx utilizing goals already found on r2mx method assessing for goals method assessment for goals in r3mx method is by meter listing and rocket read after doing r212a on the pc and good prepcheck particularly on former goals work one has the pc list goals in session on the meter one lists the tone arm action out and goes well beyond if the pc has already listed goals with none found list more on the pc to check for ta action if it exists list it out one looks for and notes goals that rocket read56one then takes these rocket reading goals and tiger drills them preferably the last one that rocket read first as it is the most likely if pc arc breaks the list is probably incomplete according to r2 findings so complete it dont list in method goals from items or detour just go on and on listing goals do prepcheck on goals every fourth session the list may go to 2000 goals but if it goes so high or beyond the pc needs more r212a method b r3mx method b uses the ten lists of 3gaxx but uses any routine 2 reliable item that still rock slams or one preferably that rocket reads this method is not covered in this hcob but will be familiar to saint hillers method c r3mx method c uses r212a until the goal starts pushing up and the pc starts insisting upon it without any prompting from the auditor one does not grab the goal the auditor notes it down if one keeps on doing r212a well the goal will eventually rocket read easily for checkout rock slams on case indicate lot of distance down to rocket reads method d r3mx method d uses problems intensives until the goal appears this has happened in many cases goal checkout the goal must rocket read three times in three to be used for listing if not do more r212a and check the goal out later57listing goals out goals listing was more serious hazard in routine 3 than finding goals this simplified listing while as yet theoretical in some respects should be easier than any earlier listing it is done like r212a but by rocket reads only line assessment one takes the goal found makes sure that it rocket reads well not rock slams and assesses as follows use the painsensation analysis of the goal if pain as it should be one tests who or what would the goal to be tiger oppose or who or what would being tiger oppose the ing form of the goal one or the other question should rocket read use that one we list just this one list on the goal itself and after that use reliable items that rocket read using long sheets of paper with the pcs name date and line question on every sheet we write down all the items called off by the pc we mark rock slams and rocket reads as we see them we list to still ta and then 50 items at least beyond and 50 items beyond the last rocket read not rock slam ever we dont null the list we read the next to last rocket read to the pc and then the last rocket read item and the item just above and below and see if the tests of 212a hold good cogs arc break sudden drop of ta lightening face color etc if so its the pcs reliable item we now begin the spiral staircase we oppose and oppose and oppose and oppose and oppose always according to whether term or oppterm as long as we can as follows we determine if the reliable item is term or oppterm by calling it off to the pc for pain or sensation and then by test listing bothwaysto on the oppose the wrong way tightens the needle and gives real ta action the right way loosens the needle and gives good ta action example we found kitten as the reliable item we test for pain or sensation on it and find it gave pain term we list who or what would oppose kitten then who or what would kitten oppose and guided by our test pain also and loosening needle and moving ta we complete the list who or what would kitten oppose58we list to still ta and 50 items or more beyond and 50 past the last rocket read we give the pc the next to last item that rocket read on listing then the last rocket read item we watch for the signs if it isnt right we go on listing if there are two rocket reads still firing on the list it is incomplete and we must complete it thus we find our reliable item in short we find reliable item after reliable item just exactly as above each time but always by rocket read not rock slam this is spiral staircase down toward the rock and opp rock we pay further heed to the goal until our spiral staircase folds up on us more rocket reads on the lists or bank getting too solid in brief when we run out of reliable items we go back to the goal we were using we test it mildly prepcheck it put the big mid ruds in on it and try to revive it if it sparks up rocket reads again or reads we do all the above steps the assessment from the 2 questions the list the first reliable item the spiral staircase again if we cant get peep out of the old goal and our auditing was good we just do another goals assessment and find new goal that rocket reads and start all over again ___________ as soon as i find what mistakes can be made ill recodify and well have an improved r321 and ill take the x off ___________ we need clears as weve never needed them before and we need them now and we therefore need simpler faster clearing ive got r2 smoothed out in r212a and its real doll now im smoothing out r321 using everything learned in watching r212 in use but using rocket reads not rock slams l ron hubbard founder59hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 11 february 1963 franchise cenocon current auditing current auditing has been unsettled due to the sudden breakthrough on r3mx what i was looking for was 1a process that invariably cleared pcs easily 2that had very precise and invariable rules 3that could be taught by rote and 4would not be subject to change this process turned out to be r3mx the x at this writing is dropped as the process has proven itself and it becomes routine 3m the designation of m is simply its consecutive letter in the development series but it could stand for mary sue as she did the actual auditing under my direction that proved its rules the rules of 3mx were worked out in routine 212 and 212a and then by examining rocket reading item behaviour in 3mx the first thing you should know about 3m is that it is more precise in application than any process you have handled when it says list the tone arm action out and then 25 items more it means exactly that surges of the needle dont count in ta action as you couldnt follow them with the ta and back that fast when r3m says list 25 items beyond the last rr or rs on list it means 25 not 24 in 3m it says rocket reading item and thats what it means and rocket read is rocket read not fall r3m is therefore masterpiece of precision do it wrongnot exactly by the rulesand it becomes real nightmare so know it before you do it and do what it says only in both r212a and r3m an item can appear anywhere on source list so long as 2 items do not rs or rr one item rsing and one rring also means list is incomplete on the ww wd goal opp list the 3m source list you have to make sure list is complete to 50 items beyond last rsing or rring item and 50 beyond ta action point where ta stops moving this is true for both 3m and 212a you read every rring item back to pc from the 3m source list goal opp and every rsing item on the 212a source list source list is of course the primary list from the goal from which you get the first rring ri in 212a the source list is what you choose to get your first list from or list one60all other lists in 3m are extended 25 items beyond the last rr or rs and the item is always the last rr on the listif not youve goofed didnt get the ta action out of this or the just prior list in 212a you go 50 items beyond the last rs and 50 beyond the 1st still ta the 8 tests for mass increase etc must be done on every item found in 3m and 2 12a the best coverages of r3m are the hco bulletin of feb 1 1963 routine 3 and the two hours of lecture of feb 7 1963 where it is covered hco bulletins and other lectures will be forthcoming r212a if r3m emerges so suddenly then what of routine 210 212 and 212a with the single caution that you must not try to package small rs and only use wide rs 13 of dial or more as your source lists ri 212a is very successful just as laid down it will continue to be taught and used in it you have some very precise rules list is continued 50 items beyond the last rs never represent an rsing item always carry wide rsing ri around to package of 4 it is not important how you get your first ri so long as it didnt come from representing an rsing item the last rs on the list opposing an ri is the right item always unless youve goofed there must not be 2 rsing items on list except list one where you choose the biggest rs as your first ri if two appear your list is incomplete or you let the pc as you must never do represent an rr or rs hes heard or seen on the list you dont nul in 212a or 3m you just read the next to last then the last rs or rr item tough cases the rs grabbed off list one issue 3 will change with 212a rockslammers sit back and get relaxed

least once if so go to step 2 3m can be started without having the goal if you have an rr ri from 212 if so start 3m with step 8 and find goal as in step 15 determine goal question 2determine by meter

interpreting what is ta action on the list keep going if you know what ta action is but dont use 005 divisions ta change as an excuse to list pc black in the face test list 5test list by reading two rses or rrs back to pc if only one rs or rr is reading on the list it is complete if two are reading continue the list until you have new rses or rrs and 50 beyond the last one again then retest be sure list is complete by which is meant it has an rsing or rring item reading on it but not two and an ri is on the list find ri 6search out the rsing or rring item by reading each one marked rr on listing back to pc one should rocket read or rock slam without td if none are found that now rs or rr read the nonrs nonrr items just above and below each marked rs or rr you may have mistaken which item rsed or rred work at it until youve found the reliable reading on the meter when read back to the pc item if none rs or rr use small tiger on those that dr if still none rs or rr extend the list until new rses or rrs are seen if ri yet null the whole source list you only do this with goaloppose source list clean up ri 7get the big mid ruds in on the reliable item found if it rsed it will turn into an rr if big mid ruds are put in on it but even if it only still rsed proceed to next step if it vanishes without being listed extend goaloppose list determine whether terminal or oppterm 8determine if the ri is terminal or an oppterm just because an oppterm was indicated by the list question is reason an oppterm will come up if an exalted sounding item it is probably an oppterm if degraded reversal of the goal it is probably terminal as more ris accumulate on the line plot the less this is true it finally reverses use any tests released wrongwayto gives more mass to pc and reads less on meter list the ri 9list the ri as terminal who or what would ri oppose or as an oppterm who or what would oppose ri if pcs face darkens or mass pulls in or if he cant keep the question in mind or cant think of answers easily or if needle tightens etc quickly abandon and start new list with the reverse question but be very careful not to keep reversing an r3 list dont test list as in r2 be right in the first place and unload fast if youre wrong in the way its being opposed the more you change the way you oppose it the more mass youll pull up on the63pc reverseway oppose list also has rrs and rses on it complete ri list 10list 25 not 23 or 20 items beyond the last rs or rr if you can read tone arm be sure the ta action is out of the list but dont use ta action of onemillionth of division as an excuse to list the pc into the ground with overlisting the actual rule is 25 items beyond the last ta change and 25 beyond the last rr or rs never list less than 25 items beyond the last rr or rs if new rr or rs occurs go 25 beyond it ta action can be caused by protest decide arc break if the pc arc breaks after youve stopped listing the list must be extended as the arc break matter what the pc says comes from the item not being on the list this step is very easy just list and note down the rrs and rses seen on the meter as you list write fast get the item down correctly ask the list question only often enough to keep the pc listing when he stops you ask the question or ask it when he asks for it dont overlist r3 overlisting is brutally cruel dont underlist dont miss reads the sensitivity is set at about 3 on mark v and 4 on mark iv for listing the eye looks across the dial at the sheet beside the meter you move the sheet up as you write lefthand meters are available at hco ww for southpaws put your ta reads on your listing sheet each time ta changes check ri being listed 11check the item you are listingfrom if it ticks or fires dont do anything with the list youve just done continue it to new rr or rs and do 25 beyond it the item can read because the pc is protesting or invalidating but usually its just list more if item being listed from doesnt read proceed to 12 read new ri 12say to the pc i will now read the last rock slamming item on the list omit saying the above if the last item was an rr that didnt read if it did and an rr is above it your list is incomplete so do step 11 again if it didnt read which it shouldnt say i will now read the nexttolast rocket reading item on the list do so if it rrs or rses do step 11 again if it doesnt which it shouldnt say that doesnt read now say i will now read the last rocket reading item on the list do so if it reads rs or rr say that rocket reads or that rock slams this is the one that must read if it rred when being written down but rsed when read back to pc the only action necessary is to put in the big mid ruds on it and it will rr if the last rr noted on list doesnt read then say i will now read the item above it read the one above the one below the one 2 above the one 2 below as soon as you have one that fires say that reads now dont do anything else when you have the item look silently at the pc you will see him get lighter colored in the face the tone arm will blow down the meter will fire rocket reads as the pc cognites if pc is in doubt say thats your item the needle may go free only for space of 5 seconds if you go on into the next gpm the residual mass of the goal youve just blown is held in more by the next gpm than by odd bits so getting the next gpm is the most constructive and time saving action64end of steps ____________________ comments you mustnt let the pc represent rring or rsing item as he lists if he knows something rsed or rred he may repeat variations of it however interfere as little as possible with the listing by the pc dont force listing or prevent it mask your paper from the pc the frequency of the bank can get thrown awry by listing both ways or by doing list wrongwayto and getting reverse item but the upset is limited to the 25item rule on any one gpm where goofs have occurred you may have to extend lists due to finding tick step 11 all rules and steps still apply you just have to extend list as in step 11 more often the item doesnt start appearing earlier on the list and the rule of the last rr is never violated its just that the 25 items after the last rs or rr rule becomes unworkable and you keep finding that the item you are listing from still ticks so you have to extend step 12 remains true r3m is purely mechanical activity the better you know it the more exactly you follow it the more rr ris you get the less you figurefigure on it the more clears youll make 3m works because of 3m not because of auditing frills the only thing missing from these steps is the test battery to find if an ri is terminal or oppterm that is given on tapes and will be the subject of whole hco bulletin when an ri that is terminal is used as an oppterm wrongwayoppose more mass turns on and vice versa wrongly call an ri and its more mass darkening pc discomfort etc any ri that gives the pc unmistakable pain when said to the pc is terminal always the sen is not as good to determine with as many terms also turn on sen and pain dont test list every ri both ways in 3m that half kills the pc do it only in r2 be right before you list look the pc over after youve listed 10 items to see if the face has darkened or discolored watch out for tightening needle and list rightwayto only do 3m carelessly or wrong and youll wrap the pc around telephone pole crash be honest never fake read never falsify report somebodys future 200 trillion depends on that honesty if it reads say so if it doesnt read say so dont try to look good at the expense of pcs future life repair 3m by tding every ri on the line plot for reads if none are reading at all examine the lists for completeness if these are short or goofed complete them for an ri as per the rules if all else fails prepcheck the pc on auditing listing and do goaloppose list if that doesnt rr while being listed examine the repair steps above in that order this pc either had wrong goal and the auditor didnt know rocket read or the rr is hung up somewhere in the incomplete lists65the point is dont goof you can clear whole goal gpm while trying to repair some nutty departure from 3m youve got one clearing technique protect it ___________ two types of list remember there are two types of lists in r3m lthe goaloppose as covered in steps 17 this is called source list 2the ri oppose either way as covered in steps 813 this is called an ri list these follow different rules the item can be any rr or rs seen on goaloppose list the item is always the last rr on the ri oppose list realize that all goaloppose lists follow the rules of steps 17 and all ri oppose lists follow the rules of steps 813 there are exceptions if the list youve done as goaloppose source list deviates from the phenomena found in steps l7 youve goofed not 3m if the ri oppose list youve done doesnt contain the phenomena in steps 813 youve goofed not 3m example auditor finds on an ri oppose list that the ri was the third rr from the bottom thats wrong complete the list its that exact ___________ old goals with the advent of 3m the question of what to do about old goals or partially run goals or keyedout clears arises ___________ rule on old goals on anybody who has ever had goal found whether it was listed partially or fully run r3m just as though the goal had just been found if it doesnt rr now it will still give rrs on the source list from it it is all right to test list it if the goal was wrong it will not give rrs on the source goal opp list l ron hubbard

is finding too many ris without finding the goal the pc can be overwhelmed by ris if he or she has goal to align them to this is true of routine 2 every ri found is part of gpm finding too many more than 4 ris whether they rs or rr with routine 2 or routine 3m will narrow the pcs ability to rs and rr and will cause his or her rs or rr to vanish thereafter you will see rses or rrs on any list it is natural for the rs or rr to vanish on routine 2 or 3m item when it is opposed the rs and rr on goal vanish when the goal is run out what im talking about is the ability of the pc to rs and rr on

difficulties of finding goal with the pcs rr off is something i need not stress the right goal well prepchecked and seen to rr will turn on the pcs ability to rs and rr in general this is life and death data dont find too many r2 or 3m ris without finding goal the rr and rs ability does not vanish by failing to package up oppose and square away ris it only vanishes if you fail to find

and is not ready to run their attention gets so stuck on it they cant cooperate in finding the first gpms goal the thing to do is to list what goal might have been postulated after favorite goal bare words like to catch catfish had failed this moves pcs attention to later gpm and youll again get ta action on listing goals by favorite goal is meant the goal that the pc thought and fought was his but amount of prepchecking could make rr regularly most pcs on whom you cant find firing rring goal had favorite goal ask them what it was or when it went out and use it in the above five is the common ta read for pc who hasnt got goal and is stuck on the last now run out goal or on favorite too deep goal when the ta goes to 50 or thereabouts in listing goals and you cant get it to move and you havent got firing rring goal use the above method it applies to r2 and r3m pcs alike at any stage of case or in any gpm the wording can also be for pcs in first second or third gpm what goal might have failed before last goal was postulated various wordings can be used the intention being to get pcs attention off gpm and onto another gpm change in r3m step 13 as auditors can easily slide on by gpm into the next and miss the rocket firing blowdown or dont heed it this must be added to step 13 and never omitted if omitted you can turn off the pcs ability to rr matter how many up to 5 or 6 anyway gpms have been run add after just take pcs opinion for use in making tests now read the pcs goal three times carefully noticing whether it rrs or rses once out of three or not or if it ticks or falls if the pcs old goal only ticks or falls and the rr or rs has vanished then you70have passed the rocket firing blowdown when the goal closes to rr or r s you have only 5 or 6 or at the most 8 ris to go before free needle occurs on that goal keep finding ris so long as you can make the goal tick or fall with tiger drill the moment the goal ceases to react with tick or fall do this lfind new goal by ordinary listing or any means 2give the old goal an 18 button prepcheck do not tiger drill the old goal to get it to rs or rr as it will briefly and then fold up the new goal if it rses must be tiger drilled or prepchecked until it rrs this happens right after rocket firing blowdown or blow up in low ta cases to clear read but auditors miss it and often brief blowdown to clear read occurs with the old goal still in action the only test then is whether the old goal rrs or rses and then in your step 14 pick up the last rring item on the spiral staircase get it to fire and oppose it dont do goal oppose with the new goal if rring item now exists on the line plot then use the new goal for goal oppose list as in step 2 and proceed on down the steps of 3m if you always read the goal to the pc in step 13 and never go on opposing if the goal does not rr or rs you will never turn off pcs ability to rr or rs and the gpms will stay straight to keep on opposing and finding items after the old goal has ceased to rocket read or rs is to court real disaster this is the commonest auditor error in r3m to shoot on past the old gpm and go racing into the next with goal suddenly disaster rr

while listing and none is found when the list is complete technique to turn on pcs rs or rr will ever be found except one find the pcs goal for the 1st gpm what makes rrs rses vanish the thing which turns off pcs rr or rs is too many reliable items found without finding the pcs goal this can be done by life or by auditing as it can be done by life some raw meat pcs will not rr or rs it can be surmised that they have been set about in life by too many reliable items in full view for instance pc has an ri father an ri polttician an ri city his father is politician who insists on living in city these and others in his bank although undisclosed are yet restimulated and this pc will not be seen to rs or rr on listing and rs or rr is likely to be seen even if an actual ri is found there is use here for more forceful way to get ris the rules are very plain unvaried and uncompromising rule when pcs rs or rr is off stop trying to find more ris matter if you could find them the rr or rs would just go more thoroughly off if you did rule finding more ris will not turn an rr or rs back on there is danger signal in this the pcs rr or rs starts getting smaller item by item ri by ri get off fast let the last ri be the last one looked for if just one more is found bang rr or rs on this pc matter what is found in the way of ris72rule completing r2 or r3 package will not turn on the rr or rs however dont let the pc arc break on an incomplete list by starting one it may be possible to find one more ri that gives feeble slam but then youve had it however the picture is not all black pcs who were incapable of rr or rs have been subjected to 26 lists after with rr or rs seen and still have recovered restoring the rr rs the rockslam and rocket read are brothers pc will rockslam and yet not rocket read because the rocket read is the frailer brother pc going down hill toward rr or rs first loses his rr it now shows only as an rs then the rs vanishes too you cant prepcheck an rs into an rr on some pcs if the pc is on the way down toward rr or rs ordinarily however lot of rses can be prepchecked into rring if there is an rr there to fire an rr as it expires may become an rs the ability to rr then goes out first there is only one thing that restores the pcs ability to rr or rs rule the only thing that will restore the ability of pc to rr or rs is to find the pcs first or next gpm goal naturally it is far easier to find rocket read on goal before the pc loses his ability to rocket read it is far from impossible however to find goal on pc that is incapable of rring or rsing and far from impossible to get it to rr by prepcheck as the pc will always rr again on the right goal just listing goals eases the condition of rr or rs and once an rr or rs that has been shut off is found again on the goal the pcs rr or rs is on again on everything on some pcs the goal is so charged that you will find an immediate rocket firing blow down of the ta you get long rocket reads one after another as the pc realizes it is the goal this is particularly true on some pcs who have had lot of ris found in such case you more find the goal and prepcheck it than you have to find another for the next gpm all items count any item found by 3dxx 3ga 3gaxx or even earlier for running processes on are all part of the gpm and must be put on the pcs line plot it doesnt matter how they were found or by whom or if they were checked out or not they belong on the line plot and can be used to find goals rule put any item ever found on the pc by any process on the line plot every one will add up to goal73therefore even bad items items that were found from representing rsing items backwards oppose items all belong on the line plot it is understood here that there was some kind of an assessment whatever was found by any kind of an assessment since 1954 belongs on the line plot and can be used to help find goals four ris in r210 212 and 212a you are allowed only four ris before the pcs goal must bc found if the rs or rr is seen to get smaller from one item to the next abandon 212 and begin 3m goal finding at once when you find the pcs goal and when you are adding up and prepchecking the first gpm you will discover that everything found on the pc for the last nine years was part of his first or another gpm so old auditing paid off in view of this on old pcs its safest to go for the goal as your first auditing action you can use any item ever found to help get that goal on raw meat pcs get couple rls if you can by r212 and use that to help find the goal with luck one will even rr but find the goal before opposing it summary this discovery of what monitors the rs and rr of pc is very important one ive worked ceaselessly on this since the first of the year and finally isolated it even 3rd goal clear isnt immune to losing his rs and rr if you keep finding scores of items with goal or wrong goal so treat the rs and rr with respect when found and find the pcs goal when he wont rs or rr and youve got it made you dont need better meter only the pcs goal this rules out unlimited r210 212 and 212a on pc but these give you the two or four ris necessary for

through gpm with pc there are many gpms four of them take one back about 20 trillion at rough estimate some cover 2 12 trillion some as much at guess as 15 trillion the last one formed may be only partially formed and cover as little as 60000 years the first one encountered then by the auditor may be the least standard but only at its top the bottom ris of the first gpm will be standard this is the old story of the hardest part of the case is the beginning this is standard gpm the first gpm encountered is just the same but may be missing its top ris those closest to pt see diagram on next page75 76the above plot with dates added is the way your gpm line plot should look there may be more items and in the first gpm you contact there may be less from the top down but this synthetic plot will assist you in knowing what to do with your preclear note that the first oppterm in complete gpm is the most likely to be successful form of goal ri and the first terminal at the top the least successful ri terminal of the goal this will keep you from making errors in selecting out the first ri you contact rule the first terminal contacted will be found to be the most degraded form of the goal of that gpm and the first oppterm an exalted form of the goal of course in first gpm that is not fully complete the above rule may not hold true but this is an exception first oppterm found is usually better expression of the goal even in the first gpm than the first terminal in all subsequent gpms second third fourth there are exceptions to the above rule it is very upsetting to the pc and the bank to oppose the first thing you find in gpm wrongwayto or to oppose any ri wrongwayto for that matter but even this doesnt change the rules note that the ri happy people in the next gpm does not fit the goal to scream the real time to get the next goal after to scream is when you have found happy people if you go more than 4 ris into the next gpm after you saw to scream cease all reads after the goal to scream you are putting the pc in real danger as the rs and rr may shut off on the pc thus making it very hard to find the next goal however if you try to find the next goal after to scream with the pc further along than the ri reprover in the above plot you wont find the next goal the ta will go up to 5 and the pc will muddle about giving you goals which wont rr out of the remaining unfound items of the goal to scream if you find ris into the next gpm after ri happy people without first finding its goal not only will the pcs ability to rr and rs eventually vanish about 12 ris later than ri happy people but goal oppose list done on to scream may give you the goal of the gpm two down from that of to scream and you will have skipped whole gpm the one with happy people at the top now youve missed the goal of whole gpm although you have half its items and my wont that poor pc arc break rule the further the pc goes into gpm without the goal the harder it is to get the goal and the more likely it is that youll get the next gpms goal and miss the goal of the gpm you have items for trouble77what you can say with certainty is the more you depart from sop 3m the more trouble youll have dont invite trouble by thinking and worrying too much worry is the occupa tional hazard of the auditor doing 3m the worry rule rule so long as the pc is happily going along and youre finding goals and ris on schedule keep calm start worry ing and correcting when the pc is arc breaky and looks bad example auditor finds the rr on the list on reading back to the pc 5 items above the last rr marked on the list there is rr on the list after the rring item found pc is happy with item found it rred it was the last rr found on nulling how the auditor saw an rr 5 items later is caused by the pc continuing to think about the one 5 above while he lists the pc is actually representing the item the auditor finds hence it looks like list item 5 down fired there was fire on the list item in nulling what should the auditor do well the pc is cheerful about the rring item that was found there is rr on nulling after it other item on the list now fires so its the pcs item bona fide ri the above is excess worry it will all come out all right as it follows the senior rules but there is another extreme too little worry example the auditor finds happy people in sequence on the above plot the pc out of pride says thats terminal the auditor carelessly lists it without any careful test the pc starts looking black the auditor keeps on going the pc gets flu the auditor plunges on without correcting the item finds 4 more without goal found runs out of rr ris blank lists does goal oppose on to scream lands in the gpm after next beyond the one of happy people runs out of all rrs and rses on the pc cant hold the pc insession pulls missed withholds and prepchecks pc and auditor together dive off highest bridge on realizing 3m doesnt work and case is hopeless joke the auditor didnt start worrying when the pc started looking and feeling bad kept adding more errors to an unhealed arc break and bang r245 rule the more you do after an arc break or pc upset without correcting the exact reason for the upset the harder the upset is to correct routine 3m has terrific wallop its arc breaks are fantastic when it starts to go wrong stop and set it right but if it isnt going wrong dont try to set it right keep going after you have done few gpms your heart will settle back into your chest and youll lose that hunted look so for the auditor the start of auditing 3m is the worst as in the pc the start of the case is the worst fortunately gpms are carbon copies with terrific precision of construction do78one and youll have done the actions youll do on all so learn the rules right and make clears warning auditors who are not well trained make errors and then in failing try to correct by inventing new rules and procedures we have already had 3m where the ris did not have to fire to be used we have had several other brands remember this clear is clear the attainment of clear lies on the other side of gpm man has been unable to crack the riddle of the bank until now we have the rules 3m makes clears there are only about 20 errors you can make there is only 1 path through the gpm it has been found the myth of oneshot clear has been exploded there is easier way to clear so learn the rules well dont think youve found exceptions to the rules you havent banks got built that way thetans are freed this way study 3m like youve never studied anything

question above longer reads on the meter check the question for read about every five items when it longer ticks make sure it isnt ticking from protest or decided add five more items test read it if it still doesnt tick end list if it does continue list null this list by elimination starting at the top of the list calling each item three times and marking in or out until only 1 or 2 are in put in lefthand buttons on remaining items one should now rocket read that is your top oppterm ri this source list is source list the reliable item may appear anywhere on it consider all lists of 3m as source lists now in r212 ri oppose lists still exist this most likely list will probably be less than hundred items long it may be only 10 items long if its longer the question is being protested which makes the question read81this gives you the top of the gpm hitherto hard to get and usually missing in case repairs i had to get clever on this one everybody was missing the top of gpms until case was repaired note the exact listing rules for this most likely list will be published in subsequent hcob take whatever you get that is an unmistakable top oppterm see line plot hcob 13 mar 63 ii the end of gpm where it is the most screamish use it and go on with the following steps after you find 3 or 4 ris downwards go back and see if the ri you found for top oppterm ticks when read to pc on meter if it does now dont throw away the ris youve just gotten just extend the most likely list and null what you extended take the ri you now find for top oppterm and use it as per steps below you will find you are going up now higher in the gpm complete it upwards until you reach the real top of the oppterm column then resume with the former last ri lower in the gpm where you left off going down and continue to the bottom of the gpm exactly as in these steps below the toughest part of the gpm to get is the top end and as its the one most dramatized by the pc it is the most important in his estimation if you dont get it all at the top the pc will drag that mass down through the lower gpms and things will be less real on the lower ris and harder to find the only time you will have difficulty is when few ri gpm extends into present time up from the first gpm you contact that means goal above the pcs first goal you can also have trouble when this most likely listing system is used if the pcs first gpm is only half lived through and has its top missing never formed this will become apparent as the pc lists and tests will show you have terminal you can in such case cope by using what you find but realizing you have terminal on the most likely list this is rare so dont invite it the status of pcs first gpm can be established by meter questions do you have goal closer to present time or above this if the pcs first gpm meaning the first one contacted by the auditor always not the earliest one on the track is truncated missing at the top the remaining gpms in the bank will still be of standard size and content even if you have trouble finding the top of truncated gpm still dont do goaloppose list if most likely doesnt work on truncated gpm try least likely version 3compare and test ri note if getting ri blew down ta ask pc if this is the item if it turns on more mass ask how it relates to the goal check goal for read read next question to pc as terminal then as an oppterm determine which one gives least mass and use that way of oppose however if this ri found in step 2 is anything but an oppterm you have bypassed an item or over or underlisted or its not pcs goal also the first gpm can have been only partially formed and the top oppterm does not easily express the goal in which case youll get terminal if so youll know by test 4obtain conditional top terminal using question who or what would oppose top oppterm just found list check the question about every five items given immediately that it longer ticks add five more test ri and question again for tick if it still doesnt tick null it if it does82get five more etc null either by calling each item 3 times in sequence until only one is left and put in left hand buttons on it suppress careful of failed to reveal or by calling only the rrs seen on listing each one one time and put in lefthand buttons on it as all lists in r3m are now all to be considered source lists the former method is safer but harder on the pc these are very short lists all ri oppose lists are they may be as small as 10 items certainly seldom more than 20 length is determined by the needle tick of the question read to pc vanishing if you overlist you will miss an ri err with bypassed item do the next one wrong way oppose and send the pc into another gpm the whole error in listing is bypassing items by over or underlisting that the listing question ticks means the reliable item is not yet on the list or there are more items needed to discharge the tick that the listing question ceases to tick means the reliable item is either on the list or will be in the next three or four given by the pc 5 compare and test ri ask the pc if item turned on more mass ask pc if its the item ask pc if ri found opposes the one it was listed from ask pc how it relates to goal test ri for term or oppterm by asking next listing question one way and then the other who or what would oppose who or what would ____oppose the one that turns on the least mass is it this is however terminal and if it isnt the list you did to find it was little too long or little too short find an earlier ri on it or extend it for another ri 6 obtain next oppterm list who or what would ri just found oppose null list by elimination or by rrs as above find ri always read the ri you are listing from and then the question you are listing on doing this jogs the question to read again when it might not if the read wont go off the ri you are listing from it is surely arrived at after an ri has been bypassed redo the list it came off from837 compare and test ri ask pc if ri turned on more mass ask pc if its pcs item ask pc if ri is opposed by terminal it was listed from ask pc how ri relates to goal test goal test ri for term or oppterm 8 obtain next terminal list who or what would oppose _____ri just found complete by testing question for reads null by elimination or by rrs seen on listing obtain ri test ri youre listing

or oppterm it should be terminal 10 continue steps 6 7 8 9 above in sequence 11toward bottom of the gpm 20 or 30 number is guess ris from top you will find and this is not guess terminal somebody or something with the goal pcs goal or somebody with the goal pcs goal there will be an oppterm then the goal pcs goal then an oppterm then just the pcs goal to whatever this last ri is called the goal as an ri there we stop all actions as above the pc can know that these pat bottom gpm ris exist he can even be shown model line plot in misguided enthusiasm the pc can put all of them on the list at once only the right one in sequence will rr and if hes been premature in putting them down84they wont fire so dont worry about it just be sure you get those ris see hcob 13 mar 63 for the pattern 12 list final list when you definitely arrive honestly at the goal as an ri to scream to whatever just the goal all by itself you will find that although the goal has ceased to rr this goal as an ri still has an rr on it now the list we do from this is the final list of that gpm and it works like the old goal oppose list and it is the only place we now do goal oppose list its long list the only long list we now do the list wording is exactly and only this who or what would pcs goal oppose who or what would to scream oppose we ignore any complaints from the pc that he or she cant answer the question even hint there are some goals it might oppose as well as items this is listed to fifty beyond the last rr or rs on the list and until the question longer ticks this list will have on it the next goal when complete and so i found way to give you the next goal without any fumbling it may be very long it must have goals on it as well as items dont do it until the line plot is complete or youll get an item off it not goal 13 null the final list null by elimination the rrs seen on listing will have real bearing on the final ri so dont just read off the rrs chances are the final item the goal wont rr while listing and wont rr until the list is completely nulled find item it should be goal the goal of the next gpm 14 smooth out last gpm as soon as the goal of the next gpm is found make sure it fires nicely but dont get pc involved in it dont start to find ris in it yet or youll have to go on with next gpm and be trying to make an ot before you make clear 15 inspect old line plot each gpm should have its own line plot make sure pcs line plot is complete particularly at the top 16 inspect ris85read over each ri on old line plot to see if one ticks include those on the plot that obviously belong to some other gpm if one is found ticking take the list off which it came not the list listed from it and renull it or extend it somewhat and renull new heretofore missing ri will turn up oppose it gently short list and in short do steps 6 7 8 9 on it depending for sequence on whether its terminal or an oppterm until the rr vanishes be careful not to leap into new gpm by overlisting or opposing backwards wrongway oppose lands you in different gpm usually if during inspection you find firing ri on the line plot rocket reading even though it was opposed the rule in the above paragraph still applies it was backwards oppose but the fault is that an ri was bypassed on an earlier list find the bypass and oppose it in this patch up or patching up gpm done by earlier versions you will find list even though rrs were seen on listing suddenly fail to give up an ri thats usually because the ri is already found the list has been tied back into the already existing ris put everything you find rightly or wrongly on the line plot theyre all the pcs items when the line plot is all smooth and looks like the 13 mar 63 hcob model go to next step however if the auditor has already found and listed other goals and the pc has 3 or 4 incomplete gpms the line plots will have become interdependent and straightening them up depends on running the last goal found as per this hcob finding the next goal but ris into its gpm and then going back for smoothout of the others danger only discomfort and more frequent arc breaks attend the condition where the auditor tried to make an ot before making clear just do the goal with the biggest read complete its plot but dont find ris in new goal found from it and work around as you can in the old mess until each gpm is complete 17 prepcheck old goal only when youve done all these steps on gpm do an 18 button prepcheck on the old goal counterbutton as it may be the next goal get in the bmrs on listing and on auditing on gpms 18

with hcob 14 mar 63 arc breaks handling of and assessments for the cause of them and correct accordinglythe arc break assessment is always right bypassed items even bypassed goals and gpms wont kill the pc i know ive been in every crossfire that goals and gpms could produce as pc and im still alive even if occasionally frayed so stop worrying and do good job and do what you consider correct not what the pc insists upon and youll win through with your pc i admit it takes high level of courage to audit routine 3m but its the only safe road out from aberration _____________ in nulling single list that an item appears earlier on list is guarantee it doesnt appear later in the bank than the one you want _____________ dont fail to let pc have his ris and goals that they arent the ris or goals of the gpm you have to work doesnt make them not his develop the h factor its yours but its not due quite yet this is undoubtedly your goal on one that stayed in but isnt it but we have to find the gpm closer to where were working thats your ri all right but we need the consecutive one to the last we found _____________ in case repair use the above rundown to repair r3m2 when you run out of ris suddenly the rule is to find the item on the line plot that reacts on the meter renull or extend the list it came from and locate the bypassed item and proceed with that as though you hadnt found anything else _____________ if you encounter an ri that given to the pc turns on more mass extend or renull the list it came from and get another ri that doesnt but dont be too harsh with this rule some ris do turn on bit more mass particularly when the top of gpm has not been found _____________ if you find an ri that doesnt belong in this gpm put it on the line plot realize it came from wrongway oppose see if the list the ri you just opposed came from doesnt have bypassed item on it if so dont bother to rightway oppose the ri you wrongway opposed use the earlier ri and go on87the reason you cant find an ri on list even though you saw rrs on listing is because the ri for that list has already been found or your list is just trifle short if you suddenly find rrs seen on listing list an earlier item was wrong bypassed or wrongway opposed locate and go on if rr on items is getting smaller beware of having wrong goal or having gone into gpm you have goal for dont find more ris until you find whats wrong only finding ris for which you have goal will shut off the rr and rs finding the goal for them will turn the rr and rs back on _____________ if you have to put question mark after the list rrs and rses you are nulling with too low sensitivity setting put up the sensitivity until you can see whats happening or get one of the new listing meters _____________ if pc cognites on an item as you list and it rrs it must rr to be an ri say very good test the question for read if the question is clean read the item to the pc to make sure it rrs if the question still reads say im sure youre right however give few more so i can get the tick off this question do so test the question and read the pc the ri if it doesnt read put lefthand buttons in on it if it still doesnt read find the one that does pc wont arc break unless you give him an item that doesnt rr _____________ there are bonus packages in r3m if two items rr or rs on the list the list is incomplete complete it until question doesnt tick _____________ we will longer consider there are two kinds of lists due to the traveling nature of the rr on the list the last rr always reads but it may be after the ri we need to avoid bypassed items consider every list source list the ri can appear anywhere on it considering them all source lists ensures your finding the ri that should rr and in sequence _____________ the main danger in r3m is not wrongway oppose you can tell that fairly easily the danger lies in bypassing ris the way these get bypassed is to overlist or underlist _____________88if the rr seen on consecutive ris found is getting smaller as you find more you have the wrong goal for the gpm youre in either get into the right gpm or less preferably find the goal of the one youre working you can only get into the wrong gpm by having wrong goal in the first place or by bypassing ris resulting in opposing an ri wrong way to and getting thrown into another gpm or by moving down into the next gpm after the old goal has ceased to tick _____________ goal rr improves as you find successive ris right up to the moment it begins to occasionally r s and rr as marked on the line plot of hcob 13 mar 63 if goal doesnt read better on the meter after you find the top oppterm and terminal theres something wrong with that goal if the goal was wrong and the ris you found did rr use the oppterm to list goals from and the terminal to list goals against what might be the goal of oppterm and what goal would terminal be an overt against _____________ watch overshooting into the gpm below the one you should be working in you can miss the low ris somebody with the goal etc and plow on into the gpm below it without its goal after dozen or so ris without having the goal the pcs ability to rs and rr will shut off to be restored only when the goal for them is found _____________ tell your pc the best way in the world to commit thetancide is to selfaudit or self list on r3m or to dope the line plot in advance if the pc thinks of goals or items out of session make the pc write them down and bring the list in but discourage it _____________ i saw the troubles you were having and have been researching swiftly to remedy it with more positive version of r3m its getting simpler it cant get much easier l ron hubbard founder89hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 6 april 1963 central orgs missions r3m2 what you are trying to do in clearing the final object of the auditor in clearing is to find goals and reliable items until all goals and reliable items have been found and each gpm is complete and all gpms are discharged now there are many ways to do this but finding and discarding the pcs ris is not one of them the more you get hold of ris and say thats not it the more miserable your pc will feel and the less clearing youll get done you can actually fumble and grope and get wrong ris and fall on your head but if you continue to get ris and put them on the line plot the pc will eventually get them all the length of time it takes to make multigoal clear does not depend upon the care with which rring ris are found it depends upon the number of rring ris and goals found only the comfort of the pc depends upon the care with which rring ris are found it is mechanical proposition there is just so much charge on case the case recovers when the charge is released charge is manifested on the emeter in the rocket reads contained in goals and their ris charge vanishes when ris are found and paired if you understand this much will come plain to you the idiocy of giving the pc an item that doesnt rr lies in the fact that it doesnt bleed off charge not that it will soon lead to an arc break the question is only how many reliable items and goals can be found on this case not how much time can be spent repairing the case smooth run to clear would consist of the auditor finding the exact top of gpm running out the exact ris in it getting the next goal and prepchecking the goal of the bank just cleared all by 3m2 but with auditors and the pcs green and worried is this ideal always obtainable the answer is i am afraid the following is far more likely to be the case goal is found lot of ris are run out of its gpm the next goal is found it is discovered then that half the ris found in the old bank belonged in this new bank the new goal is run and many ris are found the auditor then finds the 3rd goal and many ris in it the auditor now discovers the top of the first bank was missing and goes back to find it he does so and discovers goal above the first goal he finds it and gets ris in it then to his horror finds there is bank two above the first bank found he finds that goal and gets ris in it and discovers the pcs present time he also finds that everything the pc was groaning about is contained in the bank that was closest to present time he cleans this up and then goes back down to discover that although the goals of the lower banks longer read he had never found half the ris in any one of them he remedies this and only then in succeeding banks finds he can smoothly carry on cleaning up each gpm fully as he goes90there is nothing wrong with this when we had r212 it worked well then we got 212a and wasted fantastic amounts of time repairing 212 and we had few gains to show for it its the same with 3m and 3m2 the pc is far from comfortable with the auditor battering around missing gpms and goals the pc will swear hed rather be dead but the message is hell get clear if they keep at it on the basis of finding ris and goals as they can and therell come day when the pc will really shine do perfect clearing job if you can if you cant just find goals and ris and just keep going and youll still achieve the same end the error is not to find lots of rring ris and goals per unit of auditing time keep your records well just barrel along sounds barbarous and youll have to get used to arc breaks but the point is clearing can be done that way clearing cant be done by finding an ri getting nervous about it abandoning it finding another ri abandoning it fooling around whole sessions trying to find the top of gpm when whole panorama of ris exist lower down find goals and ris get the gpm as complete as you can but not at the expense of not finding ris yes it sounds barbarous and it is but it works remember youll have arc breaks assess for why repair it and keep going these are the only rules you must not violate 1an ri must rr b cause ta blowdown and c turn on minimum of mass 2if you find more than dozen ris which dont match the goal youre working on the pcs rr and rs will shut off 3precise legible records and line plots must be kept 4if the pc arc breaks do an arc break assessment and repair what you find dont do what the pc says take the pcs data but act only after an arc break assessment 5dont prepcheck goal unless you know you have all the ris in that gpm and have done the final goal oppose list to the next gpm 6a list must be long enough to give only one rr on nulling and rs it must be short enough not to bypass items it must be long enough to have the needle clean on nulling it must be short enough not to get dirty needle through protest and collapsed mass now just how you list or find goals or repair is broader study all stemming from the above when you gain experience youll be able to come closer to perfect meanwhile dont stall around nervously find goals and ris learn to find an ri every 30 minutes of auditing time and then improve that speed there is certain exact quantity of charge on case its contained in goals and ris every goal you find deducts from that quantity every ri you find and oppose deducts from that quantity the more accurately you do it the less time youll waste on arc breaks and fumbling91accuracy itself is only important because it saves auditing time but accuracy can become vice which gives one goals or ris found i know i have said do it right thats fair enough but im now saying do it as right as you can but do it at the start of his case the pc hasnt clue therefore he lists longer his confront is at its poorest therefore he fails to list the obvious green auditor on 3m2 does not really believe it is all as pat as made out therefore he always thinks the pc is different eventually both auditor and pc get the hang of the bank they learn that the bottom five ris on to catch catfish will be catfish catcher somebody with the goal to catch catfish somebody or something with the goal to catch catfish the goal to catch catfish and to catch catfish the goal as an ri only what each opposes is variable they learn that the top terminal will be something like somebody who cant catch catfish and that the three highest oppterms from the top down will probably be catfish catchers catching catfish and people who catch catfish and they know that there may be ris term or oppterm in this goal like catching catfish the inability to catch catfish people who wont catch catfish etc and they know then that only the low oppterms and the middle ground are in serious question give the auditor and pc the next goal and theyll list away as usual but directly at what should be there and it goes like whirlwind early on without this experience both auditor and pc grope overlist fumble about so the first gpm run has the longest lists and the most errors clearing is not easy on the pc its not easy on new auditor and there will be times when both rue the day they ever got into the gpm but if they keep going finding goals and their ris faint streaks of predawn gray will begin to gleam ahead and then with perseverance day will break upon higher plateau than man has ever dreamed of before the mystics spoke of the abyss they said that in trying to cross it many fell into the darkness without knowing it they spoke of the goals problem mass the buddhists spoke of nirvana without knowing it they spoke of vanishing forever into the gpm nirvana they had become completely overwhelmed lacking meters and map we are scientologists we wont fall into the abyss and we wont join nirvana we have meters and map we know the rules and the way this is the greatest adventure of all time clearing the way is strewn with the skeletons and skulls of those who have tried over the past trillenia the bottom of the abyss is glutted with failures nirvana is choked with the overwhelmed to say it is not dangerous way would be false but it is not dangerous if you keep going finding goals and ris reducing the charge

who or what would be most likely to achieve this goal for thefirst gpm contacted is proving to be longer on most pcs than was expected list this list by the rules of the old goaloppose source list which is to say 50 items past the last rr or rs you will find that on subsequent goals the list is shorter but it still must be complete 50 past last rr or rs list is as long as it has to be to have clean needle and only one rr on the list on the most likely list at the beginning and the goaloppose list at the end of the gpm done after it is complete the 50 past the last rr and rs serves best the rr can be anywhere on source list when you x out an item in nulling be sure the item did not react on the needle to do otherwise is dishonest in the extreme x means reaction on needle overlisting causes dirty needle through protest and decide underlisting causes dirty needle and lots of items to react there are then still 2 kinds of lists for each gpm 1the source list 2the ri oppose list there are only two of these source lists athe most likely list at the start of each gpm done before any ris are found and bthe goal as an ri oppose list at the bottom of the gpm done after all the ris of the gpm are found93the most likely list results if completed in high oppterm of the gpm from this the remaining ris are found it is not absolutely necessary to do most likely list if you can get the top of the gpm by doing ri oppose lists from within the gpm itself common occurrence in second and onward gpms the goal as an ri oppose list at the bottom is done only after all the ris in the gpm are found it results in finding the goal of the next gpm between these two are the ri oppose lists the two source lists are long 50 items past the last rr or rs and the ri will be anyplace on them usually an item that did not rr when listed but rrs on nulling the ri oppose lists are relatively short they tend to be longer in the first and second gpms than in later ones but they are never very long they go perhaps 20 30 items in the first gpm fewer in the second as few as 5 or 10 in the third and remaining gpms the ri oppose lists are listed until neither the ri being listedfrom or the question tick this is the actual listing rule just list and test the ri being listed from and the question frequently about every 5 items you can add 5 for good measure or not overlisting an ri oppose list tends to bypass ris underlisting tends to bypass ris it is perfectly all right on an overlisted list to take an earlier rr than the last one seen on listing sometimes the pc overlists and goes around the corner to the next ri this is particularly true in later gpms then you have the actual ri earlier than the last rr it is more usual however to extend the list bit when this happens as the pc will put the first ri back on now after the next ri the next ri will not now rr and only the pcs actual ri will rr sometimes pcs argue and get arc broke when their ri occurs earlier than the last rr this however is an infallible sign of an incomplete list it needs two or three even nonreading items to complete it and the pc will put back his insistedupon ri which now is the last rring item on the list in all listing nulling and taking rring items off any list certain amount of judgment is required it cant all be machinelike but that judgment doesnt include two rrs or one rr and one rs firing at the same time on list nor does it include giving the pc an item that read once on careful of nor does it include not trying to get the right ri skillful auditor becomes an adept pilot in listing nulling finding the pcs ri and giving it to the pc and in learning to become one an auditor makes mistakes thats okay youll also invent some shortcuts thats okay too as youll soon find that dropping the safety factors costs you more auditing time than you save and that the innovations94introduced come hard against the unalterable rules of listing and nulling then youll be happy to do it right do it well and pick up speed that will list whole later gpm in single session all by the rules dopeoff and hard listing if the pc dopes off while listing its missed withhold however the missed withhold can also be that the question or item being listed from is wrong or the item is not on the list if pc doesnt list brightly and easily on any list the pc has missed withholds or has protested or decided out or is being listed on wrong question or from wrong item always try to pull missed withholds first if pc dopes off or isnt listing well consider the 3m mechanics that might be causing the dopeoff second if youre listing an ri wrongwayto however the trouble is more than boiloff the pc just cant do it without being whipped so dont force pc to list find out why he cant nulling lists the two source lists are nulled by elimination say the item three times mark it in or out when the end of the list is reached go back over the items left in go over all items on the list not just those that

waterbuck x willow wand x game warden x the wind rr if source list is incomplete not only will the needle be dirty but it nulls like this catfish x tiger rr x waterbuck x willow wand x game warden x the wind you must not have more than one rs or rr on any list source or ri oppose this is invariable if you find an rr on source list you need only go on until you are sure there is other rr or rs on

remainder of the ris of the goal will be much more variable the crossover the area in the center of gpm is the crossover this means the ris which cause the pc to become an opponent of his own goal in at least one term and oppterm the reason for the shift of attitude is plain pcs most easily find the crossover and are liable to try to give the crossover of some other gpm if you bypass an ri in the one youre working the usual how does this ri relate to to test is almost always adequate however the crossover is only important as guide as to whether or not you are still in the gpm otherwise the middle items are not easily detected as belonging to the goal the relationship of goals only the first goal on the whole track is postulated without reason contrary to what we earlier believed all other goals are closely related pcs goals listed out in chronological order first on the track to the one in pt first102goal contacted give story this makes it easy to locate consecutive goals once youre in the gpms the arrows above give the optimum order with which to find items the banks are lived in reverse order to the arrows above there are many more ris to an actual gpm than those given above particularly later on the track closer to pt i have given here just essential ris which show the ones always there the crossover and the general picture given these plots if your pc just cant seem to get the top of bank and most likely lists are difficult get him to figure out the top oppterm from these plots or more crudely give it to him and let him work with it until you find the rring top oppterm dont waste time in clearing after the third or fourth bank the pc will be listing by plot anyway behavior of the goal is given for only one plot but is similar in all line plots l ron

form of the goal there are neither terminals nor oppterms that contain entirely different words the lower terminals have slightest variation in any bank the upper oppterms contain slightest variation from the pattern in any bank only the middle ground of the gpm may vary but always has some form of the goal itself if you make an error in following this pattern or fail to get the right ri your pcs

the pcs attention while listing to the form of the inevitable reliable item providing it can be predicted this is new departure in scientology auditing it could be dangerous one if carried into directing goals or routine 212 ris it applies therefore only to the inevitable reliable items to be found in routine 3 line plots it is so much more upsetting to the pc and clearing to miss the right ri that the practice is excused indeed it must be done the law governing this is pcs ability to confront is directly proportional to the amount of charge removed from the gpms the pcs ability to confront is not propor tional to the amount of confronting done in gpm there are only few things to be careful of in directive listing 1that the charge if any of the question being listed from is also listed off even when the right item has been directed on to the list 2that the auditor does not let himself be persuaded out of getting the right ri on the list 3that the directed ri does actually fire with an rr when called regardless of mid ruds or td 4that the directed ri is the right ri for that list 5that that part of the line plot not common to all cases may not be directed on to list by the auditor definitions directed reliable item is one guided on to the list by the auditor it is one derived from the form of the gpm common to all cases _____________ how to direct listing the auditor knows that in every gpm except truncated ones which being the 1st gpm from present time may have the top missing the majority of the ris are common to all gpms see hco bulletin of 17 april 1963 complete gpm pattern and subsequent line plots most of these particularly top and bottom groups never change therefore the auditor with the pcs help determines what the inevitable ris should be confirms it with the meter gets the charge off the question by getting some more items on the list and gives the pc the108right ri for that point in the bank or works with the pc to obtain that exact ri the first command that starts new gpm being audited is give the ultimate achievement of your goal in noun form get several of these nouns one will consistently rr thats the pcs ri give it to the pc do not overlist do not compromise with these rules the top terminal is then gotten by the question who or what would oppose noun form you just got get the right one by suggesting its probable form to the pc get the charge off the question do not overlist you must stop pcs listing on ri oppose lists and check the question you then go through the proper 3m2 steps for tests etc give pc the right top terminal that has been found list who or what would top terminal oppose suggest it to the pc as it is known make sure the 2nd top oppterm gets on the list etc etc _____________ the problem if you dont select for the pc the inevitable ris as you list them the chances of the pc getting them in the first 3 gpms is so remote as to be nonexistent the pc will go through agony if theyre missed and youll lose his or her rr as this is the roughest part of the gpm further their undischarged mass will be carried down into all additional auditing and the pc will not lose the mass and may gain weight and youve set the stage for arc breaks galore further this gives you the rightness of the goal at once with messup of the pc by reason of long listing if the obvious top oppterm isnt there it either isnt the goal or is truncated gpm _____________ directing ris an auditor must become expert at preselecting ris for any given goal study hcob 17 apr 63 complete gpm pattern and subsequent issues editors

protest their top terminal quite often as discreditable so its discreditable does it rr and discharge the top oppterm if so its the pcs give it to the pc and the pc will cognite and the ta will blow down if its still wrong youll soon run out of rr as you find more ris there are gpm ris above the top terminal or oppterm as shown on line plots for any given gpm but there may be another full gpm

east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 23 april 1963 missions routine 3m2 handling the gpm goals problem masses may be handled in several ways the only things that establish the best way are lspeed of finding ris 2accuracy of ris found 3completeness of gpms ris 4correct order of ris 5pcs morale 6easiness of the method on the pc 7ease of handling by the auditor 8resulting state of clearness of the pc immediately discounted then are those methods which put speed of finding ris second for it will be found that the slower you find ris the more the remaining factors above will suffer i have been over or through as pc almost any method of auditing gpm there could be and the one factor that stands out to both as an auditor and pc as well as case supervisor is that idling about trying to get it all now results in the destruction of both auditor and pc morale and consumes unrewarding session time why the law that covers this is pcs ability to confront is directly proportional to the amount of charge removed from the gpms the pcs ability to confront is not proportional to the amount of confronting done in gpm this is very important rule in practice it means get all the ris you can discharged as fast as you can it also could mean get all the gpms discharged as fast as you can but if this last means discharging partially many gpms it ceases to be true as the pc will go into hopeless confusion in the remaining charge it does mean ldischarge the gpm you are working on as fast as you can regardless of skipping some ris regardless of reaching the top first1102dont keep scrapping ris found just because there may be some higher than those you are finding later 3dont let the pc flounder hopelessly in some area of the gpm that cant be gotten just yet 4keep line plot of each block of ris you find join them up later you have pattern you will be able to follow it easily most of the time but where you cannot get the pattern to go right jump to another lower part of the pattern where it will go right and go on with it you will find it isnt the wrongness of the pattern that gives you trouble its the inability of the pc to confront answer remove charge because the pc arc breaks on missed ris tell the pc were going to miss some items those already found are valid were going to get some lower ones and get the charge off and then come back for what weve missed the pc wont arc break on the contrary his morale will increase in most cases and then of course with the gpm shot full of holes the pc can confront better and the second pass through the gpm will get some of the missing ones and the third pass will assemble the lot the only things to avoid are getting the pc confused by too many shifts and dizzy through invalidation of existing ris already found the rules for this method of handling are these lalways start at the top or as close to the top as you can and go down earlier in time through the gpm this is true for every pass through the gpm 2dont let the pc flounder endlessly searching if it seems all you can do is flounder go lower to another known part by pattern of the bank and get going again 3realize that the final pass through will find all ris rring again as they are put in proper order on the final line plot the rr travels from top oppterm to top terminal and right on down to the goal as an ri terminal this rr has to be passed through the complete finished bank as the last action of assembly of the final line plot even though they rr again when put in their right places they are mostly discharged by the original finding 4use all sections found already as blocks of ris dont try to find them again the rr has to be passed through them as they are joined up and they may get corrected but dont throw away sections found 5the pc suffers from charge on the bank not from significance of ris significance gives the details of the aberration but its magnitude is established by charge 6it can be assumed that two fast passes through gpm and final assembly pass will do more to clear the gpm than one painfully slow fumbling pass where the pcs efforts are always getting invalidated1117all ris must rr when found or charge comes off see note below 8the pattern of gpm is used throughout to help guide the pc 9do not redo block of ris already found until the whole gpm has been covered at least once through _____________ handling the goals problem masses you will almost never get the gpm that is nearest pt as the pcs first goal found this goal is usually the most offerable goal by its own wording very secret or very blatantly offerable type wordings are found first forced into view by their top terminals or oppterms therefore do not assume ever that the pcs first goal is the pt goal it almost never is the actual pt area goal contains all the pcs hidden standards and chronic present time problems therefore one must attain and run it eventually before getting earlier track goals rule gpm which has its top oppterm and terminal is rarely the pt gpm thus these steps apply 1run the goal you first find on the pc if its right goal has gpm 2clean it up very carefully as per this or later hco bulletins 3do not oppose the final goal as an ri ri at the bottom of the bank what goal would goal oppose leave that ri firing 4leave the lowest lst bottom oppterm of the goal with whatever rrs do not adjust it as you will eventually have to it depends on the next lower goal which remains unknown at this time 5leave the lower earlier gpm strictly alone for now regardless of pcs interest in it 6do the top source list of the gpm you have just run what goal would oppose goal whose gpm you ran 7find the next gpm closer to pt goal 8handle completely the later gpm as per this hco bulletin or later advices 9do what goal would oppose one you just handled 10handle gpm found 11eventually by this method find the pt gpm and handle it fully 12when you are completely certain you have the pt gpm pcs current life name112or person is part of it and its top may be missingtruncated and have handled it fully trace back through all ris and earlier banks found and only then prepcheck these goals as you complete them on the way down 13reach eventually the first goal ever found on the pc but not handled do its ri oppose list and find the earlier goal adjust the bottom ri of the first goal ever found on the pc prepcheck the goal 14handle the next earlier gpm for which you have just found the goal fully as per this hco bulletin or later advices 15continue earlier and earlier in the gpms handling each one fully before getting the next until you reach time zero for gpms do not continue to go earlier with gpms until you have handled everything up to pt avoid even finding the goal of the earlier gpm step 3 above until you are ready to run that whole gpm the charge on early gpms is fantastic and the more gpms unhandled later on the track nearer pt the harder it is on the pc to go into earlier further from pt gpms the pc drags the pt gpm and others near it that have not been run through earlier gpms if they are prematurely handled the method is summed by 1 get goal 2 handle the bank of the goal you get 3 get to pt gpm by gpm handling each as you go 4 smooth and prepcheck goals on the way down 5 then head for the earlier track violations of this method will account for any casualties suffered in running r3 violations will occur as the whole pressure of the pcs interest is on earlier track and pcs sell hard to handle the earlier banks but whatever the sales talk it is very hard on the pc and auditor to go into gpms earlier on the track than the first goal found before later gpms are all handled and fully discharged the pc finding himself with the earlier goal found in violation of step 3 above of the 15 steps will be so interested in it that he or she will try to move heaven and auditors to run it not to go forward toward pt auditors unable to find goals closer to pt will go back and run it well if you do do good job of it and then try to get to pt but youll wish youd tried harder to get the banks upward toward pt not back down toward the beginning of track l ron hubbard founder113hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 24 april 1963 missions routine 3m2 tips the rocket read of reliable item the right r3 reliable item on list rocket reads differently than the other rrs the experienced auditor will get to know it the right ri usually has softer rr it is already disintegrating it is accompanied by blowdown of the ta the wrong rr is hard crisp and real fine demonstration rr it is not accompanied by blowdown of the ta it is pretty but it isnt taking off charge the right ris rr is quite often detected by only seeing its accelerated start or its whipcrack end it is longer than the wrong ris rr sometimes so long its end is right off the right hand of the dial it may look therefore to the new observer like very rapid fall with an accelerated start accompanied by ta blowdown sometimes the right ri loses its charge so fast that it rrs only once on call and would have to be tiger drilled to be made to fire again as calling it may turn on somatics on the pc the pc suppresses second call of it the wrong ris rr fires well but has blowdown it is shorter to an uninitiated auditor the ta sailing down or up on low ta case 15 had better be called an adequate read for an ri then he will begin to see the accelerated start as he gets more experience on the whipcrack end and realize that right ris in r3m are long loose and disintegrating and that wrong ris while they rr beautifully do not disintegrate on being called and the ta remains up or very low none of this applies necessarily to the rrs seen in finding or checking goals but these too may have disintegrating rr and heavy blowdown but new goal must continue to rr none of this excuses accepting an ri that does not rr an ri must rr to be accepted an ri with mere fall is not acceptable _____________ nulling r3 ri oppose lists if you have to null list with xs and s for an ri to be found it is almost certain that the right ri is not on the list the right ri explodes when put down or called the ri list that has to be nulled by elimination does not have the ri on it the exception is the source list which of course is nulled in the usual way _____________ listing rules all listing rules ever released apply to ri lists except length of ri oppose lists in r3m even if they are only two items long114if two items fire in the same list its incomplete etc etc nothing has changed the rules of listing taking items off an incomplete list particularly source list can be deadly to the pc directive listing does not change listing rules except that the list may be only one item long or 5 to 30 at the most dont echo invalidate the practice of echo invalidation is easily fallen into in r3 directive listing echo invalidation the pc gives an item the auditor calls it back to the pc and says it doesnt rr if this is kept up the pc will be put into state of sen that is appalling the right way to do this is as follows pc gives item auditor writes it down pc says thats it auditor calls the ri being listed from to test its charge if it doesnt react auditor reads back the one item given if it rrs on one call looks for its blowdown if it blows down on ta says that is your item if the ri listed from reads or if the new item doesnt rr when the auditor calls it or if it doesnt blow down the ta or up on 15 reading case the auditor says give several more and keeps the pc listing until an ritype rr appears on the list or is directed onto it by auditor then the auditor goes through the standard steps reads the ri being listed from to be sure it doesnt read calls off the next to the last rring item says it doesnt rr unless it does reads the pcs item once sees it give an rr or disintegrating rr watches for blowdown which may have begun already and says thats your item if things go wrong never start echo invalidation keep to form suggest the proper ri or variation the pc hasnt thought of get several echo invalidation in which pc names an item and auditor says that isnt it is not just bad form but very vicious practice that leads to games condition the invalidation of each item makes the pc very dizzy and very desperate the pc sick and confused starts plunging in desperation for the right item and goes swiftly down tone and out of session high pc morale is vital to blowing charge and finding ris uphold the pcs morale dont begin echo invalidation reverse practice is uncontrolled listing uncontrolled listing the pc is permitted to list on and on with stops or checks on the ri being listed from does not apply to long source lists where one lists 50 beyond last rs or rr for new goal the pc on an ri oppose list not source list must be stopped every few items usual number is 5 and the ri being listed from checked get

routine 3 directive listing listing liabilities nothing has changed to alter the mechanics or laws of listing now that the pattern of the gpm is exactly known the pc can be told what ri to put on the list this requires only 5 or 6 variations from the pattern ri but the values contained in just listing are lost underlisting these things happen when underlisting is done even though the right ris are found 1half the charge is left in the gpm 2the pcs directed ri does not rr 3the pc is prevented from cogniting on the ri found because it is still charged 4the pcs body weight increases 5the gpm run through once is stiff the pc is queasy about it 6the pcs body is subjected to unusual stresses 7the auditor is led to fake rrs or believe the pattern is wrong 8the pc doesnt get clear all these things can be prevented by alisting every list to clean needle122bconsidering the ri being listed from is reacting even if when called for test it reads latently or only roughs the flowing character of the needle cdont buy an ri unless the pc understands it and if he doesnt understand it make him list charge off dmaking the pc answer the listing question not plunge for the right pattern ri _____________ convincing test on most pcs the right ri wont rr until the charge from other listable items has been taken off you can make this test take the pcs next ri to be listed for lets say its perfect catfish the question is who or what would all catfish oppose get all possible combinations of the right ri perfect catfish from the pattern catfish perfected perfection catfish etc make the pc put them on the list now test by calling all catfish youll see roughed up needle even if instant tick appeared and probably real rr only fall will be seen on testing perfect catfish now make the pc really answer the listing question without regard to the pattern ri perfect catfish but just what he thinks all catfish would oppose you will see several rrs probably and maybe an rs or two on list of only 30 items you will observe the pcs needle go smooth call all catfish again to the pc you will see that there is slightest roughening of the smooth flow of the needle now have the pc put all combinations of perfect catfish back on the list one will rr beautifully call it off to the pc other nulling done bmrs it will rr again and the ta will blow down to clear read now examine your list you will see that the right ri placed at the top of the list had poor or absent rr or only fell when put down if you had accepted it at the top of the list you would not have gotten nice rr because all the rring and rsing items you saw after it would have remained in the pcs bank you should make this test on your r3 pc then youll understand all about it because you will have seen it _____________ ninety percent of the gpm ris when found and called to the pc should bring the tone arm of the meter to clear read note the pc may be in the valence of the opposite sex in any gpm during its running therefore the pcs clear read will be for the opposite sex in that gpm123_____________ the lesson here is this one audits the pc with routine 3 one does not just run bank routine 3 is an auditing tool one uses it to audit the pc if audited the pc gets better and feels better if just run through bank pc will benefit but wont clear removing charge truly skilled use of routine 3 removes all the charge auditing is for the pc true it is wholly the number of ris you get but what about those other rring and rsing items theyre the pcs too the crosssection of real r3 reliable item looks like this if the spherical cluster were split in half all charge comes from the rring ri the remainder borrow their charge from it the ri looks like steel sphere covered with heavy layer of black smoke this black smoke is actually rring lock items in the inner area and rsing 212 items in the outer area124if you get the ri discharged nearly everything blows but few of the rring first ring and one or two of the outer rsing items will still hang on the pc is trying to list through the outer rings to the center core ri this anatomy is not graphic it is actual gpm consists of less than two hundred ris about 6000 rring lock items and about 15000 rses the figures 6000 and 15000 are approximate listing by directive listing against the pattern of gpm you get most of these rring or rsing secondary items but you dont get them all even on cleanly rring pc to get them all and on most pcs even to get good rr on the ri you have to list off charge as well as list by pattern if you get the primary ri these secondary items never need to be opposed they just blow if you do oppose one or slightly incorrect ri your ta will go high and stay high _____________ many plans for doing this could exist i would prefer this one and have used it with success it would even apply to pc who rred well on pattern running 1tell the pc what to put on the list get the most ordinary variations of it see that one falls well none are called back to the pc 2tell the pc now lets get the secondary items off just answer the question any way you want who or what 3let the pc rattle off lot the auditor meanwhile just looking at the meter watching the falls rses and rrs but looking for the moment the needle begins to flow smoothly none of this is written down and it should take only couple of minutes 4stop the pc from further random listing and have the pc put some variations of the pattern ri on the list working hard with the pc to get the wording exactly correct 5as soon as these pattern of the gpm type items being listed cease to disturb the needle and one or more have rred stop 6read the ri being listed from to the pc to be sure it doesnt react or roughen the needle if it does repeat step 5 7read the last rring pattern items to the pc

passing through gpm the third time to align it and pass the charge down the pc run this way will be bright and sparkling the whole way lots of cognitions suppress protest and decide have to be cleaned on the list or the session if things dont go well but only when all other routine 3 means of handling things have become very impeded dont use any rudiments or tiger drill or nulling or bmrs in routine 3 unless totally driven to it and only then after all r3 means have been exhausted far from wasting session time you will find this gets more ris in session because the pcs confront comes up

the job is very nearly complete as to research though it has been pretty grim facing up to this totally unknown area of the reactive mind i acted as pc on it because i didnt know if body would live through it it doesbut care is needed in handling gpm while in body and great accuracy is required or the pc will gather mass and feel strain on heart and lung machinery i am now assembling and crosschecking all levels of ris and sequences of goals practically all the material is in sight but the speedy need of it is very difficult to meet i have done with mary sues help about decade of research since december last with mary sue as the auditor and myself as pc128my rr is practically indestructible and my confront is good on this therefore and only therefore could the job be done other pcs rrs are too weak for research and their confront is not up to it therefore i had to guinea pig it this doesnt make any hero but it has been fortunate for us that i could do this as nobody currently under processing has come close to the actual pattern and without it we would be stopped i did not realize the vitalness of the data or the weakness of rrs until march because it was i who went through it i completely underestimated the ability of the average pc to confront it and find ris thus whole technology of running has had to be developed directive and random listing to cope with these factors of poor rrs and low confront so this burden was added on to research and therefore my data release has fallen behind i have been struck by the importance attached to this material cables and telexes have been coming in demanding the data i am putting out the material as fast as i can and it should all be released shortly what auditors do not realize is that any finding of ris at any level in gpm releases charge if ris are bypassed the pc however is uncomfortable or arc breaky if this story of finding this pattern and the gpms is incredible the actual story of the gpms is even more so the data entirely changes our line of attack on public dissemination more toward the dianetic approach but still within the framework of scientology and the human spirit there are very few more ris in gpm than shown in to have game the upper dwindling top oppterm down is apparently always ably or ingably never any other word form the lower dwindling goal down is apparently always able

goal or pc to pc only significance of goals change pc to pc the terminals are all nix where they have negative starts not more cultured tongues have degrees of negative and nix is closer than if is used some mass will pile up on the terminal side nix used instead of dispels this mass never rerun partially run gpm always complete gpm to the bottom including the goal oppose list at the end before rerunning or correcting gpm go back two ris if you must but never more correct gpms ris only after the gpm has been gone through once if partially run gpm is rerun or corrected before completion it will stiffen up always run gpm top to bottom never bottom to top always get the pc to the topmost gpm as soon as possible before going for early track gpms run ris off the case as fast as possible dont linger around fooling with top oppterm combination more than few hours if you cant get it go into the bank at the goal as an oppterm it shatters pc to fool about hunting the top oppterm for 20 or 30 hours get ris run and charge off the case the bottom oppterm the bottom lowest oppterm is always trick combination of the next goal below and the goal being run sometimes not or nix is added between them its an idiotic simplicity the two goals are just joined to make sense example goal being run to never fish next lower goal to catch catfish the bottom oppterm of the gpm to never fish is therefore to never fish to catch catfish i almost sprained the brain trying to find this one it connects each gpm one to the next its keystone if the pc is few ris down from the top or in the body of gpm or few ris from the bottom you cant get another goal to fire to get another goal to fire you have to complete all the way to the bottom the one you are running two goals or more can be firing at one time l ron hubbard founder130hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 8 may 1963 central orgs missions routine 3 the nature of formation of the gpm all goals contacted on the preclear early in his processing and made to rocket read are implants an implant is an electronic means of overwhelming the thetan with significance in the case of implanted goals problem masses use was made of the mechanics of the actual pattern of living to impress and entrap thetan and force obedience to behavior patterns the goal selected was not based on any goal of the thetan but was an entirely arbitrary selection both as to goal and pattern by those conducting the implanting implanting was an activity carried out to prevent retribution from executed persons to dispose of captured armies and block their return home as thetans to dispose of excess population to fit thetan for colonization project to dissuade revolutionaries simply to implant and many other reasons lacking actual technology time real purpose and common decency the electronic implant was the standard shortterm means of handling the problems of life to us this activity is highly discreditable even criminal that implanting was undertaken and done is witnessed by the weird uses of electricity by the psychiatrist who has therapeutic excuse for doing so and does not even know that he undertakes very loworder dramatization of whole track actions that whole populations have been disposed of by beings needs further evidence than hitlers pogroms against the jews wherein he involved huge vitally needed war resources and elaborate scientific skills to exterminate 6000000 human beings who had committed real crimes against him implants are not necessarily the work of pranksters or madmen but the solemn scientific combined effort of careful dedicated politicians learned men and psycholo gists and technicians who work under the orders of short sighted states how they excuse this activity would probably make an interesting study in itself that the intention is not for the good of anyone is witnessed by the fact that many of the goals so implanted dictate criminal activities131implants result in all varieties of illness apathy degradation neurosis and insanity and are the principal cause of these in man implanted goals the pattern and similarity of goals and gpms should make one aware of their actual nature as implants that implanted goals and gpms exist does not mean that the pcs own goals and gpms do not exist however to get to the pcs own goals and gpms one must run the implanted ones indeed so long as implants do exist and have to be run it is almost fortunate for they give the pc the increase in confronting and case gain confidence needed to handle the whole track and the auditor the experience in listing necessary to handle the whole track there is real difference between the technology needed to handle an implant gpm and the whole track finding purposes and listing are common to both both have basic pattern though the implant pattern does not vary pc to pc goal to goal you wont find real whole track goal on pc until the implanted goals are handled and even if you did it would snap into an implanted goal the difference between whole track ri and an implant ri consists of somatic and visio implant somatics are pressure heat electrical and generalized pain there is changing visio usually just the implant station and its false pictures intended to confuse whole track ri has visio motion and sharp identifiable somatics as from spear wounds crashes etc for twelve years i have looked for technology to get around implants and not run them instead i found one could not get around them and found the technology to get through them everyone has these implants that is here on this planet do we know as much as the implanters yes we know more about life and its laws and this universe than those who implanted does this debar clearing it makes clearing easier as it gives pattern of goals and ris that can be followed is the gain as great in running out implants the only immediate gain you will get on homo sapiens is running out implants these implants are the immediate source of those troubles he is most concerned about the gains in running them are impressive when can one run the whole track and the pcs own gpms when the implants are run132does running an implant assist whole track running the implants have grouped the whole track in pc random listing during the running of implants straightens out lot of whole track does running an implant harm the body not if expertly done there is lot of physical discomfort in running an implant gpm and mass may pile up on the pc but the completion of the job sees this damage also swept away does running an implant change the pcs patterns of behavior the only trouble some patterns of behavior the pc has reactively are from these implants the resurgence and relief is enormous does this change the definition of clear it clarifies it clear could mean thetan cleared of enforced and unwanted behavior patterns and discomforts the mood of the pc the finding that the gpms you are contacting are implants accounts for the violence of r3 arc breaks and b the suspicion with which scientology is sometimes regarded down deep thetan on this planet knows he or she was given false purposes and sent here under cloud this is attested by the enthusiasm with which pc will erase his goal let an auditor err and force or confuse the pc and the pc instantly reverts to the moods experienced during the actual implant which are amongst others anger fear apathy compounded by feelings of degradation and betrayal the pc instantly feels he is again being implanted the r3 methods of handling an arc break keep this to minimum whole groups of people suddenly become convinced that central org or scientologists are up to some evil they have confused scientologist who is undoing an implant with the crews who implanted this paranoid reaction to scientology stems from this one mechanism the implanted character of people heartbreak ones first reaction to this news may be one of heartbreak feeling betrayed etc i felt the same way when i found it out then i realized the emotion came out of the implants themselves one is supposed to feel disheartened and betrayed when he or she realizes it that keeps it from being undone and leaves the being trapped the reaction is just part of the trap but before i realized this i only waited day or two to be sure i have always persevered in my honesty with you and have given you vital research datum as fast as i knew it regardless of its palatability this is one of those times at first i thought this puts clearing too far up in hours and i didnt know how youd133take it then i rapidly summed up the pluses and minuses of the situation and came up with this datum implant or implant we now know the first goal to be run on every case and we know its pattern some fifty hours after starting class iii or iv auditor knowing the goal and its pattern can make first goal clear in other words anyone signing up for instance in an hgc can be first goal clear in two intensives the randomity of looking for the first goal and its ris has vanished the pcs confront comes up up up what at the worst has happened is that it will take longer to run pc to ot as one has to handle these implanted banks before handling the actual whole track but the door is open to steady unquestionable gain in that direction without maybes and the state of ot attainable by auditing is probably much more powerful than we have imagined bank confusions an implant is meant to be tricky and confusing we have outsmarted it by finding the patterns of these but do not expect to find the banks not confusing to the pc even still let the pc grasp any confusing situation before forcing the pc into going on the bank closest to pt is actually the furthest from pt the bank was implanted from top oppterm down basic then is the pt goal pc cant run from bottom to top as thats backwards if you get the basic closest to pt goal very well erased the others tend to soften up this is our old get the basic on the chain basic is the top oppterm of the closest to pt goal the ow sequence is present the one who has the hardest run of it in bank has done the most implanting but motivators or not these implants must be run the overts can be handled later well thats the announcement when you come out of any decline it puts you into get busy and get through you were supposed to feel disheartened l ron hubbard founder134hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex central orgs franchise hco bulletin of may 11 ad 13 routine 3 heaven well i have been to heaven and ive found that scientologists have been to heaven and that everybody has evidently been to heaven the goals problem mass implants which are the apparent basic source of aberration and heaven travail which began with the goal to forget were cynically done in heaven for long while some people have been cross with for my lack of cooperation in believing in christian heaven god and christ i have never said i didnt disbelieve in big thetan but there was certain something very corny about heaven et now i have to apologize there was heaven not too unlike in cruel betrayal the heaven of the assassins in the 12th century who like everybody else dramatized the whole track implants if bit more so yes ive been to heaven and so have you and you have the pattern of its implants in the hco bulletin line plots it was complete with gates angels and plaster saints and electronic implantation equipment so there was heaven after all which is why you are on this planet and were condemned never to be free again until scientology before you went to heaven you were not really very bad or very good but you didnt think you had lived only once and you had good memory and knew who you were and enjoyed life afterwards the symbol of the crucified christ is very apt indeed its the symbol of thetan betrayed data additional work and possible corrections need to be done but this is the gist of the matter the implants are electronic in nature and follow certain pattern of the gpm the implant station existed on the order of magnitude of 43000000000000 years135ago the dates may be part of the implants but do not appear so at this time however possibility of correction of dates is reserved some have been through it once some more than once the first time i arrived and the moment of the implant to forget was dated at 43891832611117 years 344 days 10 hours 20 minutes and 40 seconds from 10024 pm daylight greenwich time may 9 1963 there are earlier such implants there later such implants i evidently have goal of my own at 305 trillion us years and an actual gpm all of which pulled into this 43 trillion year implant additional emeter data five goals in all may be common to both sequences the first 3 of the 5 are the same there are implants but dates rocket read implanting was done on nonvisible thetan but arrival was in ship in doll body according to the meter star of bethlehem pearly gates the way out of the universe all of which rr on the meter give clue to recruitment actions there was purpose in giving particular thetan particular goal planning had individualization preclears overts should be scouted as to why these implants keyed in fac 1 hypnotism etc but doubtful if any preclear did this type of implanting the mood is set that thetans are evil treacherous and bad but this is all part of the implant not factual the earliest point of the series is not known at this writing but possibly contains recruitment through advertising the departure method from the series is not fully known yet but probably just abandonment the implants were not done in box or in some trick manner of projection the scenery is actually there common mest universe space and matter and in mest universe the first 43 trillion series consists of 29 implanted goals the second 42 trillion series consists of 21 implanted goals the first three goals in both series are the same to forget to remember and to go away the last goal and one other in both series are the same the remaining goals are not the same for the two implants personally perceived data136the pattern of ris is different for the two series consisting in the second series of added ris below the to have goaliving and with different dwindling of adjectives and adverbs but are otherwise similar both series have the gates of heaven visible the last implant of both consists of entering heaven the last goal of both is to be in heaven the gates of the first series are well done well built an avenue of statues of saints leads up to them the gate pillars are surrounded by marble angels the entering grounds are very well kept laid out like bush gardens in pasadena so often seen in the movies aside from the implant boxes which lie across from each other on the walk there are other noises and sounds as though the saints are defending and berating these are unimportant to the incident the second series probably in the same place shows what trillion years of overt acts does or is an additional trickery to collapse ones time the saints have vanished so have the angels sign on one the left as you enter says this is heaven the right has sign hell with an arrow and inside the grounds one can see the excavations like archeological diggings with row terraces that lead to hell plain wire fencing encloses the place there is sentry box beside and outside the right pillar the road leading up to the gates is deeply eroded an effigy of joseph complete with desert clothing is seen approaching the gates but not moving leading donkey which carries the original madonna and child from bethlehem the implanting boxes lie on either side of this entering at path level these are the actual ends of the two series one backs out of the gates of course from top oppterm down as this is the end the last two ris after this last goal say it is the beginning not the end the place by implant and inference was supposed to be in the sky like floating island actually it was simply high place in the mountains of planet and the gates pathway falls away into gorge very eroded and bare by the time of the second implant but heavily forested and rolling at the time of the first the beginnings have not at this writing been so well explored by myself i have not viewed the second beginning which says it is the end however i do know that the second series was done in long square tunnels with implant boxes not unlike small pa speakers with fretwork fronts on either side the first series actually begins with arrival in town as everything is backwards to upset the time sense this town consisted of trolley bus some building fronts sidewalks train tracks boarding house bistro in basement where there is bulletin board well lighted and bank building the bank is the key point of interest it is interesting that we use the word bank taken from computerology to indicate the reactive mind this bank building was onthecorner oldfashioned granitelike construction two or three stories high with the door in the rounded front even revolving type door inside to the left of the entrance door is rounded counter directly across the room are the137stairs the top oppterm and terminal of to forget are at the top of these stairs the implant then proceeds on down the stairs step by step terminals on one side the left if one were coming up the stairs the oppterms on the other the first series 43 trillion has all its implant impulses at step level in the second series the boxes are ear high to man by the time the gates are arrived at in the first series the terminals are on the left as you approach the gates the oppterms on the right having been reversed at some point the first 43 trillion series had very fine marble stairs the same stairs can be seen in any big well kept railway station they were complete with white ball held in wrought iron stand the thetan was taken along apparently on pole trap to which he was stuck it does not proceed step by step throughout the whole of the implant series but after the first flight of stairs goes ways stops while several pairs of ris fire then to new location the place seemed to have people in it but they are all effigies those seem radioactive contact with them hurts living beings are seen but the effigies that look like humans are performing sudden repetitive actions with long halts in between in the basement such dummies are seen operating machinery the boarding house at the actual beginning has dummy guest and landlady in kimono and wrappers reading newspaper there are devils or satans that i saw there is passenger getting on the trolley bus workman halfway down the first stairs of to forget eating lunch and in to be in heaven gardener or electrician adjusting an implant box behind hedge and periodically leaping up and screaming the place so long as the implants remain only partially discharged seems to swim in black and white electronic masses but these dissipate as the implants are run out by pattern one actually enters the town as the first action the implants however were rigged to makes the gates seem the entrance to the incident one backs through from the town into the bank down the steps and eventually out the pearly gates down the hillside and is there let off and abandoned to be in heaven is the last goal implanted in both series this is not body building implant though running it gives somatics to the chest this is not ge implant it is the persons own running it particularly badly brings it down on the body there are body somatics on it however particularly eyes face chest bones it apparently only can be run by 3m listing and rocket reads one must have the goal to get the ris138conclusions the place is so full of lies by implant that the preclear becomes quite confused and this review of the actual date is necessary to successful navigation however it is very easy to read more treachery into it than there is in it which is enough however as the place existed so long it was in varying state of repair and some change this data on time is subject to review but in 12 trillion years only some of the implant pattern and mock up had shifted however there may have been other stations only time and research will really tell that one must date the preclears first earliest goal to forget find how many times the preclear went through it or some such implant station date the other times and be careful to run only the first of the series as this is basic as in prepchecking sec checking and old engram running it tends to case up the remainder of the implants but running the implants later than basic is very much harder on the pc even though it can be done wherever one misses an ri in an implant that repeating ri when found in later one tends to be very much more heavily charged rerunning any implant that has only been partially run tends to rough up the whole implant and make it hard to run luck i think we are lucky it could have been much worse this heavenly dream of destruction could have been current not so long ago it could have happened often not just once or twice or three times per pc but apparently it didnt and is unique in itself this is the core of the reactive mind it is all the way south for here just once on the whole track somebody discovered the mechanism of purposes and ris and utilized them to install religious mania and pin thetans down to one life and planets the thing was done so well that it has hung up ever since there are other implants there are other goals and gpms but these are minor and easily found and listed once this key implant series is out of the way we were in position of having an infinite number of pieces to the puzzle now we have finite number which even though very tough are still finite in number further every processing step taken every ri discharged is positive gain toward definite result in processing further we have our hands on an appalling bit of technology where the world is concerned with repidity and meter it can be shown that heaven is false dream and that the old religion was based on very painful lie cynical betrayal what does this do to any religious nature of scientology it strengthens it new religions always overthrow the false gods of the old they do something to better man we can improve man we can show the old gods false and we can open up the universe as happier place in which spirit may dwell what more can you expect this actually139places us far beyond any other beings that are about it puts us through increased beingness and restoration of life in control of much destiny we now have only few unsolved problems about life huge though they may be such as the construction of bodies and how does one establish the character of and communicate if feasible with beings who are making trees and insects there are few things like these but i imagine when we finally manage to communicate with beetles under rocks and free them well doubt find the creator of heaven who 43 trillion years ago designed and built the pearly gates and trapped us all good lord id hate to be guilty of that overt but never mind you arent either that guy is gone i hope l ron hubbard note this hco bulletin is based on over thousand hours of research auditing analyzing the facsimiles of the reactive mind and with the help of mark v electrometer it is scientific research and is not in any way based upon the mere opinion of the researcher this hco bulletin is not the result of the belief or beliefs of anyone scientology data reflects long arduous and painstaking research over period of some thirty years into the nature of man the mind the human spirit and its relationship to the physical universe the data and phenomena discovered in scientology is common to all minds and all men and can be demonstrated on anyone truth does not require belief to be truth any more than water requires anyones permission to run down hill the data is itself and can be duplicated by any honest researcher or practitioner we in scientology seek freedom the betterment of man and the happiness of the individual and this comprises our attitude toward the data found the data however is simply itself and exists whatever the opinion of any one may be the contents of this hco bulletin discover the apparent underlying impulses of religious zealotism and the source of the religious mania and insanity which terrorized earth over the ages and has given religion the appearance of insanity as this paper is written for my friends it has of course semblance of irreverence noteall our data on the whole track remains factual and is not taken

the following form there may be an ri in juxtaposition or missing pair on test now i have found it all correct so far as i can tell but except as indicated this is the exact pattern in that your pc has all of these if your pcs goal does not follow this form you are running the second series at 41 trillion an approximation of the word is not acceptable with little random listing the right one will rr example enjoying catfish is not good enough it would have to be enjoyably catfish as given only variation in the middle of the word sometimes occurs ie enjoyably fires as enjoyfulably enjoy and ably are always there only may fire in the terminals not nix but if so mass will eventually stack up gpm to gpm on the terminal side early on case bank is so charged up that almost anything will rr so work for the right one as given or in later gpms that level will leave mass because basic on it 1st gpm is wrong this is not the pattern of the second series 41 or 42 trillion the first series is probably available on your pc find it if you cant and pc got only the second series of gpms although im still prepared to find it all one consecutive implant blunder about and get charge off by finding ris i havent run much of the second series without the first series run completely the accumulated charge on the second is too brutal however i will have the full pattern of it in very few weeks i am auditing fresh pc and am being audited at the rate of one ri per minute of auditing time blowdown is ignored only ris are used now we have this pattern this pattern should fit all the first series of implanted gpms 28 or 29 in number the only trouble youll have is finding the correct top oppterm on some each goal consists of certain blocks of ris for instance block one as noted on plot is forgotten therefore one has forgotten as the top oppterm nix forgotten as the top terminal then one has absoluteably forgotten then nix absoluteably forgotten as its terminal and so on the blocks are numbered the appropriate ending or form goes in each block see next page 141for to forget the blocks are block one top oppterm forgotten block two goal to forget block three goal minus to forget block four goal minus to able not present in first series of implants block five ing form forgetting block six er form forgetter for the goal to remember block one remembered block two to remember block three remember block four not present in first series block five remembering block six rememberer the goal to go away block one gone block two to go away block three go away block four not

in any old oppterm that fires then when you have the next goal put in the bottom oppterm by asking who or what would the goal to oppose get the right bottom oppterm of the upper gpm consists of the two goals joined together to make sense then list who or what would oppose bottom oppterm just found and put to on the list then relist who or what would to last ri of bank oppose and put in top

routine 3 routine 3n directive listing with new routine 3 model session as i gathered experience in auditing pc through the implant gpms and being audited through them it became obvious that we had need of special routine to handle implant gpms and new routine 3 model session there are two technologies for auditing goals you have in routine 3m completed technology needed to audit the pcs own goals this need not be changed however as we moved into implant gpms great deal of routine 3m and 3m2 could be dropped while running the implant gpms therefore here is streamlined routine developed for implant gpms only there are about 49 of these implant gpms according to present data some pcs have more some less unless one hits speed of an ri every minute of auditing time the task of clearing the pc of all these takes too long there are 230 ris in each one so the speed necessity is selfevident therefore we drop several actions from 3m2 we do not check the goal between ris we do not test the ri being listed from or the question we drop the requirement of tone arm blowdown for an ri and we leave only the necessity that the ri rr well when said by the pc and called the extraneous actions can be dispensed with because we now have the first series exact line plot as per hcob 12 may 63 routine 3 ri form gpm ri form corrected and are doing only directive listing by the numbered character of the line plot one can keep the pc straight without telling the pc the ri the session is so arranged that the auditor has line plot before him and the pc has copy propped up so that the pc can see it easily without moving about or shifting hands on the cans the auditor uses his own line plot copy as the pcs line plot spare paper is handy in case any fiddleabout with words is necessary the auditor keeps all ris on the form provided to save unnecessary writing the only thing the auditor guards against is incorrect oppose in his questionwho or what would oppose and who or what would oppose must never be mixed up the question correct for the column below it is on the form if any additional listing is necessary the auditor transfers the number of the ri being listed for to his spare paper and lists it there if he lists in writing at all there are pauses while the auditor writes during the finding of most of the ris the auditor fills in the form as he asks form filling is also shorthanded by putting just check mark on the terminal side to show it has been gotten151ris can thus be found and recorded almost as fast as auditor and pc can talk the auditor must be very sure of his rocket read the correct ri will fire once when the pc says it slightly less when called back less when part of the next question and ticks when opposed by the next ri it is thereafter wholly discharged it has to be called back to the pc and the next question then asked using the ri just found and thats all the only judgment is on did the pc hear it and is the pc distracted or suppressing experience will guide you on these dont waste time with lots of ruds or tding ris whats happening or what happened in critical moment saves almost all mid ruds and when it doesnt suppress invalidate put in on the pc is usually adequate for an ri and protest assert and decide are enough when session ruds demand to be put in the auditor takes the pcs data always and can act on it but the auditor never takes the pcs orders when the auditor fails to take data the pc soon after begins issuing orders most of which will be wrong there is case data except the pcs data via pc and meter the auditor handles the pc gently never continue session beyond an arc break until that arc break is handled otherwise the pc thinks of the auditor as an enemy which after all is characterized by forcing against will the principal thing to accomplish in routine 3n is discharge of charge charge is seen on the meter by rocket reads or rock slams which dont apply in 3n this charge is seen to do one of two things adischarge or bsuppress the auditor must be careful that the charge does not just suppress and that it actually discharges all the charge present is represented by the rocket read when the rocket read ceases to rocket read the charge is either discharged or suppressed the auditor will quickly learn by experience which has happened suppressed charge is still on the case and retains command value on the pc sometimes an area such as whole gpm or engram is so charged that the rocket reads continue to fire as the tone arm moves down sometimes most of the time the charge is so shallow that it contains only one long rocket read b one medium rocket read c one short rocket read and d tick accompanied by about 2 divisions of ta fall over the lot in 3n one gets the long rr when the pc first says the ri from his copy of the line plot form b the medium rr when the auditor calls it back c the short rr when the next oppose question is asked and d the tick when it is answered one may not see c and d often the whole charge goes on and b continuing to call right ri does not produce an rr beyond the above only wrong one continues to fire what the auditor must be careful of is failing to get and b when the pc first says it and when the auditor calls it back if rr occurs but only fall or if short rr occurs at or b the auditor must expect the pc has suppress or was suppressing by being distracted the thing to do is ask what happened and get the pcs answer and do the whole operation again dont keep putting in big mid ruds or random listing when the above simple query will handle152sometimes the speed of run causes the pc to suppress cognitions this will prevent rocket reads it is quite enough to ask what happened as above and the pc will tell you although 3n is fast one must compensate for that speed by good sense the more you harass pc the less charge is gotten off and the fewer the ris found per session you dont therefore use lots of session big mid ruds and ri big mid ruds however putting in the bmrs on nix once or twice on various words in argument will pay off with smoother run nix can always be made to fire as part of terminals pcs often hate it why its part of the implant thats why its the most used word in the implants the pc does not have to understand the words to recover however getting the pc to study before session the parts of speech involved will help the things werent understood or were sneered at by the pc at the time they were implanted getting the pc to pick up any overt thoughts he had while going through will also help but this is done only very occasionally in the session not every ri routine 3n is speed process which balances between too much and too little auditor doingness do enough to get the charge off dont do too much and inhibit charge dont do too little and leave charge on the case the pcs visio of the surroundings in the implant area as the pc goes through is not vital on the first run through the implants but it shouldnt be prevented either whether the pc looks or not is unimportant the auditor can say what does it look like once or twice in session speed can come up to 1 ri every 30 seconds but should not fall lower than l ri every minute and half of session time an average of 1 ri per minute is good this includes breaks beginning and end of session the first session or two may go much slower speed should be reached by the third to fifth session and maintained thereafter routine 3n cannot be used on those cases five percent who are not native to this galaxy and do not have therefore the helatrobus implants or who for some reason escaped them on these the top oppterm and terminal of to forget cannot be made to fire even when to forget does such cases may have goal to persist or to exist for self alone but these do not run by our line plots pc who received only the second series of implants and not the first is run on 3n but by the second series line plot form pcs who do not have the helatrobus implants covered in r3n are best run by blocking out their time track and mild engram running these are nonpattern pcs and their auditor has to develop the materials needed to handle their implants much data exists on this be awfully sure your pc does not have the goal to forget and its top ris however before deciding he or she is off pattern pcs like to be different its dangerous to be predictable and they often sell difference to an auditor it is fortunate if the pc can be run on the helatrobus implants as it makes fast gains for little work run r3n as fast as you and the pc can talk do the ris on the hco bulletin form save every corner of time you can there are more than 10000 ris on most cases some153far more on very few there are less thats about 170 hours of auditing time at one ri per minute so you see why youve got to gothetango at two ris per session its 5000 hours or more the reason we run the helatrobus implants is obvious but you may have missed

of model session occurs however what makes 3n 3n is the following after having established that pc has the goal to forget and the helatrobus implants also done in the above session form one proceeds as follows give the pc copy of the required line plot to fit his goal or preris making sure you have the latest and most accurate version prop it up so pc can read it or let pc have it on his lap guarding against too much can juggling to get it read the auditor takes second copy of the same form for his line plot auditor give number next ri who or what would oppose____last ri or who or what would last ri oppose as required pc calling only the exact form ri avoidable catfish auditor has carefully observed emeter to make sure it rred well marks but need not write in full avoidable catfish place on his line plot form verifies it is the right one to come up thank you i will read the item reads avoidable catfish sees that it rrswill do so about half the width of the pcs first rr just moment before that rocket reads notes next number or not and may or may not give it to pc according to how lost pc is liable to get uses last ri found in question who or what would oppose avoidable catfish pc nix avoidable catfish auditor sees that it rred when pc said it marks his list i will read the item reads and as always notes meter reaction carefully nix avoidable catfish that rocket reads who or what would nix avoidable catfish oppose and so forth the auditors remedy against something not rocket reading is usually what happened gets the pcs answer and repeats the operation that didnt produce an rr this usually gets the rr and the auditor just goes on the pc had heavy somatic or cognition or looked at the next ri or just didnt pay attention the next remedy if the above didnt work is to put in suppress and invalidate on the ri then one repeats the operation and goes on if however rr results yet look over the line plot thoroughly to make sure you havent skipped or gotten mixed up or gotten nonline plot rr if all is well here then do next paragraph155if rr yet use random listing letting the pc vary the wording as he or she wishes dont write any of this down you will see the meter rr on these odd variations given when more rrs are seen except on any repeat of the right ri once more repeat the operation and youll get your rr if none of these work then assume ayou already got the charge off and missed it or byou are doing something not procedure and have been gradually stacking up charge to remedy either of the above try to get the next ri if it fires well just go on as if the charge went off the next one will fire and if it didnt the next one wont your responsibility is to 1get the charge off each ri and 2keep the pc calm and unharassed and speeding forward you will quickly learn the particular tricks of your pc such as press on puzzling it out getting tired and will get the hang of this pcs meter so you can tell suppress or whatever from real rr very easily and adjust accordingly it is obvious that such trouble has to be rare to get your quota of ris in session going from one goal to the next varies the above pattern here one lists goal oppose list for the next goal to 50 beyond the last rr or rs nulls the list and gets the next goal this is longish process if there is doubt what the next goal is just direct it on the list at once making one ri list adjust the bottom oppterm of the goal just left carry the charge through and get the next top oppterm at once if you have the wrong next goal your pc will arc break or the rr will fail to fire and the pc will develop much mass wrong next goal is probably the only liability that can give the auditor trouble now ______________ this is routine 3n on the basis of its model session all routine 3 can be done as well as engram running the essence of it is auditor direction direct the pc toward clear not toward arc breaks and youll soon have marvelous rewards from the processing l ron

are important they are the charge that must be removed from the case three techniques are used to accomplish all this 1dating 2engram running modern style 3routine 3n if you cant do 1 and 2 then do only 3 and omit the balance of the program except vestibule implants gpms and end ris the other actions of dating and engram running make it easier to run the implants but running the implants is the thing less than three hours should be consumed in dating and other actions than finding ris in the implants _______________ fast blowing ris when case has been properly programed as above by the time you have run the first three or four goals if you do them well with 3n exactly on the form line plot you will encounter difficulty the ris begin to discharge so fast that once the pc in session has said them they do not again rr when the auditor says them they have blown this will only happen when the pcs visio has turned up well on the implant stairways and the rrs are wide and free as the pc says them this changes none of the patter of r3n except saying something rocket read one uses past tense of read that rocket read i can visualize pc flying up tone to where this happens and the auditor nagging because theres second read when the auditor calls it how can it its goneblown by further rise in tone and with far more charge off i can envision pc racing along in session blowing ris by inspection well its observable when it happens that the whole of every ris charge is blowing in such case an auditor can further shorten the 3n patter in the interest of speed but realize that the

auditors routine 2 new processes the recent developments on the political front and various attacks upon scientology and scientologists caused sudden catalyzing of research my answer to these attacks was to 1hold the front legally employing competent attorneys and others to halt the actions taken against us 2develop counterattack by upgrading research lines the first part of this program is succeeding push on us in australia has already collapsed and we have won in america the situation continues to improve for us and there is little doubt of our winning eventually the second part of our program is being successful beyond the most happy estimates about five or ten years research work has been crowded into the last six months and although this has been hard work beyond belief i have brought it off the need was for an achievement of the state of operating thetan while this state existed in theory time for an orderly development from aberree to clear to ot was permitted by events my task was to shortcut from aberree to ot and bypass all niceties of inbetween states scientologist needs to be told the significance of this in handling our affairs on earth this sudden speedup disrupted and probably upset many auditors and i am sorry that this interrupted training programs and study what had to be done was done but it did disrupt all previous training and auditing expectancies the first casualty was r212 the moment i was informed of the us and australian attacks i adopted the above twopoint program and even though i knew it would upset things i had choice but to concentrate on those two points so i dropped routine 212 and short while thereafter was able to drop the ardures of goals finding and working at top speed laid open the impasses to ot and developed technology to overcome them well all this i can now state has been successful the gamble was upon the power of an ot we won an ot is so much more powerful than we have ever envisioned that there is now faintest doubt of the wisdom of the twopoint program above the technology now exists for the creation of the state of ot for many weeks now the saint hill course technology has been steady and saint hill students have been successfully applying that technology and it in its essential points is in the hands of central orgs and their staffs are being trained on it we have moved fast my estimate was that we had very few years from january 1963 before the roof fell in not just on us but on earth i thought i could bring this off in that period in only five months it was being brought off short of this i could not see how i could protect individual scientologists from persecution and i was worried about them the state of clear was not enough therefore the technology of ot and controlled166environment were the only wholly satisfactory things i could do so dont be shocked at the way r212 and other data was dropped that progress would have been orderly but sudden time limit was placed on us by the washington raids these were not more than symptom of coming chaos not just for us but for earth when government has to imagine crimes to prosecute people for that government is responding to times that are more chaotic than we believe so here is the technical aspect of all this 1r212 is replaced by arc processing designated r2t any auditor can use it it consists of three questions variously cleared and used which sweep away the ri locks on repetitive process basis 2any auditor trained to handle r212 is benefited by being now easily trainable on r3n which uses an even simpler approach 3the state of clear is relegated to courtesy use without test requiring only that gpm has been run first goal clear means one gpm run second goal clear means two gpms run etc we will make attempt to stabilize clears but press them on to ot 4all concentration in auditing should be toward the state of ot free thetan as they were once known 5all scientologists should cooperate in making ots and in programs calculated to prevent the environment from degenerating into chaos ______________ it takes about 500 hours to push an average case to ot with present technology clearing gpms and the time track we have very little time not just to make ots but to get things under control so the time factors are very closely figured indeed and theres time to be lost if you enroll at saint hill you will make it faster ______________ if the program seems at all unreal then recall the life were living here on earth is little unreal too r2t the basic commands of r2t are these 1what attitude has been refused 2what reality has been rejected 3what communication has not been acknowledged each process is given cyclic ending pc in pt again run the ta action out of each command in turn then out of each one in turn again etc reduce to 25 div of ta motion in 10 minutes of auditing there are various ways of clearing these commands and various ways of using them which will be covered in later bulletins these processes are powerful enough to open up any time track if properly used they do not make an ot they prepare the way to make one and they undo past auditing when prefixed with in auditing they destimulate whatever has been restimulated l ron hubbard founder167hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 4 june ad13 central orgs missions routine 3 handling gpms the gpm of the helatrobus implants that is handled properly is very easy to run and the results delight the pc when errors are made and the gpm is mishandled by the auditor the pc becomes lethargic arc breaky and apparent gains are minimal as soon as an auditor realizes this and gets alert on his technical he or she has trouble getting ris to rr the pc has arc breaks and succeeding gpms get easier and easier to audit pc being run on these gpms who develops mass becomes exhausted or arc breaky is simply being run with certain definite r3 errors make up your mind to this and youll begin to be alert when the pc starts running poorly pc running poorly on gpms has had one or more of the following r3 errors committed 1run without preparation on arc processes only true when gpms cant be found and made to rr 2a wrong goal found by wrong wording of right goal or just completely wrong goal 3being run on goal too early in the series too soon or getting into second series when first series remains 4when goal is found as the pcs goal the auditor then runs another goal true of pcs who have had earlier goals found 5that which is restimulated is not discharged finding several goals without discharging them or scanning over banks 6running with ris which differ from the basic line plot such as absolutely for absoluteably or for nix there are divergences from the hco bulletin line plot form 7failure to do the end goal oppose list properly the crime of having 2 or more rring items on same list in nulling always find the next goal formally by list except when pc can see it and even then check it 8incorrect top oppterm for the goal always list page on what would be the final achievement of this goal and properly null it unless published block form issued after this date exists for it1689incorrect block ris diverging from pattern 10wrong word or sequence form for one or more ris 11failure to discharge an ri grinding it out not blowing it with one or more dial wide disintegrating rrs 12failure to spot bypassed charge at once and thus not caring promptly for arc breaks 13forcing the pc on after an arc break without locating the bypassed charge or running pc who is in trouble session after session without finding what charge was bypassed 14running doped off pc without pulling missed withholds the only cause of dope off 15failing to follow 3n remedies for lack of rr in that exact sequence given in the hco bulletin and harassing the pc for nonrring ris 16demanding more data than the pc can give on the facsimiles 17failure to follow the auditors code 18programing incorrectly arc breaks the most frequent cause of arc breaks and case deterioration are 1failure to complete goal oppose list 2bypassing an ri 3bypassing skipping gpm 4wrong top oppterm 5restimulating more goals than are run 6departure from pattern 7bad programing all these add up to bypassed charge of course but the above seven are the specific offenders which give even skilled auditor trouble carelessness on these points can eat up all the immediate case gain note this is the most frequent list not the most dangerous or important which includes wrong goal next goal169the next goal should be found by formal last goal oppose list list 50 items beyond last rr or rs completed to clean needle only one item rring on nulling all the rules of listing exist here full valid failure to follow them will cause skip of or failure to find the next goal if this list does not have the next goal on it the pc will arc break sometimes pc can see the next goal and it is it in such cases the goal oppose list is only one item long but it is still list and it does have the next goal on it top oppterm the most insidious offender in wrecking pcs is wrong top oppterm if guaranteed list of block items exists for the goal use it but if such block item list exists you must do list for the top oppterm on the question what would be the final achievement of this goal unless pc random lists foolishly the list should be about half page long with clean needle it is then routinely nulled and the bmrs put in on the 2 or 3 items that stayed in this is however all very tricky as the second series of gpms has things in them that could read as top oppterms for the first series so always conclude top oppterm list by confirming by meter that the resultant word from the list is first series top oppterm dirty needle sometimes in trying to locate the bypassed charge causing an arc break the pcs needle is so dirty that it almost cant be read however there is way to read it when the correct bypassed charge is located and indicated the needle will go beautifully clean ______________ programing there is much technology now on programing which will soon be released programing is what you audit on pc and how to establish it i only wish to note here that for several reasons the best programing for the helatrobus implants for pc who can be made to rr on to forget is as follows run right down from the gpm to forget including its gpm and right on out the gates of heaven doing proper goal oppose list at the end of every gpm you complete there are only about 10 gpms more or less from to forget to the heaven implant and they are all easy ones to run when the pc backs out the gates of heaven an enormous reality results from the orientation170achieved follow the precautions in this hco bulletin and you will have trouble and the pc will feel great if you start forward to the 1st implant gpm i now find after experience with lot of pcs you restimulate too much the pc always has live goal restimulated before and behind and its uncomfortable in backing the pc down you are following the pcs natural tendency and its easier further all the gpms after to forget and including it are breeze to forget is usually the basic gpm on stairs the fancy gpms are all earlier closer to the first one and have spinning plates fast rides etc in them they are not hard if the pc has the last 10 gpms of the first series run first the more gpms you restimulate and dont discharge the more uncomfortable the pc will become and the less apparent gain per gpm i have now found and run the earliest gpms to be dead which is followed by to be hurt to experience nothing to be unbalanced and to be unconscious and believe these are the standard sequence for all pcs in the first series but they are pretty strong for pc who hasnt had the end gpms from to forget to to be in heaven discharged ______________ summary 1the helatrobus implants run give enormous case gain session by session if run with attention to the points given in this hco bulletin 2they give when run without the points in this hco bulletin cared for hard exhausting struggle that is very slow going and wearing on both auditor and pc 3no matter how theyre run they give case gain its mainly question of maintaining the thetans morale and saving auditing time it can take more than five times as long to run these implants if it is not done with this hco bulletins view and the pc can get pretty sick so for comfortable run easy on auditor and pc alike and five times as fast or more apply these technical points very carefully indeed i speak form great experience in this matter on the question do they have to be run the answer is yes without running them the track remains too heavily burdened for the pc to get earlier with full perception so there is the barricade you wont find new fad removing it it can only be done smoothly by skilled auditing such as that done at saint hill they may have implanted heaven but its hell to run especially when you ignore the fine points l ron hubbard founder171hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of june

as indicated above text for hco bulletin the aircraft door goals this goal pattern hco bulletin of 17 april 1963 as changed was in use in an aircrafttype set between 315 trillion years ago and 216 trillion years ago and less and is the pattern which precedes the helatrobus implants in this galaxy it remains to be seen if all preclears have it the goals were given with one or more goals in series usually one and that goal was to create the preclear possibly has this goal several times during this period180it was given in the mockedup fuselage of an aircraft with the thetan fixed before an aircraft door there are also two or more aircraft fuselages used in the helatrobus implants but the preclear moved through them was not fixed in them the date is the way to tell the pattern the helatrobus implants existed only between 52 trillion and 38 trillion years ago the total life span of the helatrobus government if the goal is found to lie earlier between 315 trillion and 216 trillion or later up to 52 trillion years ago then it is probably this pattern the goal items were laid in with explosions the gorilla goals this same pattern but given in an amusement park with single tunnel roller coaster and ferris wheel was used between about 319 trillion years ago to about 256 trillion trillion years ago long span the symbol of gorilla was always present in the place the goal was given sometimes large gorilla black was seen elsewhere than the park mechanical or live gorilla was always seen in the park this activity was conducted by the hoipolloi group of operators in meat body societies they were typical carnival people they let out concessions for these implant amusement parks pinkstriped white shirt with sleeve garters was the uniform of the hoipolloi such figure often rode on the roller coaster cars monkeys were also used on the cars elephants sometimes formed part of the equipment the hoipolloi or gorilla goals were laid in with fantastic motion blasts of raw electricity and explosions were both used to lay the items in the series is always five goals these are very simple goals long words to end to be dead to be asleep to be solid to create to find to be visible to be sexual not to have sex as some pcs give it to be invisible to postulate and very few more were used always five goals in series the series usually started with to be dead but to end to sleep and to be asleep must also be investigated as the first goal of each series the pattern in hcob 17 apr ad 13 is correct for all of these goals as changed in this hco bulletin the bear goals from about 256 trillion trillion years ago to about 370 trillion trillion years ago the gpms are the bear goals these use the same pattern similar amusement park arrangements the same type of goals as the gorilla goals the only real difference is that instead of mechanical gorilla mechanical or live181bear was used and the motion was even more violent there is however change of pattern in the bear goals in that two ris were added these come as pair just below the vast value of goaling they are oppterm any worries about being or goaling opposed by terminal worried goaler aside from this addition the pattern is the same as the gorilla goals mostly raw electric sprays are used in the bear goals to drive in the items the bear goals were handled by group called i think the brothers of the bear and were the ancestors of the hoipolloi the black thetan goals from about 390 trillion trillion years to 370 trillion trillion years ago the black thetan goals were given these were given in glade surrounded by the stone heads of black thetans who spat white energy at the trapped thetan the trapped thetan was motionless the pattern is the earliest to form of gpm now known there were six ris per goal consisting of accomplished not accomplished action ing never action ing goal not goal there were from 15 to 18 goals in the series all of simple nature such as to end to be dead to be asleep etc the full series will be published at later date but is easily reconstructed always following the same pattern of six the invisible picture goals from somewhere around 110000 trillion trillion years ago or earlier to 390 trillion trillion years ago the most difficult gpms on the track were given these contain four ris per set positivenegative in dichotomy example wake never wake sleep never sleep the four given five times for every one picture shown this makes 20 firings per picture but the first picture is invisible and the thetan afterwards is not expected to find then the first twenty firings of ris four in row repeated five times this makes vacuum for picture and groups the bank this type of implant is probably the source of vacuums in the reactive mind182the remaining pictures vary during different periods of the sequence but consist usually of scene of cave railway an airplane view of sun and planets the first picture making the total number of five is invisible and is picture the pictures have moving object in each except the invisible one which backs up halfway through the series the trick is to get the ris out of the invisible picture particularly the basic first four the ris also fire right left then left right so that the never ri the next time has swapped sides they go positive negative then with swapped sides positive negative they are simple aberrative words start never start end never end are always the first firings followed by begin never begin stop never stop for the second whole series of firings the same four run through all five pictures then the next four go through all five etc there are many words used early in the series 3dimensional sets were used late in the series only 2 dimensional pictures were employed ______________ there may be earlier gpmtype implants but the goal idea does not go back earlier evidently than 390 trillion trillion yearsin the black thetan implants earlier material is only positive negative and dichotomies according to present data but the earlier ones are more aberrative to the pc ______________ programing the trick is to run full series through on any of these as found matter how late it is in the period then find the first time the series was given the pc and run the complete series then get the next earlier type of series and do the same thing your pc may not have been in the areas where these patterns were used and may have different types of implants if so make sure first that the implant you have found does not contain one of these patterns before going to the hard labor of trying to make one up with the pc later day implants between 38 trillion years ago and present time lot of offbeat implants can be found they sometimes have only pictures sometimes only items sometimes items and pictures both they are usually short often have goal in them only positivenegative183commands and are not hard to work out the pc can usually get them easily if theyre on his assessed r3r chain ______________ warning in complex gpm pattern almost anything can be made to fire until the exact ri is found then rr is left wrong ris leave white mass and eventually crumple up the engram missed ris leave black strips or patches partially discharged ris leave gray patches restimulated but not run ris turn everything black in the picture scan pc through ris you dont suspect and it all goes black get wrong date or wrong duration and the pc has visio or pictures that dont belong there ______________ summary this is rapid resume of principal gpms on the track where the pattern applies it must be done exactly as given note all trillions used are us trillions which are 1000 million l ron hubbard founder184hubbard communications office saint hill manor

those who are forget ing ing someone who isnt ever forgett ing ing there is extra ing cin block six incorporating the er into the oppterm side producing the exhaustion of forgetering the stupidity of forget ering there isnt any er on the oppterm side din block five and block six attempting to form the ing form of the goal by adding ing to the goal minus to which as fas as i can see would only occur at item 163 164 thus producing many items with section reading such as go awaying not going away and be in heavening not being in heaven even though the earlier line plot red has the ing form of these goals indicated in the block 2rerunning gpms after they had been run through to bottom oppterm rather than finding next goal and going on one poor sob had partly run gpms first 3 and then to be in heaven run as next goal in series i say partly because of chocked rrs one of them rerun twice and one rerun once and goal oppose long done done on to remember after to go away had been run which action apparently sticks batches of the other goals on the list all this done with the sickenedup line plots as shown above 3despite clarity of approriate bulletins run to be in heaven with and assertion that it is the 4th goal of the series ________________ id recomment clarification on the blue plot and warning to be published on at least the 2nd point auditors tend to look at the goal as

july ad 13 issue ii remimeo r3rr3nr3t cautionary hcob i have been working hard to clarify time track work which was more or less left off in 1952 with the discovery of the relationship of time and the tone arm i immediately went to work to see if any eager loops had used time confusion in order to immobilize and incapacitate thetan i found almost at once that false timing of incidents was not only used but very nearly specialized in the exact character of the betweenlives implants only then came to view and could be mapped and other implants of earlier times were disclosed entire false pasts and futures have been installed and even actual dates and incidents have been grouped this is good news rather than bad news for it gives one measure of the effort necessary to keep thetan aberrated and gives us the reason some persons wont rr or get ta motion who otherwise might for all gpms may be falsely dated and if correctly dated might run this does not mean that r3n or r3r are in any way changed or that one does not run gpms it does mean that slight variation in r3r is needed when false track is found in order to make the dating easier on it this will be called r3t it consists of r3r plus clever methods of dating that get past implanted dates meanwhile be very careful in dating dates released on anything may be accurate including the helatrobus implants im sorry if this held anybody back but as usual you know as soon as i know so carry on get ta action on your pc but be very cautious about accepting dates without checking is this incident and date in false past is this incident and date in false future the best trick is to find if right now or as in the betweenlives implants the year zero exists in the false track and date it was the year zero hundreds of years ago thousand etc clever eh some of you have been groaning about these skillions of trillions of years theyre usually found early on in auditing only on false track good hunting l ron hubbard founder188hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 20 august ad 13 central orgs missions scientology three four r3rr3n the preclears postulates we have long known that the preclears postulates made at the time of the incident contained charge as the preclear is moved back on his time track beyond trillions three you will find that incidents and reliable items contain less charge proportionately to the pc who was stronger then and that the pcs postulates made then contained more charge in short as you go earlier on the time track the incidents seemed weaker to the pc then and the pc being more capable had stronger postulates thus it is not uncommon to find gpm on the early track producing only falls on the pc and the pcs postulates made at that time rocket reading or falling this in fact gets even more disproportionate so that on the very early track you might find that running ris out of gpm produces ta motion but taking the pcs postulates out produces ta blow down that goes through 7 around the whole ta dial and back up in my recent surveys of the tone arm and its relationship to auditing it became apparent that three types of charge existed in gpm 1charge as an engram 2charge as reliable items 3charge as postulates all three must be removed from gpm any incident wherever it is on the track contains postulates comments considera tions directions made by the pc at that time thus in all incidents the pcs postulates must be called for and removed to remove postulate from any incident have the pc repeat it until it longer reacts on the needle of the meter if it comes down to persistent tick get suppress off it and get189it repeated again just as in the case of any ri in gpm dont leave postulates charged treat them like gpm items whether in gpm or an engram add to your arc break l lists l3 and l4 have we bypassed any postulates there are implants which tell the pc not to erase his own postulates there is also bear series goal to postulate sometimes the postulate lies ahead of the actual engram in r3r example man decides to get hurt then enters into an engramic situation the engram does not wholly free until the postulate is removed occasional calling for any postulates considerations or comments you had in this incident while running r3r engrams or r3n will keep the incident going well when the pc says one have him or her repeat it until it longer reacts on the needle i bring this up at this time as i have found case that got ta action on engrams or gpms or rrs on ris until the postulates were given special attention at which time ta action of an excellent kind occurred summary stuck ta is always caused by running the pc above the pcs tolerance of charge you can stop any ta by ramming the pc into incident after incident without cleaning them up postulate is only one kind of charge at any position on the time track also look for the pcs postulates early on the time track expect them to occasionally blow the meter apart flatten any postulate found by getting it repeated until the reaction is gone off the needle and all charge of course on anything whether falls or rrs must be removed

train gpms the marcab between lives implants this is rough fast survey of the train gpms and the between lives implants and the pattern used the data involved in all this is of great scope and as it concerns all the peoples of earth considerable more work will be done on it as these are the most involved and lowtoned implants on the time track it is recommended that other earlier gpms be completed before the between lives material is tackled after all tone arm action is the important thing and any earlier gpm that gives it makes the between lives implants and train gpms easier to run so program for earlier gpms however pcs do get into the between lives implants and do connect with the gpms there and in the train gpms so the pattern and data is released where possible run earlier gpms in any event safe rule is to run whatever gpm you can get your hands on and date as little as possible in 3n the train goals these are given to the being on his first contact with the marcab invasion force in this sector of the universe thus the train gpms date from hundreds of years ago to hundreds of thousands of years ago earlier on the track there are lots of trains such as in the invisible picture gpms so the mere existence of train in the implant doesnt make it the train implants this is established by date the implanting is done from huge train station the announcer through speakers on the platform gives continual running fire of wrong dates and directions and orders to depart and return to this point and you dont know when this happened to you lot of hellos and goodbyes and false information191the being is put in railway carriage quite like british railway coach with compartments speakers are to the right and left in the compartment the train is backed up rapidly through eight pairs of stands eight on either side of the track sixteen in all these spray white energy against the side of the carriage none of the white energy touches the pc one pair of ris fires during the whole backward run between the stands and then reversing in the speakers fires all the way forward again one pair of ris in the pattern then fires complete round trip then the next pair fire for complete round trip forward and back and so on there are then sixteen repeats for each pair 8 forward and 8 back before the next pair the pattern is as follows list for oppterm remaining terms use the whole phrase of the goal to be oppterm not oppterm all complete goal nothing complete goal best complete goal not best complete goal inevitable complete goal questionable complete goal doubted complete goal certain complete goal accursed complete goal commendable complete goal unforgivable complete goal forgivable complete goal hopeless complete goal hopeful complete goal single ri thats your goal at the start of each goal or pair perhaps face may come up and say you still here get out get off this train we hate you and from the speakers this happened to you yesterday tomorrow now this is your departure point keep coming back youll be meeting all your friends here when youre killed and dead keep coming back you havent chance to get away youve got to report in this happened to you days ago weeks ago years ago you dont know when this happened to you we hate you get out dont ever come back theres lot more of this including how youll be pulled and pulled when youre dead until you come back lot of wrong dates are also thrown in the type of goal is of the worst negative dichotomy to be caught to be wrong to go away to commit suicide etc the gpm to end begins the series there is large number of gpms in the series this series may have been given the pc on entrance to the marcab confederacy plus or minus 200000 years ago and then again much later just before the first between lives implant as preliminary step before the actual between lives implant it is therefore important to run these train gpms before trying to run the between lives implant itself for all these gpms are repeated again in the between lives implant192in running these train gpms be sure to get the first pair on their first fire there is standard swinging arm crossing signal that sounds at the end of each run of the train trains play large part in implanting there are lots of pictures of them lots of rails way earlier than the train gpms but earlier ones are given inside coach this is what makes it nightmarishthe white energy only hits the coach sides not the pc the rush of the train puts heavy kinesthetic into the engram the goals to start to stop to change make the pc feel he cant control the train to be unable to be instantaneous various perceptions are all in this series of train gpms if its bad its there the between lives implant this implant properly has six parts lpcs actual death not in first one given 2first screen section to left giving false death many gpms calculated to obliterate memory and group the time track and some pictures containing groupers this says it is 15 days long 3the main screen purporting to give the future trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years from the year zero on this the pcs past implants get stuck up 4the next hundred days screen on the right of the main screen giving number of positive dichotomy gpms to fit the negative dichotomy goals on the first screen section 2 this also contains false projection to earth into baby complete with sonic on the delivery room home bedroom with oatmeal wall paper or the current fashion on earth 5the actual kickoff from the implant station not by projection to earth but being dumped on earth 6the actual search for baby the main screen is long white board with grate near the top all the way along there is roar in the whole place like blowers going huge numbers of earlier gpms stack up on 2 lots of earlier implants stack up on the main screen the whole operation is huge grouper but given good ta action it all eventually flies apart especially if many earlier gpms and the train gpms are run first with good ta action the pc has had at least two series of train implants and perhaps as many as 300 between lives implants in the last many thousands of years therefore the way to program all this is to run mainly earlier gpms on the pc then the train gpms then any more earlier gpms that can be found and then the between lives implants the between lives implants and the train gpms have the full intention of installing compulsion to return and feeling the pc can be reached by them and be pulled about and wiping out all memory of former life193but any pc can be run on earlier gpms in spite of all this the reason this and other screen implants acts as grouper is because it restimulates earlier track charge which then pushing forward toward pt crushes the incidents and gpms on the screen of course it is all wrong dated and wrong durationed and this contributes to the crush of the material toward pt but basically it is simply restimulated charge on the early track that presses toward pt and shoves the pc into the screen implant therefore if you just restimulate and do not run early track gpms when found eventually you will find your pc crushed up against recent times and in these between lives screens if life and these screen incidents have not already done it this is the secret of the amnesia restimulate enough early track charge and do not discharge it and the being will have amnesia on the whole track if you are monkeying about on the backtrack and just partially discharging incidents going on to something new all the time failing to run series of gpms completely when you find them after while past track will become unreal to the pc then it will blot out and vanish and you will only have these between lives type of implants to work with then if you flub them your pcs pictures will disappear the danger signal is decreasing ta action this all occurs on the mechanism of early track restimulation compounded with wrong dates and wrong durations so the way to handle any pc is to locate or spring off the bank early gpms or implants and run them fully lack of tone arm action may upset this program but it is mainly gpms that stick tone arms since they stall time pc is in danger if earlier track is becoming less real or is vanishing or the bank is pressing forward and landing on screens the remedy is take what was already restimulated earlier particularly gpms any gpms and run them thoroughly 1 as gpms 2 as engrams and 3 as pcs postulates this discharges them keep this up be thorough dont restimulate more than you discharge fully and the pcs pictures will come back on and the track go straight again the above gives you the right way to handle the between lives implants peel off the gpms from it meaning early track gpms restimulated on it and visible on the screen and run them fully before taking something else off the screen to run thus one does not really run between lives implant until very late on case the auditor uses it when it appears on case l to realize that the earlier track has been restimulated too much and too little discharged from it and 2 to find earlier gpms to run excessive restimulation and flopping about on the early track and running nothing clean will inevitably bring the pc forward and up against the between lives implants194so the auditor who restimulates and does not run early track material when found is doing dangerous thing the between lives implants create amnesia only because they restimulate early track and dont discharge it if they didnt do this they would not produce the same effect therefore auditing undoes this mechanism only when early track incidents are thoroughly run when contacted the worst sinner is the gpm so never fail to run any early track gpm completely when found with its whole series dont go skipping about going earlier omitting goals leaving gpm incompletely discharged otherwise you will make the acquaintance with the between lives implant area if you know of any early gpm series left unhandled on the pc run it completely before restimulating anything else and if you are running the between lives implant grab off of it any earlier gpm or incident you can find and take it early and run it dont stay with the screen peel things off it that are earlier and run them otherwise the pcs bank will feel like crumbling forward into pt like an avalanche this mechanism of the production of unawareness by restimulating but not running charge on the early track is itself an important discovery it forbids then browsing through the early track sip here datum there be thorough or crash out goes the lights into pt slides the pc with thousand volts driving him on if you know of any early track gpm on your pc that can be run with tone arm motion clean it up as gpm clean up all the gpms in that series run it as an engram run any and all postulates out of it get it clean and then find something else the cycle of pc in total amnesia at start of auditing would be if audited with good ta action 1contacts yesterday 2contacts this life 3contacts childhood 4contacts past life 5contacts incidents on this planet in the past few

12goes ot if you try to rush this by practicing unthoroughness from 5 on then when pc reaches 9 above you will suddenly find him on the between life screens you will have overcharged early track and failed to discharge it and the result will be 8contacts earlier gpms but has trouble holding position on the track to run them and is arc breaky 9acontacts earlier material but it groups and scrunches and sticks together 10acollides with screen implants like the between lives there are earlier ones 11acant keep pictures apart things easily wrong dated and is very arc breaky and is stuck in between lives 12acant reach the early track and at session starts is found to be stuck in this lifetime there is shortcut back to finding when he started to make pictures the phenomenon of early charge pushing the pc back toward pt if not run defeats any such attempt so making an ot is keeping the ta going with itsa line in and being thorough on early track incident running if the pc has gotten into condition 12a above or is approaching it dont waste time on endless dating just find any early gpm already partially run the earliest one you can lay your hands on without restimulating others and run it completely then find another and another and shun all new material until you have completely handled the old and dont let the pc wander around on the early track just find and run gpms and clean up fully whatever you find or youll be sitting there reading this hcob despairingly trying to get your pc off between lives screen even if these listed evils occur however you have not lost the ta action already gained if misguidedly on the case and the matter is easily repaired providing you redo what youve left undone and this time be neat and restimulate the case otherwise as little as possible he

amplifies hco bulletin of 8 may 1963 missions all saint hill graduates scientology four important actual goals this hco bulletin should be of great interest to older saint hill graduates the actual goals and items of the preclear are several thousand times more aberrative than implant gpms i have covered the entire scope of implanted goals and implants in general and we are fortunate to have all this material an auditor must know it to cope with class iv auditing as these implant gpms become confused with actual goals problem masses on meter further the implanted gpm gives the student auditor marvelous training ground for running actual gpms and it is recommended that the implant gpm be studied and some of them run before the auditor tries to handle actual gpms furthermore it was wise to know all the tricks out there before we went so i had to collect them for you confusion between implant and actual gpms occurs because the implanters used types of goals and patterns found in actual gpms implanters obviously had knowledge from historical record or even research of what thetans own goals look like but obviously they never developed the data to workable therapy or they probably would not have continued to be driven to such costly expedients as continuous implanting between lives installations etc the highest level of treatment technology known to exist in the universe before scientology was pictureology wherein at signal from the therapist the thetan crunched up the engram this is currently in use and has been for many trillions of years in the galactic confederation there are few further complications to it except putting the thetan under control with sleep lights pictureology is very close to implanting the practitioner gets picture of the scene of the accident holds it before the thetan and snaps pair of bars not unlike cine clap sticks before the thetan the thetan eventually gets the idea and angrily or otherwise duplicates the action of the stick by crunching his own engram there are numerous kinds of traps and ways of catching and freezing thetan these are categorized as projectile which shoot thetan usually with beams or lights luring which cause thetan to inspect pole which trap thetan with his own energy prison which imprison the thetan and maze which confuse thetan temperature and perhaps chemicals are used to paralyze thetan once caught all other mental activities are done by implanting screen implants cause the thetan to put his pictures up on screen where they are misdated and scrambled picture implants simply show the thetan pictures which he recoils from or takes to be his own picture implants are also occasionally filled with false dates they give the thetan false pasts and futures they often repeat the actual beginning and ending of the incident in picture form making it hard to get before or after the implant as one sees pictures of his arrival and departure and so thinks he is not into the implant or out of it goal implants are the third and most serious type of implant they take goal and pattern197of items with left and right firing poles or jets and implant terminals and opposition terminals the pattern is too regular gpm not unlike thetans own gpms this confuses the thetan as to his own goals and seeks to scramble his own goals and items the implanted gpm gets confused into the thetans own gpms and often in running thetans own goals and items one gets into implant goals or items and vice versa one only needs to straighten it out by carefully asking on the meter if this is an installed goal or items or an actual one the things one runs for gain today on the pc are 1r1c itsa line 2r2t dating somatics 3r2h arc breaks 4r3sc service facsimile clearing 5r4m2 formerly r3m2 finding goals is done via r3sc r4m2 listing takes the first rr on the item list the auditor stops the pc and reads the item and says is this your item and concludes then the usual r3m2 steps the change of designation from r3 to r4 is to agree with the new levels of scientology all routine 3 materials are now called routine 4 because it belongs in level 4 ot engram running by chains remains r3 and is used for this lifetime r3n running implant goals is now r4n and is otherwise unchanged r4m2 is unchanged except for letting the pc itsa whether or not the rring item is his or her item one doesnt let the pc have an item that doesnt rocket read on being called ______________ it is almost amusing to note how hard implanters work and what overts they must feel they run up and to note as well that if it were not for thetans own goals problem masses they could effect nothing harmful how hard they work and all for nothing they are not the source of aberration they merely make the universe seem more unpleasant as for creating aberration they could not sleep lights screens falsepicture projectors goal implants alike are wholly innocuous compared to the thetans own goals problem masses one aberrates himself and if he did not nobody else could ______________ the service facsimile is in actual fact the two top reliable items of the last present time pcs actual goals problem mass this does not prevent one from using r3sc on the contrary this makes r3sc work the pcs present time current goal can be used as service facsimile if accidentally found providing one uses it in r3sc process with in this lifetime appended to every command employed198programing r4m2 in programing r4m2 1if you find an actual correct goal of the pc run it only if it is the present time latest goal on the track if not do goal oppose lists until you do find the present time goal 2unless youve done lot of rlc and r3sc on the pc the present time over restimulation keeps the present time goal or any actual goal from being found 3it is easier to find an implant goal than an actual goal so carefully ask about it and sort out any goal on the meter 4get the pcs actual present time gpm before you do any r4m2 on it dont go listing items on backtrack gpm 5start present time actual gpm by listing for the top terminal its easier to find the top terminal for the pt gpm is usually truncated incomplete 6go on down through the gpm to the goal 7find the next goal below the present time one list the present time goal as an ri to find the top oppterm of the next goal note this step is optional bank can be cleaned up without finding the next goal below never include this step if your pc is getting less than 20 divs of down ta per session as you wont find the lower gpm until you have completed the one youre working so omit finding next goal on low ta motion pcs and find it ollly when all other steps are taken 8go back to the present time gpm read the items already found on the line plot to the pc take the highest one nearest pt that ticks complete the list from which it came from not the list that opposes it or it opposes 9using the new item found continue r4m2 on the current gpm 10when more items exist in the top present time gpm prepcheck the goal and all auditing on goals and items 11go to the next gpm for which you already have the top oppterm and continue with r4m2 12use the same steps used on the present time gpm to run and clean up each gpm in turn gpms are run from the latest nearest present time back down the track items are found from the latest top nearest present time to earlier always the pcs reality is always greatest at the nearest to pt end of any gpm matter how far back they are overlisting lists is all that gets the pc skipping about and into other gpms so keep the lists very short 510 items just until the first rr is seen list only until the item being listed from does not tick on test keep the pcs itsa line in let the pc say it is or isnt his but dont let the pc have an item that doesnt rr dont worry the pc about tone arm or auditing actions let the pc run his bank you run the199session do careffil case analysis arc break lists and case analysis liststo be publishedwhen the case goes wrong find lots of reliable items if you dont let the pc have lots he has nothing to itsa therefore you get less tone arm action actual gpms give far more ta action than implants on r4n the implant gpm routine that uses line plots the pcs own line plot is quite individual like the original line plot for to scream in hcobs implant gpms are all pattern same ris every time it is easy on overlisting or listing only by blowdown as has been tried for the pc to skip ris or get into wrong gpms the auditor must be careful not to run an actual gpm below the goal as an item and into the next gpm the only thing that will turn off the pcs rocket read is running items out of gpm for which one does not have the goal running backtrack gpm before the present time gpm is run or skipping gpm going back sows the earlier line plot with items from the missed gpm the pcs current actions are always explained by the pair of items nearest present time this is true for all gpms matter how far back youve run the pc has only small number of actual gpms less than 50 perhaps more than 20 the length of the time track is infinitely greater than one supposes trillions one hundred is not the start of track thats trillion written one hundred times one seldom dates in r4m2 and only then to orient some item worrying the pc that has gotten out of place and only then by order of magnitude of years ago anything worrying the pc or reducing his capability or life potential is to be found in actual items or goals not in engrams or implants these are not primary causes only the pcs own goals and items are capable of basically causing the trouble the whole explanation of how an ri forms lies in the discussions of the service facsimile and the original explanations of the goals problem mass 1962 ______________ i am sorry to have caused auditors of this period to work so hard on r3n implant goals but without this data and understanding found between may and september of 1963 actual gpms are impossible to handle as one gets into implants pcs confront of his own gpms is increased by running implant gpms providing ta action occurs in sufficient quantity after running few implant gpms one comes up to contempt for their aberrative value the pc is lucky who has run few before tackling his own gpms the pcs own goals and items are the final road to ot l

bank is composed of things thing that have mass these things are gpms reliable items locks on gpms and items implants implant reliable items locks on implants and implant items and goals of the thetan with or without items and gpms attached gpm has mass actual mass it has density weight and size it can be measured reliable item has mass and size implants locks and actual goals of the thetan have mass this mass is caused by by the suppression of the things by the thetan only nonimplant gpms and ris have any aberative value on the thetan the others are merely confusion factors the bank is composed of these masses and nothing else when gpm or ri or ris or gpms are pulled out of line by restimulation and brought into present time they impinge upon the body when this happens in auditing we say the pc has the creak when this happens in life the doctors say he has an incurable case of lumbosis when one of these masses is restimulated out of line the thetan then has mass bearing down on him large ugly heavy black mass mass that brings pressure against his body mass that tries to inhabit the same space the thetan is inhabiting with his body and when two or more such masses may get restimulated ow restimulation of these masses all the time in life auditing is handling these masses all the time matter what level of auditing it is when you are having pc simply talk about his like and liovingness as with r1c or you are doing r2c slow assessment or you are doing r3sc or an r4 case analysis any one of these you are handling the masses of the bank gpms ris etc the pc is looking at these masses matter what you are running201r4m2 is the only technology which asises or gets rid of these masses on the pc in any combination not only could pc get the creak but the croak now since the bank has its own snarled up ares in it from life restimulation already any auditor is going to make errors running r4m2 when he runs into an already snarled up area of the bank if the auditor is trained in r4m2 he will know how to unsnarle the bank and correct his error but the auditor who is not trained in r4m2 does not know how to unsnarle an already snarled bank and who attempts to run r4m2 will run into snarled area make mistakes and these masses will fall in on the preclear result pc with the croak good way to make mds rich perhaps so the point is matter what you are doing with the pc matter what auditing technique you are using you are handling and having the pc look at itsa the masses called gpms ris etc and as long as you dont try to run these masses out if you are not trained in r4m2 but run r1 r2 or r3 techniques your pc will get better and better and wont croak stick to auditing levels i ii iii until you have been trained in r4m2 youll get plenty of charge off and make keyedout clears and the pcs will be happy another point is that pc cannot be run on r4m2 unless he knows what gpm an ri etc is anyway r4m2 is for educated pcs ots are made with r4m2 when run

technology for which has been fully released an indicator is condition or circumstance arising in an r6 auditing session which indicates whether the session is running well or badly and if badly what

routine action should be undertaken good indicators abound in properly run session here are some good indicators pc cheerful pc cogniting on items or goals pcs items found are the ones the pc thought

session ________________ the good indicator tells you things look the way they ought to look and are going the way they have to go to make an ot when these good indicators are absent then is the time to start doing searches repairs etc in actual practice you get so used to good indicators that you dont really think of them as indicators at all therefore you keep your attention alert or bad indicators and when these show up you have to act and promptly like many other things in this universe you dont concentrate on the smooth you stay alert for the rough but it is great mistake for an auditor to be so nervous about bad indicators that the pc is thrown into whatsit when nothing is wrong things will go wrong then for sure the rule is expect good indicators and go on with routine actions as long as they are present observe quickly and knowingly bad indicators and rapidly act with the correct response every bad indicator is precise easily observed and has an exact counteraction the speed with which bad indicator is observed and the certainty with which it is corrected prevents the session from producing more bad indicators observe the trouble sign instantly know what to do for that exact sign instinctively repair swiftly and in these points we have the whole secret of fast progress it is not the pc who slows the session it is the auditors lack of knowledge of bad indicators and their remedies the longer bad indicator goes unobserved and unrepaired the longer it will take to repair it in r6 errors consume time far far out of proportion to successes one overlooked bad indicator can consume month of auditing time in that month three whole banks could have been run but the month is consumed with unproductive wanderings the pc and auditor torn to bits with stress and arc breaks its all matter of indicators and knowing what to do if that knowledge is poor thenwell ot thats all the road is traveled with total correctness only it is never traveled at all when unremedied bad indicators are present the auditor is either totally competent or totally incompetent there are shades of gray one error unremedied puts the whole project on the dump heap so the auditor has to know his business and so does the pc and errors cant be let205go by this is the routine of perfection sloppy hopeitwillgetby wellitdoesnt matter attitudes will not make ots any error passed up and neglected will within minutes or sessions wreck the lot miss gpm or half dozen items and within two banks the pc will bog completely and hopelessly and never progress further until the earlier error is remedied its like having pc on rubber bands the pc will go down the track from an error just so far and then as though the bands tighten to drag him back will run slower and slower and then suddenly one is faced with pc who cant run at all but these errors are not undetectable the instant they occur bad indicator shows up the speed errors are remedied determines the speed of advance of the case the dontcare hopeitwillgetby whyrepair auditor just cant audit r6 and will only seriously mess up pcs this is the condition of the final road out i wish it were different but it isnt its that way an auditor can know his business there is finite specific answer for every bad indicator that shows up therefore an auditor to succeed in r6 must 1know basic auditing and meters and itsa like an old smoothie 2know the anatomy of gpms ris and the objects of the mind and all their possible combinations like card sharp knows cards 3know the techniques of r6 like completely relaxed

rules of r6 ratatattat given those six things an auditor can make an ot in under thousand hours weakness on any one of them will not only not make an ot but will fiendishly mess up case for even if

occasionally comes to my attention that auditors entering classes v and vi do not believe meter can be made to read big they settle for ticks tiny falls etc of the sort that can be found usually in getting mid ruds in in all auditing up to class v the usual meter needle read is around an eighth to quarter of an inch long at sensitivity 16 the mark v is designed to give good serviceable reads for the lower classes of auditing and is quite wonderful at it but the moment you enter the wide vistas of class v the whole character of meter needle behavior changes you go from tiny read to big read in classes v and vi tiny reads are used only for mid ruds as they were in lower levels but in all work in goals case analysis plotting finding items checking things out etc reads are enormous new horizon of metering dawns and an auditor coming up through the lower levels entering class v and vi work just doesnt believe it most of his early mistakes in checking out goals or finding the wrongnesses are entirely based on this he thinks tiny read is enough and he uses it whereas he really must never use small read for this work if goal is real gpm it will read with great intermittent inconsistent slashes if an analysis of situation is brought to the right answer the meter needle falls hugely the trouble is that the auditor just doesnt press on looking for the right answer and settles for ticksbecause he cant think up the right combination the right combination gpm or lock on an implant will send the needle racing all mistakes on goals or situations in classes v and vi can be traced to failure to appreciate that metering is different at these levels the sensitivity at class vi has to be kept around 4 you only use sensitivity 8 or 16 to get in since mid ruds on all r6 work you shut the meter down you cant keep the needle at set if you use sensitivity higher than 4 heres class v or vi student fiasco based on using class iii expected meter behavior on highlevel work auditor finds goal on list that ticks 18 asks if its the correctly worded goal gets tick 116 runs it on the pc pc collapses heres the real way it should have been auditor finds goal on list that only ticks gets in suppress and invalidate on the list renulls finds another goal gets in suppress on it gets third of dial instant slash all goals and items must instant read checks it out until he gets 3 prior slash on actual gpm gets 2 slightly latent or prior slash on correctly worded gives it to the pc and pc thrives209its not asking the right question what it really is that gives you ticks in fact tick with sharp edge at class v or vi really means wrong question asked big reads are the only reads you buy at class v and vi learn the right questions to ask about the character or nature of what youre examining and you get the big falls rrs etc so its lack of knowledge of track analysis that makes the auditor fall back on small reads and hell fail the second stage of desperation enters at class v and vi when the student hammered by the instructors still cant get big reads through lack of knowledge of the track and what things can be the student then abandons all he knew about body motion causing needle reaction the quickly exhaled breath the shuffled feet the can fling about the stretch the can bang all cause big surges so the auditor encourages the pc to shout goals and items or fling himself about so the meter will react big this of course will spin the pc getting charge off running wrong goals and ris by the time the student auditor is trained not to take body motion shout or breath reads his track analysis has also improved and he starts to ask the right questions and gets his big reads with the pc quiet as lamb i never touch ta during the pcs body movement this loses ta of course since pc is most likely to move when an ri starts to discharge i never buy goal unless ive seen it instant read bang on the last letter i never ask the character of anything to instant read ie is this an implant gpm because it may go on anticipate or arrive latent and do i get ta on the pc in goals finding and plotting you dont expect much ta yet in six consecutive sessions i built ta few divisions more per session from 70 ta down divisions to 103 ta down divisions in 212hour sessions and all by never buying tick only big rrs or falls gradual build of ta shows all is well so classes v and vi are not only big read classes but they are big ta classes as well as you are handling the basic sources of charge on case in classes v and vi you expect big meter behavior and you get it only ignorance of the track keeps the auditor in the small read small ta departments if you keep on trying to get what it really is until you have it you will always see big read on what it is you wouldnt expect to handle high voltage wires with tiny sparks you would expect huge arcs to crackle similarly with the materials of classes v and vi if you dont believe meter will read big at classes v and vi then you havent learned yet to find the right things and ask the right questions and if you settle for ticks or have to make the pc yell items to get big reads youll soon have very messed up case on your hands so its different meter behavior at the higher classes expect it look for it and make it r d l ron hubbard founder210hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead

administration if the pc gives you any goal for all our sakes please record it in that sessions auditors report or in his papers if he is not in session and if the pc thinks of goal it must be written down and handed over to the auditor to be recorded with the date noted any goal that is offered must become matter of record so that it can be located by date dont lose the pcs goals attach them to reports and worksheets that are dated out of thousands of goals offered you may just glide over the key goal if you have recorded it by date it can be recovered if you havent then i dont know what youll do how to recover goal if pc develps bad somatic the chances are goal has been invalidated or lost and invalidated the only way you can get somatic in r6 is actually to invalidate gpm skip it miss it fail to pick it up the invalidation of the gpm causes the somatic all human suffering basically stems from invalidated gpms and they are of course all skipped or missed and nobody has picked them up before we came along thus when pcs case is going badly and the pc has nagging somatic the cause is an invalidated gpm gpm therefore has been skipped missed or been refused this is sweeping fundamental somatics meaning mostly pain in this case are caused by skipped refused or missed gpms the exception is the sick stomach this is always caused by wrong goal somatics meaning pain or lots of sensation are caused by skipped missed or refused gpms sick stomachs not cold stomach are caused by wrong goals cold stomachs are caused by misplaced wrongly plotted gpms cold body is caused by implant gpms or wildly misplotted actual gpm that may also be an implant gpm thus we see that skipped missed or refused gpm is the only one that causes pain or sensation and we can see that skipping missing or refusing gpm all add up to211invalidating it wrong goal wont ruin case neither will the inclusion of an implant goal in the plot ruin case they only make the pc uncomfortable and will eventuall be found and thrown out but the missed or refused goal once gone into the discard may have been vital to the case and now being heavily invalidated may never come up again so the gpm invalidated by being missed or refused is the dangerous one if the pcs records are in order and legible if the auditor has recorded all goals mentioned by the pc the missed or refused gpm can be located how this is an actual case the pcs goals plot just wouldnt assemble the pc was in considerable pain goal has been invalidated gave third of dial surge the invalidation was dated on the meter the session reort for that date was looked up and there recorded was goal the pc had offered the auditor had refused since it wouldnt read this goal was checked out and was found to be one of series of four gpms that monitored the goals plot it had never again occured to the pc it was so invalidated it seemed completely unreal to the pc it was so unreal that every goal mentioned in that session had to be nulled as goals list to find it only one goal gave the big invalidated surge first noticed and only after prepcheck 5 minutes did it read as it had already been invalidated by life it didnt read when the auditor called it in that session and the auditor had not gotten in supress or invalidate on it there was the whole case stalled if the auditor had not recorded it in that session report where it had date on it it would have been completely lost in that session the pc had merely mentioned it as possible goal the auditor had said that didnt read month later the pc started getting pains within four months the pc became very hard to audit tjhe lessons here are that one can date an invalidation or supression and that an auditor must record every goal mentioned by pc and make it part of the records coupled with date that was close call so if your pc is running with pain goal has beem missed or refused it will read that goal has been invalidated the invalidation read can be dated and if recording has been done the goal can be recovered these are probably some of the most important case repair facts of r6 l ron hubbard lrh jw copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights

perhaps for beginning class vi auditor to accept is that he or she must get proper identification of what the goal is experience will eventually make citizen out of the auditor on this subject after wrapping pc around few telegraph poles with wrong goals and bad goals plot the auditor now in shock realizes the terrible importance of proper goals identification but why wait there are two reads both important each must be good fall or rr 2 or 3 long 1goal read to be given any attention or identification drill goal must read this can be l chug or fall or rr but it must read if the goal has been suppressed or wronged if it is charged the suppress or wrong buttons will produce l to 3 read the goal charge transfers to suppressed or invalidated thus either by itself or suppress or invalidate goal must read or must have read to be given any identification drill 2identification read any goal that has read must now be identified what is it this read must be long fall or rr sizable read not tick or 14 flick this is the identification read to be accepted or discarded goal must have 1 goal read and 2 an identification read it is 2 the identification read that auditors neglect dont believe in become upset about and yet lack of it is the only real way to wreak pc of the two the identification read is the more important new pcs grow resistive they dont believe the identification read is important either so they protest and sell and gum their meter up its my goal so why etc etc so the auditor nervous about an arc break comes off identification without finding out what the goal is gives it to the pc and then wonders why the pc starts going to pieces it is not kind it is very cruel indeed for the auditor to skip identification213another way an auditor gets around it is to take reads on what the pc says not what the auditor asks both goal read and identification reads must be taken only when the auditor says it the read must occur on the auditors call not the pcs the read when the pc says it must repeat when the auditor says it or it isnt true new class vi auditor runs out of questions in identification his knowledge of track is not up to really identifying the goal and so the new auditor comes to believe that identification reads are impossible to get and so stops trying or blames the pcs metering it isnt ever the pcs metering its lack of auditor knowledge and persistence the session tape of march 18 1964 has lot of identification drill on it in each case the goal was made to read nice long fall on what it was the drill is not pattern or an assessment list here are some questions for identification to woof is that correctly worded actual goal does to woof form 18 ris is it and actual gpm is it an implant gpm is it both an actual and an implant gpm is it lock on an actual gpm is it lock on an implant gpm is it lock on an actual ri is it lock on an implant ri is to woof gpm is it only goal is it just an item on list is it an idea you had does to woof have lot of mass connected with it is it phrase from an engram the above are the basic questions an auditor should be able to rip them off in torrent and vary them two long falls is enough to identify and there is always long fall available believe it or not if it falls well on correctly worded actual gpm thats it you go further but if it doesnt you must find out why it read any goal that has read will read hugely on what it is if you ask the right question to identify goal puts the pc at ease and completes the cycle of action of the214checkout it should take only two or three minutes it can get bizarre when standard questions fail then knowledge of the pc counts knowing the pc had had life in punjab on the 18th march session tape i asked if to be untouchable was an indian idea and got the first long fall after all else had failed to identify the main reason some auditors will have trouble with routine 6 will be their disbelief in the necessity to identify goal well by getting long read these auditors will have arc breaky pcs very soon will be balked and will be in endless trouble the severest lesson r6 teaches matter what i say is the necessity to identify goals you can suppress goal and arc break pc as youll find on the 18th march 1964 tape by failing to give the pc right goal but thats far far preferable to an apathetic shoveling out of anything that has goal read that way lies death the pc new to r6 gets impatient he or she only needs to experience the horror of few wrongly identified goals to become quiet as lambs during the identification step when identifying keep the pc posted that didnt read that ticked thats long fall and then say to the pc what fell to woof reads as lock on an implant gpm if its correctly worded actual goal get it in the bring about steps and oppose if any and get fall on the number and then give it to the pc is that your goal thats your goal _______________ failure to learn the knack of identifying goals debars the r6 auditor from any success failure to accurately identify goals that get read sets the pc up for catastrophe r6 moves smoothly only when goals found are properly identified by big read l ron hubbard

tone arm action summary of previous hco bulletins the state of case of the pc has nothing to do with getting tone arm action an auditor is in absolute control of the bankit always does what you tell it to do case must not be run without ta action or with minimal ta action if it didnt occur tone arm action has to have been prevented it doesnt just not occur the skill of an auditor is directly measured by the amount of ta he or she can get pcs are not more difficult one than another any pc can be made to produce ta but some auditors cut ta more than others the most vital necessity of auditing at any level of scientology is to get tone arm action not to worry the pc about it but just to get ta action not to find something that will get future ta but just to get ta now many auditors are still measuring their successes by things found or accomplished in the session though this is important too mainly at level iv it is secondary to tone arm action 1get good tone arm action 2get things done in the session to increase tone arm action and body motion doesnt count as ta without tone arm motion charge is being released and actual case betterment is observed beyond few somatics removed the pcs session goals stay the same the pcs life doesnt change the most correct track significances run but without ta ac tion will not change but can deteriorate case it takes the right process correctly run to get ta action so dont underrate processes or the action of the auditor ta moving signals auditor not to act ta not moving signals auditor to act your enemy is overrestimulation of the pc as soon as the pc goes into more charge than he or she can itsa easily the ta slows down and as soon as the pc drowns in the overrestimulation the ta stops clank unless destimulated case cant get rocket read or present the auditor with valid goal in doing r6 the silent auditor lets the pc itsa all over the whole track and causes overrestimulation which locks up the ta but in lower levels of auditing inviting an itsa with216silence is an ordinary action as soon as you get into level vi auditing however on the pcs actual gpms the auditor has to be crisp and busy to get ta and silent idle auditor can mess up the pc and get very little ta level vi auditing finds the auditor smoothly letting the pc itsa ris and lists but the auditor going at it like small steam engine finding ris ris ris goals ris ris ris for the total ta in an r6 session only is proportional to the number of ris found without goofs wrong goals or other errors which rob ta action so the higher the level the more control of the pcs attention only in r6 where youre dead on the pcs gpms and the pc is allowed to say it is or isnt can you get good ta action out of listing and nulling and even then failure to let the pc say it is it can cut the ta down enormously in confirmation of auditors being too anxious to get in the itsa line themselves and not let the pc is the fad of using the meter as ouija board the auditor asks it questions continually and never asks the pc up the spout go divisions of ta is this item terminal the auditor asks the meter why not ask the pc if you ask the pc you get an itsa i think its an oppterm because______ and the ta moves auditor failure to understand if pc says something and the auditor fails to understand what the pc said or meant the correct response is i did not hear you understand what was said get that last to do anything else is not only bad form it can amount to heavy arc break invalidation to say you did not speak loud enough or any other use of you is an invalidation the pc is also thrown out of session by having responsibility hung on him or her the auditor is responsible for the session therefore the auditor has to assume responsi bility for all comm breakdowns in it evaluation far more serious than invalidation above is the accidental evaluation which may occur when the auditor repeats what the pc said never repeat anything pc says after him matter why repeating not only does not show the pc you heard but makes him feel youre circuit but that isnt the main reason you do not repeat what the pc said after the pc if you say it wrong the pc is thrown into heavy protest the pc must correct the wrongness and hangs up217right there it may take an hour to dig the pc out of it dirty needles if your pc has dirty needle its cause is cut itsa or an l1 session arc break other source such as wrong item or goal or earlier engrams or service fac bypassed charge can cause dirty needle if its dirty needle its cause lies in basic auditing not in technique errors this rule is invariable the apparent exception is the session arc break that keys in bypassed technique charge all dirty needles are caused by the auditor failing to hear all the pc had to say in answering question or volunteering data charge is removed from case only by the comm cycle pc to auditor the auditors command restimulates charge in the pc the only way this charge can be blown is by the pc telling the auditor cleaning cleans the auditor who cleans clean meter is asking for trouble this is the same as asking pc for something that isnt there and develops withhold of nothing echo metering the pc says you missed suppress its and the auditor reconsults the meter asking for suppress that leaves the pcs offering an undischarged charge never ask the meter after pc volunteers button example youve declared suppress clean pc gives you another suppress take it and dont ask suppress again thats echo metering if pc puts his own ruds in dont at once jump to the meter to put his ruds in that makes all his offerings missed charge echo metering is miserable auditing dont echo invalidate echo invalidation the pc gives an item the auditor calls it back to the pc and says it doesnt rr if this is kept up the pc will be put into state of sensation that is appalling the right way to do this is as follows pc gives item218auditor writes it down all items are written down that the pc gives an auditor never repeats items to the pc after the pc says them if the auditor doesnt understand he asks pc to spell it or if it is singular or plural dont fake an understanding the list must be accurate echo invalidation in which pc names an item and auditor says that isnt it is not just bad form but very vicious practice that leads to games condition the invalidation of each item makes the pc very dizzy and very desperate the pc sick and confused starts plunging in desperation for the right item and goes swiftly down tone and out of session high pc morale is vital to blowing charge and finding ris uphold the pcs morale dont begin echo invalidation meter invalidation an auditor who just sits and shakes his head didnt rocket read can give pc too many loses and deteriorate the pcs ability to run gpms in conflict between pc and meter take the pcs data why because protest and assert and mistake will also read on meter you can get these off but why create them your data comes from the pc and the meter always for anything and if the pcs data is invalidated you wont get meters data if the pc says he has ptp and the meter says he doesnt you take the pcs data that he does you take the pcs data never take his orders also minimize pcs dependency on meter dont keep confirming pcs data by meter read with that reads yes thats there yes theres rocket read the meter is not there to invalidate the pc the emeter registers charge very high or low tone arm sticky or dirty needle all are registrations of this charge the chronic meter of case is an index of chronic charge the fluctuations of meter during session are registering relative charge in different portions of the pcs time track more valuably the meter registers released charge you can see it blowing on the meter the disintegrating rr the blowing down of the ta the heavy falls the loosening needle all show charge being released the meter registers charge found and then charge released it registers charge found but not yet released by the needle getting tight by dn by climbing ta or ta going far below the clear read then as this cleans up the charge is seen to blow charge that is restimulated but not released causes the case to charge up in that charge already on the time track is triggered but is not yet viewed by the pc the whole cycle of restimulated charge that is then blown gives us the action of auditing when prior charge is restimulated but not located so that it can be blown we get arc breaks auditing selectively restimulates locates the charge and discharges it as seen on the219action of moving tone arm the meter in actual fact does nothing but locate charged areas below the awareness of the pc and verify that the charge has been removed the meter cures nothing and does not treat it only assists the auditor in assisting the preclear to look and verify having looked meter dependence pc can be made more dependent upon the meter or can be made more independent of the meter all in the way meter is used by the auditor meter dependence is created by invalidation by or poor acknowledgement of the auditor if the auditor seems not to accept the pcs data then the pc may insist that the auditor see it read on the meter this can grow up into formidable meter dependence on the part of the pc pc must be carefully weaned of meter dependence not abruptly chopped off if pcs case is improving the pc becomes more independent of the meter this is the proper direction build up the pcs confidence in his own knowingness and continuously and progressively reduce the pcs dependence on meter as the pc gets along in running time track and gpms with their goals and reliable items he or she often becomes better than the meter as to what is right or wrong what is the goal what ri still reads charge charge the stored quantities of energy in the time track is the sole thing that is being relieved or removed by the auditor from the time track when this charge is present in huge amounts the time track overwhelms the pc and the pc is thrust below observation of the actual track the mechanism of permanent restimulation consists of opposing forces of comparable magnitude which cause balance which does not respond to current time and remains timeless such phenomena as the overt actmotivator sequence the problem postulatecounter postulate tend to hold certain portions of the time track in permanent creation and cause them to continue to exist in present time as unresolved masses energies spaces times and significances the intention of the physical universe and those who have become degraded enough to further only its ends is to make thetan solid immobile and decisionless the fight of the thetan is to remain unsolid mobile or immobile at will and capable of decision this in itself is the principal unresolved problem and it itself creates timeless mass which accomplishes the basic purpose of trap bypassed charge220bypassed charge does not always arc break but arc break always bypassed charge bypassed charge always exists in sessionit isnt until it is keyed in by some communication failure in session that it causes an arc break the source of all arc breaks is bypassed charge there is other source of arc breaks people do not arc break on known charge it is always the hidden or the earlier charge that causes the arc break the pc never knows why the arc break he may think he does and disclaim about it but the moment the actual reason is spotted the real missed area the arc break ceases all bypassed charge is in some degree missed withhold missed by both auditor and pc in session or handling the living lightning we handle people can be hit by forceful charge of which they are only minutely aware but which swamps them their affinity reality and communication life force is retarded or cut by this hidden charge and they react with what we call an arc break or have an arc broken aspect everything on the whole know to mystery scale that still lies above the pc finds the pc at effect these are all on automatic therefore the pc in an arc break is in the grip of the reaction which was in the incident now fully on automatic the pcs anger in the incident is not even seen or felt by the pc but the moment something slips the pc is in the grip of that emotion as an automaticity and becomes furious or apathetic or whatever toward the auditor as soon as the actual bypassed charge is found and recognized as the charge by the person up goes affinity and reality and communication and life can be lived the arc break the cycle of the arc break stage one the arc break starts always in the same way the pc finds something wrong with the auditor the subject or tools of auditing or the auditing room he does this in varying intensity arc break to arc break stage two this is followed by misemotion also directed at the auditor subject tools or room stage three if the auditor continues on with auditing the pc will drop into grief sadness or apathy this is an inevitable cycle and may be followed by the pc with greater or lesser intensity of emotion or loudness or lack of response221in r6 when the pc criticizes or attacks the auditor or goes into grief or apathy an r6 error has just occurred the auditor must ignore the pc s statements as to the cause of the arc break and quickly remedy the r6 and do nothing else the common denominator of all r6 arc breaks consists of missed or wrongly designated gpm goal or reliable item there are other sources of r6 arc breaks bad sessioning poor auditing ordinary life missed withholds are only contributive to r6 arc breaks and are incapable of doing more than keying in and intensifying the magnitude of the arc break which has already been caused by errors in r6 arc break rule 1 if the pc arc breaks issue further auditing commands until both pc and auditor are satisfied that the cause of the arc break has been located and indicated do not issue more orders do not run process do not offer to run process do not sit idly letting the pc arc break follow this rule arc break rule 2 when pc arc breaks or cant go on for any reason do an arc break assessment and locate and indicate to the pc the bypassed charge if you know youve missed goal or ri just saying so prevents any arc break dont bypass charge unknown to the pc arc break assessment the meter is invaluable in locating bypassed charge and curing an arc break the trick is to find and indicate the right bypassed charge to the pc and to handle it when possible but never fail to indicate it it is then up to the auditor to locate it more precisely as to character and time and indicate it to the pc the pc will feel better the moment the right type of bypassed charge is identified by assessment and indicated by the auditor if the pc does not feel better but further arc breaks then the assessment is either incomplete or incorrect if the pc blows up in your face on being given type of charge keep going as you have not yet found the charge you can however undo session arc break assessment by continuing beyond the pcs cognition of what it is continuing an assessment after the pc has cognited invalidates the pcs cognition and cuts the itsa line and may cause new arc break several bypassed charges can exist and be found on one list sometimes in trying to locate the bypassed charge causing an arc break the pcs needle is so dirty that it almost cant be read however there is way to read it when the correct bypassed charge is located and indicated the needle will go beautifully clean but it can be done without meter just by letting the pc think over each line read to him or her from the arc break assessment and say whether it is or isnt and if it is spotting the thing222bypassed dont ever be reasonable about an arc break and think the pc is perfectly right to be having one because____ if that arc break exists the pc doesnt know whats causing it and neither do you until you and the pc find it if you and the pc knew what was causing it there would be further arc break arc breaks are inevitable they will happen q and arc breaks q and causes arc breaks by bypassing charge how the pc says something the auditor does not understand or acknowledge therefore the pc s utterance becomes bypassed charge generated by whatever he or she is trying to release as the auditor ignores it and the pc reasserts it the original utterances charge is built up and up finally the pc will start issuing orders in frantic effort to get rid of the missed charge this is the source of pc orders to the auditor understand and acknowledge the pc take the pcs data dont pester the pc for more data when the pc is offering data learn to see if the pc has said everything he or she wants to say before the next auditor action never do new auditor action while or if the pc wants to speak and youll get superior ta action cut the pc off get in more actions than the pc is allowed to answer and youll have dirty needle then stuck ta and then an arc break realize that the answering of the process question is senior to the asking of another process question watch the pcs eyes dont take auditing actions if the pc is not looking at you dont give acknowledgements that arent needed overacknowledgement means ac knowledging before the pc has said all pc tone the pc rises in tone up to the lower levels of the tone scale he or she comes up to degradation up to apathy and it often feels horrible and unlike an arc break and the sad effect is not cured except by more of the same processing then suddenly they realize that they have come up to being able to feel bad they even come up to feeling pain and all that is gain l ron

sorts of actions other than r6 stopping nervously at every flicker of an eyelash to do arc break assessments or thrash about looking for imaginary faults 5pc flinch items wont read because pc scared green cure is to investigate flinch 6challenging r6 alignment forms materials or benefits form of flinch this is the source of more sickness or pains or bad needles than any other single fault it shows up as ticktocky needle small rs which turns on called tocky needle 7not letting the pc have items or progress which is bigger and worse form of arc break than leaving little charge 8not recognizing passed charge needle you dont have to do an arc break assessment for charge left on items already run if you recognize the queer chuggy reluctance of the needle to read when you see that you just scout for where rapidly get the charged item or bring about step release it quickly and go on needle on real items reads smooth contrary to earlier goal data if charge is left closer to pt than where you are where you are items wont read well 9beating items to pieces with excess steps you do minimal steps the vital ones are next oppterm or terminal please pc says it auditor says it it reads both times auditor says thats you item circles it on work sheet what is its relation to this gpm give the bring about steps auditor makes appropriate notes next terminal please 10not getting in all the bring about steps these are 3 in number example 3rd opp to second terminal b 3rd terminal to second opp c 3rd opp to 3rd terminal they are done only in this order there are brought about steps22811not using enough suppress or challenged has this ba been suppressed has this item form been previously knocked about has this sequence been questioned its done rapidly not flattened some times the suppress read only is taken then the item or step is asked again pc doesnt even answer the suppress question meanwhile one is alert for tocky needle and if it turns into one one just goes on 12taking care of trouble before it happens one always lets trouble catch up and manifest plainly before taking care of it 13not understanding the only times you go into patch up or nonrunning actions these are reads or bad reads b heat whatever c arc break heat does not always have to be present but it must not be continually absent 14not coming off patch up the moment tocky needle turns on 15the pc suppressed into the antisocial or reprehensible character of the goal this is now essentially very simple car to drive you were trained to run more complex vehicle the very fact that it is so simple require you to be trained so hard for you have to be honest expert and fast r6 itself will straighten out any physical or mental problem if you just get on with it there are on senior remedies other process will surpass it or remedy what it does except it other process or approach will straighten things up like it will providing its run r6 is quantitative its the number of ris run the number of gpms run quantity it may be ten gpms down the line before the pc wakes up in the morning without single ache pain or worry and even then that will last maybe ten minutes only whole series and the feeling lasts half the day the ground covered is proportional to the gain attained not even cognitions are important they sometime even restrain read pcs worry about not grasping how it bas can hold it up but the pcs ignoring the sense doesnt its just significance and mass run quantity of how many items how many gpms that determines gain what gpms are run determines very little its all just problem in ta after all but this ta comes from the release and vanishment of the imprisoner of all beings the reactive mind itself so get on with it note the easiest way to run team of gpms is 2 for 2 the auditor runs one gpm on the pc that has already been run on the auditor and then immediately one on the pc that has not been run on the auditor the team only then reverses and the team member now auditing audits one that has been run on him or her and one that has not this equalizes the strain keep the team at parity and is only fair certain amount of charge comes off the auditors bank as he or she audits it on another on the other hand it may get suppressed so use lot of suppressed as an auditor to get the bank clean when you get very far along theres yet another way to do this if youre brave so all is not lost l ron hubbard lrhdr copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved229hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex sthil students tech staff only scientology six star rated track analysis experience on routine 6 after and auditor has been auditing routine 6 for few sessions he or she may have observed occasionally the following 1a meter shutting off its reads 2items failing to blow down properly 3placement steps not reading 4pc tending to take over session control 5heat shutting off 6a meter reading poorly 7steps not going in with good reads these phenomena are gazed upon with dismay by the auditor and various wild cat actions may be taken to counter them these may include the following very high crimes 1just ignoring reads and plunging on without getting items to read 2actually lying about reads 3arc breaking the pc by overwhelm 4worrying and harassing the pc about the meter 5knocking off running gpms and getting in endless session considerations and bmss 6downgrading the pcs auditing level and starting in on problems and lower level processes 7deciding that he or she has been taught wrongly and trying to develop some new way 8listing for other types of goals 9just giving up now this picture im painting here is not the rule but the exception it doesnt happen to everybody but when it does the above may be the response there are two types of pcs pc type can run through anything and get reads heat and ta pc type b will shut off when he or she hits misplaced comma these two types are not different people they are different conditions of physical bone they have nothing to do with body age they may have alot to do with tiredness the pc who works hard all day will not read well on arrival in the auditing session after about two hours alot230of pcs just have their meter pack up if you were to audit type for 8 hours say until 2am you would suddenly have type b pc therefore the pc who doesnt get enough food or sleep or is just exhausted in life is type b pc for this is chronic with this pc being built into his or her living habits type b pc made to go early to bed and get 8 or 9 hours sleep made to eat breakfast and lunch and supper may become in few days type b pc but as we cant always guarantee this rest and food regimen and because general physical tone in life may require several months to remedy by improving livingness alone we are left with type b pc one can and should as and auditor try to make this type b pc into type by livingness discipline but one always count on doing so type pc will also pack up meter some sooner than others if you were doing night auditing you would find that type pc wonderful easy meter responses would be subject to pack up at some small hour of the morning some would suddenly go dead on the meter at 2am some at 3am some at 6am this if observed over time would demonstrate similar hours for the pack up the type pc who could be shoved through almost anything would standardly become type b at certain hour of the night the type b pc has packed up already lack of sleep lack of food nervous strain general physical weariness have caught up with type b so that its always 2am the moment of lifes lowest ebb even at 12 noon age even illness are actually outside this weariness factor now if you will go back and read your auditors code any auditors code back to 1951 i think you will find this covered at level six the matter becomes staggeringly important you could go on auditing at level vi or below for years without having the roof fall in you would just say it was just the pc or process used and that some pc didnt get ta and some did and try to argue it away but when you get to level vi you are looking the tiger straight in the eye the moment of truth arrives items dont read ta doesnt blow down and items are obviously right there to do so so whats wrong if an auditor doesnt know snap whats wrong he or she may follow the remedies ive listed above as high crimes type b pc is already so exhausted that by passed charge of any kind can be tolerated so to audit without reads without heat without blowdowns is far more serious than it would be on type pc on whom it would also be high crime so you see first things first youre right back to the auditors code of all things but now its run or wont run code follow it and the pc runs break it and youve had it total yes or total by passed charge231now aside from the type of pc you should learn by experience that this is the rule that applies items wont read when youve gone beyond an unrun charge conversely when items wont read you have charged area behind you honest its just that simple items are reading well heat on good charged area behind you items chugging small reading badly or not at all charge exists closer to the top of the bank than where you are you might as well learn this it isnt going to change it will save you from committing the high crimes above and failing utterly with your pc the pc who doesnt run at all where the pc doesnt read at all chronically just never reads type b extreme the charge is life exhaustion ows sleep keys in too much bank sleep rest ows level iv and below auditing will set this right but your pc who has already arrived at level vi should have has enough lower level auditing if however the pcs lower level auditing was never effective then you have quite problem the answer is not to go off r6 but to make this pc rest and eat if r6 still wont run go into defining ows and why auditing wont work ows will loosen up bank its superior processing but if your pc got to level 6 without effective earlier auditing rest and food and keeping on trying to get the beginning few items discharged are your best answers and until thats given very fine try one shouldnt revert to lower level auditing type b pcs now then how about the pc who ran two gpms and the meter packed up that may be rest and food in combination with the following but otherwise it is only the following charge has been missed thats all thats the only reason weariness and hunger excepted you suddenly fail to get reads ta blowdowns and heat yesteryear it could have been an improperly worded gpm or lot of things but you dont have wrongly worded gpms now unless you really goof in copying or go crazy enough to try to run one you or the pc found what could the charge be then gpm out of sequence missed gpm or more gpm in an incorrect series how could you have such well easy life scrambles the bank for one thing so the perfect series is pretty hard to plot earlier coaudit experience dealt with lot of sequence errors you might lose your place on the plot the pc comes into session and starts whole232gpm or 2 items lower than you left off and you dont notice it until there you are looking at packed up meter it ceases to work to go on is criminal why because thats the only way you can damage anything running gpm out of sequence isnt serious so long as its in the same series its just unfortunate and takes bit more time through corrections and patching it mainly slows down the rate of running by consuming just that much auditing time but running gpm without needle action on items or ta is criminal it means one hasnt learned that this indicates only one thing charge left behind you can run gpm out of sequence unless it stops reading when it quits reading quit dont go one item further to remedy this find whats out of sequence find what has been missed find where the charge got left correct that and then run the bank correctly if the meter behaved well on gpm 4 and on 5 packed up theres charge between where it ran well and where it packed up find it correct it and go on with the correct progression you know its even sort of silly having to stress all this so hard if you were out driving and were able to do 60 on road and then couldnt do but 5 mph youd certainly realize that something was wrong with the road well in view of the fact that you can always go 60 on the gpm sequences providing you dont leave the road or miss section it would seem pretty obvious that were you not doing 60 youve left the road or arent going all the road like any good road can be traveled easily as long as you are on it of course you may think this gpm road is full of holes or is peculiar or erratic or isnt built right thats an amateur blunder its awfully like those near perfect roman straightasadie roads only the way you travel over it or the errors in traveling it like thinking youre in lewes fording the river which youve not left newhaven or just not traveling it because you cease to travel it when your meter packs up youre not traveling the section you think you are youre still in lewes fording the river which you didnt ford youre not ten miles further on even though youre busy reading items that are ten miles further on because you say were ten miles from lewes doesnt guarantee you are if your meter hasnt read well or at all since lewes youll wake up finally to the fact you never crossed the river at lewes and havent any road under you so the meter wont read type pcs type pcs are not necessarily easier to audit errors are harder to detect but also errors do less damage but they still make upsets233a type pc stuck somewhat in the ford at lewes will read somewhat and with heat on being ten miles from lewes and will even make good case gains on type pc you only accept pure text book and realize youve left charged areas when you havent got perfect reads bds and heat learn to ask where the pc is and click it off youll find the pc in the item the pc is in ask for it by numbers arc you two gpms back fall in the first pair from the top second pair third pair f rerun the 2nd and 3rd pair with full steps if pc is still stuck in gpm you think has been departed from and yet goal has been skipped the pc will be found in the bottom oppterm of the last gpm in correct sequence or the second pair from the bottom learn to locate your pc by numbers and gpms youd look pretty silly out driving if you left your car stuck in the ford at lewes and told everyone you were in london miles away theyd think you were batty well its just as batty to leave pc stuck in gpm 4 run out of reads in the next gpm and try to go on anyway gpms are game of parcheesi only easier it looks pretty amateur to tell the players youve gone around the corner when your piece is still sitting squares back of where you claim you are thats all meter says when it packs up except for the weariness factor and is says there too you aint where you think you are brother what kind of think does it take to thereafter go groping forward the pc can only be stuck where you have already been of course none of this will make sense to somebody who hasnt done well on the clay table and doesnt realize that gpms are study in actual travel in distance the concept of things arranged in space in sequence has to have been grasped before one can grasp going forward or back one has to realize that gpms are laid out like road one is actually going along road this possibly gets qualified by some as what is meant here is that the symbology is roadlike and this is metaphor gpms are arranged in spatial sequence and you move the pc along this sequence and when you dont get reads youve left the pc back there somewhere stuck and i do mean back there metaphor the pc isnt with you youre not accompanied so the needle acts badly the heat goes off and theres gain arc breaks and everything goes to bits before your eyes its crime to have things go to bits its only crime not to know they have and act accordingly find the pc find the road and walk it correctly honest i wish i could tell you very plainly so there couldnt be any misunderstand ing its not even problem when your meter doesnt respond you havent arrived there when it responds badly you arent completely there when it doesnt respond at all theres nobody there the only place road simile differs is that road stays there when traveled on and234is still behind you the gpms traveled through properly vanish so again if theres road behind you in running gpms you havent traveled it for in traveling through gpms you shouldnt have any road left being isnt free who has to walk only one road we have learned now to walk this road so that it disappears and ceased to be the same old agonized rut but it is road and running gpms presents the same problem as any road if you havent walked down it you arent going down it if you havent walked you are at the place where you stopped walking if the road vanished behind you and you went back to walk it it wouldnt be there to walk upon and meter reactions are the sign of walking meter reacting youre walking meter not reacting youre not walking meter reacting badly youre stumbling ahead slowly being pulled on by rubber bands to the point where you got stuck in the mud rubber bands stretch only so far then youre not walking at all anyone would learn these things fast enough if he were being taught parcheesi but then theres awe mixed up in parcheesi because it was so much like kabala that had rudderguds all over its spoofers in upper anastabulla one would simply learn to move the piece on the board square by square from beginning to end and i dont think one would get any weird notions of how the piece was in square 2 when it obviously was sitting in square 1 if you have trouble running r6 dont send for new methods or chart to dumbala to bail you out just realize that when your meter misbehaves youve left road behind you dont go on find it blow it and walk the correct road even type b pc is only case of too tired to travel when you lay out those gpms on the clay table and move the white ball please realize thats metaphor youre performing thats road and it goes across distance and it begins and ends and thank the holies we have way to travel it l ron hubbard lrhjw copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard

end word the final word of goal it differs fro root words in that these are to ____________ such as to eat the end word always follow this to wit sausages the complete gpm would be to eat sausages here sausages is the end word there are 268 root words to each end word there are possibly 268 end words in the reactive mind although 56 also reads on the meter the largest r6 gain early in processing if ound from listing and scouting and finding end words and their locks locks often blow as hard as an actual end word they are and so if you find one find the other this finding of end words is also associated with considerable somatics if the pc is allowed to dwell on them ie prepcheck etc the trick is to find them and get away not beat them to death actually this is r6 used for healing at lower levels the aim of the process is what end word might be behind your troubles the procedure is to 1find what the pc is worried about in life 2try to find an end word to account for it usually pc says it in describing the worry or at least says lock 3try by very brief list to locate the actual end word step only used if big blowdown of tone arm did not occur on step 2 4ask for considerations about this found end word in this lifetime 5get out of there by asking pc how he or she has done and is doing in the session the main liability of the process consists of trying to find goals to match the end word when it is found for it is out of sequence or far frompresent time and if dwealt on too long will turn on somatics this is strickly destimulation process and must not be

1964 sthil students what an r6 auditor should know number of students have fluncked their provisional examinations lately for the following reasons 1they did not know what to do when an item does not immediately read if the item doesnt read list for the item by using the correct listing question if the item still does not read here are some of the questions an auditor could ask has this item been suppressed has this item been notised what considerations do you have about this item if the item still doesnt read the auditor could briefly check whether the pc is dramatizing the item whether the pc has had the correct concept of the item or not whether heat has been suppressed 2they did not know the correct listing questions these are what would oppterm bring about when looking for the terminal of the same pair b what item would have brought about terminal when looking for the oppterm of the next pair down therefore even though we have the complete line plot it is sometimes necessary to list for the next item this immediately helps the pc to locate the item in its position in the gpm or the pc gets rid of few locks and the item blows down like dream 3they did not know what to do when you run into trouble on r6 question what does r6 trouble consist of answer r6 trouble basically consists of areads shut off bpc refuses to continue on r6 cheat turns off question why do reads shut off answer because you are running the pc without goal under him239question so what dod you do when you run into trouble on r6 answer 1you find out where the pc is sitting 2find the relationship of the material you are dealing with question where would the pc be answer the pc is still safely sitting way back in the last correct action question is it ok you you to continue running the pc down the line plot after your reads have shut off in the hope of reads turning on again if you go on long enough answer dont go beyond nonreading meter hco b 12 june 64 page 3 running gpm out of sequence isnt serious so long as its in the same series etc but running gpm without needle action on items or ta is criminal question what should an auditor do when an item has not read but the pc insists it has blown answer check whether the iten has blown not blown if it reads that it has blown ask the pc to give you the next item but if the next item does not read dont go any further youve got r6 trouble on your hands and what do you do when youre in trouble you find out where your pc is etc question what about tocky needle turning on answer if it really is tocky needle you are cleaning clean but the following has been observed auditor running gpm with reads getting smaller and smaller okay let just check for bypassed charge in this gpm have we bypassed any charge instant dirty read auditor ohoh tocky needle well i wont argue with that next oppterm please by the way just in case of confusion the above is an example of how not to run r6 here is another please dont follow example

rights reserved founder244from the inner structure of the mind by l ron hubbard grade vi confidential we are going to delineate for you the inner structure of the reactive mind the core of the reactive mind is the r6 bank it is surrounded by engrams and secondaries which must be wiped out to get at the core itself and what does the r6 bank consist of you may be surprised to learn it is groups of words called gpmsgoalsproblems mass which serve to confuse being they are the cause of aberration the contents of the r6 bank are aberrated stable data in the demo each containerlike object is gpm and the balls of clay on top represent its verbal contents note the author refers here to demo set up by lrh in film to demonstrate the reactive mind the demo model was of what looked like string of barges each loaded with about dozen clay balls packed tightly against each other forming two rows these phrases are based on the electromagnetic principle of plus and minus charge on one side of gpm are the positive phrases on the other the negative and these go together to form pairs more on that later here you see an amazing phenomenon the reactive mind is not chaotic patchwork jumble of words and emotions but rather an exact order of verbal phrases the same in every person like the time track the precision with which the reactive mind was put together is staggering dont think it was easy to find all this out we had to get the precise numbers of gpms andoh yesthe number of ris or reliable items the various phrases of gpm the ris long remained secret likewise the fact that the gpms contain mass and significance and that the bank has mass and weight the end of the series of gpms runs into the beginning at place called present time incidentally there are only two verbs running throughout the series to create and to destroy r6ew is the process which makes you grade vi release it prepares you to face the highly charged core of the bank without endangering yourself r6ew gets most of the charge off the ews end words now each phrase or ri in gpm contains an infinitive or verb plus noun this noun the object of the infinitive is called the end word or ew the ew is the less highlycharged part of the ri since there is only one gpm per ew the verb though might occur in several or all of the gpms thus having the much greater charge and will bunch up entire sections of the time track if restimulated ergo we have made an effort on the solo course materials to avoid any restim of highly charged words in the r6 bank which would spin you in on your gpms when giving examples or making demos obviously unrestimulative words must be used245to catch catfish would illustrate an ri perfectly with infinitive to catch and ew catfish harmless words not occurring in the bank having set up your cb meter and arranged your reports take up the solo can in one hand ballpoint pen in the other and ask yourself the question what am i dramatizing the answer must be in the form of noun an ew if the word is not noun add ness to it for instance if it occurs to you that you are dramatizing being boy construct the word boyness boyiousness boyingness or some such if this is one of your ews it will read when you say it aloud when you find an ew register it on small filingcard with the date and the read then you must arrive at the opposite of that word all ews come in pairs plus and minus dichotomies like tallness and shortness to find the opposite the prefix may be attached to the first ew unboyingness when the opposite is found it must also read thus completing pair it is noted to the left of its mate on the first card and is in turn registered on second card with date read and first ew jotted down next to it the second card is then placed on top of the first and the two held together by paperclip there is trick to any of this simply find one ew and its opposite after another using dictionary or book of synonyms when necessary register them on cards and throw each clippedtogether pair on top of the growing pile complete reports must be kept that is the whole process finding pairs of ews there may be hundreds do not mull over r6ew in your mind before getting to do it if you catch yourself thinking of dramatizations say thats it and go back to whatever you were doing r6ew will put an end to any lingering somatics you may be undergoing its an easy process done correctly its just walk in the park246hubbard communications office saint hill manor east sussex hco bulletin of december 8 1964 sthil students level vl staff r6 graduates scientology vi solo auditing and r6 ew solo auditing the action of solo auditing is not selfauditing solo auditing is done in regular session in model session form one of the few ways to get messed up in solo auditing is to not use regular session form to not keep regular auditors report and to coffee shop oneself when the session begins run it when it ends end it if after session you find yourself maundering around and selfauditing you just have something wrong in what you did or found in the last session inabilitys to continue solo audit series of sessions stem wholly from end words getting into restimutation that dictate one way or another not going on how hopeless or impossible it is etc bypassed charge is not enough to stop series of soloaudit sessions only end words can do it getting arc broken in solo audit is not unusual it is handled just as you would handle an arc broken pc bypassed charge assessment from list prerequisites it is presupposed that scientologist engaged in solo audit is at least provisional class vl lower levels simply cant solo audit what makes solo auditing possible is the fact that on processes below r6 one has communication as necessity for auditing success but as this necessity is part of the gpms when one is into r6 he or she is above this necessity only r6 can work without comm therefore solo auditing is exclusively an r6 activity one supposes the auditor solo auditing has already become level 0 willing to talk freely to people level i able to answer an auditing question level ii able to duplicate247level il free of hidden standards overts and ptps level iii physically competent level iv has been clear if an auditor has not passed those six vital stages of case solo auditing to be blunt is quite impossible the self discipline wont be there the needful insight into ones own motives will be lacking any advanced scientologist always knows when he is dramatiz ing even when he is the being that cant solo audit never believes he or she is dramatizing matter what they are doing or saying self control is must in solo audit the pc who still needs an auditor to progress should never be permitted to solo audit any pc to go on r6 must go up through the six states listed above under levels if you dont take pc through those first that pc will eventually fall on his or her head on r6 this is all the more true on solo auditing if an auditor or pc is started on r6 prematurely there is the remedy of doing the life and livingness version of the l6 list each question is cleaned of needle reads by auditing by list also the pc can be run on any remedy or routine that does not assess for and use words as the key reason for recovery this only outlaws level iv and processes depending on assessment by meter for word to run even service facs can be run on an r6 failed case and certainly ow can be run clay table healing is very good on such case so if scientologist hasnt gone over the various hurdles as above listed he or she should neither soloaudit at all or be run on r6 reasons for solo audit the basic reasons for solo auditing are 1 auditor can possibly run r6 successfully on another without personally experiencing the simultaneous reads and case reactions its all just unreal to person who hasnt seen the needle move and felt the bank shift at the same instant an auditor without this reality just messes up pcs theres qualifying or modifying that fact its just true so an auditor who hasnt solo audited on r6 just cant run it well or at all on pc such an auditor goofs and goof on r6 is horrible to pc and has dreadful reactions 2 auditing pc when ones own bank is in full cry on the very same material is not conducive to good auditing this is overcome somewhat by using platen card with holes in it that is put on another paper and has in it the line plot mostly written out but not entirely when one begins r6 he or she can be too restimulated all banks are the same the combined factor of noreality on the bank and restimulation as an auditor combine with the third 3 an auditor just starting to use allstyle auditing is using new tool and must have it perfect before he uses it this is like not swimming until one knows how the best place to learn allstyle is in soloaudit248you see in solo auditing one can stop before he plows in if one were auditing pc and erred one would go on just that extra second that means disaster from which we get 4 in solo auditing one is not assisted by the comm cycle to go deeper than one can cope with r6 goes straight past the usual protective mechanisms of the mind mentioned in dianetics therefore when one is auditing pc on r6 one can violate those mechanisms and get the pc in too deep while soloauditing one is still selfprotected to large degree one blunders becomes relatively incapable of going on therefore doesnt keep plowing in the exception is the foolish one who sees read and goes on down several non reading items suddenly down comes the roof even so thus solo auditing restores the selfprotective nature of the mind which r6 done by an auditor on pc could violate by going beyond where one should stop and investigate whats wrong thus solo auditing is 1possible only on r6 2possible only when person has come up through the levels 3possible only when one is well trained when one tries solo on lower levels it doesnt work for long but we cant deny it does work somewhat even at lower levels sometimes when one gets onto r6 solo before coming up through the levels its jolly mess because one is having to do lower level auditing lot of the time ptps and overts for instance that only an auditor could handle on pc when one isnt trained up to r6 one cant handle it at all so its specialized activity solo auditing and only for the provisional class vl the earliest processes student just given his provisional classification should not be given any plots of any kind his or her first 20 hours of solo auditing should consist only of locating dichotomies of end words dichotomy in the dictionary means division into two parts its word we borrowed and gave new meaning to and after all these years it is very apt as you will discover dichotomies the dichotomy in scientlogese means plus and minus plus word and minus word they are of the same order of things always crude example would be an apple and applelessness that is pair dichotomy the alchemist was on the fringe of this with his activepassive forms and words but he looking for the gold of truth only the latter ones looked for real gold having missed too many definitions doubt didnt really look for plus and minus he looked for the active such as man and the passive such as woman by his definitions249we in scientific age look for the two sides of thing taking our cue from electricity plus and minus interchange current as you will find on any battery so we dont want activepassive we want the bold plus and minus the opposites janus the roman god of gates and doors had two faces so does each major idea have two faces the nature of things is major idea it has two faces plus and minus these are opposed to each other they interchange current they conflict bad and good things have nature the nature can be bad or it can be good poison ivy has bad nature viewed from body viewpoint cool water is good thus the nature of things has two faces two parts there could be let us say the major thought how one feels this has two parts elation and depression elation is plus depression is minus what is generally agreed to be the unwanted or the poor side is minus what is generally conceived to be all right is plus in modern society we would have the major idea that an individual has an economic status wealth is the plus and poverty is the minus now you dont have to have the major thought to get its two parts to find dichotomy but the two parts must add up to being comparable you dont have tall and small as dichotomy the major thought of which tall is part is height therefore you would have tall and short as the dichotomy small would be half of another major idea of size therefore you would have its other face as big or large you would not have nagging and violent as two parts theyre both on the same side both minus for nagging you might have praising and for violent you might have benign so dichotomy means the two parts of major idea the character of the reactive mind knowing the above you must also be informed of this in the reactive mind the end words alternate between plus and minus in the top half of the bank reactive mind the minus turns up and has as the next one down its plus in the bottom half of the bank the plus turns up and just below it is the minus each is the end word of series of gpms each gpm has line plot the most charge force strength electric energy you can find easily with the least disturbance if you err is dichotomy of end words pair they are called end words because they come on the end of each of series of goals each end word has many root words these root words are the regard or action one is supposed to have for the end word grab ________ would be root its the verb just ahead of the verb is the participle to which gives us the implied purpose to grab _______ as form would be then the complete root root is just our word for this to verb 250add the end word and you have purpose goal end words are always nouns or condition made into noun avarice might be an end word book or books might be one thus we have to grab books as full goal or to shun avarice would be one but books would have lot more roots before we had done with them so would avarice each full goal like to grab books would have line plot with items like grabbing books or just grabbed books now you see then that root words are heavily repeated but if you try to find them you may jam up many end words for the same roots apply to each pair of end words the same apples to items in the line plot therefore the one thing that can be plucked out of the reactive mind without messing things up is pair of end words they discharge to some degree and as theyre not repeated except in their own series they dont restimulate too much obviously then in theory end words would be the least restimulative thing to find in actual practice they indeed are and not only that once found they cool off ones dramatization of them quite wonderfully its like recalling lost experience just knowing it happened brings big lift one doesnt have to erase it all to have lot less effect from it so in actual practice then the finding of end words brings the most r6 early case gain further finding these pairs cool off the bank without messing it up badly found end words do very little to one running gpm badly can be quite deadly ____________ starting r6 therefore in starting r6 the solo auditor regardless of the availability of the line plot root plot and end word or series plot should find his or her own pairs of end words this will tend to straighten out the reactive mind unburden it and cool off the whole case some fantastic changes can result from this action if it is done right when lot of end words have been cooled off had some charge removed just by proving them out on meter one is enormously more capable two pairs of end words properly found is equal to about one clear in terms of case gain but the end words to be found must be the ones in restimulation on the particular case just getting standard list of end words to read does very little except maybe upset one251process r6 ew the first process of solo auditing then is named r6 ew this of course is both co audit and solo audit process not only solo process this is very tricky as process and the following rigid rules must be closely followed rules of r6 ew 1no listing with paper and pencil is permitted this means written lists of possible end words why not because if you go by one in listing it suppresses and raises the mischief also past auditors have loved 87 page lists you should be able to get the right end word in about four or five words and you sure dont need to write them as list write down the first idea of it only 2write down every end word found and proven on separate card with its opposite also noted each end word has card with the end word at the top boldly written with all its check out data over on the left in small letters is written the other one these two cards make one pair which thereby refer to each other 3never go on to new pair before finding both end words in the old pair dont find plus skip finding its minus and go on with another plus always find both before going on 4dont try to plot them on the track or bank just find the pairs 5if anything goes wrong meter hangs up ta goes high you feel bad you dramatize you want to cease auditing forever etc realize youve got wrong pair or wrong mate somewhere behind you and find the right pair or the right mate the other end word of the pair hence keep your cards consecutive and in one packet the last end word found on top and its other word the next one down 6dont wander off onto some other action such as prepchecking an end my god getting curious about its roots or some gpm to shun cats just keep after things like cats realize if you stray youve found wrong pair or mismatched an end word behind you look for it 7realize that the read of the needle transfers easily to locks if you suppress or challenge an end word too hard but saving grace the one that reads i heavily on suppress or challenge have i challenged cats is it suppress or challenge read on particular end word serves to prove it 8note all meter and ta actions on the card 9dont write list between sessions you may jot one down if it leaps up but in the next session you must take it up at once jotting down fifty between sessions you havent proved up will literally slaughter you if you do jot down fifty take up the first one and go down the whole list proving out the opposite of each you prove 10find only pairs if you prove out plus then find its minus if you prove out minus find its plus those are the rules of r6 ew they are far more important than how you do the process252the process this is game like charades charades party game of guessing word or phrase from someone acting out its parts only its played with this question what am i dramatizing or what word might you be dramatizing for pc thats the question not as in charades what is he or she trying to get across but what noun is being dramatized not what goal janus forbid but what single nounal word not what pair that would really chew one up just what noun you write down this first idea rather lengthily on your auditors report then you use that to find single noun singular or plural that sums it up you work with that written sentence until youve got it then you find its opposite remember theres lot of ities and ice like servilities and avarice whereby what we consider as adjectives usually get made into nouns but also nouns as nouns not automobiles of course thetans at the start of the universe didnt have them but machinery might do not clowns too specific but assininities might work the whole question is just what did i thetan early track cook up that i am now getting my head kicked in with tallness stealth hugeness vastnesses that sort of thing one checks out the correct word to express it with usual patter is this an end word does it have gpms is it lock is it an implant is it an actual end word is it phrase out of an engram is it lock on root is it an item theres staccato patter that fits except is it an end word which is asked every time along with other questions you worry at it until you know by needle action and ta blowdown it is an end word or you know it isnt when it definitely isnt it is very wise to find the right wording that is the end word dont just give up the notion when youve got real end word and hauled it in and written it down and why you know it is by meter behavior you then must find its mate snakes travel in pairs so do end words both sides of the same sort of thing if you just found rotten you must now find fresh or preserved and prove that out on its card heres an example you ask what am i dramatizing you think then eating ok what is its reaction well ing isnt any end word so maybe its food that doesnt read maybe its inflow and so on and suddenly bang full dial there it is gills flippers and all the right one that expresses that idea you had good now lets set the opposite hunger deprivation etc etc and bang you have its partner the second fish and so you go253pretty soon they start popping up check them out get the pair pair after pair when it all slows down again once more what am i dramatizing and youre on your way once more its quite process be thorough be accurate and youll make some long long strides toward ot and in solo audit learn how to handle all style to the degree of checking out and learn bank reactions subjectively and as an auditor only when youve nice big pile of cards should you be thinking of running gpms item by item off line plot remember even if you had the full end word plot youd make faster personal gains at first and faster gains as an auditor using r6 ew it is my convinced opinion that if an auditor cant solo audit with high gain what is now called r6 ew he or she should not be let near running gpms much less audit another preclear r6 ew has been actually research tool when i found how to convert it to process it already had its rules laid out and proven in research it has not been used at this writing for case gain only by others i can therefore predict several hco bulletins giving mustnots and all that however the facts remain 1it takes an ability to detect ones own actions before one can detect those of others 2it takes unburdening to make case run smoothly 3the least dangerous early approach to ot with the greatest case gains lies in the discovery of pairs of end words that are in restimulation on ones own case 4the best way to start new pc who must have been through the six phases listed above before r6 plus pc training is to use r6 ew on him not run gpms the question what am i dramatizing may be unflattering and you may prefer what noun has been in restimulation if so fine all the same l ron hubbard lrhjw

end words beyond the one the pc thinks it was the actual one is unburdened enough so that it will now read if you go back to it sometimes the first one or the second one was the end word but is too overburdened to read if one goes on without going back to check it then if it was the one it will suppress and things will get uncomfortable the specific correction to r6ew is that one does record carefully each one thought of and checked over if none have read in list of dozen or so end words at the very most usually 6 or 8 go back and check the list again for suppressions and challenges often suppress or challenge need be mentioned the correct word unburdened by the additional listing will just read when mentioned major discomfort can be encountered by checking real end word out then deciding it wasnt it and going on without going back to it thus one does need record r6ews when r6ew seems bit flat r6ews can be entered into this is done like r6ew but six are found not pair it will be found that the major dichotomy is the middle pair with similar pair of end words on either side effort is made to arrange them in relation to each other or the other gpms one just finds the six hence r6ews routine 6 end word sixes to do this take the first pair found in r6ew and locate the additional two pairs then take the next r6ew pair and locate the two additional pair all the rules of r6 ew apply259r6ewp when r6ews is reasonably flat begin r6ewp this means routine 6 end word plot to do this first get the six you first found in r6 ews and get them into proper relation to each other then take this first six found as now lined up and relate it to the second six then correctly line up the second six within itself sixes are related to each other by the auditor by numbering by finding if there are lot of gpms between which six is prior to the other etc in short one does whatever is necessary to arrange all sizes in relation to one another of course new sixes show up do r6ews on this and relate them to the remaining sixes this is best done with card file of course all gpm end words are written on separate card like this 4 jan 65 steam f end word lf correct f ice suppress lfbd then one has one for the opposite2604 jan 65 ice f endword lfbdcorrect lfchallenged lf steam this way when correcting any six in sequence you have card for each and only change the opposite words about like this 10 jan 65 races f end word lfbdcorrect f walks lock pokescorrected opposite to f r6 ewp has two plotting steps 1plot the six in relation to each other most prior to nearest top 2plot the six in relation to the other sixes gpms will respond to numbering from the top as l right on back is this gpm greater than 50 less than 50 from the top greater than 40 less than 40 is it 41 42 43 is it 43 plots as 43rd gpm from the top sixes respond to prior and nearer the top is this six prior to the cough six is it closer to the top the cough six is prior261summary this is all rather easy to do the main point is that r6ew r6ews and r6ewp must all be pretty flat and the end word plot correct before you even try to run items and gpms dont do r6 ew then get eager and start to run gpms item by item flatten r6ew then go on to r6ews then go to r6ewp then start on items youll have it much easier the only real way to get slowed down is to try to run items before the bank is thoroughly unburdened with r6ew r6ews and r6ewp three months of heavy auditing would run out the whole bank anyway why rush if you try to rush it itll take year or two youve been aberrated this long few months can be tolerated and for that matter year or two on the lower levels also the only way to not make it is not to do all of level 0 level i level ii level iii level iv and all of r6 as above

clearing the point is that one doesnt quit for pt reasons matter how good they sound one quits or slows down or blows solely because of end words or gpms its always an end word is an excellent maxim for patching up any upset by the way this is true also at lower levels but in this case one hasnt prayer of getting at the end word and if one did try then the resulting mess would be too hard to repair 80 of the time one lucky break in locating the end word on lower level pc can ruin an auditor afterwards he keeps trying and flunking for you have to have pc in comm and bank264unburdened to run r6 successfully if older schools of practitioners ever contact this portion of our data we can predict with confidence that they will fail miserably in all efforts to apply it for they have not begun to walk the bridge in the right place to succeed with r6 data they would have to embrace the whole of auditing and its ethics as well and they wouldnt be older practitioners then would they auditing is all of piece auditor has to know his lower levels and preclear must walk the bridge from where he can have reality on it end word forms there are two sources for end words in each gpm 1the end word of the one oppterm and 2the end word of the goal and other items the one oppterm as per the line plot has the end word as forthright noun in that oppterm boy if it were an end word which it isnt would be boy in the goal as an ri and the goal as an oppterm it would be boyness or boyiousness or boyingness the suffix ness is the clue here it seems to occur uniformly in the goal as an ri and the goal as an oppterm therefore you can get two apparent forms of end word one is the forthright noun occurring in the normal oppterm the other is modification adding ness and sometimes fullness or perhaps ingness liness or iousness the idea is very plain just knocking out boy would be small action but knocking out things which knock out boys would be much broader action therefore gpms in their goal items have an end word ending in the ness form of the noun purpose of the bank the probable purpose of the bank is to suppress all creating and destroying by aiming creation at evil and destruction at good this apparently was to restrain all creation and destruction and so gives us the mest universe l ron hubbard lrh jw copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved265hubbard

scientology is homonym which is to say it has several definitions each according to how it is used the pre 1962 definitions of terminal were and are anything used in communication system something that has mass in it on processes below level iii use proper nounal form in an auditing command dont use sleepy or sleepiness in the command use sleepy person or sleeper use in other words terminal in the sense that it must have mass also terminal meant and means something with mass meaning and mobility also terminal means anything that can receive relay or send communication to wit bullet though it has mass would really be communication particle and the shooter and target would be the terminals what is at cause and what at effect are the terminals when you are using comm formula of cause distance effect this is the commonest use of the word terminal in scientologese you hear scientology saying he gave up because he didnt have real terminal or he wasnt good terminal meaning in both cases that there wasnt anybody to talk to or listen to even though there were people about person who could gives relay or receive comm was terminal and person who couldnt wasnt terminal electrically terminal is one of the two poles between or through which current flows in gpms what we now also call items were first called terminals because they interacted with each other electrically they were always in pairs these are composed of 1 mass and 2 significance they only interact with the pc or the matching terminal the pc or the matching terminal can act against the remaining terminal also we got the idea of two different types of terminals in gpms because thats the way they are one the pc thinks of as his own or himself the other he thinks of as an opposition hence we use terminal to mean what the pc thinks is his idea and mass in the gpm and we use opposition terminal or oppterm for short to mean the mass and significance he thinks of as the enemy to the one he is in both the terminal and the oppterm in gpm have mass and significance and266have the appearance of receiving and giving communication and so they are called terminals when one is speaking of either one term or oppterm and isnt being specific as to which it is term or oppterm one says item an item can also be anything that reads on an assessed list particularly if it is an adverbial or adjectival noun or proper noun so item is broader sloppier term which includes terminal of any kind the word noun noun is most properly and severely used to indicate specific something rather than condition boy cat sparks are nouns these can be converted to nouns which only identify condition with the characteristic of the forthright noun such as boyishness cattiness or sparkability here we see noun made into condition which in english is called an adjectival noun or an adverbial noun reversely adjectives adverbs and verbs can be turned into something loosely called noun which is only an adverbial or adjectival noun responsible is an adjective responsibleness is an adjective turned into an adjectival noun you see the end word of the goal as an ri going both ways if the proper forthright noun is really the subject of the gpm lets say boy this occurs as part of one oppterm but the goal as an ri converts it to lets say boyness making the forthright noun become an adjectival noun the other way to if the gpm end word occurring in the goal as an ri is highness then in the one oppterm it becomes height english suffers bit from lack of differentiation in its grammar and terminology but we get around with it somehow if there is an academic terminology for such differences then it is insufficiently in general use to communicate the way we have to be able to do i know words to describe these things in another language but not in english there are proper forthright nouns as end words to the goal as an ri in gpms there are some in the one oppterm each gpm has that describes the accomplished fact this

bad do bpc assists until you are well and ta low only when you have the gpms very well in hand and plotted do you run them but if things go awry do assists only for bpc when run go to r7 data on this

during my absence in early 1965 somebody varied the r6 ew rundown on students and it suddenly ceased to work of course when looking for why process isnt working the general human impulse is first to blame the pc and say the pc is different then try to vary the process almost never is there an impulse to see if one was running the process right in the first place yet on these mainline processes that are part of levels particularly the fault is never the pc and varying the process is fatal so i am furnishing the impulse thats missing look for the variation first one always looks for how the process was alterised in the first place and one is nearly always right so it was in the case of r6 ew knowing all this from long experience when i found r6 ew had ceased to work i directed that several students be asked with hco bulletin before them how they were running r6 ew and sure enough they were running variation that was the source of the slow terminations and stalled cases the variation wasnt much but it was enough to raise tone arms and freeze needles solid and make people very unhappy physically the twist was as follows the students were being permitted to list for dramatiza tions this of course merely stirred up end words as by passed charge there is such step in r6 ew by listing for dramatizations an assessment step was introduced the purpose of r6 ew is to find end words not to get all steamed up about dramatizing as in service facs so in effect r6 ew was reduced down to level iv but being improperly addressed to the bank the dramatization not the end word restimulated gpms by being nearly on listing of end words is forbidden in the original hco bulletin of r6 ew noting down what one has checking was provided for in the second hco bulletin on r6 ew hco bulletin mentioned listing for dramatizations heaven forbid i never dreamed anybody would enter in the level iv service fac step into level vi that was really reaching maybe the word dramatizing was not grasped what one wants to know is what end word explains my condition so if you have any trouble grasping dramatizing as concept just fall back or what end word explains my condition and the purpose of269r6 ew will be fully understood to dramatize something means to be the effect of the bank but to vary process rather than try to find whats misunderstood about it is very very humanoid if one had complete command of all the parts and relationships of the mind and background of uniform success as an auditor since 1950 and many have including and had been d of t and d of p and had run the saint hill course and had studied thousands of cases and case histories and graphs then one might possibly vary process but then such person would also see how the recommended process worked and that it didnt need varying and so would be the last person to change it in my experience only the poor student with bad graphs on pcs ever varies processes an organizational parallel is the fellow who knowing nothing whatever about an org its purpose and patterns and successes comes in sits down at his new desk and promptly starts telling everyone how the org should be run he may find some listeners right up to some idiotic point like all pigeons should be sold but we dont keep pigeons says an old staff member starting to see the light about this fellow to which the newcomer snarls then buy some so they can be gotten rid of so i always assume two things on reports of trouble with mainline process standard one that has working history 1the original process has been varied 2whoever brought about the change has had bad record on courses and on pcs that way i can easily trace back failed training and the source of variations and i have yet to find this formula for unearthing trouble with processes wrong today as result of hard experience i regard any listing process with great reserve not because they dont work in the hands of expert experts they do but because there is something about listing that doesnt lend itself to training i knew there was an impulse to overlist i have seen some poor preclear made by student auditor to list 89 pages of items going black in the face ta soaring needle frozen and yet the auditing student just going on and on and on demanding more and more items i have seen underlisting as chronic impulse three items and the auditor called it list although the needle hadnt even stirred yet now i have seen an impulse to inject listing into process where it was forbidden so we can say that some tend to be odd on the subject of listing its probably itself dramatization of implants they are in long sequences so we lay the rule down that in level vi you dont list in r6 ew on dramatizations you write down the first dramatization thought of thats it it didnt have to read or check or be assessed now find an end word to fit it that270reads well by thinking of it writing it down or seeing if it reads while thinking of it writing it down or repeating it if it reads at any one of those times well thats it if it doesnt read nice long read you think of another write it down and see if it reads again it can read while thinking of it b while writing it down or c repeating it once or twice if you have about six and none have read with long fall go back to the first one and check it again and either it or the second or third one you wrote down now reads like bomb having been unburdened thats all there is to finding an end word additives there is check out blow the idea of ness or any other idea dont bob around mauling it now find its opposite same way think of the probable opposite of the one youve got write it down and see if it reads if it does thats it start worrying when you start creaking and the ta starts rising when that happens do bpc assessment beware of missing read while youre writing something down use one of those glass paneled emeters if you wish and bend its brass stand leg so you can get paper and pen behind it easily dont paste paper on its back so you cant see the needle its made to look through at your paper and hand putting the needle between the writing hand and eye so you can see the needle move if it does honest its too easy there are two versions of an end word the more specific noun goes with the third oppterm from the top the ness goes with the goal as an ri and others endless correcting of what you find will get you in more trouble than not checking what you find the suppress and challenge you put into the bank by constant checking are worse than few wrong ones you dont have to work at it just keep good auditors report and write what you find sometimes when youve found an end word string of other end words go off like fire crackers or you keep thinking of them one after another well write them down noting their reads find their opposites when they slow down in coming and youve got bonus lot of pairs but always find their opposites and always write them down as they occur indeed after youve been on r6 ew for few weeks the question about dramatizing becomes useless and you just find end words when this happens youre due for r6 ews as there is now enough charge off the bank and enough kinks out of it to go back and use your pairs to make sixes when r6 ews longer limits itself to sixes but keeps going off into 12s and 18s youre due for r6 ewp for now enough charge is off that youre placing by number is accurate they number from the top as 1 of course use cards for each one you find keep regular auditors report but audit mainly on 3 x 5 or some other measurement cards instead of work sheets so you can move the cards about in sequence date every card with the session date and fill in the opposite word271on each card you can of course check out an end word to see if its an actual or what but dont make it habit for every word some you know are it be happy when more charge is off the case theyll then be seen as right or wrong when doing r6 ews why worry during r6 ew did the end word take charge off your case big needle falls 2 to 3 okay thats your purpose you dont have to plot the bank in r6 ew thats later in r6 ewp youll catch all serious r6 ew errors you make in bpc assessments or r6 ews anyway wrong end words hang up and plague you you keep thinking of them they dont blow so check can be relegated to checking those that hang up in your attention during or after session or those that turn everything black or white dont be so careful during the day or night if you dont really begin and end your sessions like an auditor more end words will pop up write them down dont be running back to meter next session start with those and get pairs to complete your notes end words that mess you up with pressures or heavy somatics are incorrect or incorrectly paired straighten them up honest its easy to do the only side effect if you do as above comes from leaving the two roots unexpressed one tends then to dramatize them or from bypassing so many items really its an easy activity its lots of fun its mainly quantity youre after not quality so you drive at 100 mph until you have wreck then you patch it up and again drive at 100 mph sometimes you get pretty nervous and reluctant to drive at all too many wrecks if so you missed bypassed charge so go back on an assist basis and build up your nerve again and shortly youll be doing ton driving 100 mph again you cant kill yourself on r6 ew you can by running wrong goals item by item so thats why youre doing r6 ew rather than gpms item by item its safer if you had the exact list of gpms when you started r6 ew you would still get further i think on r6 ew although gpms are the same pc to pc they are not keyedin the same way on each pc r6 ew gives you chance to key them out the way theyre keyed in on you so please do it and lets not vary it eh l ron hubbard lrhjw copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved272hubbard communications office saint hill manor east

doing it at all including auditing 2altering the procedure by which is meant doing something that is close but has twist in it including using it for the wrong purpose and 3adding to it additives almost all procedures have suffered from additives which is to say having things added to them complexitysimplicity covered as subject in an acc probably the 15th man is far less likely to do something simply than he is complexly due to the reactive bank which dictates it should be that way in r6 ew very important reason for small or insufficient tone arm action is the tendency to add steps or actions to the procedure unwittingly given simple session form which starts and ends it goals for the session and toward the end summary of the session goals made or not an r6 ew session doesnt have anything else ptps overts almost any part of levels to iv are now hard to get reads on and if looked for or fooled with may freeze the ta if introduced into an r6 ew session only by passed charge searches can be done in an r6 ew session and have to be done by oneself or another when things are grim if you try to audit yourself after you have arc broken yourself without locating and indicating the bpc you get pretty apathetic otherwise there isnt anything you can profitably add to an r6 ew session to improve it to add other auditing actions to an r6 ew session can be quite upsetting the ptp overt or motivator turn out to be the effect of dramatizing end words that you would have found anyway almost at once had you just continued r6 ew trying to scan off locks after finding an end word listing dramatizations adding any action to the very elementary actions of r6 ew all just slow the ta action and get the needle dirty or sticky look over your procedure if youre in trouble using the following steps 1 do you really not audit at all 2 are you doing twist on r6 3 have you added some steps that you figured should go in but i never mentioned if you are having rough time look over these hco bulletins on r6 goofs and check your procedure out maybe you havent spotted all the additives also have you departed r6 ew for r6 ews before the time was ripe thats an

students r6 students r6 grads r6 coaudit information bulletin all former students of the saint hill special briefing course who obtained class vi were sent materials concerning r6ew and r6ews yet it has come to my attention that many are still running gpms according to the line plot as released or if not doing this are running actual gpms using end words which they have located the plots they are finding are incorrect the full plot is not yet released therefore all class vi students should only be running r6ew at this time and nothing else to do this they should take care to answer the question what am i dramatizing the answer to that question should be noted down on the auditors report form it does not matter how this is phrased it could be for example the feeling of having butterflies flapping around inside my stomach or cold feet or whatever you find the end word just like in the bulletins check it out and find its opposite then you look to see whether or not you still have the feeling of having butterflies flapping around inside my stomach or cold feet if you still have the manifestations of such dramatization you continue to find end words and their opposites until you have completed cycle on that particular dramatization when this cycle is complete and you will know when it is complete then you would again ask the question what am i dramatizing and proceed as above all this requires is some ability to recognize what it is you are dramatizing figurefigure is required just an ability to perceive an existing state condition emotion feeling sensation inability or lack of emotion feeling or sensation make good use of dictionary and book of synonyms and antonyms this will keep an auditor busy for quite some long time as there are many more end words than last released when it appears that there really are further dramatizations the auditor can then proceed to r6ews as given it will be unlikely that any auditor will have to do r6ewp as all the end words have274been found and are currently being plotted by right now r6ew and r6ews will remain as procedure even when the end words have been completely plotted as it is the very best way to get off vast quantities of charge and to ease the actual running of gpms all class vi auditors should immediately upon receipt of this bulletin study all the previous bulletins on r6ew and r6ews and proceed right away to run r6ew as given and when that is handled run r6ews you have been given the form of end words be sure to only find end words in this form there you are get busy and try to get in at least five hours of solo auditing done on yourself each week by the time you have found hundreds of end words and by the time you have found hundreds more with r6ews r6gpmi item running will be complete for you here at saint hill the whole message here is to continue to find end words until the dramatization is flat otherwise youre leaving unflat processes behind you l ron hubbard lrhwmc

able to back out of his reactive mind the reactive mind is still there but the person is not sunk into it with all its discomforts and depressions the person has been released from his reactive mind he still has it but hes not in it his iq and ability rises and he is far more effective in changing his environment into better one above release lies clear clear is the name of button on an adding machine when you push it all the hidden answers in the machine clear and the machine can be used for proper computation so long as the button is not pressed the machine adds all old answers to all new efforts to compute and wrong answers result really thats all clear is clears are beings who have been cleared of wrong answers or useless answers which keep them from living or thinking the reactive mind in its entirety is known territory today it contains false purposes and makes people lose their own basic purpose an uncleared person is making himself the unknowing and unwilling effect of his own reactive mind reactive mind is an unknowing unwanted series of aberrated computations which bring about an effect on the individual and those around him it is also an obsessive strata of unknown unseen uninspected data which is forcing solutions unknown and unsuspected on the individual it is subawareness activity that is below the knowing awareness of the individual the reactive mind opposes the individual now the way you handle the reactive mind is simply to increase the individuals awareness by increasing his awareness he becomes aware of this thing and so its now under inspection and as he goes along he can then handle it and its under his control and ceases to be reactive matter whats in it life is quite an adversary and the reactive mind is quite an adversary you shouldnt ever undervalue these things and therefore you cant really overvalue the state of clear it has never been achieved before the last big stumbling block to freedomthe reactive mind itselfhas been found out explored and conquered the technology to reach these states is in practice in your nearest church of scientology this minute all you have to do is obtain the auditing and skill available the thing to do is keep going up get your grades of release one by one keep taking the next step up release and clear are reached by small certain steps not by huge leaps now is the time to start you can make it287the state of clear by l ron hubbard clear is being who can be at cause knowingly and at will over mental matter energy space and time as regards the first dynamic survival for self for more than 2500 years man has dreamed of this goal being clear gives one the freedom and potential of being further it makes it possible to continue being something it is stable state also scientology clear has experience the source of aberration is the reactive mind and the source of the reactive mind is the being himself an uncleared person is making himself unknowing and unwilling effect of his own reactive mind reactive mind is an unknowing unwanted series of aberrated computations which bring about an effect on the individual and those around him it is also an obsessive strata of unknown unseen uninspected data which is forcing solutions unknown and unsuspected on the individual it is subawareness activity that is below the knowing awareness of an individual the reactive mind opposes the thetan now the way you handle the reactive mind is simply to increase the thetans awareness by increasing his awareness he becomes aware of this thing and so its now under inspection and as he goes along he can then handle it and its under his control and ceases to be reactive matter whats in it there is such thing as crazy thetan there is thetan who is mocking up craziness that he is the effect of he does this automatically and does not know he is doing it he does not see the things which are affecting him clear then is longer the effect of the automaticities of the reactive mind on the first dynamic because of pleasurable experience in the past and inherent sensitivity there will be differences amongst clears and clears should not be assumed automatically to be standardized middle ground that pale goal of past doctrines rationality as divorced from aberration can be studied only in cleared person it is the aberrations of the uncleared individual which give him the appearance of irration ality irrationality is simply the inability to get right answers from data now in view of the fact that the mind does more than its share of pinning somebody inside body there are conditions imposed on him clear he can more easily become exterior clear doesnt have to be in body or out of body there are conditions imposed on him he is just at cause over mental matter energy space and time on the first dynamic or as regards his own survival life is quite an adversary and the reactive mind is quite an adversary you shouldnt ever undervalue these things and therefore you cant really overvalue the state of clear it has never been achieved before288 clearing course instruction booklet read study and know these instructions before doing any auditing mechanics of the bank anything in the bank that occurs several times will not erase unless its the earliest time it occurred this is known as the basic on the chain number of similar things early to late in different points of time make chain when you have the earliest erased the rest erases easily however when the earliest one is erased the next to last is the new basic and must be erased in its turn and so on as this goes on the items of the chain eventually begin to blow erase very easily therefore if items cease to erase easily you have not properly handled the item just before it and may not have handled the same item in the earlier run even if you get reads out of later run than the one you are supposed to be in you will find the later one still reads when you get to it properly and will then erase nicely the real sneaker in the r6 bank is the person himself at the time this we call the thetan in the item each item has an impression of the being as he was at the moment of the item long ago if one does not spot this each time it will not erase and mass builds up as we go along this means look at or locate yourself as thetan at the time of the incident it is not the light it is right where you are in the auditing chair but of course ages past spot means glance at q greek letter theta qn is trick way of saying thetan if as you read this you can glance at the wall you can spot it reads well one then has to get the earliest moment of ones own beingness in the bank and spot it then one has to spot it for each item one runs one spots the thetan and the item or in the objects the items at the same time this is bit of trick it is simultaneous spotting spotting the thetan in called verbal item can be done at the same time as the item is called ordinarily one calls or spots the item few times and then also calls and spots the thetan the thetan can also then be spotted without calling or spotting the item the right way is the way you get the most reads soon one begins to be expert at it but then one must be expert at it with item 1 part 1 run 1 or it builds up one had tiny bit of mass on him right at the start as he was protesting this is slight as it is enough to tie down the chain by leaving it with basic so spot the thetan each time spotting the environment at the time is also possible289duration of auditing find quiet place in which to audit audit an hour or two at time preferable the same time each day day you dont audit is session lost trying to make up session is useless audit daily when you dont you lose sessions it isnt how much you get done in session its the getting on bit by bit that counts its like digging long ditch what you dont dig isnt dug the bank contains less than was first thought but it contains enough in three or four months you will have make it if you do good job on each item and dont fool about with the bank it goes into restimulation if you stir it up and dont decide lot of things your ability to postulate is increasing and you can decide run is flat or doesnt need to be run and have it behave that way but it will still be there to knock you down the cause of trouble the only way one can get ill or in trouble is not auditing in trying to correct the items given or in not following instructions what doesnt make items read properly loud shouting body movement while calling fiddling the onehand electrode tensing muscles getting angry with the lack of read gritting teeth auditing past an arc break doing list 7 every time you dont get read or feel odd what makes items read properly doing regular sessions not self auditing out of session staying calm keeping calm keeping the auditors code on the pc you following directions exactly adding nothing finding arc breaks when they happen with list 7 list 7 run as an assessment for arc break will run easily locate and indicate the bypassed charge as it shows up if you are not classed auditor get this done in qual division that has classed auditor either on or through the clearing course if you really bog down auditing by list 7 will give you the relief sought auditing in place you feel secure and where you wont be disturbed audit daily not auditing too long at one time 1 to 2 hours is optimum closer to 1 than 2 not trying to get rid of it all at once considering it routine piece of ditch digging not expecting to fly suddenly not dwelling on your case out of session when you end session end it290being plodding and methodical just getting on with it getting all the reads off by calling or spotting going on to the next item if it doesnt read get more off last item and return to the one that wouldnt read getting in the buttons supp inval protest when needed only checking for earlier or later runs only when in trouble only handle trouble when it arrives dont try to handle it before it does the best way to stay out of trouble is read study and understand these instructions before beginning basic basic the first earliest bit in the bank is not an item but light it appears to the left front of the face some distance away look ahead and to the left bit and youll spot it it is the source of unconsciousness and produces it when contacted there is light before each run in the middle of each 7s gpm every 4 pairs at the start of basic end words at the start of confusion gpm and at the start of the objects and at the end of each type of item in the objects every 8 items each time you feel groggy its light doing it each major change then is preceded by the light mark these in on your platens if they are not there flatten each one by spotting it and it and thetan anaten unconsciousness can be spotted away it is part of the light when the light went on the thetan went anaten instead of solo auditor going anaten in his session it is only necessary to spot the anaten in the thetan when running the light when you spot light or object or combination of objects you should get read on the needle by spotting the same thing again you get another read by spotting it again you get another read and so you continue to spot it time after time until more reads occur by reason of spotting you repeat verbal items aloud getting read each time you repeat until it has more reads verbal items are found in the 7s basic end words and confusion gpm but you silently spot lights objects combinations of objects repeatedly same one until you have more reads you should get as many falls etc from spotting light as you do from calling an item spotting the thetan follows the same rules you spot repeatedly until there are more reads on the needle by reason of spotting the thetan self at that instant and place you dont have to see the light to spot it or see the thetan or see the object or objects you only need to spot the place where they are with the idea of what should be there of course seen at first or not continued spotting makes it blow291pattern of the bank the apparent pattern of the bank is as follows etc for 10 runs total there are five parts these occur in row this row of 5 parts is called run the first earliest of these is the 7s the second just above the 7s is the basic end words the third just above the basic end words is the confusion gpm the fourth just above the confusion gpm is the objects hollow the fifth just above the objects hollow is the objects solid after run of b c d and we begin again with the 7s for the next run the parts go as they do in the first run 7s then basic end words then confusion gpm then the objects hollow then the objects solid therefore the trick is always to run only the earliest run available and not get into later runs the bank has 10 runs or 50 parts none of these use gpm line plot they only contain what is given on the platen you are issued the proper way to run it all is to get on with it after 10 runs you may have to go from run 1 to run 10 all over again anyway to get any final bits so your first running of the whole 10 runs may not be your final runearliest part

repeat the number on the actual foolscap paper across the top of the foolscap paper is written the students name the name of the part being run the number of the run and the date the reads on the items are written on the foolscap paper alongside the number of the item to keep from cramping your reads and have enough paper on all parts just take legal foolscap size paper and use the items consecutively numbers and go down the page as far as necessary to record all reads then leave space and write the next number it is too hard to keep the numbers even on the platen and worksheet number work sheet by page number of platen consecutive letter page 1 of platen becomes page 1a b c of worksheet label each worksheet well in order to save paper bulk continue down your piece of foolscap paper from session to session dating each new session start use both sides of your foolscap paper but use separate auditor reports for each session of course any comments that need to be written down must be put on another sheet of paper only the actual reads including any buttons that are used and any cognitions should be written on your foolscap paper do not write the name of the items only the pair number and item number leave some space on your foolscap paper when you complete an item so that if the next item does not read you then have sufficient space to go back and add more in if necessary to the previous item do not write anything on the platen when you return your auditors reports and worksheets always use paper clips never use stapler on this course 293 joe bloggs run part 8565 page 1a light pair 1 1 2 pair 2 1 2 9566 pair 3 1 2 pair 4 1 2 10566294running items always run the earliest item first flatten it and go on to next item complete the part go to first item in next part etc one calls the item and marks its reads until one longer gets reads then one calls the next item and marks its reads until it longer reads then one can call the first item of the pair again and second item calling them as pair until they longer read the reads obtained on an item by calling pair are put under the appropriate item number all the reads for any one item are recorded in the same place on the worksheet regardless of when the item is called such as calling as pair or in rerunning space should be left after each item so that reads can be added when calling the pair or in the case of having to go back and get more charge off an item whenever you move the tone arm down mark on your worksheet bd and put the new ta position in the blank space eg bd 30 if an item does not read the moment it is called then you have left the item just before it charged so call the earlier item again and get the read or reads off it making sure you dont go into later run then call the item that didnt read the first time and you will find it instantly reads when you leave an item to go back to previous one put on the item you leave and at the item you go back to if you go back more than one item put for as many items as you go back ie if you go back three items you put on the item left and on each item gone back over each item must be called in turn up to the place where you went back from note this can easily be overdone getting all reads off earlier items as you can put yourself into later runs so moderation in this goes long way but never ignore the fact that new item didnt read the first time it was called it always means you didnt get all reads off the item immediately before or that you failed to spot the thetan at the moment never go past nonreading item when running clearing course material you find you get certain amount of reads on an item correct run type reads are fs lfs sbds bds then the following item in the same session will get approximately the same amount of reads if not and you get only few reads then go back to the previous item that read well and you will find there is more charge on it after that the next item will read with approximately the same number of reads as the previous one one doesnt muck about with concepts or other maunderings the item is the item and cognitions do or dont appear the item is the thing and calling it is what makes it read if the items go on reading dont try to suppress them items read big and many times you may get as many as 25 or more large reads on every item the main thing is to clear get all the charge off each item for the run you are in be sure to keep in the correct run remember if you get bored with so many reads to take the boredom off as button you can just throw away reads because you get tired of seeing it read your purpose is to clean each item not make yourself interested or happy or entertained lot of it is just hard slogging work if you clean them up as you go all will be well295you can sometimes erase an item and have it then read as lock or lock item test it for lock if it reads too long if you find you are getting small reads ie ticks small falls check to see if there is any charge left on the previous item and check to see if you are in the correct run falls and blowdowns are expected on each item not just small reads dont go on calling the item if you are getting small reads find the outness and correct it keep auditors reports for each session dont try to run the same item out of all runs at one time just proceed from bottom up run by run in order item by item part by part take care to stay in the correct run it is now proved fact that none of the basic bank will erase on preclear until all the lower grades are properly established on preclear and then the basic bank confronted in its exactness item by item in sequence and in its exact relationship to the rest of the bank know then that 1 there is haphazard blowing of bank 2 item blows out of context 3 there are prior holes blown in the bank for anyone matter what the nature of any prior auditing might have been until the item has actually been run pain pain pn occurs only when you left something charged behind you earlier sicknesssickness is part of the somatic it runs out flattenflatten every item thoroughly erasureyou are not seeking release from the bank at this level you are erasing therefore the bank has blown is nonsense one has blown from the bank so get back in it and run it total erasure is the aim readno read on new item is always followed by long falls and blowdowns never bypass an item just because it didnt read sure passport to upset is to leave items alive and go on or to skip an item because it didnt read they all will read rerunif you start getting pain or sickness you got into later run or you by passed some charge and must rerun the earlier area you just did some thing is still alive if in doubt rerun the lot from the start of the part erase thoroughly but if it is later run get back into the correct one neglectif you run upwards getting reads at all on several items and still go on you will become quite upset do not go past nonreading items find out what is wrong immediately and remedy it bypassed charge use l7 on yourself if you dont quickly find reasons for pain or upset readswrite down using the code every read you get after the item that it occurred on write for item that didnt read at first read even when it then reads296example lfsbdfffsbd releaseyoull go release lot of times ignore it we are erasing in r6 release can be ignored because the r6 bank is vanishing not true of lower grades ta upthe ta goes up between sessions it cleans up and goes down on beginning rudiments or on the first couple of items or both repeater technique the items are flattened by repeater technique just repeat them until they longer read get your own reaction off repeat again repeat to read beware of session suppress and invalidate part bis nouns be careful of first one because it is used in the sense of noun dont run it otherwise than as pure noun readsit is not unusual for an item not to read at first call read the one just before it again try the item once more if still read call several just before it then call it again it will read items read many times in most cases dont leave anything reading behind you sometimes you will find pair you just left are still very alive flatten them mark all reads or lack of them wooden face wooden feeling in the face is caused by pulling later items that are also pulled in out of arrangement if you pull in from later bank runs x and you will not get wooden feeling in your face but if you pull them in x you will code used in noting reads f1 to 2 fall needle left to

objects relative to the thetan are the objects appear about an arms length away on coming in or going away the location is the same for 1 object it appears few feet in front of ones face for 2 objects they appear to right and left of one at same height as the front one for 3 objects they appear combined as 1 and 2 objects positions in front face and to right and left for 4 objects they appear as

the thetan at the same moment seek to perceive the object or objects dont call them perceive them as going away or as coming in as given if the mass stacks up you are missing spotting the thetan go back and spot it yourself at the time it is an easy run if you grind at it too hard you will get into the same run repeating as later run if you have pain you have missed read or you went into later run if you have severe pains youve gotten into later run if your eyes burn you have invalidated something 298mistakes and illness about the only thing that can make you ill on the clearing course is your own error losing your place on the plot skipping or rerunning between sessions little can happen you cannot repair but at the start of session you may pick up in error something you have already run or skip and pick up late ie you have done 133 you start at 129 the next session more seriously you have not done 141 to 144 but begin the next session at 145 if you skip 4 items and do light you will surely become ill by illness is meant colds flu dysentery etc to prevent becoming ill be very careful of your place very careful to pick up where you left off very careful not to skip and you will do very well if you do become physically ill down in bed it is almost certain you missed items and did skip and further you must have been pts at the time connected to an sp clearing course

above is commevable offense334if mission or field auditor believes one of their pcs to have gone clear they will send the pc and his folders to their closest org which has cs who is clear for full dianetic clear special intensive the following definition of clear is nonconfidential and may be and has been used in promo or other publications given issue authority for release definition of cleara being who is unrepressed and self determined confidential data clear has lost or erased the matter energy space and time connected to the thing called mind he has been cleared of the mas pictures etc in the bank or mind it is negative gain clear cognition clear occurs when one stops mocking up bank or realizes that he is mocking it up or has been mocking it up that is the clear cognition the realization that he is or has been mocking up the mass and pictures etc that make up the bank when the person arrives at this realization he can then of course cease mocking up bank clear has perhaps not entirely lost the automaticity of mocking up mass but at least he knows hes putting it there and practice increases his general reality the person who has actually gone clear will express the clear cognition or some version of it upon going clear or at some point on the dianetic clear special intensive he must have expressed this in some way for the cs to know he has in fact gone clear and before being permitted to attest the state of clear can be achieved prior to doing the clearing course it can occur on dianetic auditing especially new era dianetics sometimes it has occurred on goals processing and even on objective processes it is not however attained by feeding people cognitions clears are made through auditing non confidential verifying and declaring the state of clear when the individual before doing the clearing course thinks he is or might be clear or when he has read on correction list such as cs 53 green form etc as having gone clear he must be given the dianetic clear special intensive to verify the state and rehabilitate it if valid when the steps of the dianetic clear special intensive have been thoroughly done to full end phenomena and full resurgence of the state the person may be sent to attest to the state of clear ref hcob 2 may 79 iss i dianetic clear special intensive 335the state of clear must be acknowledged and declared when it has been validly attained and verified programming the dianetic clear for further auditing dianetic clear must not be run on engrams r3ra or any version of r3r or dianetics dianetic clear does the purification rundown and the survival rundown if he has not had these he is given the scientology drug rundown unless he has already completed full ned drug rundown or other dianetic drug rundown he is run on expanded arc straightwire and expanded grades 0 iv to full ability gained for each grade not previously standardly declared note he would not be run on the r3ra section of the service fac handling on grade iv however he can be given touch assists or contact assists as can clears and ots but not dianetic auditing assist nor any dianetic auditing when each grade has been handled to ability gained the next step is the solo auditor course at saint hill or an advanced org dianetic clear is not run on power r6ew or the clearing course but upon completion of the solo auditor course goes directly onto ot 1 this hcob is issued to org cses who are themselves clear or above as the clear cognition cannot be issued broadly and must not be fed to pc which is commevable offense clears are made through auditing not by feeding eps or cognitions to pcs this is important as someone who has not made clear will not make it on ot levels org cses who are clear or above however will need to be able to recognize the state of clear when it occurs on dianetics or otherwise to ensure using the steps of the dianetic clear special intensive that the state is real and to declare any such pc clear when the state has been truly attained once declared the persons pc folders must be clearly marked dianetic clear for security and for purposes of further programming the individual is then issued the standard clear certificate by certs and awards which states simply that he has attained the state of clear this standard certificate bears qualifying statement of the state once the person has attested to clear he may then be csed for further auditing per the programming data above i am entrusting clear cses with the responsibility of ensuring that the confidential data herein is kept secure so that each and every individual may honestly male it to clear and go ot lrhkjmcmp l ron hubbard copyright 1978 1980 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved336clears cause over reactive mind by l ron hubbard the total content of the reactive mind then is entheta held down by physical pain engrams which form the mass that causes later enturbulated theta to be permanently trapped the physical pain brings about the permanence of entrapment but the auditor will find his greatest store of entheta which he can covert into theta in secondaries and locks clear technically is simply an individual from whom all physical pain engrams all secondaries and all aberrative locks have been erased being clear does not mean being reeducated or reenvironmented or re geneticized individual but it does mean that all possible free theta in the case can be brought to bear on the problems of the environment and the future and that all the data in the analytical memory bank is available for the solution of those problems the clear can receive new engrams but these must be of very severe nature to be highly aberative because it is the early engrams on case which produce the greatest aberration and effect on the individual however do not mistake the fact that heavy intentional engrams hammered by ferocious physical pain into clear should that clear have been basically low on endowment of free theta may produce psychotic break but do not expect that engrams once erased and the entheta exhausted from the reactive mind will then return in some strange fashion the will not once they are properly addressed and converted it takes new physical pain to produce more engrams in clear clear will however become enturbulated by the environment but will enturbulate temporarily only and will suffer after effect from the enturbulence since there is nothing to trap the entheta337hubbard communications office saint hill manor east sussex hco policy letter of 17 january 1967 remimeo franchise fsms all students all preclears bpi an open letter to all clears you are clear well done and congratulations this state has not previously been attained in this universe and we must all work towards getting more peoplemany more peopleup to this level essentially you are clear on the 1st dynamic and still have lot of work in front of you to attain ot which is to say the remaining dynamics but nevertheless you will find you have many abilities hitherto undreamed of an ethical code already exists for ots so at the state of clear one should not assume that one has license to do just whatever one will you still have the remaining dynamics to go so dont use the abilities you have attained already to enslave others or indeed yourself with freedom comes responsibility and with responsibility comes the need to assess ones actions and to take only such actions as will do the greatest good over the greatest number of dynamics so the policies of scientology which have enabled you to reach the state of clear still apply to all clears in fact they apply more because you have the reality of their value and the necessity of seeing that they are followed those who have not yet attained clear will be watching you with some awe so you have the duty of setting an example of exemplary behavior in all aspects of your life as clear you have privileges beyond being declared clear as result bigger responsibilities will be given and expected of you so you must be prepared to responsibly educate yourself where necessary so that you can do whatever is assigned to you in proper manner in keeping with the main goals and aims of scientology so for you there is sitting down and resting upon your laurels waiving of policy promiscuous 2nd dynamic activities improper assumption of power control or influence or assuming that you automatically know best in every situation it is crime to invalidate the state of clearsee to it that you dont do this in your conduct as clear particularly as regards yourself you still have the rest of the dynamics to go you have now become more than ever part of team obsessive individualism and failure to organize were responsible for our getting into the state we got into as soon as you have gone the rest of the way this will become abundantly plain i expect and need your help to carry out the broad mission of decontaminating this area of the universe if you wish to help your first duty is to protect the repute of the state of clear by exemplary conduct your second duty is to attain ot as soon as possible your third if you still wish to help is to become part of the endeavor to clean up this sector of the universe and make it safe not only for ourselves but the billions of others who have been harmed as clear you are welcomed and honored dont do anything that will wear out your welcome or bring dishonor on yourself or upon other clears thank you for what you have done so far thank you for what you will do in the future i know i can count on you l ron hubbard founder338hubbard communications office saint hill manor east sussex hco bulletin of 13 november 1981 limited distribution grad iv cses and auditors clear or above in class iv orgs or above only c n f i d n t i l the sunshine rundown the sunshine rundown is brilliant new rundown that adds sparkle to the state of clear it is the next step after the dcsi on the grade chart it is done solo but does not require solo auditor course as prerequisite the solo auditor course is the next step after the sunshine rundown academy training may also be done after the sunshine rundown not further processing it may only be delivered in class iv orgs or higher orgs theory the auditing pc receives up to the point when he goes clear is subjective ie the pc looking inward into his mind and down the track the dcsi which follows picks up any loose ends of bpc and rehabilitates the state of clear it too is subjective the sunshine rundown is an extrovertive action that puts the clear into communication with the present time environment perhaps for the first time certainly it is the first time that he is in direct perception of the environment without bank in the way procedure the clear is audited on the dcsi the folder csed and sent to declare the state of clear after the declare the auditor or d of p qualified to do so hands the clear the envelope containing the sunshine rd ensures that he understands the instructions and sends him off to do it when the clear completes the sunshine rd to its ep he goes to the examiner and attests to having completed the sunshine rd and writes success story his certificates for the state of clear and for the sunshine rd must have been prepared in advance by certs and awards and routed to the registrar the clear is routed from success officer to the registrar his attestation and success story are put in the folder and sent to the cs but the clear is not held up for this the registrar presents the certificates congratulates him and informs him that his next step is the solo auditor course or training to class iv and signs him up for it right away where the film the solo auditor is available he should be shown the film339the clear should then be started on his training as soon as possible and will be eager to do so but if there are any bad indicators notify the cs and qual sec immediately csing the csing is very simple when the dcsi is complete the cs cses the folder to 1examiner to declare the state of clear 2the auditor or d of p to issue the sunshine rd envelope when the folder is returned to the cs with the sunshine rd attestation and success story the cs checks these to ensure that all is well or acts instantly to get the clear reviewed the only possible errors on the sunshine rd itself are that it was overrun or not completed but bad indicator after the sunshine rd would be most likely to be due to an earlier outness missed on the dcsi or even that the person was not clear after all but that would mean that the auditor and cs had goofed badly on the dcsi the first action to take if the dcsi was successful but the sunshine rd was not would be to have an auditor fly the ruds and then meter check whether the sunshine rd is overrun incomplete if overrun indicate and rehab as needed to fn if incomplete send the person off to complete it and then to examiner to attest success story etc if the above did not fully resolve the matter or if there is any doubt about the dcsi or if the clear exhibits bis bad indicators later including not moving up the bridge cs for cs 53 to fning list by an auditor who has done the assessment drills per hcob apr 80 should it turn out that the pc was not clear repair any upset and return the pc to ned drd or ned whatever step the pc was on and retread the auditor and cs and get the auditors trs and metering in per hcob 22 apr 80 assessment drills before attempting another dcsi or sunshine rd fortunately these errors and repairs are not likely to be necessary and you will find that the sunshine rd is very easy to cs and extremely rewarding cautions be sure to ensure the confidentiality of the sunshine rd do not permit it to be spoiled for others by carelessly leaving the materials where they can be read or by discussion of it within the hearing of others ensure that the instructions are handed to the clear in the envelope provided which must be clearly marked as confidential it could spoil the rundown for another if he were to read or hear the instructions and self audit on it before the appropriate time always report any breach of security to the ethics officer and go ensure that when people are signed up for the dcsi that they are also signed up for the sunshine rd at the same time that they sign promise not to reveal the materials nor to discuss them with others who have not had these rundowns or within their hearing ensure that success stories on clear and sunshine rd do not contain confidential statements or excerpt these out before posting or publication also ensure that plenty of these success stories are made known340always deliver the dcsi and sunshine rd as package preferably the sunshine rd should be done the same day that the person declares clear there must be delay from the attestation to the sunshine rd and success story to the registrar the registrar must have the certificates to hand and the forms to enroll the person onto the solo auditor course the qual sec and cs must act instantly to handle any bi bad indicator following the sunshine rd should such ever occur and wherever possible get the person to session and repaired before leaving the org or called in for repair immediately when the bi is noted if for any reason the sunshine rd is not done immediately after the clear declare the auditor must fly the persons ruds if there is fn before issuing the sunshine rd instructions the examiner must collect back the envelope and instructions when the person attests and must return these to the cs do not try to persuade sunshine rd completion to have other auditing but encourage him to continue on up the bridge the only exception would be when the clear reaches higher org for solo set up auditing even then sufficient time must have elapsed for the clear to enjoy his win and it is big one if any abbreviation is used for the sunshine rd use sunrd so as not to confuse it with the srd survival rd when the d of p or registrar is clear and has had the sunshine rd or if they are already of higher case level allow them to read this hcob for their enlightenment then the d of p can issued the sunshine rd instructions after the clear declare saving precious auditor time ensure that the routing form for dcsi and sunshine rd is used and ensure that the line is drilled to flubless before starting deliver and from time to time thereafter although this is the hat of other executives you as the cs are also responsible to ensure that such drilling is done or even to do it yourself if necessary cs series 56 57 well drilled line makes for smooth flubless service and higher quality too summary this is bright new rundown use it and help clear the planet say

member hat franchise issued may 1965 keeping scientology working series 1 note neglect of this pol ltr has caused great hardship on staffs has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out international effort to restore basic scientology over the world within 5 years after the issue of this pl with off the lines violation had almost destroyed orgs quickie grades entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases therefore actions which neglect or violate this policy letter are high crimes resulting in comm evs on administrators and execu tives it is not entirely tech matter as its neglect destroys orgs and caused 2year slump it is the business of every staff member to enforce it special message the following policy letter means what it says it was true in 1965 when i wrote it it was true in 1970 when i had it reissued i am reissuing it now in 1980 to avoid again slipping back into period of omitted and quickied fundamen tal grade chart actions on cases thereby denying gains and threatening the viability of scientology and of orgs scientology will keep working only as long as you do your part to keep it working by applying this policy letter what i say in these pages has always been true it holds true today it will still hold true in the year 2000 and it will continue to hold true from there on out matter where you are in scientology on staff or not this policy letter has something to do with you all levels365keeping scientology working hco sec or communicator hat check on all personnel and all new personnel as taken on we have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology the only thing now is getting the technology applied if you cant get the technology applied then you cant deliver whats promised its as simple as that if you can get the technology applied you can deliver whats promised the only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is results trouble spots occur only where there are results attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are results or bad results therefore the road before scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied so it is the task of the assn or org sec the hco sec the case supervisor the d of p the d of t and all staff members to get the correct technology applied getting the correct technology applied consists of one having the correct technology two knowing the technology three knowing it is correct four teaching correctly the correct technology five applying the technology six seeing that the technology is correctly applied seven hammering out of existence incorrect technology eight knocking out incorrect applications nine closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology ten closing the door on incorrect application one above has been done two has been achieved by many three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in proper manner and observing that it works that way four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world five is consistently accomplished daily six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently366seven is done by few but is weak point eight is not worked on hard enough nine is impeded by the reasonable attitude of the not quite bright ten is seldom done with enough ferocity seven eight nine and ten are the only places scientology can bog down in any area the reasons for this are not hard to find weak certainty that it works in three above can lead to weakness in seven eight nine and ten b further the nottoobright have bad point on the button selfimportance c the lower the iq the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation d the service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong the bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad thus we as scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to seven eight nine and ten in all the years i have been engaged in research i have kept my comm lines wide open for research data i once had the idea that group could evolve truth third of century has thoroughly disabused of that idea willing as i was to accept suggestions and data only handful of suggestions less than twenty had longrun value and none were major or basic and when i did accept major or basic suggestions and used them we went astray and i repented and eventually had to eat crow on the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writings which if accepted and acted upon would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs so 1 know what group of people will do and how insane they will go in accepting unworkable technology by actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100000 that group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroy good technology as we could have gotten along without suggestions then we had better steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it this point will of course be attacked as unpopular egotistical and undemocratic it very well may be but it is also survival point and i dont see that popular measures selfabnegation and democracy have done anything for man but push him further into the mud currently popularity endorses degraded novels selfabnega tion has filled the southeast asian jungles with stone idols and corpses and democracy has given us inflation and income tax our technology has not been discovered by group true if the group had not supported in many ways i could not have discovered it either but it remains that if in its formative stages it was not discovered by group then group efforts one can safely assume will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future i can only say this now that it is done there remains of course group tabulation or coordination of what has been done which will be valuableonly so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications the contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship of defense of organization of dissemination of367application of advices on results and of finance these were great contributions and were and are appreciated many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are discovery contribution was not however part of the broad picture we will not speculate here on why this was so or how i came to rise above the bank we are dealing only in facts and the above is factthe group left to its own devices would not have evolved scientology but with wild dramatizations of the bank called new ideas would have wiped it out supporting this is the fact that man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolvepsychiatry psychology surgery shock treatment whips duress punishment etc ad infinitum so realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense and refuse to sink back into it again see that seven eight nine and ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped relax them get reasonable about it and we will perish so far while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions i have not failed on seven eight nine and ten in areas i could supervise closely but its not good enough for just myself and few others to work at this whenever this control as per seven eight nine and ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed witness elizabeth nj wichita the early organi zations and groups they crashed only because i longer did seven eight nine and ten then when they were all messed up you saw the obvious reasons for failure but ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons the common denominator of group is the reactive bank thetans without banks have different responses they only have their banks in common they agree then only on bank principles person to person the bank is identical so constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in human group an individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from humanoid group to get anything decent done the bankagreement has been what has made earth helland if you were looking for hell and found earth it would certainly serve war famine agony and disease has been the lot of man right now the great governments of earth have developed the means of frying every man woman and child on the planet that is bank that is the result of collective thought agreement the decent pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by the group idea for that matter look how we ourselves are attacked by public opinion media yet there is more ethical group on this planet than ourselves thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then as group of freed beings achieve freedom and reason it is only the aberrated group the mob that is destructive when you dont do seven eight nine and ten actively you are working for the bankdominated mob for it will surely surely introduce incorrect technology and swear by it b apply technology as incorrectly as possible c open the door to any destructive idea and d encourage incorrect application368its the bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing its the bank that says we must fail so just dont play that game do seven eight nine and ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns heres an actual example in which senior executive had to interfere because of pc spin case supervisor told instructor to have auditor b run process x on preclear c auditor b afterwards told instructor that it didnt work instructor was weak on three above and didnt really believe in seven eight nine and ten so instructor told the case supervisor process x didnt work on preclear c now this strikes directly at each of one to six above in preclear c auditor b instructor and the case supervisor it opens the door to the introduction of new technology and to failure what happened here instructor didnt jump down auditor bs throat thats all that happened this is what he should have done grabbed the auditors report and looked it over when higher executive on this case did so she found what the case supervisor and the rest missed that process x increased preclear cs ta to 25 ta divisions for the session but that near session end auditor b qd and ad with cognition and abandoned process x while it still gave high ta and went off running one of auditor bs own manufacture which nearly spun preclear c auditor bs iq on examination turned out to be about 75 instructor was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone even lunatic the case supervisor was found to be too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases all right theres an all too typical example the instructor should have done seven eight nine and ten this would have begun this way auditor b that process x didnt work instructor what exactly did you do wrong instant attack wheres your auditors report for the session good look here you were getting lot of ta when you stopped process x what did you do then the pc wouldnt have come close to spin and all four of these would have retained their certainty in year i had four instances in one small group where the correct process recommended was reported not to have worked but on review found that each one had increased the ta b had been abandoned and c had been falsely reported as unworkable also despite this abuse in each of these four cases the recommended correct process cracked the case yet they were reported as not having worked similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed then the resulting error uncorrected in the auditor is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter so seven eight nine and ten are even more important in course than in supervision of cases heres an example rave recommendation is given graduating student because he gets more ta on pcs than any other student on the course figures of 435 ta divisions session are reported of course his model session is poor but its just knack he has is also included in the recommendation careful review is undertaken because nobody at levels to iv is going to get that much ta on pcs it is found that this student was never taught to read an emeter ta dial and instructor observed his handling of meter and it was not discovered that he overcompensated nervously swinging the ta 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at set so everyone was about to throw away standard processes and model session because this one student got such369remarkable ta they only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student the pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain impeded by rough model session and misworded processes thus what was making the pcs win actual scientology was hidden under lot of departures and errors i recall one student who was squirreling on an academy course and running lot of offbeat whole track on other students after course hours the academy students were in state of electrification on all these new experiences and werent quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on seven eight nine and ten so they stuck subsequently this student prevented another squirrel from being straight ened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse hard tough instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of girl but students had right to do whatever they pleased squirreling going off into weird practices or altering scientology only comes about from noncomprehension usually the noncomprehension is not of scientology but some earlier contact with an offbeat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood when people cant get results from what they think is standard practice they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree the most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight scientology under instruction in scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles and the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble and worse it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions hence debacle resulted in two places directly traced to failures of instruction earlier so proper instruction is vital the d of t and his instructors and all scientology instructors must be merciless in getting four seven eight nine and ten into effective action that one student dumb and impossible though he may seem and of use to anyone may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure scientology got home to him with what we know now there is student we enroll who cannot be properly trained as an instructor one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the sluggards inside out personally system will do it only you or with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student never on whole class only hes slow something is awful wrong take fast action to correct it dont wait until next week by then hes got other messes stuck to him if you cant graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining graduate them in such state of shock theyll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling then experience will gradually bring about three in them and theyll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing when somebody enrolls consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the universenever permit an openminded approach if theyre going to quit let them quit fast if they enrolled theyre aboard and if theyre aboard theyre here on the same terms as the rest of uswin or die in the attempt never let them be halfminded about being scientologists the finest organizations in history have been tough dedicated organizations not one nambypamby bunch of pantywaist dilettantes have ever made anything its tough universe the social veneer makes it seem mild but only the tigers surviveand even they have hard time well survive because we are tough and are dedicated when we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger370when we instruct halfmindedly and are afraid to offend scared to enforce we dont make students into good scientologists and that lets everybody down when mrs pattycake comes to us to be taught turn that wandering doubt in her eye into fixed dedicated glare and shell win and well all win humor her and we all die little the proper instruction attitude is youre here so youre scientologist now were going to make you into an expert auditor matter what happens wed rather have you dead than incapable fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear but we wont have to bear it forever the bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job and the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from one to ten keep those in mind and well be able to grow fast and as we grow our shackles will be less and less failing to keep one to ten will make us grow less so the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the high priests its our possible failure to retain and practice our technology an instructor or supervisor or executive must challenge with ferocity instances of unworkability they must uncover what did happen what was run and what was done or not done if you have one and two you can only acquire three for all by making sure of all the rest were not playing some minor game in scientology it isnt cute or something to do for lack of something better the whole agonized future of this planet every man woman and child on it and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in scientology this is deadly serious activity and if we miss getting out of the trap now we may never again have another chance remember this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past dont muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do seven eight nine and ten do them and well win l ron hubbard founder lrhjwrrntkamesrdbkgm copyright 1965 1970 1973 1980

the effort to get students through courses and get pcs processed in orgs was considered best handled by reducing materials or deleting processes from grades the pressure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly answered by just not delivering the correct way to speed up students progress is by using 2 way comm and applying the study materials to students the best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not the puzzle of the decline of the entire scientology network in

the remainder of what is heard or written i have now discovered that mlsunderstood on any given subject can prevent the completion of cycle of action related to that subject therefore those people who dont complete cycles of action on certain subjects have misunderstood word on them this then results in noproduct situations therefore when you are getting product look for the misunderstood word on the subject matter how long and arduous it is its there and when its found the person can go on and complete cycle of action and get product caution make sure the person actually does have an inability to complete cycle of action before you get into handling him you dont handle somebody who is completing cycles of action that result in production misunderstoods and perception misunderstoods can also act as perception shutoffs they can actually interrupt persons perception it is quite astonishing that perceptions such as sight sound and even touch can be shut off by misu words this opens the door to the fact that people apparently do not see hear notice or handle outnesses when they have misus on them this also may open the door to people who have perceptic shutoffs such as poor eyesight deafness other perception difficulties374misunderstoods and complexity misunderstoods lead to complexity people who have misus in an area are inclined to develop vast complexities they can generate confusions and complexities beyond belief people do this because having misunderstoods they do not confront and duplicate in the area and so get into lot of thinkthink and unnecessary significance their ability to get things done in that area dwindles as result and at the bottom of all this is simply misunderstood words misunderstoods and total organize when you see an area that is organizing only you know that area is loaded with misunderstoods when people have incomplete cycles due to misus they get bogged down into organiza tion you can tell when people have misusthey are totally involved in organize organize organize they dont know what they are doing there is level below thisthey have overts and withholds which prevent even organizing below that level people are pts lacking sense of organization actually lies below this it is below the level of misus overts and withholds and ptsnessand youd have to go north through ptsness and overts and withholds to even get to the misus misunderstoods and organize there can also exist condition where someone does not organize any corner of his area or work or organizations or lines l his manifests itself by irrational demands to only produce and to prevent any organization so that production can occur at the bottom of this you are very likely to find misunderstood words particularly on the purpose of the production or why one is producing it is in this sector that you get overt products most frequently handling the exact procedure for handling these misus is given in hcob 17 jun 79 crashing mlsus the

packs security of data issued with small amount of r6 data in 1964 three or four persons promptly used it on pcs knowing well it was forbidden the pcs became ill or misemotional toward us and just the day i write this original writing 4 october 1965 i myself encountered pc very ill who had had some original r6 data misused on her and did not suspect why her case and health had worsened she was not ready for it at all the issue earlier was trial balloon in sense i found certain persons small minority were not up to responsibility for the material of april 1964 therefore our firm action will be that the moment we find the material of the clearing course or course has escaped or been misused we will quickly trace the person who was insecure and cut off all further or any future clearing or data issue to that person the likelihood of independent discovery even with clues has proven to be nonexistent by actual review of auditors trying to find pieces of it when they had over half of the answers already you must realize that we suffer all of us from the misuse of knowledge concerning the mind at very early period to place this data near such people as psychiatrists or even states places them in position to enslave people or repeat the original action and cave people in very small minority receiving incorrect data did promptly use it harmfully on others after april 1964 until we ourselves have climbed well out of the hole we must safeguard the materials our case gains depend on it and others could make our salvage of people impossible we do not safeguard these materials from any commercial consideration our futures those of each of us and those of all scientologists depend on our keeping this material under lock and safeguarded from abuse until we are well away as group and can handle things better as individuals as well as group the road is wide open to anyone to come up the grades and obtain them but it is shut to any who misuse them or injure their security students of the advanced courses the advanced course cs and supervisor ethics officers and all hco and org staff have it in their personal interest to enforce security of materials to the limit these restrictions apply to data up to grade v from power processing on up the data is confidential up to there you can release scientology data as you always havefreely and to everyone but this last bit is dangerous in unskilled or uneducated or unscrupulous hands and it is purely ours it belongs to the scientologists who keep the show on the road and must be available to them when they are ready

letting student onto solo auditing who cant audit and hasnt been trained to audit giving solo student his materials while he is still studying basic auditing letting files or materials get in any confusion letting security go out on the solo materials line failing to cs sessions not having solo unit not applying the cs series not making students attain the ep of level before going on using next levels to handle whats wrong with case not seeing solo and advance course are well attended and promoted and sold failing to get blows or incompletes back in and handled lose track of student after sending him for intensives and not being at all times aware of who is on solo lines feeding eps to students failing to be courteous and friendly and helpful to solo students ______________386these are the major faults which slow up or stop the solor6ewao flow lines cost wins and income and keep orgs who have ao lines from being prosperous if you were to take the above as checklist and go over the solo lines each point found in violation would be major why as to low income and upsets for instance the solo supervisor is not just responsible for the solo course he is responsible for all checkouts of all solo and advance courses including r6ew when there is in charge for the whole line solo r6ew clear to vii on up there is one to regulate and coordinate flow so it doesnt flow if there is solo review auditor then patch up can only be done by sending the person to the hgc where an inevitable backlog bars the person off solo for days weeks or forever and kills all further course wins and sales review for solo student must be immediate it is of course charged for the only way solo student gets off this one line is by be sent to cramming that should be one day action at the most if mini courses have to be taken by solo students they are taken under the solo super this doesnt say that the solo course supervisor cannot have persons for admin and other course supers under him as for promo when an ao begins to specialize in intensives lower grades and class iv actions they are taking business away from class iv orgs and shs and not wearing their own hat thus solo courses must be promoted nothing in this policy letter may be interpreted to mean that solo sign up cant be audited on anything but fast reviews it is totally possible that person signed up for solo r6ew may be found to need several intensives and be given them as long as 1 the student is signed up for solo and 2 he is not shunted over into hgc backlog but is actual gotten into auditing with actual intensives being given in rapid succession like one or two 12 12 hour intensives week if these conditions cant be met the solo line is justified in expanding its own review all manner of irregularities can occur on solo lines like giving 10 day solo course at r6 level and then letting the student who of course could never learn to audit in 10 days fall flat on his head from there on out the line up is given in cs series 5 and cs series 5 addition solo courses can and do produce the most fantastic wins and case gains it is up to those entrusted with the activity to make it so l

background the world before dianetics had never known precision mental science man has used mental knowledge in the past mainly for control politics and propaganda the word psychology in the popular usage is synonymous with getting around somebody in the thousands of years before 1950 there were many philosophers and much knowledge was gathered in the field of logic mathematics electronics and the material sciences however due to ideologies and political conflicts little of this prior knowledge was ever applied to the field of the human mind the scientific idea of regarding as truth only that which could be demonstrated with result was never really applied to the mind researchers in this field were not fully trained in mathematics the scientific method or logic they were interested mainly in their own private ideas and in political targets as an example the only schools of psychology taught or followed in the west were russian and east german the primary school was that of ivan petrovitch pavlov 18491936 veterinarian every school child and university student was required to study pavlov in one disguise or another the burden of pavlovs work is that man is an animal and only works through conditioning the western nations overlooked the fact that this work had already destroyed several countries including czarist russia that stalin had made pavlov write up his work in the kremlin in 1928 in order to permit the control of men using the mental studies of an enemy is very dangerous thing to do the west at that time was run by only the very best people and possibly it pleased them greatly to think that the masses they controlled were only animals after all that this also made them animals did not occur to them billions of dollars were appropriated by parliaments and congress to subsidize men to better control their animals these men had idea of healing anyone or helping anyone riots and civil disorder were the only product they achieved394dianetics was released straight into the teeth of these heavily subsidized barons of the mind with their it takes 12 years to make psychiatrist and authority states and any effort to interrupt this monopoly must be stamped out at once psychology and psychiatry were state government subjects pushed by the very best people they could not make their way on their own because they were contrary to the public morals and customs the public actually wanted nothing to do with them in mental institutions torture permanent damage and death were the order of the day on the basis that it did not matter if one killed people as they were just animals any way so the public was on the side of dianetics and later scientology and the governments were on the side of the very best people press controlled by governments and intelligence services and the very best people lied endlessly about dianetics and scientology dianetics new valid mental science was pitted against russian and eastern european teachings dianetics is not only the first mental science developed in the west it is the first mental science on the planet that uniformly produces beneficial results man is being subjected to fantastic and violent

entire balkans poland germany and many more eastern european countries have already perished trying to use the work of pavlov wundt and others the entire west having bought the same governing ideas is now in turmoil and is perishing in its turn dianetics refuses to be revolutionary activity it does not have to be all it has as mission is to get itself applied the basic building block of society is the individual from individuals groups are built and this is the society society is better than its basic building blocks men are not animals well men are sane men dianetics if applied to individuals in the society brings hope well and sane beings395these well and sane beings sent on to scientology then become brilliant and very able beings we are evolving man to higher state in this state he can better handle his problems we are not trying to overthrow anyone we are not revolting against anyone in truth we call even make the fancied very best people into actual very best people dianetics was first conceived in 1930 and the developments of 39 years have gone into producing standard dianetics dianetics the original thesis was published in 1949 in manuscript form it was copied in various ways hand to hand across the world dianetics the evolution of science was published in late 1949 dianetics the modern science of mental health was published may 9 1950 and has since sold millions of copies in the early 50s new discoveries concerning the spirit brought us into scientology but dianetics was never lost sight of and every little while i would push it further ahead toward fast easy 100 workability the present release of standard dianetics is near final product if done exactly it produces good permanent results in only few hours of auditing one can train dianetic auditor in standard dianetics in from 10 days to month at the most with an average of about 2 weeks these are very very worthwhile advances and standard dianetics is almost as great breakthrough in 1969 as the original thesis in 1949 hundreds of thousands of hours of search and research have gone into it dianetics has progressed from the predianetic period of science of the mind to the existence of real science of the mind to fast accurate science simpler than any other scientific subject and of more value to man all this advance has been very hardly won without government billions in the teeth of avalanches of lies and opposition the subject owes allegiance to anyone but itself it has commitments to anyone it has politics it belongs to those who use it it is the only game in the universe where

trouble just to end session for fifteen years we have always continued session that found the pc in trouble and i myself have audited pc for nine additional hours all night long in fact just to get the pc through newer auditors not trained in the stern school of running engrams must learn this all over again it doesnt matter whether the auditor has had policy on this or notone would think that common decency would be enough as to leave pc in the middle of secondary or an engram and just coolly end the session is pretty cruel some do it because they are startled or afraid and rabbit run away by ending the session auditors who end process or change it when it has turned on heavy somatic are likewise ignorant what turns it on will turn it off this is the oldest rule in auditing of course people get into secondaries and engrams go through misemotion and heavy somatics this happens because things are running out to end off process or session because of the clock is to ignore the real purpose of auditing the oldest rules we have are get the pc through it b what turns it on will turn it off c the way out is the way through these now are expressed as policy399a falsified auditors report is also subject to court of ethics any auditor violating this policy letter is liable to all immediate court of ethics convened within 24 hours of the offense or as soon as is urgently possible auditing at all levels works well when it is done by the book the purpose of ethics is to open the way for all to get in tech then we can do our job there is modern process that will not work when ex actly applied therefore in the eyes of ethics all auditing failures are ethics failurespts suppressive persons as pcs or noncompliance with tech for auditors and the first offense an auditor can commit is ceasing to audit when he is most needed by his pc hence it is the first most important consideration of ethics to prevent such occurrences then well make happy pcs releases and clears l ron

flag lrh comms the reason for q and q and means question and answer when the term q and is used it means one did not get an answer to his question it also means not getting compliance with an order but accepting something else example auditor do birds fly pc i dont like birds auditor what dont you like about birds flunk its q and the right reply would be an answer to the question asked and the right action would be to get the original question answered tr 4 handling origins can apply here the moment tr 4 is violated ack and return the pc to original question and the original unanswered question is not again asked the auditor just drifts along with the pc things get restimulated nothing gets really handled or run in administration the same thing can happen the executive gives an order the junior says or does something else the executive does not simply tr 4 it and get the original order done and the result is chaos executive phone mr schultz and tell him our printing order will be there this afternoon junior i dont know his number executive dont you have phone book junior the phone company didnt send one this year as our bill was overdue executive the fool goes to accounts to see what about the phone bill mr schultz never gets his call the printing order arrives but mr schultz doesnt know it example executive do target 21 now junior i dont have any issue files executive what happened to them junior mimeo goofed executive ill go see mimeo dispersal q and is simply postulate aberration aberration is nonstraight line by definition sick thetan who is all caved in cant direct postulate at anything when he tries he lets it wobble around and go elsewhere the difference between degraded being and an is simply that the db cant put out postulate or intention in direct line or way and make it hold good the insane are great example of this they are insane because they have evil intentions but they cant even make these stick they may intend to burn down the house but they usually wind up watering the rug or do some other non sequitur thing its not that they dont mess things401up the whole point here is that they cant even properly destroy what they intend to destroy even their evil intentions wobble poor things but not all people who q and are insane when person is running at effect he qs and as he is confronted by life he does not confront it he is usually bit blind to things as his ability to look at is turned back on him by his lack of beam power thus he gives the appearance of being unaware his emotional feeling is overwhelm his mental state is confusion he starts for b winds up ata other not too well intentioned people can play tricks on qer and aer when they dont want to answer or comply they artfully bring about q and example bosco does not want to staple the mimeo issue he knows his senior qs and as so we get this senior staple that issue with the big stapler bosco i hurt my thumb q and senior have you been to see the medical officer bosco he wouldnt look at it q and senior ill go have word with him departs bosco gets back to reading jesse james rides again humming softly to himself for his trouble is he qs and as with the mest universe body q and some people q and with their bodies the body is after all composed of mest it follows the laws of mest one of these laws is newtons first law of motion inertia this is the tendency of mest object to remain motionless until acted upon by an exterior force or to continue in line of motion until acted upon by an exterior force well the main force around that is continually acting on human body is thetan the being himself the body will remain at rest since it is mest object until acted upon by the thetan that is supposed to be running it if that being is an aberrated nonstraight line being the body reacts on him more than he reacts on the body thus he remains motionless or very slow when the body is in unwanted motion the being does not deter the motion as the body is acting upon him far more than he is reacting on the body as result one of the manifestations is q and he wants to pick up piece of paper the body inertia has to be overcome to do so so he does not reach for the paper he just leaves the hand where it is this would be action at all if he then weakly forces the motion he finds himself picking up something else like paper clip decides he wants that anyway and settles for it now he has to invent why he has paper clip in his hand his original intention never gets executed some people on medical lines are just there not because of actual illness but because they are just qing and aing with their body402people also q and with themselves they want to stop drinking and cant they want to stop or change something about themselves or their body and then disperse off onto something else freud read all sorts of dire and awful things into simple q and he invented intentions the person must have that made him sublimate all freud succeeded in doing was making the person introspective looking for wrong whys the right why was simplethe person could not go in straight line to an objective and or could not cease to do something he was compulsively doing the very word aberration contains the idea of thisno straight line but bent one the cure for this sort of thing q and with body is objective processes and very willing and bright thetan can simply recognize it for what it isnot enough push and instead of going to the mo for slight ache he just pushes on through as the ache is recoil of body q and in lot of cases the ache itself goes away as soon as one simply pushes through painters and artists buy the idea they are benefited by aberration be glad you are neurotic was trick being played by the late and unlamented psychiatrists on artists one paints because he can push into execution what he visualizes the best painters were the least aberrated greenwich village or left bank artists when they dont paint never suspect its because they just cant overcome hand inertia to push paint brush people live q and lives they never become what they desire to be because they q and with life about it schopenhauer the german philosopher of doom even had dirty crack about being able to do things stubbornness is the will taking the place of the intellect by this one is intellectual if he qs and as summary people who cant get things done are simply qing and aing with people and life people who can get things done just dont q and all great truths are simple this is major one l ron hubbard founder lrhntjh copyright

has series of responsibilities that are part of every cs he gets to audit accepting cs when the solo auditor gets cs to do and he thinks it is not the correct thing to do he has the right to return it to the cs with the reason why and require another one he can agree to the auditor does not have the right to start doing cs and change it during the session except as noted below stale dated cs cs that is week or two old can be dynamite this is called stale dated cs meaning it is too old to be valid it should have been done sooner the pc of last week when the cs was written may have been well and happily employed but week later may have headaches and reprimand from the body the solo auditor who sees his cs is old and sees the pc has bad indicators is justified in demanding fresh cs giving his reasons why use fresh cses406ending the session when the cs he has is proving unworkable during the session the solo auditor has right to end the session and send the folder to the cs ending the session is totally up to the auditor if the auditor just doesnt complete an action that was producing ta and could be completes it is of course flunk such case is just not running basic incident the one more time through that would bring the ta down and give proper end phenomena this and similar actions would be an auditor error the judgment here is whether or not the auditors action is justified in ending the session even though he may have made an error the auditor cannot be blamed for the ending off of the session as that is totally up to him he can be given flunk for the error auditing over out ruds auditing pc or pre on something else whose ruds are out is major auditing error even if the cs omits fly rud or fly ruds this does not justify the auditor from auditing the pc over out ruds the solo auditor can do one of two things he can fly all ruds or he can return the folder and request ruds be flown inability to fly ruds if an auditor cannot get rud to fn cannot get any rud to fn he is to end the session and send the folder to the cs this is an expected action it is understood the auditor would use suppress and false in trying to fly ruds sessions far apart when pc has not had session for some time or when pc gets sessions days apart ruds must be flown otherwise the pc will get audited over outruds this can develop mental mass optimum session scheduling is whole advanced course done in block of sessions close together this prevents the world from throwing the pcs ruds out between sessions giving sessions far apart barely keeps up with life the auditing time is absorbed in patching life up rapid gain gets above lifes annoyances and keeps the pc there407unreading items when an item the solo auditor has been told to run doesnt read on the meter even when the auditor puts in suppress and invalidate on it the auditor must not do anything with the item matter what the cs said it is expected he will see if it reads and use suppress and invalidate on it and if it still doesnt read he will be expected not to run it high ta when the auditor sees the ta is high on 2 cans out of normal range at session start yet the cs says to fly rud the auditor must not try to fly rud trying to bring ta down with arc brks or ruds is very hard on pc as arc breaks arent the reason tas go up seeing high ta at start the solo auditor does not start the session but sends the folder back to the cs things done twice by carelessness the same process can be called for twice and done twice or even more folder summary inside the front cover must exist and must be kept up never neglect entering session and what was run on the folder summary fs copys dont copy worksheets from notes keep all admin neat and in the original form copying makes errors possible ruds going out when the ruds go out during the session the solo auditor recognizes the following pc critical wh from auditor pc antagonistic bpc in session ta problem tired failed purpose or sleep sad arc break soaring ta overrun or protest dope off bypassed fn or not enough sleep408no interest out ruds or interest in the first place solo auditor who isnt sure what it is but runs into trouble with the pc is smart to end off the session quickly writs down the full observation and get it to the cs the solo auditor who is an old hand and knows what he is looking at as per above scale and the cs the cs would give handles it promptly pc critical wh pull the wh pc antagonistic bpc assess proper list such as l1c and handle ta or case gain problem locate the problem tired sleep or failed purpose check which it is and handle sad arc brk locate and handle itsa earlier itsa soaring ta or or protest find which and handle such an or is usually by rehab dope off lack of sleep or bp fn check on sleep or rehab fn interest interest in first place or out ruds check for interest or put in ruds ruds wont fly some other error send to cs the solo auditor has business trying to do the cs given when it collides with and isnt designed to handle any of the above false reports the vilest trick that can be played on his pc is for solo auditor to falsify an auditing report it may be thought to be good public relations good pr for the auditor with the cs actually it buries an error and puts the pc at risk integrity is hallmark of dianetics and scientology just because psychiatrists were dishonest is reason for auditors to be the results are there to be gotten false reports like false attests recoil and badly on both the auditor and pc what he did wrong solo auditor has right to know what he did wrong in the session that went wrong409most often sour session occurs only when the rules and data in this hcob have been violated but an auditors trs can go out or his handling of the process is in error not only does an auditor have the right to be told what was wrong but he must be given the exact hcob date and title that he violated never take verbal or written correction that is not in an hcob or tape dont be party to hidden data line that doesnt exist you ruined the pc is not valid statement you violated hcob______page is the charge auditor may be disciplined for asking may i please have the tape or hcob that was violated so i can read it or go to cramming if it isnt on tape book or an hcob it is not true and auditor has to accept any criticism that is not based on the actual source data if it isnt written it isnt true is the best defense and the best way to improve your tech these are the rights of the solo auditor with relation to cs they are all technical rights based on sound principles solo auditor should know them and use them if solo auditor stands on these rights and gets beaten down he should put all the facts before his nearest otl or so ship as something would be very wrong

must not self audit he ends the session he has done when he ends session on his worksheet he then goes to examiner and gets his exam the examiner sends the completed exam form to solo admin who puts

the moment you feel this cs is complete and are ready for new cs412when exam forms come in the solo d of p chases the pc up if solo exam form is bad the examiner must mark it urgent attn solo cs in

going on and he gets into another action when he should keep going 3a preot can rabbit run away from the bank by proposing cs that does not make him confront it 4and last but far from least cs by

summarizes all the data there is to be known about arc breaks ptps and missed withholds or handling rudiments there is wealth of technology and data on these subjects contained throughout the technical volumes and in scientology books which the student auditor will need as he progresses up the levels rudiment is that which is used to get the pc in shape to be audited in that session for auditing to take place at all the pc must be in session which means 1willing to talk to the auditor 2interested in own case that is all you want to accomplish with rudiments you want to set up the case to run by getting the rudiments in not use the rudiments to run the case arc breaks present time problems and withholds all keep session from occur ring it is elementary auditing knowledge that auditing over the top of an arc break can reduce graph hang the pc up in sessions or worsen his case and that in the presence of ptps overts and missed withholds restimulated undisclosed overt gains can occur thus these are the rudiments we are most concerned with getting in at the beginning of session so that auditing with gains can occur getting the fn if you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find an earlier item if something does not release if rud doesnt fn then there is an earlier or an earlier or an earlier lock which is preventing it from fning thus we have the procedure and the rule if rud reads you always take it earlier similar until it f ns417the question used is is there an earlier similar arc break or problem or missed withhold if at the beginning of session the rudiments are in the needle is floating and the pc is vgls the auditor goes directly into the major actions of the session if not the auditor must fly rud or ruds as ordered by the cs arc breaks arc word from the initial letters of affinity reality and communication which together equate to understanding arc break sudden drop or cutting of ones affinity reality or communication with someone or something upsets with people or things come about because of lessening or sundering of affinity reality communication or understanding while the earlier similar rule fully applies to arc breaks there is an additional action taken in handling arc breaks that enables the pc to spot precisely what happened that resulted in the upset an arc break is called thatan arc breakinstead of an upset because if one discovers which of the three points of understanding have been cut one can bring about rapid recovery in the persons state of mind you never audit over the top of an arc break and you never audit an arc break itself they cannot be audited but they can be assessed to locate which of the basic elements of arc the charge is on thus to handle an arc break you assess affinity reality communication and understanding to find which of these points the break occurred on having determined that you assess the item found or r or c or u against the expanded cdei scale curious desired enforced inhibited and refused ref hcob 13 oct 59 dei expanded scale scientology 08 the book of basics and hcob 18 sep 67 corrected 4474 scales with this assessment the actual bypassed charge can be located and indicated even more accurately thus enabling the pc to blow it the assessment is done on every arc break as you go earlier similar until the rudiment is in with fn and vgls the first rudiment question is 1do you have an arc break 2if there is an arc break get the data on it briefly 3find out by assessment which point the arc break occurred on was that break in affinity 418reality communication understanding you assess it once and get the read or the largest read on say communica tion 4check it with the pc was that break in communication if he says rehandle if yes let him tell you about it if he wishes then give it to him by indicating it ie id like to indicate that was break in communication provided the right item has been gotten the pc will brighten up even if ever so slightly on the very first assessment note on step 4 the pc may originate yes i guess it was communication but to its really more like break in reality for example the wise auditor then acknowledges and indicates it was break in reality 5taking the item found in step 4 above assess it against the cdei scale was it curious about communication desired enforced inhibited refused 6as in steps 3 and 4 above assess it once get the item and check it with the pc was it desired communication if rehandle if yes indicate it 7if fn at this point you follow it earlier with the question is there an earlier

special problem that exists in the physical universe419now on which the pc has his attention fixed any set of circumstances that so engages the attention of the preclear that he feels he should be doing something about it instead of being audited violation of in sessionness occurs when the pcs attention is fixed on some concern that is right now in the physical universe the pcs attention is over there not on his case if the auditor overlooks and doesnt handle the ptp then the pc is never in session grows agitated arc breaks and gains are made because he is not in session the second rudiment question is 1do you have present time problem 2if there is ptp have the pc tell you about it 3if fn take it earlier with the question is there an earlier similar problem 4get the earlier

omission or commission which does the least good for the least number of dynamics or the most harm to the greatest number of dynamics that thing which you do which you arent willing to have happen to you withhold an undisclosed harmful contrasurvival act something the pc did that he isnt talking about missed withhold an undisclosed contrasurvival act which has been restimulated by another but not disclosed this is withhold which another person nearly found out about leaving the person with the withhold in state of wondering whether his hidden deed is known or not the pc with missed withhold will not be honestly willing to talk to the auditor and therefore not in session until the missed withhold is pulled missing withhold or not getting all of it is the sole source of an arc break missed

have finally reduced clearing withholds to rote formula which contains all the basic elements necessary to obtain high case gain without missing any withholds these steps now become the way to clear withhold or missed withhold auditor objective the auditors object is to get the pc to look so that the pc can tell the auditor the auditors objective is not to get the pc to tell the auditor if the pc is in session the pc will talk to the auditor if the pc is not in session the pc wont tell the auditor withhold i never have any trouble getting the pc to tell withhold i sometimes have trouble getting the pc to find out about withhold so the pc can tell it to if the pc will not tell the auditor withhold and the pc knows it the remedy is rudiments i always assume and correctly that if the pc knows about it the pc will tell my job is to get the pc to find out so the pc has something to tell the chief auditor blunder in pulling withholds stems from the auditor assuming the pc already knows when the pc does not if used exactly this system will let the pc find out and let the pc get all the charge off of withhold as well as tell the auditor all about it missing withhold or not getting all of it is the sole source of arc break get reality on this now all trouble you have or have ever had or will ever have with arc breaky pcs stems only and wholly from having restimulated withhold and yet having failed to pull it the pc never forgives this this system steers you around the rock of missed withholds and their bombastic consequences withhold system this system has five parts 0the difficulty being handled 1what the withhold is 2when the withhold occurred4233all of the withhold 4who should have known about it numbers 2 3 and 4 are repeated over and over each time testing 1 until 1 longer reacts 2 3 and 4 clear 1 1 straightens out in part 0 0 is cleaned up by finding many 1s and 1 is straightened up by running 2 3 and 4 many times these steps are called 0 difficulty 1 what 2 when 3 all 4 who the auditor must memorize these as what when all and who the order is never varied the questions are asked one after the other none of them are repetitive questions use mark iv the whole operation is done on mark iv use other meter as other meters may read right electronically without reading mental reactions well enough do this whole system and all questions at sensitivity 16 the questions 0 the suitable question concerning the difficulty the pc is having meter reads 1what what are you withholding about the difficulty or as given in future issues meter reads pc answers with wh large or small 2when when did that occur or when did that happen or what was the time of that meter reads auditor can date in generality or precisely on meter generality is best at first precise dating on the meter is used later in this sequence on the same wh 3all is that all of that meter reads pc answers 4who who should have known about that or who didnt find out about that meter reads pc answers now test 1 with the same question that got read the first time the question for 1 is never varied on the same wh if needle still reads ask 2 again then 3 then 4 getting as much data as possible424on each then test 1 again 1 is only tested never worked over except by using 2 3 and 4 continue this rotation until i clears on needle and thus longer reacts on test treat every withhold you find or have found in this fashion always summary you are looking at preview of preparatory to clearing prepclearing for short abandon all further reference to security checking or sec checking the task of the auditor in prepclearing is to prepare pcs rudiments so that they cant go out during 3d criss cross the value of prepclearing in case gain is greater than any previous class i or class ii auditing we have just risen well above security checking in ease of auditing and in case gains you will shortly have the ten prepclearing lists which give you the 0 and 1 questions meanwhile treat every withhold you find in the above fashion for the sake of the preclear for your sake as an auditor and for the sake of the good name of scientology note to practice with this system take withhold

incorrect to get rud reading with or without suppress and then fail to follow it earlier and to continue to call it and take only reads is incorrect correct if rud reads you always follow it earlier

false you clean false _____________ there are two actions possible in flying ruds 1 the rud is not out if it didnt read you check suppress if it read but is in any way protested you clean false4262

get an fn to get rud answered and then check suppress and its read is mixing l and 2 above false has anyone said you had awhen you didnt have one is the answer to pro tested ruds _____________ any

read reads are small falls or falls or long falls or long fall blowdown of ta preclears case can be gotten into serious trouble by listing list that doesnt read or prepchecking an item that doesnt read or running an item or flow that doesnt read on list this is the sort of thing that happens the list is who or what would fly kites the cs has said to list this to bd f n item so the auditor does list it without checking the read at all the list can go on 99 pages with the pc protesting getting upset this is called dead horse list because it gave item the reason it didnt was that the list question itself didnt read one does an l4bra on the pc to correct the situation and gets unnecessary action on list that is getting item you dont extend you correctly use l4bra or any subsequent issue of it if you extend dead horse list you just make things worse use an l4bra and it will set it right this weird thing can also happen cs says to list who or what would kill buffaloes the auditor does gets bd fn item hunter the cs also says to list as second action who or what would feel tough the auditor fails to test the question for read and lists it had he tested it the list would not have read but the list comes up with an item mean hunter it has stirred up charge from the first question and the item mean hunter is wrong item as it is misworded variation of the first lists item now we have an unnecessary action and wrong item we do an l4bra and the pc is still upset as maybe only one or the other of the two errors read in dianetic list one is not doing listing action one is only trying to find somatic or sensation etc that will run the item must read well or it wont produce a428chain to run in actual fact the dn list q does usually read but one doesnt bother to test it but an item or flow that doesnt read will produce chain basic and the pc will jump around the track trying but just jamming up his bank _____________ the moral of this story is always test listing question before letting the pc list always mark the read it gave sf f lf lfbd on the worksheet always test an item for read before prepchecking and always check an item and flow before running recalls or engrams always mark the read an item gave sf f lf lfbd on the worksheet charge the whole subject of charge is based on this charge is the electrical impulse on the case that activates the meter charge shows not only that an area has something in it it also shows that the pc has possible reality on it pc can have broken leg yet it might not read on meter it would be charged but below the pcs reality so it wont read things that dont read wont run the case supervisor always counts on the auditor to test questions and items and flows for read before running them the auditor when question or item or flow doesnt read can and should always put in suppress and invalidate on this question item flow has anything been suppressed on this question item flow has anything been invalidated if either one read the question or item or flow will also read the case supervisor also counts on the auditor to use suppress and invalidate on question or item or flow if after this there is still read on the question or item or flow thats it dont use it dont list it go to the next action on the cs or end off lrhdzkardjk l ron hubbard copyright 1970 1978 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved429hubbard

whenever an auditor gets read on an item from ruds or prepared list l1b l3a l4b etc etc it must be carried to an fn to fail to do so is to leave the pc with bypassed charge when pc has had several reads on various lists which were none of them carried to fn it can occur that he will become upset or depressed without any other apparent reason as one has done the lists without fning each item one now has the mystery of what is wrong the error is reading items from ruds or prepared lists cleaned to read but not carried to fn this action amongst many such refinements is what makes flag auditing so smooth and indeed makes it flag auditing when an auditor first tries this he may well think it is impossible yet it is simplicity itself if you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find an earlier item if something does not release what has been found as read on prepared list would fn if it were the basic lock so if it doesnt fn then there is an earlier or an earlier or an earlier lock which is preventing it from fning so the rule never walk off from reading item on rudiment or prepared repair list before you carry it down earlier similar to an fn example arc brk reads pc says what it is auditor does arcu cdei if f n auditor asks for an earlier similar arc brk gets it arcu cdei etc until he gets an fn example ptp reads carry it earlier similar until ptp fns example l4b has an item been denied you reads answered fn is there an earlier similar denied item answered fn go on to next reading item on the list example gf assessed once through for reads the next cs must take every item430on it that read by 2wc or other process to an fn so there is much more general rule every item that reads must fn in dianetics you get the fn when you run secondaries or engrams to an erasure fn cog vgis in rudiments every out rud you get read on is run to fn on prepared list you take each read to an fn or to fn on an lx list you run each flow chain to an fn on gf you get by whatever process an fn on listing by the laws of listing and nulling your eventual item listed must fn so another rule every major and minor action must be carried to an fn there are exceptions any exception leaves bypassed charge on the pc also every fn is indicated at the conclusion of the action when cog is obtained you take too soon an fn first twitch you cut the cognition and leave bypassed charge withheld cognition _____________ i could take any folder and simply write out the ruds and prepared list reading items and then audit the pc and carry each one to fn and correct every list so disclosed and wind up with very shining cool calm pc so have reading items been left charged would be key question on case _____________ using lists or ruds on high or low tas that are not meant for high or low tas will get you reading items that wont fn so another rule never try to fly ruds or do l1b on high or low ta one can talk the ta down see hco b on talking the ta down431or one can assess l4b about the only prepared lists one can assess are the new hilo ta hco b 13 mar 71 and possibly gf40 once through for biggest read the biggest read will have blowdown on it and can possibly be brought to fn if this occurs then one also handles all other items that read _____________ the most frequent errors in all this are not taking read earlier similar but just checking it and leaving it as clean not using suppress and false on items and of course leaving pc thinking things are still charged by failing to indicate the fn indicating an fn before cog not going back through the folder to handle ruds and items that read but were called clean or were simply abandoned pc audited under tension of poor trs has hard time and does not fn sometimes inviting overrun the rules then to happy pcs

needle to set as necessary as the beginning of each demonstration of the can squeeze 4the coach gives the cans squeeze with an even pressure if there is read or very small one less than an inch at sensitivity 1 the student auditor moves the sensitivity knob to 5 and gets another can squeeze if still read or its smaller than an inch student moves sensitivity to 16 and gets another squeeze for purposes of the following demonstration you want to set the sensitivity so that you can obviously see movement of the needle on the can squeeze of about an inch so the sensitivity could be set lower than 5 or higher than 5 so long as you get fall of about an inch on the squeeze 5with the sensitivity setting determined in 4 above the coach will then squeeze the cans incorrectly each time in different way the coach shows the student what particular thing hes doing with his hands and then has the student observe what happens on the meter and the distance the needle falls on the dial when he does each version of an incorrect can squeeze as follows coach holds the cans with cups of palms and all fingers and both thumbs in complete contact with the cans as he squeezes the cans he lifts one finger off and then puts the finger back on after relaxing the squeeze this is an incorrect can squeeze b coach holds the cans as in this time he gives the cans very fast light squeeze this is an incorrect can squeeze c coach holds the cans as in squeezes them with gradual pressure and then when he releases the squeeze he relaxes his grip on the cans so it is much looser than before the can squeeze this is an incorrect can squeeze d coach holds the cans as in and this time gives hard fast squeeze this is an incorrect can squeeze coach holds the cans as in squeezes them firmly and only partially releases the squeeze this is an incorrect can squeeze f coach holds the cans as in but gives squeeze in 2 stages first little squeeze then suddenly harder one this is an incorrect can squeeze g coach holds the cans as in gives hard fast squeeze and holds the grip the student should notice that the needle swings way over to the right due to the sudden motion and that it returns only part of the way with the coach still maintaining the squeeze thus giving an incorrect measurement of the can squeeze student should see that the distance between the first needle position at set and the final needle position with the coach still maintaining the squeeze is the actual measurement of the can squeeze fall it is not the distance between the first needle position of set and the needle position at the far swing to the right hard fast can squeeze is an incorrect can squeeze441h coach holds the cans so they are not in contact with the cups of his palms and squeezes them this is an incorrect can squeeze i coach holds the cans with the thumbs going up the sides and sticking out over the top edge of the cans and squeezes them this is an incorrect can squeeze j coach holds the cans in fairly tight grip and squeezes the cans this is an incorrect can squeeze k coach holds the cans with the forefingers lifted slightly off and puts the forefingers on the cans during the squeeze this is an incorrect can squeeze the drill is continued until the student auditor gets the idea that an incorrect can squeeze gives inaccurate unreliable needle reactions section ii to give the student auditor proper idea as to what correct can squeeze is and to train him how to get correct can squeeze 1the following drill should be done first by the coach to demonstrate to the student auditor what correct can squeeze is the coach has the student auditor shake his hands until the fingers are loose and floppy b then the coach has the student auditor put his hands on the table palms up exerting control on his fingers the student auditors fingers will curl in toward the palm c now the coach simply places the cans in the student auditors hands at an angle across the palms the natural curl of the fingers is sufficient to hold the cans in place and the placement of the cans at an angle ensures that the maximum skin area is touching the cans the cups of the student auditors palms and all the fingers and both thumbs must be touching the cans ensure the thumbs go around the cans and not up the sides d now the coach has the student auditor gradually increase the pressure of his grip on the cans until light squeeze is achieved and then relax it this is correct can squeeze note ensure when the student auditor relaxes his grip that he does not take finger or thumb or his palms off the cans he should have about the same contact he had at the start as in c above 2having done the above the coach now has the student auditor do the drill as follows have the coach pick up the cans and keep his hands on the table so the student can see them throughout the can squeeze b check the coachs grip on the cans to ensure it is correct as in b and c above the student may have to try out different sizes of cans small medium or large depending on the size of the coachs hands to obtain the correct size can which he can hold comfortably without strain and that fits into the cup of his palm with442maximum skin contact c adjust the sensitivity booster knob to the lowest position da set the sensitivity knob at i on the sensitivity dial b adjust the needle to the set line on the needle dial c give the proper commands for getting can squeeze as follows squeeze the cans please thank you the student must ensure the coach gradually increases the pressure of his grip on the cans and relaxes it d note the distance the needle fell when the coach squeezed the cans now increase the sensitivity setting to 2 and repeat steps d b c and d above again noting the distance the needle fell when the coach squeezed the cans f repeat steps d b c and d for sensitivity setting at 3 then sensitivity setting 4 then 5 then 6 and on up until you have the needle hitting the pin on the can squeeze with the needle hitting the pin on the can squeeze you wouldnt be able to note the length of the needle fall flunks are given for not having the coach remove all rings or finger jewelry as they can cause the needle to give unusual reads for not checking that there is maximum skin contact on the cans for failing to see that the thumbs go around the can and not up the sides for failing to set the meter and needle up properly for failing to notice and handle sudden or hard or jerky or convulsive can squeeze instead of an even increase of pressure on the cans or sudden letting go of the cans for not making sure the coach doesnt take finger or thumb or palm off the cans when he releases the contact for failing to note accurately the distance the needle fell on the can squeeze and for giving the wrong commands lack of skill in earlier drills is corrected by pink sheet section iii to give the student auditor reality on setting the sensitivity for 13 of dial drop of the needle on the can squeeze the student auditor should know that setting the sensitivity for 13 of dial drop on the can squeeze is an integral part of setting up each and every session he does it is the sensitivity he will be using during the session it is vitally important he gets the correct sensitivity setting for each preclear at each session so that he will not miss reads or fns sensitivity setting which is too low or too high for that particular preclear in the particular session will obscure reads and fns thus upsetting the preclears case therefore the student auditor must be proficient on this drill 1a have the coach pick up the cans and keep his hands on the table so the student can see them throughout the can squeeze b check the coachs grip to ensure it is correct also ensuring you have the correct can size443c adjust the sensitivity booster knob to the lowest position da set the sensitivity knob at 5 on the sensitivity dial b adjust the needle to set line on the dial c get the coach to squeeze the cans ensuring he does it properly d note the distance the needle fell when the coach squeezed the cans eon step d d the needle will have fallen distance of either less than 13 of dial drop or b more than 13 of dial drop if its raise the sensitivity bit and repeat steps d b c and d and continue to do this until you have 13 dial drop if its b lower the sensitivity bit and repeat steps d b c and d and continue to do this until you have 13 dial drop in other words keep adjusting your sensitivity lower or higher according to whether the drop is more or less than 13 of dial drop until you get the correct sensitivity setting each time new can squeeze is asked for the student auditor is to make sure the coach is holding the cans properly and is giving correct can squeeze f the student then notes the exact sensitivity setting at which he got the 13 dial drop flunks are given for errors as in section ii above and for failing to recognize when 13 dial drop of the needle on the can squeeze has been obtained for failing to recognize if the coach is giving considerably harder or lighter can squeeze than he was giving at sensitivity 5 and for failing to establish the correct sensitivity setting for 13 of dial drop on the coach 2now the coach has the student auditor do the drill on number of other students with the coach watching until he is satisfied that the student can easily and accurately establish the correct sensitivity setting for 13 dial drop can squeeze section iv to give the student auditor reality on how correct sensitivity setting for 13 of dial drop on the can squeeze gives readable and workable meter and how an incorrect sensitivity setting gives an unreadable and unworkable meter so the student will understand why he has to use sensitivity setting that gives 13 of dial drop 1coach has the student auditor set the sensitivity accurately on correct can squeeze for 13 dial drop as in section iii 2the student auditor does pinch test as follows student pinches the coachs arm hard enough to hurt little bit 3now while watching the meter the student says to the coach444recall that pinch i just gave you thank you 4student notes the reaction of the needle to his command and the distance the needle fell 5coach has the student do steps 2 3 and 4 several times each time noting what the needle does in response to recall that pinch 6coach now has the student set the sensitivity at 1 student has coach squeeze the cans and notes whether theres read or not if there is read note size of read and leave the sensitivity at 1 if theres read on the squeeze the student still leaves the sensitivity at 1 7the student auditor does new pinch test as in 2 3 4 and 5 above noting the difference in needle response to the command recall that pinch as compared to what it was in step 5 at the correct sensitivity setting there may be read at all and the student should notice that 8coach now has student set the sensitivity at 32 and coach squeezes the cans 9student does the pinch test again and notes the reaction of the needle to his command recall that pinch 10coach has the student then set the sensitivity correctly for 13 of dial drop on correct can squeeze and does the pinch test again 11the student should observe from these pinch tests that an accurate sensitivity setting determined from correct can squeeze gives readable and workable meter and that an incorrect sensitivity setting gives an unreadable and unworkable meter if he does not see this clearly then the coach would have the student redo steps 7 through 10 until the student sees why the sensitivity must be set for 13 of dial drop determined by correct can squeeze flunks are given for failing to note what the needle did and size of read in response to student telling coach to recall the pinch and for errors in setting sensitivity accurately and getting correct can squeeze when called for in the drill history developed as training drill by l ron hubbard at saint hill in

auditors to assess the pc on the meter to find the cause of false ta instead of checking directly with the pc this bulletin reinstates the false ta checklist with specific handlings that are directly from the issues that i wrote on false ta the following are the items to be checked by an auditor on any pc it need only be done once unless the check itself is suspected false or if conditions of the pcs hands etc change the checklist is kept in the pc folder and is entered on the folder summary as an action done the value of operating with correct can size should not be underestimated the reference hcobs state why the auditor signs and answers the following points on the checklist the auditor must obtain information by checking the pcs hands himself or herself to see if the hands are dry or wet the cause of false ta is in the physical universe and that is where the check is done it is not done by asking the pc or checking the questions on the pc for meter reads so the auditor would feel the hands of the pc to establish if they are dry or wet would feel the pcs hands with cream on them to see if the cream has dried up would see if the pcs hands cup so as to form an area that does not touch the cans and so forth false ta is not think or mental mass it is in the physical universe and that is where it has to be handled for it to be remedied the handling follows each line as you check it this is for simplicity as that is the way this checklist is done each line being handled as you go rfactor to pc i am going to check the cans your hands and various other things

particularly on some pcs until the cans warm up the reading is generally false and is false in the direction of high some pcs are cool blooded and the shock of icecold cans can drive the ta up and it takes while to drift down practice which gets around this is for the auditor or examiner to hold the cans briefly until they are warm and then give them to the pc variation is for the auditor or

false ta you cs for and get run repair and rehab of this error emeter cans can monitor or change ta position when the palms are too dry or too wet or when the cans are too big or too small or when the wrong hand cream is used the emeter does not read on hand moisture alone as was long believed by people in electronics but ta depends upon resistance to electrical current in the palms leads and meter as well as its main resistance which happens to be mental masses or lack of them to simply tell some intern always disregard an fn not in correct range is to set him up for loses and set the pc up for crashes the correct information is that an fn which isnt in range is accompanied by pc indicators that indicate whether it is an fn or not and indicates you better get the false ta handled fast as soon as it wont interrupt the current cycle and you always note where it fned so the cs can cs for false ta handling where an arc break needle which looks like an fn is observed whether it is in range

of the chain he is running the ep of dianetic chain is always always always the postulate coming off the postulate is what holds the chain in its place release the postulate and the chain blows thats it the auditor must recognize the postulate when the pc gives it note the vgis call the fn and end off auditing that chain an fn seen as the incident is erasing is not called the pc does not have to state that the incident has erased once he has given up the postulate the erasure has occurred the auditor will see an fn and vgls now the fn is called fns are not indicated until the ep of postulate

earlier belief that in order to be valid the tone arm had to be between 20 and 30 for it to be called floating needle carefully examining dozens of fns which occurred with the ta well above 30 and looking for any troubles with the case following calling the fn an fn i found that there were adverse consequences therefore it can be safely assumed that floating needle is floating needle regardless of where the tone arm position may be it should be called indicated and written as an fn with the ta noted palm moisture pc grip and other factors alter the ta position but not the fn the auditor must also be prepared to handle and handle false ta and nothing in this finding changes handling tone arm positions register the relative mass of the case and nothing in this finding changes that there are low ta cases and high ta cases and the state of the ta remains important and all data regarding ta positions are valid an arc break needle an fn accompanied by bad indicators remains an arc break needle and nothing in this finding changes that it must be handled one ordinarily checks for an arc break in this case this finding about ta position and fns has been corrected earlier this present issue carries it further based on very thorough recent testing there are apparently liabilities of any kind in calling high and low ta fns fns l ron hubbard founder lrhncgm copyright 1980 by l ron

now and then you will get protest from preclears about floating needles the preclear feels there is more to be done yet the auditor says your needle is floating this is sometimes so bad that in scientology reviews one has to prepcheck the subject of floating needles lot of bypassed charge can be stirred up which arc breaks upsets the preclear the reason this subject of floating needles gets into trouble is that the auditor has not understood subject called end phenomena end phenomena is defined as those indicators in the pc and meter which show that chain or process is ended it shows in dianetics that basic on that chain and flow has been erased and in scientology that the pc has been released on that process being run new flow or new process can be embarked upon of course when the end phenomena of the previous process is attained dianetics floating needles are only one fourth of the end phenomena in all dianetic auditing any dianetic auditing below power has four definite reactions in the pc which show the process is ended lfloating needle 2cognition 3very good indicators pc happy 4erasure of the final picture audited auditors get panicky about overrun if you go past the end phenomena the fn will pack up cease and the ta will rise but thats if you go past all four parts of the end phenomena not past floating needle466if you watch needle with care and say nothing but your r3r commands as it begins to float you will find 1it starts to float narrowly 2the pc cognites what do you knowso thats and the float widens 3very good indicators come in and the float gets almost full dial and 4the picture if you inquired has erased and the needle goes full dial that is the full end phenomena of dianetics if the auditor sees float start as in i and says i would like to indicate to you your needle is floating he can upset the pcs bank there is still charge the pc has not been permitted to cognite vgis surely wont appear and piece of the picture is left by being impetuous and fearful of overrun or just being in hurry the auditors premature too soon indication to the pc suppresses three quarters of the pcs end phenomena scientology all this also applies to scientology auditing and all scientology processes below power have the same end phenomena the 0 to iv scientology end phenomena are floating needle b cognition c very good indicators d release the pc goes through these four steps without fail if permitted to do so as scientology auditing is more delicate than dianetic auditing an overrun fn vanished and ta rising requiring rehab can occur more rapidly thus the auditor has to be more alert but this is excuse to chop off three of the steps of end phenomena the same cycle of fn will occur if the pc is given chance on you get beginning fn on b slightly wider on c wider still and on d the needle really is floating and widely i would like to indicate to you your needle is floating can be chop also its false report if it isnt widely floating and will keep floating pcs who leave session fn and arrive at examiner without fn or who eventually do not come to session with an fn have been misaudited the least visible way is the f n chop as described in this session the most obvious way is to overrun the process running pc after he has exteriorized will also give high ta at examiner in dianetics one more pass through is often required to get 1 2 3 4 end phenomena above i know it said in the auditors code not to bypass an fn perhaps it should be467changed to read real wide fn here its question of how wide is an fn however the problem is not difficult i follow this rulel never jolt or interrupt pc who is still looking inward in other words i dont ever yank his attention over to the auditor after all its his case we are handling not my actions as an auditor when i see an fn begin i listen for the pcs cognition if it isnt there i give the next command due if it still isnt there i give the 2nd command etc then i get the cognition and shut up the needle floats more widely vgls come in the fn goes dial wide the real skill is involved in knowing when to say nothing more then with the pc all bright all end phenomena in sight fn cog vgls erasure or release depending on whether its dn or scn i say as though agreeing with the pc your needle is floating dianetic oddity did you know that you could go through picture half dozen times the fn getting wider and wider without the pc cogniting this is rare but it can happen once in hundred the picture hasnt been erased yet bits of it seem to keep popping in then it erases fully and wow 2 3 and 4 occur this isnt grinding its waiting for the fn to broaden to cognition the pc who complains about fns is really stating the wrong problem the actual problem was the auditor distracting the pc from cognition by calling attention to himself and the meter moment too soon the pc who is still looking inward gets upset when his attention is jerked outward charge is then left in the area pc who has been denied his full end phenomena too often will begin to refuse auditing despite all this one still must not overrun and get the ta up but in dianetics an erasure leaves nothing to get the ta up with the scientology auditor has harder problem with this as he can overrun more easily there is chance of pulling the bank back in so the problem is more applicable to scientology as problem than to dianetics but all auditors must realize that the end phenomena of successful auditing is not just an fn but has 3 more requisites and an auditor can chop these off the

surge usually fairly long over 1 can read if the pc says it to himself as an answer to question asked read therefore does not mean invariably yes or that the question is charged all it means is that the meter has read the auditor must now find out what the read was before determining he should do something about that portion of the green form or list one doesnt just assume the read was yes one asks about the read as general rule not assuming at once the thing asked was charged example auditor do you have missed withhold meter surges auditor what was that pre i thought i dont auditor ok do

length when they surge it is not important how you handle this phenomena of postulate or to oneselfcomment by high level case it is important that the auditor does not hang the case with wrong adjudication of whats wrong by thinking every surge means yes or that the question is charged because it surges question is charged only if it wont clean up with buttons until the action itself is taken pre unlike pcs below grades i or ii usually recognizes what is wrong as soon as it is mentioned he or she is more aware 2 response like brief dirty needle on pre means always so there is certain

special briefing course here are some observations i have made on the coaching of emeter drills which i feel could be of use 1the coachs needle is dirty the students out comm cycle has cut his comm in some way but prior to that the coach failed to flunk the part of the comm cycle that went out correct flunking by coaches equals students with dirty needles 2if coachs ta starts climbing on drill and the needle gets sticky it means that the students comm cycle has dispersed him and pushed him out of pt the coach is either i not flunking at all 2 flunking the incorrect thing 3the correct flunking by the coach of an out comm cycle which has dispersed him and pushed his ta up will always result in ta blow down if there is blow down the coach has flunked the wrong thing 4needle not responding well and sensitively on assessment drills although the needle clean coach has failed to flunk tr 1 or tr0 for lack of impingement and reach 5coach reaching forward and leaning on the table means tr i is out with the student 6student asking coach for considerations to get ta down but ta climbing on the considerationsthe coach is cleaning clean instead of flunking the out comm cycle which occurred earlier and pushed his ta up 7student getting coachs considerations off to clean the needle but needle remaining dirtystudent is cutting the coachs comm while getting the considerations off and the coach is not picking this up 8students shouting or talking very loudly on assessment drills to try and get the meter to read by overwhelm the reason for this is invariablybut im assessing the bank

emeter instant reads an instant read is defined as that reaction of the needle which occurs at the precise end of any major thought voiced by the auditor the reaction of the needle may be any reaction except nul an instant read may be any change of characteristic providing it occurs instantly the absence of read at the end of the major thought shows it to be nul all prior reads and latent reads are ignored these are the result of minor thoughts which may or may not be restimulated by the question only the instant read is used by the auditor only the instant read is cleared on rudiments what questions etc the instant read may consist of any needle reaction rise fall speeded rise speeded fall double tick dirty needle theta bop or any other action so long as it occurs at the exact end of the major thought being expressed by the auditor if reaction occurs at exactly that place the end of the major thought the question is nul by major thought is meant the complete thought being expressed in words by the auditor reads which occur prior to the completion of the major thought are prior reads reads which occur later than its completion are latent reads by minor thought is meant subsidiary thoughts expressed by words within the major thought they are caused by the reactivity of individual words within the full words they are ignored example have you ever injured dirty pigs to the pc the words you injured and dirty are all reactive therefore the minor thoughts expressed by these words also read on the meter the major thought here is the whole sentence within this thought are the minor thoughts you injured and dirty therefore the emeter needle may respond this way have you fall ever injured speeded fall dirty fall pigs fall only the major thought gives the instant read and only the last fall underscored in the sentence above indicates anything if that last reaction was absent the whole sentence471is nul despite the prior falls you can release the reactions but ordinarily would not on each of these minor thoughts exploring these prior reads is called compartmenting the question paying attention to minor thought reads gives us laughable situations as in the case written in 1960 of getting pdhed by the cat by accepting these prior reads one can prove anything why because pain and drug and hypnosis are minor thoughts within the major thought have you ever been pdhed by cat the inexpert auditor would believe such silly thing had happened but notice that if each minor thought is cleaned out of the major thought it longer reacts as whole fact if the person on the meter had been pdhed by cat then only the discovery of the origin of the whole thought would clean up the whole thought pcs also think about other things while being asked questions and these random personal restimulations also read before and after an instant read and are ignored very rarely pcs thinks react exactly at the end of major thought and so confuse the issue but this is rare we want the read that occurs instantly after the last syllable of the major thought without lag that is the only read we regard in finding rudiment in or out to find if goal reacts etc that is what is called an instant read there is package rudiment question in the half truth etc we are doing four rudiments in one and therefore have four major thoughts in one sentence this packaging is the only apparent exception but is actually exception its just fast way of doing four rudiments in one sentence clumsy question which puts in this session at the end of the major thought can serve the auditor badly such modifiers should come before the sentence in this session have you you are giving the major thought directly to the reactive mind therefore any analytical thought will not react instantly the reactive mind is composed of 1 timelessness 2 unknownness 3 survival the meter reacts on the reactive mind never on the analytical mind the meter reacts instantly on any thought restimulated in the reactive mind if the meter reacts on anything that datum is partly or wholly unknown to the preclear an auditors questions restimulate the reactive mind this reacts on the meter472only reactive thoughts react instantly you can groove in major thought by saying it twice on the second time or third time if it is longer you will see only the instant read at the exact end if you do this the prior reads drop out leaving only the whole thought if you go stumbling around in rudiments or goals trying to clean up the minor thoughts you will get lost in sec checking you can uncover material by compartmenting the question but this is rarely done today in rudiments what questions et you want the instant read only it occurs exactly at the end of the whole thought this is your whole interest in cleaning rudiment or what question you ignore all prior and latent reactions of the needle the exceptions to this rule are 1 compartmenting the question in which you use the prior reads occurring at the exact end of the minor thoughts as above in the pigs sentence to dig up different data not related to the whole thought 2 steering the pc is the only use of latent or random reads you see read the same as the instant read occurring again when you are not speaking but after you have found whole thought reacting you say there or that and the pc seeing what he or she is looking at as you say it recovers the knowledge from the reactive bank and gives the data and the whole thought clears or has to be further worked and cleared you can easily figurefigure yourself half to death trying to grapple with meter reads unless you get good reality on the instant read which occurs at the end of the whole expressed thought and neglect all prior and latent reads except for steering the pc while he gropes for the answer to the question you asked thats the whole of reading an emeter needle two saint hill lectures of 24 may 1962 cover this in full l ron hubbard

style remimeo tech qual emeter watching are you waiting for the meter to play dixie i have been bit surprised by the length of time it is taking people to do assessments on the prehav on security checks and goals query into this which may reveal more has discovered that students wait patiently for the meter to react which mary sue has noticed it dawns on that auditors believe they are doing an analytical assessment on the prehav etc this is wrong the prehav scale is not picture of analytical thought it is in the order it is in because it is picture of reactive thought it is how the reactive mind is stacked up see dianetics the modern science of mental health for the chapter on the reactive mind now an emeter reacts only on the reactive mind clear doesnt react because he is able to be conscious an aberree reacts because he cant think without thought exciting the reactivity of the reactive mind this being composed of mass energy space time and thought responds to tiny electrical impulses if your auditing was not aimed at reactivity it would not register on meter thus you run what reacts because it reacts and is therefore part of the reactive mind the reactive mind responds instantly on data billion years ago how is this time in the reactive mind is out of order so is space so is matter so is energy pin sign on the reactive mind out of order it connects wrong connections hence the emeter what is wrong with the pc is not known to the pc therefore if pc knows all about it it isnt wrong with him thats why you never run what the pc says you run only what the meter says example pc is sure his current general prehav level that should be run now is order or command order rapidly vanishes command follows suit conquer stays in this is an actual example i just assessed it few minutes ago on pc who is in pretty good shape he didnt like conquer he said order and command were long track somebody running q and on his assessment would have said perhaps the pc knows best so well run order even if it doesnt fall but when i said it was conquer that we were going to run as only it now fell the pc sighed and gave in finding the conquer474level questions produced very responsive meter needle it was wrong with the pc because he didnt know about it it was part of his reactive mind order and command were analytical responses prompted by an entirely different thing conquer if order or command had been run the pc would have had lot of auditing time wasted on him now why are assessments wrong sometimes because the auditor is persuaded by the pc not the meter if the pc and the meter agree so what you can still run it but only if the meter says so for only then is it reactive now what about slow assessments well the auditor thinks the pc must consider things before he answers waits for the pc to answer and waits for the question to sink in so the meter will react this is entirely wrong based on misunderstanding of assessment the meter and the reactive mind 1the pc does not have to be given chance to think before the needle responds 2the pc does not have to answer or say one word to make the needle respond 3all needle response is reactive 4there is time in the reactive mind 5if the pc knew what was wrong with him it wouldnt be wrong 6only the meter knows 7the auditor has more control over the pcs reactive mind than the pc since the pc is influenced by the reactive mind responses and the auditor is not so influenced the meter responds instantly the reaction you will get on the needle starts to occur on the needle instantly after you utter it there is need to sit there afterwards waiting for the needle to respond again for it wont until you push that button again the only wait is caused by letting the needle come back at the end of fall this may take one second therefore to wait more than one second before uttering the next word on the list is complete waste of auditing time all the response you want will begin to occur instantly after you utter goal terminal level or security question thus the maximum time between questions on the prehav level is at most threesecond interval of silence while you digest the data further on an assessment for prehav run on the general scale as in routine 2 hcob 5 june 1961 you do not now say do you or any other dunnage you just475say the level itself note response put pencil point down on the level if it responds say the next word etc etc takes about 5 minutes to run the primary scale up and down to find its level you start at the bottom you just say the word if it responds you dot the sheet using different symbols to tell them apart like dots xs lines then go back down the scale touching only those you marked going up add another dot if they still fall or react then play off those left one against the other saying level only once each time the remaining level is now the only one that reacts so you assemble your 5way bracket and carry on with auditing the pc doesnt have to say word throughout the whole assessment you can even ask him politely not to as breath going in and out in speech can vibrate the needle when you assess over into the secondary scale of the level you found you do exactly the same as above you read them all off once then only those that reacted eliminate them and youve got it and by the way if you go over the secondary scale you then dont only run levels on that secondary forever in each new assessment you use the primary scale again to find new secondary level to assess this is also true of joburg if youre going to get reaction on the needle it will come fast waiting if you get reaction you clear that reaction not the pcs whole life the moment the needle is null you go on to the next question of course in joburg the pc talks he better all auditing actions except the cchs are now done in model session and all auditing actions and questions are done effectively neither frantically rushed nor slowly so it boils down to this weeks can be added to joburgs and assessments if you think you have to wait for needle response what are you waiting for the whole action only requires second dont wait for the emeter to play

and marking down the reads that occur on the meter the pc is not required to comment during this action and it is better if he does not this action is called assessment for longest read it is used mainly in dianetics there are two scientology assessments which are differently done these are assessment by elimination and listing and nulling they are not used in dianetics one does not mix the three types in dianetic assessment by longest read one uses these symbols x didnt read tick small jerk of needle sf small fall quarter to half an inch f fall about one to 2 inches lf long fall 2 to 3 inches lfbd long fall followed by blow down or ta motion downward all falls are to the right bd is tone arm motion to the left made to keep the needle on the dial the favored action for an item is an lfbd and if one item on the list does so that is it without any further assessment the reason one assesses is that if an item does not read on the meter when assessed it is beyond the pcs level of awareness it is very unwise and unsafe to try to run somatic which has not read on the list it will be beyond the pcs reality and beyond his awareness and will result in overwhelm ing him that an item reads guarantees that the pc will be able to confront and erase the chain so that an item reads well is guarantee that the pc can handle it and will not get in too deep for him the exception to this is protest read an item possibly already run is seen to read the pc frowns he is protesting and the meter is registering protest not the item one478never runs pc against his protest to do so will overwhelm him and give bad result protest almost never blows down the ta to be sure that the item is right one usually asks the pc if he is interested in the item chosen if the pc says he doesnt want to run it this is protest read one then picks the second best reading item on the assessment already done and checks that with the pc for interest the pc will usually be interested in it the pc can almost always be counted on to be interested in any item that gives lfbd one never simply asks the pc which on the list he is interested in as an assessment as it will be found the pc simply chooses at random and may choose null item the result may be very unsuccessful session an auditor may sometimes be astonished by what reads the pc let us say obviously has broken leg but what reads is an earache one runs what reads not what the auditor knows should be run know best in an auditor can be fatal fault on second or third assessment items which were at first null or reading poorly will be found to come alive and read well the pc by being audited has had an increase of ability to confront and if the auditing is standard an increase in confidence the result is that items beyond his reach previously and did not read well are now available and can be run easily the emeter measures the awareness depth of the pc on things which do not read on assessment you would find his reality poor things that read well on assessment will be found to be things on which pc has high reality and high interest level only if pushed to audit without meter could an auditor assess by interest only there is real excuse for it if one has an emeter auditing without meter is chancy activity good assessment by longest read is the best entrance to successful session the same list will serve for the next

at the end remedy for this is to record ordinary conversation ask some normal questions and make some normal statements and you will find that the voice tone rises on question and goes down on statement assessing with statements tone of voice instead of questioning tone of voice results in evaluation for the pc the pc feels accused or evaluated for rather than assessed and an auditor can

literature solo cans i have worked out more ideal solo electrodes for the emetercans the basic trouble with singlehand electrode is that it gives falsely higher ta which can be very alarming the tone arm range on the meter should be between 20 and 30 for floating needle to be valid this is when two regulation electrodes steel soup cans are employed when you use only one electrode holding it in the left hand if you are righthanded the ta can read as high as 40 when it is actually 30 also ta at 17 can read as 25 singlehand electrodes are almost as old as the modern meter an aluminum tea ball with an insulator between the screw threads served in the earliest models an electrode leading to each half two stainless steel pipe sections about an inch in diameter separated in the middle by rubber ring with an electrode to each end was singlehand electrode version which came down to modern times there were further developments of any lasting value on this problem of single hand electrodes until few months ago the problem in solo auditing is of course that if you held electrodes in both hands you couldnt write or work the meter at the same time but singlehand electrode gives the wrong ta even if it does give the right needle reads which it does to get the right ta then one must unplug the singlehand electrode and plug in the twohand electrode in this operation the ta can change and the wires get tangled this commotion is of course distracting what i worked out was twocan electrode that became singlehand electrode at once you take 2 small juice or vegetable steel cans with their tops neatly removed they must be the paper label not the painted kind of course the size required is 2 18 inches diameter at the rim that is about 54 millimeters the length is 3 34 inches which is about 95 millimeters481you then take piece of soft sponge or foam rubber about 38 inches thick about 10 mm you cut circular piece of sponge rubber about 2 38 inches about 60 mm it is just slightly larger than the can diameter you glue this sponge or foam rubber circle to the closed end of one can but not to the other snap the electrode wires into the open ends of the cans you now have to all requirements twocan electrode setup with the difference that one cans base has rubber pad on it holding these one in each hand gives you the 2can more correct ta read by putting the closed base of one can against the rubber pad on the other can taking them in one hand two fingers on each can as you hold them you have singlehand electrode in an instant you can take them in two hands and get the correct ta adjusting the tone arm with knuckle or finger tip taking them back in one hand and resetting the ta you again have your singlehand read in using this system you should change your notation to an indication of whether it is onehand or twocan read to save your case supervisor from heart failure the new notation is as follows 375 1 29 2 it doesnt mean you always use both reads you add the brackets and 2 or 1 to show whether its double or single 2 or 1 read at session start and at end you always give both ie 35 1 25 2 and at the end you give trim check like 19 20 done by unplugging the electrodes from the meter for an instant and putting the needle at set and reading what the ta is it should be 20 but often has drifted to 19 or 21 that verifies all reads standard electrodes standard can is about 234 inches 69 mm diameter by about 412 or 5 inches 114 mm or 127 mm long steel soup or vegetable cans unpainted tops cleanly removed label and glue washed off tin plated or not have been standard for many years it is with these that calibration has been done it is amusing that i had to work hard on electrodes to get the first meters to work at all everything got tried steel rods aluminum aluminum tea balls metal pads metal straps you name it the only one that works consistently is the good old common kitchen variety soup can its amusing to see efforts to improve our electrodes other versions have all been tried and failed and every few years we have to have soup can revival campaign to get people back to standard reads the smaller juice can as described for the singlehand electrode does not give the exact read as the standard cans when used as twocan electrode so the smaller can shouldnt be used by examiners you can check the difference if you like between these two can sizes482but the standard cans are too big as onehand to be held comfortably in most peoples left hand the difference is not great enough to worry anyone in normal auditing small hands people with small hands or children cant cope at all with standard can the size given for the singlehand 2 18 x 334 is more suitable for them for very little children two kodak 35 mm unpainted cassette cans from any photo shop will serve admirably these two 35 mm cassettes fixed with rubber pad on the bottom of one as described for the singlehand electrode above will serve child as onehand electrode shorting the whole trick in preparing two separate cans to be held as singlehand is to make sure that when you put the bottoms together they dont short they can cause rock slam or sudden fall if the metal of the cans touch thus the gluedon rubber pad must be bit bigger than the can diameter and thick enough so it doesnt press through old setups were bolted together and couldnt be separated easily for twocan reads these two cans are loose from each other important note the smaller cans can give falsely low ta read being small if you get such read have two large standard cans handy to snap onto the leads and check will save heart failure at seeing 17 for twocan read l ron hubbard founder lrh sb rd copyright 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved483 484hubbard

items note observation i have recently done while handling cs line has resulted in necessary clarification of the subject of reading item or question which improves older definitions and saves some cases it can occasionally happen that an auditor misses read on an item or question and does not run it as it has not read this can hang up pc badly if the item was in fact reading item or question it does not get handled and exists in records as read when in fact it did read therefore all dlanetlc auditors whose items occasionally dont read and all scientology auditors who get list questions that dont read must be checked out on this hco b in qual or by the cs or supervisor these errors come under the heading of gross auditing errors as they affect metering 1an item or question is said to read when the needle falls not when it stops or slows on rise tick is always noted and in some cases becomes wide read 2the read is taken when the pc first says it or when the question is cleared this is the valid time of read it is duly marked plus any blow down this reading defines what is reading item or question calling it back to see if it read is not valid test as the surface charge may be gone but the item or question will still run or list 3regardless of any earlier statements or material on reading items an item does not have to read when the auditor calls it to be valid item for running engrams or listing the test is did it read when the pc first said it on originating it or in clearing it 4that an item or question is marked as having read is sufficient reason to run it or use it or list it pc interest in dianetics is also necessary to run it but that it did not read again is reason to not use it 5when listing items the auditor must have an eye on the meter not necessarily the pc and must note on the list he is making the extent of read and any bd and how much this is enough to make it reading item or reading question 6in clearing listing question the auditor watches the meter not necessarily the pc and notes any read while clearing the question 7an additional calling of the item or question to see if it read is unnecessary and not valid action if the item or question read on origination or clearing 8that an item is marked as having read on an earlier dianetic list is enough also checking interest to run it with further read test4859to miss seeing read on an origin or clearing is gross auditing error 10failing to mark on the list or worksheet the read and any bd seen during pc origination or clearing the question is gross auditing error eyesight auditors who miss reads or have poor eyesight should be tested and should wear the proper glasses while auditing glasses the rims of some glasses could obstruct seeing the meter while the auditor is looking at the worksheet or pc if this is the case the glasses should be changed to another type with broader vision wide vision good auditor is expected to see his meter pc and worksheet all at one time matter what he is doing he should always notice any meter movement if the meter needle moves if he cannot do this he should use an azimuth meter and not put paper over its glass but should do his worksheet looking through the glass at his pen and the paperthe original design purpose of the azimuth meter then even while writing he sees the meter needle move as it is in his line of vision any and all as to what is reading item or reading question should be fully cleaned up on any auditor as such omissions or can be responsible for case hang ups and needless repairs read any comment that an item or question did not read should be at once suspected by c s and checked with this hco b on the auditor actually nonreads nonreading item or question means one that did not read when originated or cleared and also did not read when called one can still call an item or question to get read that it now reads is fine but if it has never read at all the item will not run and such list will produce item on it it is not forbidden to call an item or question to test it for read but it is useless action if the item or question read on origination by the pc or clearing it with him important the data in this hco b if not known can cost case failures thus it must be checked out on auditors lrh ntrd l ron hubbard copyright 1971 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved486hubbard communications office saint hill manor east sussex hco bulletin of 29 april 1980 remimeo prepared lists their value and purpose matter how complicated or confusing the environment is getting if you have stable datum of exact action it can see you through the prepared list provides the auditor with stable action when session or ease is confusing and can bring things under control the idea of such lists and their development are original to dianetics and scientology they are made possible because these subjects embrace the full extent of thought the spirit and actual and potential aberration thousands of hours of research and development have gone into these lists thousands of case histories have been reviewed and condensed to make the lists possible they are in themselves considerable tour force they have often meant the difference between stalled case and spectacular result just as they are important knowledge of them and skill in their use is vital to auditing success history probably the oldest prepared list is the white form now called the original assessment sheet hcob 24 jun 78r this provided series of questions which would give one the background of the preclear it dates from 1950 by it one can get the probable this life areas of the preclears heaviest charge self analysis was written in 1951 it contains processing lists preclear could run on himself group auditing materials of the middle 50s contained lists of commands which were run on groups done on meter it provides case entrance the joburg of 1961 is probably the next historical point it was list of the possible withholds preclear might have it was called the joburg because it was developed in johannesburg south africa the l1 was probably next the original gave list of session rudiments which might have gone out and enabled the auditor to get the session rudiments back in it is still in use as l1c or list one c the green form was developed in the early 60s so that qual review at saint hill would have tool to analyze case correction lists for various auditing actions began to appear these corrected an action in progress that had gone awry in 1973 the famous cs 53 meaning case supervisor series 53 was devised and continued to be improved and reissued today there are dozens of prepared lists there is even prepared list to repair repaired lists in general487theory of prepared lists prepared list is an assembly of the majority of things which can be wrong in case an auditing action or session such lists are quite remarkable actually only thorough knowledge of aberration makes such list possible when you look over the extent of prepared lists you will see that they contain grasp of the subject of aberration never before available use while an auditor is expected to have studied and mastered all this theory it is bit much to expect that in the confusion of case or session gone wrong he will be able to spot instantly without help exactly what has gone wrong prepared lists where they exist and his emeter will sort this out for him all the auditor has to have is general insight that something is going wrong know in general what is being handled in the case knows what list to use and then with good trs and metering do an assessment of the prepared list usually the trouble will come right since the exact point will have been located it is sometimes enough to merely indicate the point found to discharge it somewhat one can fn what is found or one can go into very wide extensive handling the point is the use of the prepared list has spotted the trouble what is demanded of the auditor or cs is which prepared list to use but this is determined by what has been going on types of prepared lists there are four general types of prepared lists these are an analysis list this is type of prepared list which analyzes case broadly or analyzes session the purpose of it is to find out what to address in the case in order to program it the white form the green form and the cs 53 can all be used for this purpose there are other such lists and there is even prepared list to debug production b direct auditing list prepared lists exist which deliver direct auditing commands or questions which run on the pc produce an auditing result the lists or self analysis and the various confessional lists form this type of prepared list c correction list this type of list corrects an ongoing action examples are the word clearing correction list the int rundown correction list the dianetic correction list there is bit of gray area in this type of list as one can also use some of them for analysis as in the case of course supervisor correction list or student correction list the cs 53 can also serve as correction list the real difference is what the list is being used for to analyze to find out what to program or start or to correct something already in progress d drill lists these are used in training as dummy lists to get an auditor used to handling the meter and prepared lists such lists are contained in the book of emeter drills method of handling there are three methods of handling prepared lists depending on the type of list there is simply the method of asking the questions in sequence and getting the answer from the preclear this would apply to white form or to auditing prepared lists as in self analysis or in group auditing very few lists are handled in this way488the second way is called method 3 wherein the list is assessed on meter and when read is noted the meterreading question is taken up with the preclear and fned method 3 is covered in hcob 3 jul 71 auditing by lists the third way is called method 5 this type of assessment assesses the whole prepared list rapidly without getting the preclear to talk and the reads are then noted the largest read or reads are then taken up and fned method 5 is covered in hcob 3 jul 71 auditing by lists trs and metering whether or not prepared list reads depends upon the auditors trs and metering at one time or another case supervisors have had great deal of trouble with this accuracy as to what really read was greatly in question this came to view on flag in the early 70s when prepared lists that had been assessed by class iv trainees were then reassessed same list same pc shortly after the first list assessment by class xiis totally different results were found lists on which few or reads were obtained by the class iv trainees were found to be very live by the class xiis the difference of quality of trs and metering were what made the difference with the prepared list response hcob 22 april 1980 contains the drills which remedy this it is the trs and metering of the auditor that makes prepared list reliable not the list itself the champion list of all time is the cs 53 on one page any general thing that can be aberrated in thetan has been assembled there are two forms of it short form for preclears who know the terms and long form for preclears who are unindoctrinated they are the same lists but the short form is in single word and the long form is full question director of processing giving d of p interview can use one of these and obtain enough material to enormously help case supervisor it is not the only d of p interview action but it is very helpful when used an auditor can debug program or session with it it can analyze case for programming and it can also be used to correct program or to correct session originally it was developed to handle high and low tone arm cases and although it still says this it also says it can correct case outnesses and today this is its greatest use priority of handling outnesses is vital part of cs 53 the first three groups of items interiorization outnesses b list errors and c rudiments give the necessary order of handling if int is reading nothing else can be handled until it is list errors take the next priority then rudiments if one were to try to repair case out of sequence mess could occur so this prepared list also gives the sequence in which outnesses must be handled the main fault is using cs 53 is overuse an auditor reaching for it when he gets in trouble instead of improving the auditors own trs metering or knowledge of programming in the first place but the cs 53 is one of the most valuable tools an auditor or case supervisor has general case handling the prepared lists of all types place in the hands of the case supervisor and the auditor procedure by which case can be analyzed and programmed some auditing can be done direct from prepared lists489word clearing prepared lists it can happen that prepared list gets stalled on misunderstood words for many prepared lists there are also full word clearing lists which can be done on the pc at one time it was thought that before one did list one should always word clear lt however this has the liability that pc who is in one kind of trouble cant sit still until full word clearing action is done the amount of trouble which came from prepared lists came more from assessing and metering errors than it did from misunderstood words when one is using prepared list on pc who has never had it word cleared it is usually enough to check that the read isnt coming from u early in pcs auditing about the time he gets csl the more critical prepared lists should be word cleared and the fact noted in his folder but when one is doing this word clearing tone arm action or significant reads should also be noted one is liable to think he is word clearing whereas he is actually assessing true there are lot of tech words on prepared list that the pc isnt likely to know unfortunately the discoveries of scientology exceed common language and require terms of their own but pc catches on to this quite rapidly they are new ideas to him even though he was been living with them all the eons of his existence when the word is cleared the idea is also thrown into action so it is important to note meter reads and tone arm actions when clearing the words of prepared lists hard and fast rules can be drawn on this point of word clearing prepared lists if you have already word cleared the key words of key prepared list before you need it thank your stars otherwise carry on and hope summary case supervisor and an auditor owe it to themselves to have good command of this subject of prepared lists

have done the whole list in this fashion if you got read on the list question but the pc volunteers some answer to an unreading question do not take it up just ack and carry on with your mimeoed list believe your meter do not take up things that dont read dont get hunches dont let the pc run his own case by answering nonreading items and then the auditor taking them492up also dont let pc fiddle the cans to get false read or to obscure real one very rare but these two actions have happened big win if halfway down prepared list the last part not yet done the pc on some question gets wide fn big cog vgis the auditor is justified in calling the list complete and going to the next cs action or ending the session except in the case where an fning list is csed for eg cs 53rl the auditor does not violate cs series 20 persistent fn if he is intending to fn the list and the pc is on big win the auditor would end off let the pc have his win and then in another later session continue with the list there are two reasons for thisone the fn will usually just persist and cant be read through and further action will tend to invalidate the win the auditor can also carry on to the end of the

standard actions there are very few actions which do not have their own correction lists there is nothing in dianetics and scientology as miraculously workable as correction lists the only things which prevent the list from working are auditors metering b auditors trs metering when the auditors meter is habitually placed where he cannot see l the meter needle 2 the worksheet and 3 the pc with one directed look then he misses reads all three have to be seen at once the faults are i eyesight poor ii glasses rims obscure one while looking at another iii position of the meter it is standard

higher then lower note once the student has grasped this and can duplicate it have the student use other two syllable words or single syllable words preceded by an article using these notes of the statement then using these two notes have the student make up sentences as statements the bulk of the sentence said at the pitch of the higher note but the end of the sentence at the pitch of the lower note once the student has this down and can easily do it and it sounds natural and he is satisfied that it does go on to the question step the coach has the student say apple as question then

has the student say apple as question and then strikes the lower and higher note until the student can duplicate it now take other two syllable words or single syllable words preceded by an article and have the student say these as question following each one with the two instrument notes lower to higher when the student can do this is satisfied that it sounds natural and doesnt have to think about dolling it go on to the next step here the student makes up banal questions the first part of the question is said at the lower note and the last part is said at the higher note at each question the coach strikes the lower note and then the upper note when this sounds natural and the student does not have to think to do it and is satisfied with it the drill is ended end phenomena person who

personal habits in questioning purpose to enlighten the student as to his own communication habits and peoples reactions to his questions commands the most common everyday social questions such as hows it going do you like the weather etc appropriate to the activities and circumstances of the person only one or two questions to separate person the questions must be banal social and ordinary but they must be questions training stress the two students agree on the areas they will cover next time they will meet again they then go over individually not together the student pauses next to people encoun tered and asks social question and notes the reaction of the person asked in this drill the student does not necessarily try to use tr 1q1 but is just himself speaking as he would normally speak the students then meet and compare notes and discuss what they have discovered about themselves on the subject of asking questions if they have not learned or observed anything the drill must be repeated end phenomena person who has detected any habits he has in handling pitch of voice in asking questions so that he can cure these in subsequent drills history recommended by l ron hubbard in

other with table in between them the emeter is not used the book of emeter drills used by student and another copy by coach purpose to be able to ask questions using single word read from list commands the coach uses the usual tr directions of start flunk thats it the student uses single words from the prepared lists of the book of emeter drills pages 66 to 72 of the appendix training stress to get the student to use the pitch of his voice to deliver question consisting of single word it must sound like question per tr 1q1 and use similar pitchs to tr 1q1 the student is flunked for out trl for keeping his eyes glued to the list for sounding unnatural the student is also flunked for slow or comm laggy delivery or pauses the coach designates the list to be used changes lists when the student can do this easily second part of the drill is entered and the coach begins to use the pc origination list on page 58 so as to interrupt501the student and make him combine his questions with tr 4 in this case the student acknowledges appropriately uses i will repeat the question and does so end phenomena the ability to ask single word questions that will be responded to as questions

across table the emeter is set up and used copies of the book of emeter drills are used purpose to train the student to ask whole questions that sound like questions read an emeter and handle session at the same time commands the usual coach commands of tr drills the prepared lists of the appendix of the book of emeter drills the questions in these drills are reworded so that the item occurs as the last word example list 2 pg 65 or the book of emeter drills states that the assessment question is which tree do you like best this is converted for each question to do you like prepared list 4 is converted to do you dislike etc whole sentence is used in every case training stress the usual tr commands are used by the coach emeter drill 5ra must be used to start any tr errors or metering errors may be flunked but special attention is paid to the students ability to ask question that sounds like question in accordance to tr 1q1 and that sounds natural the drill has three parts in the first part although the coach is on the meter the ability to ask the question is concentrated upon the second part concentrates upon the students ability to look at the written question and then ask the coach directly without undue comm lag or hesitation the third part is to do the first two parts and read the meter in accordance with emeter drills 27 and cr00004 which may have to be reviewed if flubby and to keep session admin all smoothly and accurately if question arises about meter accuracy third person who can read meter or video tape is employed to ensure that the student is actually not missing or dubbing in reads end phenomena person who can do all the necessary actions of asking questions from prepared list and run session smoothly without errors or confusions and be confident

the coach sitting beside the student in third chair square fourcornered ashtray is used502purpose to deliver the thought of question into an exact position wide or narrow at decision that is question with or without words commands for the first part of the drill are you an ashtray are you made of glass are you sitting there second part of drill same questions silently third part of drill are you corner to each corner of the ashtray verbal and with intention at the same time fourth part of drill any applicable question verbal and with intention at the same time put broad and narrow at choice into the ashtray exact parts of it and the surroundings training stress the coach uses usual tr coaching commands there are four stages to the drill the first stage is to land verbal command into the ashtray the second stage is to put the question with full intention silently into the ashtray the third stage is to put verbal command and silent intention at the same time into exact parts of the ashtrays the fourth stage is to put any applicable question both verbally and with intention into any narrow or any broad portion of the ashtray or its surrounds at choice and at will at the conclusion of the whole drill imagine the ashtray saying yesyesyesyes in an avalanche of yeses to balance the flow in actual life people pcs and meters do respond and return the flow end phenomena the ability to land question with full intention into an exact target area broad or narrow at will and effectively whether verbally or silently history developed by l ron hubbard in april 1980 as an

indicate any fn end of assessment end of session training stress permit the student to continue to his first error then have him drill and correct that error and continue finally to conclude let the student go through the entire sequence of the drill beginning to end three times without error or flunk for final pass it is expected that the student will not flub any trs or metering or session patter metering may be finally verified by third student or video all assessing must be in proper tone 40 with full intention exactly placed the student must not wait to see if the meter read but catch the read of the last question as he starts the next one his vision may shift from list to pc but at all times must embrace list meter and pc this drill also would be the one used for tape or

assessment commands the usual coach tr commands two copies of the book of emeter drills prepared list is chosen by the coach and both use the same prepared list the student reads the question and asks it and the coach reads the replies from the same list but in his own copy the student must write down the answers in proper session worksheet and note and write down any reads an fn terminates the listing if it occurs the coach need not use the whole list of replies but only half dozen chosen at random the sequence of commands is the same as tr 48q1 except that the r factor is we are going to list question and if item fns and significant read has occurred the additional action of nulling the list is undertaken with the command i will now assess the list training stress the laws of listing and nulling hcob l aug 68 apply in full as these are very important laws and ignoring them can result in severe arc breaks not so much in this drill but in actual sessions the coach may also require suppress and invalidate buttons be put in on the whole list all errors omissions hesitations and lapses from tone 40 on the part of the student are flunked coach similarly to tr 48q1 pass when the student can do it flawlessly three consecutive times this drill may be used for internship tapes and videos for assessing and metering passes end phenomena person able to do flawless l n list as the session or as part of session with all trs in with perfect metering and proper admin and using tone 40 in his listing and assessing history developed by l ron hubbard in april 1980 summary the purpose of these drills is to train the student to ask questions that will get answers and to assess prepared lists that will get accurate reads if student dolling these drills has difficulty it will be traced to false data misunderstood words or not having passed earlier trs including upper indoc or his metering drills as contained in the book of emeter drills if satisfactory result is not obtained the faults in the above items should be located and remedied and these drills repeated if any earlier omissions are found and repaired and if these drills are honestly done heightened success as an

is an entirely different subject from listing and nulling listing and nulling is an entirely different subject from assess ment please get these differences very clearly they are completely different actions they are even years apart in development they have nothing to do with each other assessment assessment is an action done from prepared list prepared list the list is prepared by the auditor or the cs or it is an hcob of prepared lists it is done by someone other than the pc the prepared list for an assessment is not made up by the preclear assessment is done exactly per the book of emeter drills number 24 assessment is not done by the laws of listing and nulling assessment has nothing to do with s ds remedy or remedy b which are listing and nulling actions assessment is not auditing it is simply trying to locate something to audit you say the words on the prepared list right to the pcs bank bang bang marking the reads and go through the list of reading items until you are left with one reading item that is the item to get clue as to what happened the cs prepares list and the auditor starts assessing with the list already written out the auditor calls out each item and notes its read as follows505lions x big game sf cats x felines sf tigers x bearers x trucks x elephants x killing camping x three items are now reading after the first assessment the auditor continues to assess the reading items on the list by elimination down to one item on the second assessment the list looks like this lions x big game sf x cats x felines sf x tigers x bearers x trucks x elephants x killing f lfbd camping x now the item left in is killing it is circled that is the item the cs now knows where the charge lies this item is prepchecked or done on an l1 as subject or otherwise handled as directed by the cs sometimes some items will read three or four times but the action is the same the auditor assesses the reading items by elimination down to one item and that is all there is to it if the item killing also had an fn the item would not be handled further as the charge will have blown506listing and nulling listing and nulling is an action whereby the pc gives items in answer to the auditors listing question it is the preclear who lists listing and nulling is listed by the preclear this is done precisely per the laws of listing and nulling hcob 1 august 1968 there is listing and nulling drill in the book of emeter drills the auditor asks the listing question if it reads he asks the pc the question the pc answers item item item item the auditor writes the items down as the pc gives them noting the read or read as the pc gives the item the auditor then nulls the list per the laws of listing and nulling in listing and nulling there should be only one reading item on the list after nulling you dont go over and over the reading items by process of elimination you may extend the list if more than one item is reading on nulling in its finest form listing and nulling is done to lfbd fn the auditor says the listing question to the pc checks whether it read and notes the reads per number 6 of the laws of listing and nulling ideally the following would happens the auditor checks the question who got shot it gets long fall so it is reading well auditor writes the read beside the question then the auditor gives the pc the question with good tr 8 and pc gives items the auditor writes the pcs items down noting whether the item read and the read as the pc gives it the first reads therefore is always the read the item gave as the pc said it who got shot lf x

will bd fn because it is the item the auditor gives the item to the pc the pc will have cogs and vgis it might happen that the pc tells the auditor that this is the item at which point the auditor would pleasantly say thank you the white hunter is your item of he could just smile and say thank you in acknowledgment but the point is that he would never chop the pcs cog or enforce his presence on the pc while this is happening good trs are vital and this is the way you do listing and nulling you get an lfbd fn while listing or while nulling if youre flubless auditor it is the finest hand that gets it while listing and never has to get to the nulling stage however both are excellent list that has to be nulled to cm lfbd item is acceptable but not worthy of praise there is of course one other place where you could get an lfbd fn in listing and nulling which is while checking the listing question for read before listing you could get an fn on checking the question and the pc could start cogging and blow the whole subject when that happens the subject has blown dont do anything more with it indicate the fn and let the pc have his cog and vgis listing and nulling is so simple have perfect trs know the laws of listing and nulling and do it as shown above any auditor who consistently cannot get an lfbd fn while listing and nulling should retrain on listing and nulling it is more than likely hell find he has bought some one elses misunderstoods or considerations on the subject as matter of fact listing and nulling is breeze and dont let anyone try to tell you otherwise

or wrong list even rarely dianetic list can produce wrong list reactions ask the pc for his somatics and he blows up or goes into apathy or blows or attacks the auditor all of the more violent or bad reactions on the part of the pc come from out lists nothing else produces such d sharp deterioration in case or even illness out lists therefore when one gets sharp change in case like lowered tone violence blows determination to go on in spite of the supervisor long notes from pcs self c sing etc etc the cs suspects an out list this outness can occur in regular sessions even when the item was said to bd fn it can occur in coffee shop out of session auditing of someone or by est or poorly trained or untrained staff members or even in life pts when such actions as finding items by nonauditors are done on pts people the situation can be bad so one also suspects the person to be pts to someone or something pts does not communicate well in an assessment question so one says someone or something is hostile to you and you are connected to someone or something that doesnt agree with dianetics or scientology514repairs the main things to know when doing such repairs are that such situations as wrong lists or upset people can occur in an org where untrained people are also using meters and b that it is up to the cs to suspect detect and get them handled in regular session do not ignore the possible bad influence as the good outweighs the bad in such cases it is not correct answer to forbid such actions it is correct answer to require all such actions and worksheets become part of the folder one can also persuade the d of t or qual to get in the people doing such actions and do not ignore the effect such actions can have on cases and do not neglect to include

correction of it has been found that the correction of lists very vital piece of tech has been source of confusion in the field as it apparently has never been written up in an issue it really is simple if you know your laws of l n verifying list the correct procedure for verifyingcorrecting past l ns is to check the items as to whether or not they are correct then do an l4bra on each list where the item is found to be incorrect you would have to orient the pc to the listing question and the item you do not direct the question to see if it read and dont just do an l4bra and then not find the right item for the pc as part of the handling unless the question proves to be uncharged or some such nulling list one nulls list when he doesnt get bd fn item on listing the laws of l n strictly apply an l4bra would be used if the action bogs with still item found one would also null lists the pc made where item had been found such as 2wc which turned into listing action with the pc giving off items or list the pc somehow made while not on meter in these cases there is item to verify with the pc as correct just cull the items into list work out with the pc what the question was if its not already noted and null the list reconstructing list sometimes you just dont have the list and cant get it or its an old why finding or pts interview for which there are worksheets in this case you get from the pc what the question was and then get him to give you the items that were already on the list as the item probably was already on the list and you dont want the pc to get into newly listing the question in pt and then getting into an overlisting situation just get him to give you the items he had already put on the list and more often than not you will get bd fn item if you dont get the item that way then you can extend the list selflisting watch it on these as every random stray thought person has about why this or that does not mean its selflist but do look for it on person who is manifesting the horrendous bpc an out list can generate who is introspected or has been trying to figure out who is doing him in after just having seen the ethics officer just dont get into trying to make list out of some non standard listing question that wont give you an item and actually the usual reason for selflisting is prior wrong l n item or an item not found people will selflist to try to find the right item so find and correct the earlier out list517list correction blowup when you are going along correcting lists and suddenly you get big pc blowup and it is not resolving on the list you are correcting you had better quickly realize that you probably are not correcting the list that is out and youd better find out which list it is there is usually an earlier out list to be found if the list you are correcting does not resolve the upset lists not reading when you start getting key lists such as grades iii and iv not reading and items found its time for that auditor to get thorough overhaul on his metering eyesight and to get off all his mus on l n you also could be setting the pc up for selflisting situation as he has been given the listing question but item has been found so be very sure the question did not read even with suppress and inval and trs were in before getting off key l n process use of l4bra the prepared list l4bra corrects l n lists it can be run on old lists current lists general listing when pc is ill after listing and nulling session or up to 3 days after always suspect that listing action done on the pc had an error in it and get those lists corrected sometimes it is obvious what the error was per the laws of listing and nulling for example there could be two reading items left on the list in which case you would know to extend the list as it has been underlisted if this didnt go then an l4bra would be done on the list handling an l4bra you handle reading questions on the l4bra by the directions under the question that read you dont just 2wc these questions for example say question 4 read on the l4bra is list incomplete sf you then ask the pc what list is incomplete locate it and get it completed to bd fn item you dont just 2wc incomplete lists to an fn and leave it at that by the way the l4bra is missing line which is was it the first item on the list this is being added as its quite common that it is the first item and is most often missed do it right an out list can create more concentrated hell with pc than any other single auditing error so its imperative that listing errors get properly corrected the best thing to do is to have the laws of listing and nulling drilled line by line and down cold and just do it right in the first place then you will also see at once where old lists violated these laws and you will not be yourself doing lists that have to be corrected later l ron hubbard founder assisted by cs45 lrhjedr copyright 1977 by l ron hubbard all rights

which instantly turns twc into listing question listing questions are governed by the rules of listing and nulling if you use listing question accidentally in twc you can get the same bad reactions from pc that you would get on wrongly done list the reason for pc upsets in twc is hidden as it is not apparently listing process rarely gets the correction bad list would get asking who or what or which during twc after the main question can also turn it into listing and nulling process twc questions must be limited to feelings reactions significances they must never ask for terminals or locations example who upset you in twc causes the pc to give items this is list what are you upset about does the same thing which town were you happiest in is also listing question not twc question any of these results in the pc giving items they are not then nulled or correctly indicated the pc can get very upset just as he would with wrong list yet the session is not listing session so never gets corrected example how are you doing lately is an example of correct twc question it gets off charge and gets list items are you better these days than you used to be how have you been since the last session what happened is different than what illness what person what town which are listing questions repair when other things fail to locate the upset of pc look into twc processes in the

the list down until he gets heavy read and cleans that using itsa earlier itsa then he can go on to the next heavy read cleans that etc to fn in this case he can get several fns on the same list 4the whole list is rapidly assessed over and over until one item stays in and that is given to the pc upset pc when pc is very upset and misemotional the action in 4 above is the only one to use as it is the safest on very upset or antagonistic pc dont engage in any chatter just grab list and assess it and indicate the bypassed charge the results are usually magical repair repairing case fully as done in qual or in an hgc where the person has led an outrud life method 3 above is the one to use various and assorted lists can be employed setting up the best way to set up case for auditing major action is to repair it520this can be necessary before the person is ever audited at all on any major action such as dianetics or grades such an action can go on and on and should the action is to bleed the list of all possible use using 3 this is new discovery i have made auditing repair auditing repair usually uses methods i or for pcs upset from lists 4 error in using lists the major error in using prepared lists is not to really get full use out of the list in using lists dont be in great hurry or do superficial job the list is for the pc not statistic l ron hubbard founder lrhkjmkard

response to listing question and written down by the auditor in the exact sequence that they are given to him by the preclear an ln list is always done on separate sheet its best to do an ln list on

by the question sf f lf lfbd if suppress or inval is used that is also noted as each item is given by the pc the reads are markedsf f lf lfbd this is done as you list if the item does not read you mark it with an x ta is noted periodically as the pc lists and especially when the ta rises the lfbd fn item is circled if indicated to the pc it is marked ind when extending list line is drawn from where it has been extended with the date example item joe x shoes sf socks x ________________ext 24272 sky x wax x pigs etc etc523ln lists are never stapled to the ws but are paperclipped under the

as an auditor the pc cognites and makes case gains further according to the axioms bank straightens out by asising its content if the pcs attention is distracted to the auditor and meter his attention is not on his bank so asising cannot occur the definition of in session is interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor when this definition describes the session in progress then of course the pc will be able to asis and will cognite by the original thesis the auditor plus the pc is greater than the pcs bank when the auditor plus the bank are both overwhelming the pc then the bank seems greater than the pc it is this situation which gives pc low tone arm an auditor who cant be heard doesnt ack doesnt give the pc the next command fails to handle origins simply has outtrs the auditor who is trying to be interesting to the pc who overacks who laughs loudly is putting the pcs attention onto himself so the pcs attention not being on his bank doesnt asis or cognite the auditor whose metering bypasses fns or calls fns at wrong points or who tells the pc that reads that blew down etc or who any other way uses the meter distractingly the pc knows when he is being under or over run and knows when he is being mismetered is of course violating the definition of insession the pcs attention goes to the meter not his bank so he doesnt asis or cognite530auditor invalidation and evaluation is just plain villainy it interferes with pc cognitions other code breaks are similarly distractive perfect session if you understand the exact definition of insession if you understand the pcs necessity to have his attention on his bank so as to asis it and work out what is really going on in session that brings about cognition asising aberration with realization about life you will then be able to spot all the things in trs metering and the code that would prevent case gain once you see that outtrs mismetering and code breaks would prevent the insession definition you will see what would impede pc from asising and cogniting when you have this figured out you will then be able to see clearly what are intrs correct metering and correct code application there can be an infinity of wrongnesses there are only few rightnesses recognition of right trs right metering and right code use depend only on aunderstanding the principles in this hcob and btheir

familiar with his meters and papers to such degree that they do not in any way distract him only then can you add bank to the scene poor solo auditor does not cognite as his attention is on the tools not his bank where the solo auditor fails he has not learned his tools the remedy is to make him learn them the bridge between ii and iii is sometimes hard one it may be that an hdc course is vital before the pre can make this bridge the solo auditor who attests rather than confront his bank probably never learned to use his auditing tools in the first place then adding the bank as something to

solo auditing the auditing question or auditing command is provided in the materials the solo auditor has to ensure that he understands the auditing question or auditing command gets the answer to the question or carries out the command and recognizes that he has done so and completes that cycle solo auditing mainly consists of carrying out cycles of action this is easy to do as these are given in the materials and it consists of doing what the materials say to do verbalization the solo auditor does not verbalize questions or commands in solo auditing it is done on thought or intention level there is solo auditing action in which the solo auditor calls items verbally but otherwise solo auditing is not verbalized meter error in solo auditing the meter worksheets and materials must be arranged so that the solo auditor can read the meter at the same time as he reads the question or item in the materials this is because the question or item will read on the meter when the solo auditor reads the question or item in the materials one should not ignore the meter read when first reading the question or item in the materials this is especially true when checking reads on ruds or doing bpc assessment as the read might not repeat the initial read when the question or item is first read and understood by the solo auditor is taken this is because the read occurs when the solo auditor thinks the question or concept of the item another meter error could occur if the solo auditor didnt understand the question or item you could get reaction because the question or item was misunderstood and if the question or item is misunderstood then you wouldnt be able to audit it therefore it is very important that the solo auditor knows to clear the meanings of words in auditing commands and items solo drills the solo drills are designed to familiarize the solo auditor with the tools of solo auditing and to become skilled so that when the time comes to start solo auditing he

silently answers the question and writes down the answer then he acknowledges that that cycle is complete the coach then verifies that the student did each step and whether the student is satisfied that he has done so this drill is passed when the student can carry out this cycle without being distracted or q aing does complete the cycle started and ends the cycle the questions answers and acknowledgments are done silently and conceptually not verbalized _____________ the student solo auditor now does the following solo emeter drills the solo session setup solo cans are all used as in preceding drills and the student writes on worksheet this is to keep familiarizing the solo auditor with the tools he will be using in solo auditing the student must have completed the regular drills per the book of meter drills before attempting these drills if the student solo auditor has difficulty with drill done solo he should return to the appropriate solo auditor drill or to the regular meter drill until he can do it easily the numbers within the drills are the numbers from the book of emeter drills the solo emeter drills are done silently drills 1 to 7 are exactly as given in the book of emeter drills and are not repeated here as solo action also use hcob 14 jul 70 solo cans for proper use of solo cans542solo emeter drill 8 as for em8 except that student has the bulletin on the table beside the meter he holds the electrodes solo cans himself and observes the meter while reading the bulletin solo emeter drill 9 as for em9 except that student auditor holds solo cans and reads bulletin considerable emphasis is on correct positioning of the meter worksheets and reading material early in this drill the student should experiment with these positions for optimum placement so as to see the meter at the same time as reading and to avoid session distractions solo emeter drill 10 as for em10 additional notes as for previous drill solo emeter drill 11 as for em11 with student holding solo cans and reading silently from origination sheet emeter drill 12 omitted as solo drill emeter drill 13 omitted as solo drill solo emeter drill 14 as for em14 but with student holding solo cans and reading bulletin solo emeter drill 15 as for em15 but the student holding the solo cans and reading originations to himself and thinking the meaning of the origination conceptually coach asks what did the needle do while reading the line etc as in the basic drill in this drill the student learns that the meter read will occur when he reads the line and gets the concept and trains the student to be able to read line and note the meter reaction or lack of it at the same time not read the line and then look at the meter later it also trains the student that if he has his attention locked on the meter and doesnt actually think the meaning of the line the meter wont read solo emeter drill 16 omitted as solo drill solo emeter drill 17 omitted as solo drill solo emeter drill 18 omitted as solo drill solo emeter drill 19 as for em19 but with the student solo auditor holding the solo cans and the coach seated beside him observing the drill is done silently the coach is to keep the student at it and asks commands as per em19 until the student can do it easily and with certainty543solo emeter drill 20 omitted as solo drill solo emeter drill 21 as for em21 but student auditor holding solo cans in this drill done solo the student auditor will of course already know what he was thinking when the meter read however the drill is done as given to show the solo student auditor that his thought will again produce the same read when he again thinks the same thought it also illustrates the necessity for the solo auditor to keep his attention on the reading item or subject in order to keep that item reading and further when the thought is repeated it shows how the read on that thought will diminish and vanish as the charge is reduced by respotting the original thought therefore in the solo drill there is second step where the student is required to repeatedly think the same thought until the read longer occurs and to note the reads on worksheet as they occur as this is an auditing technique used in certain solo levels when discharging items the drill must be well done and continued to high level of competence solo emeter drill 22 omitted as solo drill solo emeter drill 23 omitted as solo drill solo emeter drill 24 as for em24 but the student holding solo cans and does the assessments on himself only use the assessments given in the book

primarily training actions are also designed to start the solo student auditor on his solo auditing at the correct gradient the solo cs is not limited to these solo student cses solo student auditors will make good gains from these actions the main emphasis however must be on their use as training actions for the student as solo auditor to ensure he is using the exact and correct session procedure keeping proper session admin and doing competent job of basic auditing they provide him with foolproof gradient for getting his feet wet when he begins548to solo audit while giving him experience in running standard solo session by the book the cses are issued to the student auditor one cs at time and each cs is checked out on the student before he does the action should the student auditor flub any action he is crammed on the materials and drills covering that action before he audits further each action is repeated until the student can do it successfully with flubs it is the responsibility of the solo student auditor the solo supervisor and the solo cs to ensure the actions are not skimped the success of the solo auditor on advanced levels will depend upon the certainty and competence he achieves on these student auditor actions the solo student cses from 8 on are designed to give the solo student auditor both increased confidence and case wins supply of these standard cses should
