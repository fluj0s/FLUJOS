wellbeing of children and their families including protecting children from abuse or neglect and ensuring that they have safe and permanent home federalstate framework for child welfare policy as the us constitution has been interpreted states have the primary obligation to ensure child welfare at the state level the child welfare system consists of state and local judges nd other court personne l prosecutors law enforcement personnel and public and private social service workers these representatives of various state and local entities investigate allegations of child abuse and neglect provide services to families in their own homes remove children from homes if necessary and supervise and administer payments for children in out ofhome settings federal involvement in child welfare is tied to the financial assistance it provides to states to conduct these activ ities in fy2008 congre ss appropriated just under 79 billion for child welfare purposes the bulk 46 billion of this money was appropriated to reimburse states for the cost of providing foster care for children who meet federal eligibility criteria estimated 43 of national foster care caseload in fy2006 beginning in the early 1960s th federal government has paid for part of the cost of foster care for children who would have been entitled to federally assisted cash welfare had they continued to live in their own homes in essence the cash aid was expected to follow the child into foster care states had primary responsibility to pay the full foster care co sts for other children who were removed from their homes in the 1996 welfare re form law pl 104193 congress ended the entitlement to cash aid for needy families with children and converted funding for this purpose to block grant at the same time it continued to require that only children removed from homes that would have met the eligibility requirements for cash aid under the states pre1996 welfarerefo rm rules would be ligible for federal foster care assistance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34388crs2 1 for more information about specific program requirements see crs report rl31242 child welfare federal program requirements for states by emilie stoltzfus 2 the cfsr was designed by hhs to meet the conformity review requirements mandated by congress in 1994 pl 103432 and enacted as section 1123a of the social security act the initial round of the cfsr was conducted from 2001 through 2004 and all states were required to take some corrective acti ons second round of reviews is now underway and is expected to continue into fy2010 for more information see crs report rl32968 child welfare state performance on child and family services reviews by emilie stoltzfus 3 some children experience more than one type of maltreatment these percentages total more than 100 because child may be included in as many categories as the types of maltreatment he or she experienced 4 us department of health and human services administration on children and families childrens bureau child maltreatment 2006 april 2008 hereafter child maltreatment continuedas condition of receiving these foster care and other child welfare funds states are required to abide by series of federal child welfare policies1 federal child welfare policies focus overall on ensuring safety and wellbeing for all children served however the most specific and extensive requirements are designed for the protection of children in foster care especially to ensure them safe and permanent home these protections must generally be provided to all children in foster care regardless of whether they meet federal foster care eligibility criteria state compliance with the majority of these federal requirements is checked as part of the child and family services review cfsr state that is not in substantial conformity with federal child welfare policy as determined by the review must implement program improvement plan pip the state typically has two years to implement pip the pip must successfully address the compliance issues identified by the cfsr or the state faces loss of part of their federal child welfare funding2 child maltreatment and children in foster care in fy2006 an estimated 905000 us childre n or about 121 children for every 1000 in the general population were found to be victims of abuse or neglect an estimated 1530 children died due to abuse or neglect in that year the rate of reported child maltrea tment victims has been about 12 children per 1000 children in the national population in every year since 1999 this rate is well below the recorded highs in the early to mid1990s 19921996 when the rate ranged around 15 victims for every 1000 children in the population and the number of child victims was counted as more th an 1 million nnually see table 1 for fy2006 states reported 64 of child victims experien ced neglect 16 were found to have experienced physical abuse 9 sexual abuse 7 psychological maltreatment 2 medical neglect and 14 other abuse3 these shares were fairly constant between 2000 and 2006 although the rate of childre n found to have experienced neglect increased somewhat while the rate of children found to have experienced physical abuse or sexual abuse declined somewhat4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34388crs3 4 continued 2006 or another year in the series and unpublished statereported data received from the childrens bureau 5 the number of children in foster care include s some youth age 18 or older however the comparison to the general population is made with population estimates of individuals age 17 or younger 6 the state of maine also saw caseload dec line of more than 34 over those same years which reduced the number of children in the states caseload by more than 1000 with nearly all of the decrease occurring since fy2002 7 mississippis caseload was virtually uncha nged between the last day of fy1999 3196 children in care and the last day of

estimates show 510000 children were in foster care on the last day of fy2006 or bout 68 per every 1000 children in the general population this represents modest decline from the estimated 511000 children in care on the last day of fy2005 but is well below the reco rded high of 567000 children in care on the last day of fy1999 when there were about 80 children in foster care per 1000 in the population5 see table 1 overall the national foster care cas eload declined by about 10 between fy1999 and fy2 006 however this decline has not been shared by all states between fy1999 and fy2006 most recent year statelevel data ar available less than half of all the states 24 including puerto rico and the district of columbia reported reductions in their foster care cas eload ranging from less than 1 decline in connecticut 40 children and michigan 200 children to nearly 47 decline in illinois 16000 children along with illi nois california and new york posted the greatest numerical and

according to data submitted as of january 2008 the overall number of children in care on th last day of given year rises or falls depending upon both the number of entrie s to foster care that is children who are removed from their homes in given ear and the number of exits in that same year that is children reunited with thei r families adopted eman cipated or placed in another permanent setting nationally the number of children reported as having exited foster care has risen from an estimated 250000 in fy1999 to an estimated 289000 in fy2006 however this is understood as an undercount because some states do not report all exits from foster care10 nationally the number of children who entered foster care may be trending up during fy2006 most recent year for which data are available the number of children who entered foster care in fy2006 was estimated as 303000 compared to 293000 children who entered in fy1999 table 1 indicates that this represents ra of about 41 child ren per 1000 in the population in both of those years however during the period of greatest recorded decline in the national caseload fy2000 through fy2004 the rate of children entering foster care also decline d reaching low point of 39 in fy2003 table 1 shows national estimates of the total number and the rate ie the number of children per 1000 in the populati on who were found to be victims

in this table but are drawn from us census bureau population estimates for individuals under the age of 18 the population estimates used included children in all 50 states the district of columbia and beginning with 1998 puerto rico b data on child maltreatment victims were reported by calendar year from 1990 thro ugh 2002 and by fiscal year in 2003 and each year thereafter reporting methodologies related to children entering or in care varied over time however beginning later than 1995 estimates of children entering foster care refer to those who entered at any time during the fiscal year and for children in foster care refer to those in care on the last day of the fiscal year c data from puerto rico is estimated regarding child maltreatment for the first time in 2002 and regarding entries to foster care and children in foster care beginning at least with 1998 d relatively small but possibly growing number of children in foster care are 18 years of age or older these youth are included

child welfare po licy has sometimes been c onsidered synonymous with foster care policy and most federal dedicated funding and policy proscriptions are related to children in foster care at the same time the mission of child welfare agencies as described in federal policy and the group of children and families those agencies work with is far broader source us department of health and human

during fy2006 most recent data available states received allegations of abuse or neglect related to roughly six million children many of these allegations were screened out and further attention wa s given to the case screen out might occur because the alleged behavior does not match the state definition of child abuse or neglect because the case is transferred to another agency considered by the child protective services agency to be more ppropriate because not enough information was provided to follow up on the allegation or for other reasons in the end states conducted investigations or assessments of abuse or neglect involving some 36 million children during fy2006 and found more than 905000 children to be victims of child abuse or neglect states also reported providing post investigation services to an estimated 13 million children including some of those who were found to be figure 1 children brought to the attention of or served by child welfare agencies national estimates 2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34388crs7 11 child maltreatment 2006 12 ibid not all states reported data on the number of victims and nonvictims served following an investigation the total numbers and shares of victims served or not served are national estimates using data provided by reporting states these data should be treated as rough estimates 13 children who are nonvictims may nonetheless be served because of risk factors identified during the course of the investigation and consequent efforts intended to prevent future abuse or neglect the reason that children counted as nonvictims are sometimes removed from their homes is not fully understood these children may be the siblings of other children who have been found to be victims of maltreatment they may have been removed for alternative reasons eg child behavior i ssue or there may be other issues including those related to how states report these data 14 us department of health and human rvices adoption and foster care analysis reporting system afcars data trends in foster care and adoption fy2002 fy2006 based on data submitted by states as of january 2008 15 these broad goals are most clearly expressed in the federal regulations promulgated as part of implementing the title ivb subpart 2 program now known as the promoting safe and stable families program see principals of child and family services at us code of federal regulations 45cfr 135522 victims as well as some who were not f ound to be victims most of these children 77 were served in their homes and th remainder were removed to foster care11 although the number of children receiving some services after the investigation 13 million exceeds the number of victims 905000 not all victims received post investigation services12 instead the data reported by st ates suggest that roughly three out of every five victims received any serv ices following the investigation overall states reported that among children found to be victims of child maltreatment an estimated 22 were removed to foster care and roughly equal portions of the remaining victims were either served in their homes 37 or received neither inthe home nor outofthe home servi ces following the investigation 41 among the children who were not found to be victims in the inve stigation states reported that more than 4 were removed to foster care close to 26 received services in the home and the remaining 70 received neither inthehome nor outofthehome services following the cl ose of the investigation13 finally during fy2006 states reporte d serving some 799000 children for at least one day 24 hours in foster care this number includes some children who were in care at the beginning of the year and some of those who entered care during that fiscal year whether due to abus or neglect or another reason eg child behavior on the last day of the fis cal year september 30 2006 an estimated 510000 children were in foster care14 activities of the child welfare agency federal statute authorizes state child welfare agencies to use federal funds to offer broad range of services and other activities toward the central goals of ensuring the wellbeing of children and their families and ensuring that children have safe and permanent homes15 these services and activities may take variety of forms and include the following httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34388crs8 efforts to educate the public about child abuse or neglect and how to report suspected maltreatment efforts to prevent child abuse and neglect and improve child and family wellbeing generally such as provision of communitybased family support services like pa renting education classes procedures to identify children w ho have been abused or neglected such as operating hotline to r eceive and screen referrals and investigating abuse or neglect allegations procedures and services to protect children from unsafe home situations by providing services to prevent the need for their removal such as parenting education resp ite care counsel ing or mental health substance abuse or othe r treatment services or when necessary finding temporary foster home for children and supporting their stay in foster care services and activities to enable children removed to foster care to be returned to their families eg permanency planning counseling mental health substance abuse or other treatment services parenting education or other suppor ts for children or their parents for children and youth who cannot be reunited with their biological parents services and activities to able them to be placed in another permanent family eg locating and supporting adoptive parents or fit and willing legal guardians for those children and youth and procedures to identify children likely to age out of foster care without finding permanent family and services and activities to enable these youth to succeed as independent adults including services and support to youth who have already aged out of the foster care system federal child welfare funding in fy2008 for fy2008 congress made available just under 79 billion in dedicated child welfare funding by far the largest amount of this funding is made availabl for states to help support and provide certain casework activities eg permanency planning for eligible children who have been removed from their birth families primarily due to abuse or neglect these include children in foster care 46 billi on and children who have been adopted primarily out of foster care 22 billion sma ller amount of fy2008 federal child welfare funding 763 million is distri buted to all states for wide range of child and family services and activities these include to identify and assess children at risk of child maltreatment prevent the removal of children from their homes when possible plan for and permit the safe reuniting of children in foster care with their parents or when this is not possible pl an for and find another permanent home for children in foster care and overall to provide services intended to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children in their homes w hether with biological parents

programs section 107 of capta contains the program authority for grants to all states to improve the handling and prosecution of child abuse and neglect cases these grants were initially authorized by the childrens justice act of 1986 title i of pl 99401 but program authority was subsequently moved to capta at the same time authority to fund these grants is not provided in capta but remains in separate law that law the victims of crime act of 1984 pl 98473 as amended authorizes setaside of up to 20 million annually out of the crime victims fund for these grantsbeing placed in permanent home or fo r those who have already done so to successfully make the transition to inde pendent adulthood fina lly funds totaling 173 million in fy2008 is made available mos tly as competitive grants to eligible entities primarily for support of research demonstration or pilot programs services and other activities related to child welfare16 federal program administration nearly all federal child welfare programs are administered by the childrens bureau within the administration for children and families acf at the us department of health and human services hhs handful of programs authorized by the victims of child abuse act and related primarily to court adjudication of child abuse cases are administered by the office of justice programs within the department of justice congressional committee work in congress the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee typically report legislation related to the largest child welfare programs all of which are authorized under the social security act these include the title ivb programs child welfare services and promoting safe and stable families and the title ive programs foster care and adoption assistance adoption incentives and the chafee foster care independence program including educati on and training vouchers at the same time the house education and labor committee and the senate health education labor and pensions help committee generally report bills amending the grant programs authorized under the child abuse prevention and treatment act capta that law authorizes grants to states to improve child protective services grants for research demonstrations and other activities and grants for communitybased services to prevent child abuse and neglect17 those same committees have typica lly dealt with legislativ proposals related to two additional and freestanding programs adoption opportun ities and abandoned infants assistance finally several other committees deal with variety of competitive grant programs related to child welfare purposes see table 2 funding authority many federal social serv ice programs including some child welfare programs have discretionary nd timelimited funding authorizations this gives congress the discretion to appr opriate funds for the program generally up to the amount specified in the authoriz ing law for specific number of years eg for fy2004fy2008 discretionary fundi ng authorization is said to expire once the last year of the funding author ization is completed although congress mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34388crs10 sometimes choose to appropria funds even after the expiration of the funding authorization congressional committees that authorize federal pr ograms often use these dates as time to revisit how the programs are working and to consider reauthorization legislation other child welfare progra ms have mandatory funding authorizations either capped meaning the amount of funding that must be provided is specified in the authorizing statute or openended m eaning the funding level is ultimately determined by the value of eligible claims submitted by states the funding for some of these child welfare programs is au thorized on timelimited basis like the discretionary authorizations discussed above while for ot hers it is authorized on permanent basis permanent funding au thority may only be ended by repealing

budge ting and financia l management health education housing and services to promote youth development at least half did indicate they had receive d some educational support26 recommendations the youth who testified st ressed the critical importance of working to create perman ent connections for youth before they leave foster care by matching the youth with perm anent supportive family including relative families or at the least by helping the youth connect with an adult mentor some suggested that youth should have the option to remain in foster care custody until at least age 21

would respond to number of the concerns raised in the child welfare hearings held during 2007 including proposals to change the federal ch ild welfare financing structure has been introduced in the

welfare financing proposals made outside of congress including proposal by the bush administration that have influenced or continue to influence legislative proposals other legislative proposals would aut horize or require new services and protections for children in or about to enter foster care seek to improve services for youth who are aging out of care including those who have already exited

her related changes intended to enhance the safety perm anence and wellbeing of children these legislative proposals are described in greater detail below most of the bills discussed would amend child welfare programs and policy that currently exist however some would create new and freesta nding programs or would amend other social service or education programs an effort was made to identify bills with proposals that highlight wide range of ch ild welfare policy concerns and that would be expected to affect the primary populations served by the child welfare agency as well as the child welfare agency itself at the same time this discussion is not comprehensive and inclusion of bill or exclusion is not intended to suggest the viability or lack of viability for given proposal proposals to expand title ive eligible populations number of bills would expand the popula tion of children who are eligible for federal assistance under title ive of the soci security by delinking the program or parts of it from the eligibility rules of the former federal cash welfare program repealed in 1996 by pl 104193 th at program was known as aid to fa milies with dependent children afdc additional bills would further expand the population of children who ma be served with title ive dollars by permitting eligible children leaving foster care for legal guardianship in relatives home to receive title ive support and by extendi ng the age at which youth could remain eligible for title ive foster care support to 21 years of agehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34388crs18 33 there are various ways to estimate this coverage rate on national basis and the coverage rates shown here are based on the average mont hly number of children claimed by states as eligible for title ive foster care maintenanc payments expenditure data in given fiscal year compared to the number of children the st ate reported in foster care on the last day of the same fiscal year adoption and foster care analysis and reporting system afcars data for example there were an estimated 510000 children in care on the last day of fy2006 and during that year states submitted t itle ive foster care maintenance payment claims for an average monthly num ber of 220000 children in foster care 34 hr 5466 would strike all references to the prior afdc prog ram with regard to eligibility however for purposes of federal title ive eligibility hr 3409 and hr 4207 would continue to require that child must have been removed to foster care from the home of specified relative as defined in the prior law afdc program 35 although the current link was established by the 1996 welfare reform measure pl 104 193 the initial link between eligib ility for cash aid and federal reimbursement for foster care expenses was

by re presentative shelley berkley and senator sherrod brown and the place to call home act hr 3409 an omnibus youth policy bill introdu ced by representative ruben hinojosa34 this change would potentially expand eligibility for federal foster care maintenance payments and adoption assistance subsidies to include any child in foster care as well as any child adopted from foster care w ho meets state speci needs criteria share of eligible children there are multiple criteria for federal title ive eligibility see appendix b and wide variation among states in the estimated share of children in foster care who meet these eligibility criteria simple correlation between states 1996 income eligibility ru and the share of its foster care caseload that is title ive eligible can be established nonetheless the current law requirement that links title ive foster care and in most cases adoption assistance eligibility to the income rules of the nowrepealed afdc program is viewed by many as an explanation for the recent decline in the share of children who are eligible for federal foster care support specifically fe deral law requires state to look back to and apply the income and other eligibility rules that were in use in the state on july 16 1996 under the prior law cash welfare program afdc35 this requirement has limited title ive eligibility to children from families whose incomes represent declining share of the federal poverty guidelines in 1996 the median value of all states afdc income tests for family of three was equal tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34388crs19

median va lue had slipped to 45 in fully twothirds of the states 34 including dc the title ive income eligibility test for family of three is now less than 50 of the federal poverty guideline for family of three or less than 858536 nature of funding there is upper or lower limit on federal title ive foster care or adoption assistance funding to states instead the federal government is committed to sharing fixed part of every eligible claim submitted by state on behalf of an eligible chil d this kind of federal funding is sometimes referred to as openended entitlement funding hr 5466 hr 3409 hr 4207 and s 2900 would continue to provide support for title ive foster care maintenance payments and adoption assistance payments on an openended entitlement basis these bills would also provide for continued open ended reimbursement for related child placement activities eg case management training data collection costs and other program administration costs however hr 5466 would limit overall state reimbursement for specific administrative costs eligibility determination setting payment rates for foster care homes and institutions and for related agency overhead to more than 15 of states fe deral title ive administrative funding37 and hr 3409 would limit those same costs to mo re then 15 of states total federal title ive funding hr 4207 and s 2900 do not include this limit reimbursement rates hr 4207 and s 2900 would not make any changes to current federal reimbursement rates under title ive howe ver hr 5466 and hr 3409 propose to reduce the expected cost to the federal government of expanding eligibility for title ive by reducing the rate at which states are now reimbursed for foster care and adoption assistance costs in general these bills propose to determine what portion of all states total foster care and adoption assistance costs whether incurred on behalf of ive eligible child or nonive eligible child is now provided by the fede ral government and would ensure that this same national level of commitment be continued into the future to achieve this each states current reimburse ment rates under the title iv program except those related to training and deve lopment and operation of da ta collection system would be reduced by the same percentage at the same time hr 5466 and hr 3409 would provide threeyear period following the enactment of these changes during which any state that received fewer federa l foster care or adoption assistance dollars because of lowered federal reimbursement rate s could submit additional claims to receive funding at the level they would have received under prior law38 ultimately the overall share of federal s upport received by the state during that threeyear period would be used as part of establishing its title ive reimbursement rates current law currently the reimbursement rate for foster care maintenance payments and adoption assistance payments is pegged to the states federal

financial support depending on their legal relationship to the child and the licensing or other policies of the state in which they live relatives may receive foster care maintenance payments if they serve as formal foster parents for relative child however those payments may not be title ive federally subsidized unless the relative meets the states licensing standards and approval process similarly children who exit foster care to relative adoption may be eligible for title ive adoption assistance payment but only if that relative meets speci fic background check requirements some unlicensed relatives caring for children in formal foster care may instead receive temporary assistance for needy families tanf childonly benefit and this may also be true for children who exit foster

would need to enter into guardianship assistance agreement with the legal relative guardian provide copy of the agreement to the relative guardian and certify that any child moving to title ive guardianship assistance arrangement is eligible for medicaid the guardianship assistance agreement would need to specify the services to be made available to the family and the amount of the guardianship assistance payment s 661 hr 2188 and hr 3409 would provide that this amount must take into account the needs of relative guardian and of the child and that it may not be less than what the child would otherwise receive as foster care maintenance payment hr 5466 would make these sa stipulations except that it would also give states the option to set the payment amount at th adoption assistance rate the child would have received had he or she been adopted s 3038 would re quire states to take into account the circumstances of the relative gu ardian and the needs of the child and

obtaining legal guardianship although s 3038 would cap the amount of re imbursement of those costs at more than 2000 finally each of the five bills w ould require that for any child in foster care whose permanency plan was legal guardianship the state must have documented that relative guardianship is the most appropriate permanent placement option for the child and among other items this

on permanent basis and must become the legal guardian of the child through legal guardianship established by court57 s 3038 would make th same requirements except that the grandparent or other relative is not exp licitly required to have been the foster parent of the child all five bills would also require that relative guardians complete fingerprintba sed criminal background check and four

contrast although hr 5466 requires fingerprintbased criminal record checks it does not reference list of findings that would disqualify legal relative guardian from receiving federally supported title

the remainder lived in group continuedive foster care child must be under the care and placement responsibility of the state or any public agency with which the state agency has made an agreement however in most states child reaches the age of majority on their 18th birthday and is considered to be legally emancipate d from either hishe r parents or in the case of child in foster care the state foster care system most youth leave foster care upon reaching their 18th birthday and this is true ev though many states now permit youth to choose to remain in care beyond that date60 however with handful of exceptions few states appear to actively facilitate youths extended stay in foster care possibly because states must pay most of these foster care costs s 1512 and hr 5466 would permit state to continue to make foster care maintenance payment claims for an otherwise title ive eligible youth who remains in foster care under the responsibility of the state until the youths 21st birthday or at state option up until their 19th or 20th birthday s 1512 would explicitly state that remaining in foster care would be c hoice made by the youth hr 3409 hr 4208 and s 2560 would require

institution to include supervised setting in which the individual is living independently but only for otherwise title ive eligible youth who are at least 18 years of age and in accordance with any c onditions related to the supervised setting established by hhs in regulations funding for services to children and families common criticism of federal child welfare financing is that most federal support is for children after they have been removed from their homes ie funds provided for foster care or adoption assistance and that relatively little federal funding is provided to encourage states to provide services that would prevent placement of child in foster care or to help children who are placed in foster care be successfully reunited with their parents in recent years the share of dedicated child welfare funding that is available for all states to provide child welfare services and activities on behalf of any child or their family needing them has been about 10 of all dedicated child welfare funding63 title ive child and family services component hr 5466 would authorize openended reimbur sement of new child nd family services component under title ive of the social security act this would enable states to seek federal reimbursement for services that seek to 1 safely reduce the number of children in foster care 2 safely reduce the length of stay for children in foster care 3 increase the percentage of foster children who are cared for in familylike settings and 4 improve the wellbeing of ch ildren in foster care or those who are receiving title ive supported adoption assistance or guardi anship assistance payment the federal reimbursement rate for these services w ould be pegged to states federal medical assistance percentage fmap which may range from 50 in the highest per capita income states to 83 in states with the lowest per capita income state seeking funding under the title ive child and family services component would need to submit plan to hhs describing what services it intends to support with this funding the process by which it intends to assess the effects of the spending on the states established goal s and on other indicators of child welfare performance and whether it intends to spe nd some or all of the funds on required program improvement plan pip the plan would also need to contain an assurance that the state would submit

most recent five years and if the prior spending on that service method failed to result in meaningful progress toward the goals the state described in its plan finally states would be required to use the funds r eceived under this new service component of title ive to supplement rath er than supplant any federal state or local funds currently used for such child and family services maintenance of effort prov isions and service spending hr 3409 would require each state to sp end at least the same amount of money previously spent to provide foster care maintenance paymen ts for children who were not title ive eligible because of the afdc link on either foster care maintenance payments or any of the four services categories for wh ich states must now spend promoting safe and stable families funding ie family support fa mily preserva tion timelimited reunification and adoption promotion and support64 s 1462 which as described above would remove the afdc link for pur poses of federal eligibility for adoption assistance only would provide that state must spend any savings it derives from the increased share of children that would be eligible for adoption assistance on any purpose now authorized under t itle ive or title ivb of the social security act including postadoption services this requirement is also included in s 3038 by contrast hr 4091 which would also expand eligibility fo r federal adoption assistance support by removing the afdc link would not make this requirement of states but would include sense of congress statement to this effect by removing the afdc eligibility link and thus increasing the number of children eligible for title ive foster care maintenance payments hr 5466 hr 3409 and hr 4207s 2900 would also increase the share of children in foster care for whom states could seek federal suppor t for certain caseworker activities such as monthly visits and permanency planning for children in foster care although these activities are not considered services under the title ive program they are critical efforts that federal law require s states to make on behalf of any child in foster care currently states may seek reimbursement for these activities only on behalf of title ive eligible children in foster care states must use their own dollars or find other federal funds such as title ivb or soci services block grant funds to pay for these caseworker activities made on behalf of children who are not eligible for title ive support thus the expanded eligibility for title ive foster care maintenancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34388crs30 65 hr 3409 would also extend the current ca pta funding authoriz ation levels without significant changespayments described above would make federal support available for caseworker activities on behalf of all or nearly all children in foster care this might free up other federal funds provided to state fo r services to children and their families further provided that states did not use this increased support to simply supplant their current spending for these purposes it might also increase available state support for those purposes on the other hand both hr 5466 and hr 3409 but not hr 4207s 2900 would reduce the reim bursement rate for those costs to limit the effect of the expanded eligibility none of the proposed bills would address maintenance of effort with regard to current funding for caseworker activities on behalf of children not eligible for title ive transfer of unused title ive funds for services and training hr 4207s 2900 which as described ear lier would remove the afdc link for purposes of both federal foster care and adoption assistance eligibility would separately permit state that reduces the number of days children in the state spend in foster care to transfer any federal savings from this reduction to be used for child welfare related training or for any of the cat egories of services now authorized by the promoting safe and stable families program as noted earlier those services are family support family preservation timelimited reunifica tion and adoption promotion and support under hr 4207s 2900 state wishing to transfer funds would have to negotiate w ith hhs the total number of days it expected children in its state to spend in foster care ie its number of placement days the maximum amount of savings that coul d be generated would be th product of any fewer number of placement days and the states per child federal title ive cost of keeping child in foster care state appl ying to hhs for the ability to transfer funds would also need to submit plan detailing how it w ould use any funds generated and assuring that relevant current law child protections would be maintained additional funding authorization sought hr 3409 would increase by 200 million the annual mandatory funding aut horization for the promoting safe and stable families pssf program this would raise the total annual

promote the physical health of children and mothers as well as the social and emotional development of children nd to ensure childrens school readiness depending on the program model these serv ices

effective in improving outcomes for those served as well as reducing costs to government127 at the same time results from many evaluations have shown mixed or effects and researchers caution that home

program title ivb subpart 2 of the social security act st ates are required to spend portion of the federal funds they receive for both family support and family preservation services and the definition of both of these servi ce categories includes improving parenting abilities for example the definition of family preservation services includes services designed to improve parenting skills by reinforcing parents confidence in their strengths and helping them to identify where improvement is needed and to obtain assistance in improving these skills with respect to matters such as child development family budgeting coping with stress health and nutrition130 in addition states must spend portion of their pssf funds on adoption promotion and support and this service category is broa dly defined to include any activity that encourages the adoption of child out of foster care when this is in the childs best interest s 2237 does not propos to amend this program funds provided for family preservation under the pssf program are intended to serve families at high risk of having children enter foster care or who may be reunited with child in foster care in either case these are typically families with an open child welfare case whether the child remains in the home or has been removed to foster care by contrast as implemented by hhs funds provided under captas communitybased grant program may not be used to serve families who have an open child welfare case regardless of whether the child is living at home instead they are intended to reach and serve families before child welfare involvement is needed child welfare workers regularly come into contact with caregivers whose parenting skills they assess as poor131 at the same time federal policy charges child welfare

her home132 it should be surprise then that parent training is widely offered child welfare service with at least one estimate suggesting that annually as many as 800000 fa milies r eceive parent training as child welfare service133 research indicates however that despite its widespread use child welfare agencies frequently do not pay for parent training and possibly as consequence do not often control the kind of training provi ded and that the effectiveness of the training models used has rarely been eval uated or otherwise shown as effective recent nationally representative survey found that in the majority of counties 61 child welfare agencies do not always pay fo r the provision of parent training instead the service is provided and funded by another community organization while acknowledging that research available on eff ective models of parent training for child welfareinvolved families is limited and that this is pa rticularly true where neglect is the reason for the involvement as opposed to physical abuse researchers nonetheless advocate more attention by ch ild welfare agencies to what is known about effective parent traini ng and to implementing those models or at least the principles behind those models they also suggest that single model is unlikely to meet the range of needs among child we lfareinvolved families given the different ages and developmental needs of the ch ildren in these families and because the parenting skills most deficient in family where neglect is the main issue are likely different from those where phy sical abuse or child behavi or is the major reason for child welfare involvement134 infant safe haven s 2237 would require stat receiving certain newly proposed funding related to law enforcement and victims

support infant haven programs to provide way for pare nt to safely relinquish newborn infant at safe haven signated pursuant to state law s 2237 would require state infant safe haven laws to include the following provisions permit parent to anonymously leave newborn baby with medically trained employee of hospital emergency room without criminal or other penalty states would be permitted however to pur sue criminal or othe r penalties if the newborn showed signs of abuse or appeared to have been inten tionally harmed s 2237 would further require that this state in fant safe haven law include mechanism to encourage and permit hospital empl oyee in the receiving hospital to collect information about the medical history of the family subject to the approval of the parent and it must require that immedi ately following the relinquishment law enforcement entities search state and federal missing person databases to ensure the child has not been reported as missing finally the state law would be required to include plan for publicizing the states safe haven law summary analysis of infant safe ven laws in place as of november 2004 suggests that many state laws have similar provisions to those that would be required by s 2237 that analysis showed that safe haven providers are defined in state laws to include variety of settings including hospitals emergency medical services police stations and fire sta tions states have defined range of ages under which an infant may be legally relinquished to sa fe haven provider but most provide limit between three days and one month typi cally these state laws provide for the relinquishing parents anonymity and that abandonment charges may be filed except in cases where child abuse or negl ect is indicated and that the parents relinquishing the baby may not be compe lled to provide personal information or accept information offered and many states require the safe haven provider to ask the parent for family and dical history information lthough in some states the safe haven provider is require d to attempt to give the pa rents information about the legal effects of leaving the infant and in formation about referra l services finally children relinquished to safe haven provider are typically transferred to the custody of child welfare agency which is expected to petition for the termination of the parental rights of the childs birth parent s and to seek an adoptive home for the child some states permit the relinqui shing parent to petition to reclaim his or her parental rights typically within specified

advocates of safe haven laws believe they will reduce the number of infants discarded or abandoned in dangerous places preventing risk to the newborns and possible death eliminating the fear of pros ecution they argue enables desperate birth parent to act in the childs best interest and ensure the childs safety even when the parent does not feel able to personally care for the child others argue that the laws encourage irresponsible behavior and might induce birth parents to simply relinquish the child rather than to seek additional support and rvices by allowing birth parent anonymity they further argue that important medical or other genetic information may be lost forever to the child further they add that these laws might interfere with the parental rights of fathers if they are unaware of the babys birth and subsequent relinquishment138 some practical considerations in implementing the laws have included ensuring public awarene ss of the laws so that pregnant women and their partners know about this option as well as ensuring knowledge of the laws provisions among employees at safe have n providers finally the timing and conduct of termination of parental rights proceedings with regard to children left with safe haven provider may also be an issue children of incarcerated parents s 2237 would authorize funds 25 million for each of fy2008 and fy2009 for the

proposals to change the way federal dedicated child welfare funds are distributed to states presidents child welfare option the presidents fy2009 budget proposes to offer states an alternative method for financing their foster care programs and other child welfare services this proposal was first included in the presid ents fy2003 budget and has been in every successive one as well according to fy2009 budget documen ts the pr oposal is intended to be budget neutral and would give states the option to receive their foster care funding as flexible grant over five years to support continuum of services for families in crisis and children at risk 174 specific legislative language to enact this plan has been introduced however the administration has indicated that under this flexible funding plan states could choose to receive their foster care funding as an annual preestablished grant amount rather than as openended re imbursement of eligible expenses for period of five years the amount of stat annual grant funding during those years would be based on the funding that the st ate would be assumed to receive under the title ive foster care program as it exists in current law over those same five years states could use the grant funds for the fu ll range of child welfare services including foster care payments prevention activities permanency efforts case management administrative activities training for ch ild welfare staff and other similar child welfare activities further the funds coul d be spent on any child without regard to whether this child met the title ive foster care eligibility criteria that are part of the afdcprogram link the administration s proposals would not make any changes to the current title ive adoption assi stance program which also includes this eligibility link at the same time the fy2009 budget documents note that states would be required to uphold child safety protecti ons outlined in the adoption and safe families act agree to maintain existing levels of state investment in child welfare programs and continue to participate in the hhsadministered child and family services reviews to ensure compliance with federal child welfare

for children in foster care may 2004 the full report is available at httppewfostercareorgresearchdocsfina lreportpdf the commission also proposed set of recommendations intended to improve th

foster care cochaired by former representatives gray and frenzel released set of recommendations to restructure the current federal child welfare system177 those recommendations have guided some aspects of introduced bills in this and prior congresses and they remain part of the child welfare financing debate delink payments the commission recommended removing the income eligibility requirements for title ive adoption assistance and foster care maintenance payments now in law as part of the link between the title ive program and the prior law afdc eligib ility requirements dis cussed above and continuing mandatory and openended funding for the program to reduce the federal cost of this expa nded eligibility it further reco mmended that the share of each foster care maintenance or adoption paym ent reimbursed by th federal government be reduced those reimburse ment rates now range from 50 to 83 depending on the states per capita income and the pew commission proposed an even 35 reduction ie new funding matching rate s of roughly 325 to 540 to ensure that the lower reimbursement rates would not result in some states receiving less federal support for adoption subsidies and foster care maintenance payments than under current law the commission also recommended threeyear adjustment period during which states would at min imum receive the same level of funding that would have been available to them before the adjustment of the programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34388crs76 178 the commission proposed that states re ceiving more funding under the proposals expanded eligibility and despite the decreased reimbursement rates would have some of the funding diverted to ensure that state received less federal support alternatively the commission made two other proposals that would have accomplished delink and maintained openended funding but that they expected would cost the federal government some additional dollars the first alternative would have permitted all states to keep any additional funding they received under the pr oposal and would also have permitted states who lost money under the proposal to file supplemental claims during threeyear adjustment period to be paid by the federal government the second alternative would link the program over roughly 17year time frame in the first year the title ive income eligibility limit would be set at 50 of the federal poverty level and would rise 10 percentage points each year by year 16 of the proposals implementation the income eligibility limit would be 200 of poverty and in year 17 all income eligibility criteria would be eliminated further some of the fede ral cost of this delink would be recouped by phasedin reduction of the reimbursement rates totaling 14 percentage points ie reimbursement range of 3569 by year 17 eligibility criteria and the reimbursement rate thus the commission believes this delink proposal would be co st neutral to both the fede ral and state governments178 service case manageme nt and training funds the commission further recommended single safe children strong families grant program be created to provide capped manda tory funding that states w ould not be able to use for foster care maintenance payments but that they could spend on virtually any other child welfare purpose including providing services to children and their families casework support for children and training of child welfare cour t and other relevant personnel the commission recommended that this grant be created by combining the capped funding now available to states under title ivb of the social security act child welfare services and promoting safe and stable families with some of the openended funding now ava ilable under title ive for states to conduct specified administrative and child placement activities the initial grant funding level would be based on the total amount of current f unding for each of these funding streams estimated at about 37 billion at the time of the proposal enhanced by 200 million in the first year for total of about 39 billion the commission proposed that states would receive share of this money based on the share of the total pot of money they receive under current law fu rther the commission proposed that this grant should be indexed so that each state s funding would annually grow by 2 plus the inflation rate consumer price index under current law the federal govern ment provides betw een 50 and 75 of the total eligible program costs for the programs that would be rolled into the safe children and strong families grant the commission recommended adjusting this rate to create single federal matching ra that would ensure state had to provide more of its own funding to receive the same level of federal s upport it estimated that this federal share matching rate would be about 68 finally with regard to other funding currently provide d under title ive the commission recommended that states continue to be able to claim ope nended reimbursement for the developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34388crs77 179 the commission also supported continue d authority for hhs to

every child who is atrisk of being or has been bused or neglected it proposes to do this by amending title ive of the social secu rity act to permit states to use those funds on broader range of purposes and without converting any of the title ive to block grant the partnership calls for expanded federal eligibility for title ive foster care through elimination of the income eligibility criteria delink from afdc it does not propose reduction in reimbursement rates or another mechanism that would limit increased cost from this change to the federal government and it further proposes that any state that safely reduces its foster care caseload should be able to reinvest th federal title ive funds which would otherwise be lost to the stat in services and supports th at prevent abuse or neglect the partnership would further stipulate that any savings in state spending that might accrue because of these changes must be similarly reinvested the partnership further proposes that st ates should be able to use title ive funds to 1 provide postpermanency servi ces to children reunited with their parents placed permanently with relative or dopted and to help older youth who age out of foster care successfully transition to adulthood and 2 provide subsidized guardianship for children placed with gal guardians when neither reuniting with parents nor adoption is appropr iate the proposal also ca lls for direct tribal access to title ive funding and suggests that states be permitted to establish relative specific licensing standards provided those standards cont ain safety protections and criminal background checks for most states the partnership woul d increase the federal matching rate available to states under the title ive program for casework activities including assessment of child and family needs development and refinement of permanency plans recruitment licensing and superv ision of foster and preadoptive parents under current law states may seek federal reimbursement of 50 of the cost of such caseworker activities provided they are incurred on behalf of title ive eligible children which is the general reimbursement rate for title ive program administrative costs the partnership propos to change this matching rate for caseworker activities under the title ive program to the states federal medical assistance percentage fmap which may range from 50 to 83 with states that have higher per capita income receiving lower rates and vice versa181 further the partnership proposes to permit states to us child welfare funds withdrawn penalties or disallowed by the fede ral government to conduct evaluations of promising approaches to achieve safety perman ency and wellbeing for children and implement approaches that have been monstrated to improve these outcomes for childrenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34388crs79 182 states that provide training on these topics may not claim reimbursement for that training under the title ive program at either the 75 training rate or the 50 general administration rate see child welfare policy manual section 81h question 11 and question 8the partnership further proposes to expa nd both the range of topics and the kind of workers for whom states may seek fede ral title ive training support at the 75 reimbursement rate under current law stat may receive reimbursement of training costs at the 75 rate if the topic is related to administering the title ive foster care or adoption assistance program and only on behalf of public employees training topics that are specifically not eligible for title ive reimbursement include those related to providing services including tr aining on how to conduct child abuse and neglect investigation or how to provide treatment or other services related to domestic violence mental health issues or substance abuse among children and families coming into contact with the child welfare agency182 the partnership proposes to permit federal t itle ive reimbursement at the 75 matching rate for any training topic related to ensuring safety permanency and wellbeing for children and further it would permit states to make these claims on behalf of private child welfare agency workers c ourt personnel and other social service agency workers including those with expe rtise in health mental health substance abuse and domestic viol ence related services finally the partnership proposes to enhance accountability by requiring states to report annually on funds spen t on particular services and categories of services the number of children and families served the duration of the services and the number of children and families who are unable to access service for which they are referred five years after the enactment of these reforms the pa

changes in foster care placements 3 recruitment retention and workloads of child welfar workers and 4 improved outcomes for children atrisk of entering or who have entered the child welfare system
