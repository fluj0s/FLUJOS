act related matters the use of the military to execute civilian law summary the posse comitatus act outlaws willful use of any part of the army or air force to execute the law unless expressly authorized by the constitution or an act of congress history supplies the grist for an argument that the constitution prohibits military involvement in civilian affairs subj ect to only limited alterations by congress or the president but the courts do not appear to have ever accepted the argument unless violation of more explicit constitutional command could also be shown the provision for express constitutional authorization when in fact the constitution contains such express authorizations has been explained alternatively as meaningless political face saving devi ce or as an unartful reference to the presidents constitutional powers the express statutory exceptions include the legislation which allows the presiden t to use military force to suppression insurrection 10 usc 331335 and sec tions which permit the department of defense to provide federal state and local police with information and equipment 10 usc 371381 existing case law indicates that execution of the law in violation of the posse comitatus act occurs when the armed forces perform tasks which are assigned not to them but to an organ of civil government or b when the armed forces perform tasks assigned to them solely for purposes of civilian government questions arise most often in the context of assistance to civilian police at least in this context the courts have held that absent recognized exception the posse comitatus act is violated 1 when civilian law enforcement officials make direct active use of military investigators or 2 when the use of the military pervades the activities of the civilian officials or 3 when the military is used so as to subject citizens to the exercise of military power which was regulatory prescriptive or compulsory in nature the act is not violated when the armed forces conduct activities for military purpose which have incidental benefits for civilian law enforcement officials the language of the act mentions only the army and the air force but it is applicable to the navy and marines by virtue of administrative action and commands of other laws the law enforcement f unctions of the coast guard have been expressly authorized by act of congress and consequently ca nnot be said to be contrary to the act the act has been applied to the national guard when it is in federal service to civilian employees of the armed forces and to offduty military personnel the act is probably only applicable with in the geographical confines of the united states but the supplemental provisi ons of 10 usc 371381 appear to apply worldwide finally the act is criminal statute under which there has never been prosecution although violations will on ra re occasions result in the exclusion of evidence the dismissal of criminal charges or civil cause of action as practical matter compliance is ordinarily the result of military selfrestraint this report appears in abridged form as crs report rs20590 the posse comitatus act sketch

touching the business of martial law these things are to be observed first that in truth and reality it is not law but someth ing indulged rather than allowed as law the necessity of government order and discipline in an army is that only which can give those laws countenance secondly this indulged law was only to extend to members of the army or to those of the opposite army and ne ver was so much indulged as intended to be executed or exercised upon others for others were not listed under the army had colour of reason to be bound by military constitutions applicable only to the army whereof they were not parts but they were to be ordere d and governed according to the laws to which they were subject though it were time of war thirdly that the exercise of martial law whereby any person should lose his life or member or liberty may not be permitted in time of peace when the kings courts are open for ll persons to receive justice according to the laws of the land this is the substance declared by petition of right 3 car i whereby such commissions and martial law were repealed and declared to be contrary to law i blackstone commentaries on the laws of england 400 1765for martial law which is build upon settled principles but is tirely arbitrary in its decisions is as sirking charles i preparing for military expedition in france had quartered his troops in homes along the southern english coastline5 rioting resulted and the participants both military nd civilian were tried nd punished by commissioners operating under the authority of martial law offended by this peacetime exercise of military judicial authority over civilians parliament sought and was granted the petition of right of 1628 which outlawe d both quartering and martial law commissions6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95964crs4 matthew hale observes in truth and reality law but something indulged rather than allowed as law the necessity of order and di scipline in an army is the only thing which can give it countenance and therefore it ought not to be permitted in time of peace when the kings courts are open for all persons to receive justice according to the laws of the land and it is laid down that if lieutenant or other that hath commission of martial authority doth in time of peace hang or otherwis execute any one by colour of martial law this is murder for it is against the magna carta and the petition of right enacts that soldier shall be quartered on the subject w ithout his own consent and that commission shall issue to proceed within this land accordin g to martial law and whereas after the restoration king charles the second kept up bout five thousand regular troops by his own authority for guards and garrisons which king james the second by degrees increased to less than thirty thousand all paid from his own civil list it was made one of the articles of the bill of rights that the raising or keep ing of standing army within the kingdom in time of peace unless it be with the consent of the parliament is against the law 7 z obel the boston massacre 135 1987 the soldiers one ought always to remember went into boston not as an occupy ing army but rather as force of uniformed peacekeepers or policemen their role as ev the radicals conceived it was to assist the executive and if necessary the courts to maintain order engdahl soldiers riots and revolution the law and history of military troops in civil disorders 57 i owa law review 1245 1971 the last die was cast when two regiments of troops were quartered in boston at the end of the decade bost on was hotbed of col onial discontent the assemblage of military troops for control of possible disorders aggravated the discontent not only because it affronted the english trad ition against domestic use of military troops but also because it was without warrant in the charter of massachusetts bay the unwelcome troops were frequently taunted and vilified and the ultimate and inevitable outrage soon occurred crowd of angry bostoni ans blocked the path of detachment of soldiers marching to their post the sold iers made ready to force their passage but were ordered back to the main guard the crow d approached the main guard with angry and opprobrious taunts sentinel struck one par ticularly bothersome boy with the butt of his musket and quickly crowd converged on that spot throwing snowballs and rocks at the sentinel along with verbal threats on his life the sentinel loaded his musket and waved it at the mob squad of soldiers were sent to his aid the soldiers soon joined by colonel loaded their muskets as the crowd hooted and jeered and berated them and dared them to shoot they kept the crowd back time with ba yonets but then suddenly fired it was neverwhen in the following century the british responded to colonial unrest by quartering troops in boston the colonists saw it as breach of this fundamental promise of english law their circumstances however were not exactly identical to those surrounding the petition of right first the question arose in the colonies england had stationed troops in the colonies to protect them against the french and indians and had opted for military governorsh ips in other territories second there was military usurpation of judicial functions the colonists remained subject to civil rather than military justice and soldiers who employed more force than civilian law permitted were themselves subject to civilian justice as the trials of the soldiers involved in the boston massacre demonstrates on the other hand the troops involved in the boston massacre were stationed in massachusetts not for protection against marauding invader as they had been in the french and indian wars not to accomplish the transition between civil governments within conquered territory as they had been after the french lost canada to the british as consequence of those conflicts but as an independent military force quartered among disgr untled civilian population to police it7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95964crs5 made clear it never is whether they had fi red on their officers order or upon their own compulsion in any event five americans dead and several others seriously wounded members of distrusted standing army whose quartering was in violation of the petition of right and whose preparation to milita rily suppress possible civil disorder was inconsistent with the oldest of englands own traditions had slain english civilians in time of peace 8 this last charge presumably refers to the results of the murder trials of the officer and soldiers involved in the boston massacre two of the soldiers were convicted of manslaughter branded on the hand and released the officer and the other soldiers were acquitted

declaration of independence listed among our grievances ag ainst great britain that the king had kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislatures had affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power and had quartered larg bodies of armed troops among us protecting them by mock trial from puni shment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states8 the articles of confederation addresse d the threat of military intrusion into civilian affairs by demanding that the armed forces assemb led during peacetime be more numerous than absolutely necessary for the common defense by entrusting control to civil authorities within the states and by preference for the farmer in arms as member of the militia over the standing professional army9 the constitution continued these themes albeit with greater authority vested in the federal government it provided that civilian the president should be

common law to call upon the posse co mitatus14 in the beginning the two were comparable but unrelated even though congress empowered the president to call out the militia to overcome obstructions to law enforcement it continued to vest th federal equivalent of the sheriff the federal marshal with the power to call forth the posse comitatus in performance of his duties15 in some cases when it passed particular statute congress specifically authorized recourse to the posse comitatus for its enforcement under the fugitive slave act for instance owners whose sl aves had escaped to another

validity of use troops to quell rioters in london the duke of richmond began with observing that he was much pleased with the speech he heard that day from the throne he hoped before he should agree to the address that minister s would give him satisfaction in another point he meant in the continuing on foot of milita ry government lord mansfield for some time argued several points after which hi s lordship went on it appears most clearly to that every man may legally interfere to suppress riot much more to prevent acts of felony treason and rebellion in his pr ivate capacity but he is bound to do it as an act of duty and if called upon by magistrate is punishable in case of refusal private man if he sees person committing an unlawful act more particularly an act amounting to violent breach of the peace felony or trea may apprehend the offender and in his attempt to apprehend him may use force to compel him not to submit to him but to the law what private man may do magistrate or peace officer may clearly undertake and according to the necessity of the case aris ing from the danger to be apprehended any number of men assembled or called together for the purpose are justified to perform this doctrine i take to be clear and indisputable with all the possible consequences which can flow from it and to be the true foundation for calling in of the military power to assist in quelling the late riots the persons who assisted in the suppr ession of those riots and tumults in contemplation of law are to be considered as mere private individuals acting according to law and upon any abuse of the legal power with which they are invested are amendable to the laws of their country for instance suppos ing soldier or any other military person who acted in the course of the late riots had exceeded the powers with which he was invested i have not single doubt but he is liable to be tried and punished not by martial law but by the common and statute law of th realm consequently the false idea that we are living under military government or that the m ilitary have any more power or other power since the commencement of the riots is the point which i rose to refute and on that ground to remove those idle and illfounded appreh ensions that any part of the laws or the constitution are either suspended or have been dispensed with on the whole my lords while i deprecate and sincerely lament the ca use which rendered it indispensably necessary to call out the military to assist in the suppre ssion of the late disturbances i am clearly of the opinion that steps have been taken whic h were not strictly legal as well as fully justifiable in point of policy the military have been called in and very wisely called in not as soldiers but as citizens matter whether their coats be red or brown they have been called in aid of the laws not to subvert them or overturn the constitution but to preserve both xxi h ansard the parliamentary history of england

comitatus act raises at least three constitutional questions 1 to what extent does the posse comitatus act track constitutional requirements beyond the power of the president or congress to adju st or ignore 2 to what extent do the powers which the constitution vests in the president limit the power of congress to enact the posse comitatus act or any other provision restricting the presidents

needed military housing must be authorized by congress it also was expressly left to c ongress to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union suppress insurr ections and repel invasions such limitation on the command power written at time when the militia rather than standing army was contemplated as the military weapon of the republic underscores the constitutions policy that congress not the ex ecutive should control utilization of the war power as an instrument of domestic policy congress fulfilling that function has authorized the president to use the army

principle which was incorporated by the house in the bill in refe rence to the use of the army in time of peace the senate had already conceded what they called and what we might accept as principle but they had stricken out the penalty and had st ricken out the word expressly so that the army might be used in all cases where implied authority might be inferred the house committee planted themselves firmly upon th doctrine that rather than yield this fundamental principle for which for three ye ars this house had struggled they would all the bill to fail notwithstanding the reforms wh ich we had secured regarding these reforms as of but little consequence alongside the great principle in all its length and breadth including the penalty which the senate had st ricken out we bring

and in the seve nth line the words the constitution or by were inserted so as to read by the constitution or by act of congress and the penalty was stricken form the bill we found considerable difficult in agreeing upon this section but the modification which the senate had made in it made it possible to come to an understanding i should like to say here that it is my firm judgment after the experience of the last forty eight hours that unless the senate had made the duty easy for the committee by the modification which it made in that section it would have been impossible to have come to any agreement on the army bill with the original house section in controversy i am satisfied it never would have been stricken from the bill as it now stands the house yielded that the words under the pretext of s hould go out which we contended were in the autre of reflection upon the past administ ration of the government and we could not consent that anything in the nature of re flection and which was entirely useless for any practical purpose should remain in the bill we satisfied them by our argument that ought to be done and it was stricken out with reference to the word expressly we restored it and allowed it to go in so that now the employment of such force must be expressly authorized by the constitution or by act of congress they assenting that the word s the constitution or by before the words act of congress might remain in so that if the power arises under either the constitution or the laws it may be exercised and the executive would not be embarrassed by the prohibition of congress so to act where the constitution requires him to act and the embarrassments would not have the effect of retraining the action of an upright and energetic executive but still might raise question which he would desire to avoid if possible the penalty remains in the section as agreed upon except that we procured that the word willfully should be put in before the word violating so that it reads and any person willfully violating the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of misdemeanor 7 congrec 4648 1878 remarks of sensargent 44 lieber the use of the

impermissible effort to limit the powers of the president44 the regulations covering the use of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95964crs19 attempt was made to strike out the word expressly but that failed but manifestly the clause as enacted recognizes the constituti on as direct source of authority for the employment of the army this is very impor tant consideration in the construction of the legislation and another matter of great importa nce is also to be observed with reference to it the enactment prescribes that it shall be unlawful to employ any part of the army as posse comitatus or otherwise for the purpose of executing the laws except when it is expressly authorized by the constitution or by act of congress now it is evident that the word expressly can not be construed as pl

cases and circumstances with more narrowly crafted legi slation thus it has vested the coast guard branch of the armed forces with broad law enforcement responsibilities47 second over time it has

department of justice that the weight of authority on the posse comitatus act prohibits the use of miliary personnel as informants undercover agents or noncustodial interrogators in civilian criminal investigation that does not involve potential military defendants or is not intended to lead to any official action by the armed forces when military personnel become aware of violations of civilian laws as an incidental result of other military operations such information may be voluntarily disclosed examples of this type of information sharin g include situations such as investigations of military and nonmilitary coconspirators and the observation by military personnel of illegal conduct during routine military mission or training operation the committee anticipates however that an increased sensitivity to the needs of civilian law enforcement officials particul arly in drug enforcement will permit more compatible mission planning and execution fo r example the scheduling of routine training missions can easily accommodate the need for improved intelligence information concerning drug trafficking in the caribbean the comm ittee does not intend the military to engage in

exists nexus between drug sales off base by civilians to military personnel and the military base at which the purchasers are stationed hence the prosecution has the duty to present evidence to show that when military investigation was undertaken the targeted drug transactions involved military personnel or were connected to sales conducted on military installation 854 p2d at 1369 emphasis of the

that the military has valid interest in ferreting out those who supply drugs to military personnel does not automatically qualify its aid to civilian drug law enforcement as having the primary purpose of furthering military function 80 moon v state 785 p2d 45 48 alaska app 1990it seems to us that the army had valid military purpose in preventing illicit drug transactions involving active duty

prosecution and that case before lacked the elements whic h had lead to the adoption of the fourth amendment exclusionary rule finally the court felt the use of the marines had been aberrational that subsequent similar transgressions were unlikely and that the regulation would be amende d to provide an enforcement component but the court warned should there be eviden ce of widespread or repeated

back to the united states for trial violated the posse comitatus act and vitiated the jurisdiction of american courts to try them ordinarily criminal trials are not barred simply because the defendant was unlawfully seized and carried into the jurisdiction of the trial court116 there are indications that the same rule applies when the defendant challenges thecourts jurisdiction on the gr ounds of posse comitatus act violations in the early posse comitatus cases the defendants argume nts were further undermined by the fact that the countries from which they were returned germany and japan were under american military rule at the time 117 in later cases some of which began beyond the territorial confines of the united states lthough none in occupied territory the

civilian demonstrations near the military installationnoted that dismissal would not be an appropriate remedy for posse comitatus violation118 defendants have found the act more helpful in prosecutions where the government must establish th lawfulness of its conduct as one of the elements of the offense charged thus several defendant s at wounded knee were able to persuade the court that evidence of possible posse comitatus act violations precluded their convictions for obstructing law enforcemen t officials lawfully engaged in the performance of their duties119 civil liability almost decade ago the eighth circuit found that violation of the act might constitute an unreasonable search and seizure for purposes of the fourth amendment thereby giving rise to bivens cause of action against ffending federal officers or employees120 posse comitatus act violation however also provides the government with defense to claim unde r the federal tort claims act since the government is not liable under that act for injuries inflicted by federal officers or employees acting outside the scope of their authority121 on balance however the posse comitatus act is only rarely placed in issue in civil cases compliance the most significant impact of the posse comitatus act is attributable to compliance by the armed forces as administrative adoption of the act for the navy and marines demonstrates the military has long standing practice of avoiding involvement in civilian ffairs which it believes ar contrary to the act122httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95964crs51 restraints on
