grow more than 250 types of fruit ve getable tree nut flower ornamental nursery and turfgrass crops in addition to the major bulk commodity crops1 in 2006 specialty crop production accounted for 533 billion or 44 of total us crop receipts 22 of total receipts for crops and livestock2 the us department of agriculture usda traditionally has not subsidized specialty crops as it has bulk commodities such as wheat feed grains soybeans cotton rice dairy peanuts tobacco and others about two dozen commodities in all often referred to as program commodities nonetheless over several decades congress has authorized wide range of programsespecially crop insurance and marketing ordersintended to facilitate the growth and benefit the economic health of the specialty crop sector relatedly when congress gave commodity program producers planting flexibility in the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 pl 104 127 the 1996 farm act it included provision prohibiting them from planting fruit and vegetable crops on program acres congress renewed this provision in the 2002 farm act pl 107171 government programs affecting the sector are not limited to usda the department of commerce and the us international trade commission are the agencies to which specialty crop growers can turn for assistance if they suspect that foreign countries are selling their products in the united states at less than fair value practice called dumping the food and drug administration fda within the department of health and human services is responsible for assuring the safety of specialty crops for human consumption and the environmental protection agency epa regulates the safety of pesticides used on specialty crops and sets tolerances for permissible residues which are enforced by fda the department of labor administers programs that help provide the workforce growers need to harvest major specialty crops at certain times of year regulate working conditions and

risk management agency administers the federal crop insurance program which congress reformed most recently in pl 106224 the agriculture risk protection act of 2000 approved private insurance companies sell and completely service the policies but usda reinsures potential losses and either fully or partially compensates the companies for any losses incurred about 50 specialty crops currently are covered but availability of coverage varies by region eligible producers can receive catastrophic insurance which is basically free except for an administrative fee producers can buy up their level of coverage beyond the catastrophic level and pay premium that is subsidized by the federal government revenue insurance which makes indemnity payments for income lost either from poor production or low market prices also is available to producers of certain crops in some areas such insurance provides an indemnity payment when actual revenue falls below target level of revenue the 2000 farm law set the subsidy rate for revenue insurance at the same level as for traditional crop insurance usda decides which crops in which geographical areas will be covered by which types of insurance the decision is made on cropbycr op and countybycounty basis based on farmer demand for coverage and the level of risk associated with the crop in the region among other factors the rma frequently offers pilot programs offering various types of coverage for new crops particularly specialty crops or new geographical areas it uses the performance of these programs to inform its decision on whether to extend coverage permanently annual usda appropriations acts provide funding for rma salaries and expenses to operate the program it receives such sums as are necessary for premium subsidy and program losses and expenses which makes it mandatory program producers of any commercial crops that are not insurable under the federal crop insurance program are potentially eligible for direct payments up to 100000 per person under usdas noninsured assistance program nap 3 the farm service agency in usda administers this program which has permanent authority under the federal crop insurance reform act of 1994 pl 103354 as amended specialty crops currently eligible for the nap include mushrooms flowers ornamental nursery crops christmas trees turfgrass sod and ginseng an individual producer is ineligible if his gross revenues from the qualifying crop exceed 2 million nap is not subject to annual appropriations but rather is mandatory program that receives such sums as necessary through usdas commodity credit corporation ccc which has line of credit with the us treasury for losses associated with the 2006 crop year usda estimates that it made 117 million in nap payments for more information on these programs see crs report rs21212 agricultural disaster assistance 3 the regulatory definition of an napeligible crop is one for which catastrophic coverage is not available and which is commercially produced for food or fiber as specified in the regulations the term also includes floriculture ornamental nursery christmas tree crops turfgrass sod seed crops aquaculture including ornamental fish and industrial crops

vegetables commission merchants dealers and brokers handling perishable agricultural commodities in interstate and foreign commerce must obtain paca license and abide by the fair trading practices spelled out in the act traders who violate the act face license suspension or revocation in 1984 congress amended paca to create statutory trust consisting of buyers business related assets in the event buyer fails to make full payment due to bankruptcy for example fruit and vegetable sellers can recover money owed to them before trust assets are made available to general creditors paca also

authorizes ams to facilitate and oversee the operation of marketing orders and agreements producers and handlers in specific growing area generally initiate the administrative process leading to the establishment of an order or an agreement once twothirds majority of the parties in that area approves marketing order by referendum the order is binding on all growers and handlers in that area in contrast marketing agreement is binding only on growers and handlers who are voluntary signatories to the agreement currently there are 30 active marketing orders and agreements covering specified fruit vegetable and tree nut crops list is available at httpwwwamsusdagovfv marketing orders and agreements are managed by administrative committees made up of local growers and handlers who are operating under them ams publishes the proposed and final regulations in the federal register and they are mandatory for marketing the covered commodity these regulations may include quality standards quantity controls commodity promotion and packaging standards among other things the activities of marketing orders and agreements are financed by assessment fees commonly called checkoff fees collected from handlers usually at time of sale to administer the orders and assure that they operate legally and in the public interest ams uses funds provided through annual usda appropriations acts

promotion programs are requested and funded by members of particular specialty crop industry ams currently oversees eight such programs cultivated blueberries hass avocados honey mangoes mushrooms peanuts popcorn potatoes and watermelon national boards appointed by the secretary administer them the boards may be composed of producers handlers importers and processors depending on which industry members have agreed to pay assessments to support the program the national boards collect the 5 marketing orders and research and promotion programs for certain fruit and vegetable crops have come under legal challenge from producers who have questioned their constitutionality visávis the first amendment in 1997 the supreme court ruled that using checkoff funds for p each and nectarine promotion under marketing order was constitutional in 2001 however the supreme court ruled that mandatory assessments for advertising under mushroom checkoff were unconstitutional the supreme court is

responsibility covers all food domestically produced and imported excluding meat poultry and certain egg products which are under usdas jurisdiction under the authority of the federal food dr ug and cosmetics act ffdca 21 usc 301 et seq the fda provides guidance to the food industry on the best practices to assure food safety and sets certain requirements through regulations to monitor adherence to guidelines and regulations the agency is authorized to inspect factories warehouses and establishments where foods are manufactured processed packed or held and vehicles transporting foods at current levels of funding and staffing fda inspects each establishment under its jurisdiction about once every five years fda has limited authority to detain food products during investigations of possible violations and must approach the justice department to initiate injunctions seizures or prosecutions fda does not have the authority to issue mandatory recalls of suspected contaminated foods it relies on the individual firm to issue recall voluntarily if fda officials recommend it fda has direct authority to review and approve food additives before manufacturers can use them in processing in order to assure that they meet ffdca standards for being safe for consumption at the intended level of use fda also is responsible for enforcing epaset standards for permissible pesticides and pesticide residues in or on foods through inspections and testing although fda also has responsibility for ensuring the safety of imported food including imported produce traditionally the agency has

firms exporting food to the united states to give fda prior notification of the exact time location and contents of incoming shipments the agency achieved full implemen tation and enforcement of the new policies in 2005 increased information on shippers and shipment contents is intended to improve fdas ability to allocate resources for inspecting food imports more efficiently but the new regulations generally are not expected to affect the overall percentage being inspected food safety is critical issue for the specialty crop industry as consumers increasingly are recognizing the importance of fruit and vegetable consumption to long term health and proper weight maintenance nonetheless the nature of production handling and preparation makes produce vulnerable to contamination from wide variety of sources the fact that produce often is consumed raw contributes to its potential as source of foodborne illness the fda reports that from 1998 to 2004 40 foodborne illness outbreaks were associated with fresh producedouble the number occurring in the early 1990s the agency attributes the increase in part to the growth in consumer preference for fresh precut produce as well as the widespread use of such products in fastfood restaurants some of the more recent outbreaks have been attributed to leafy greens alfalfa and clover sprouts tomatoes and green onions32 after foodborne illness outbreaks related to fresh produce in 2003 and 2004 fda issued proposed action plan to address produce contamination and held public meeting in june 2004 the revised plan was published in october 2004 33 this effort built upon actions fda took in the late 1990s under the clinton administrations initiative to ensure the safety of imported and domestic fruits and vegetables under the earlier initiative fda produced the guide to minimize microbial food safety hazards for fresh fruits and vegetables in 1998 this was followed by special guidance to prevent contamination of sprouted alfalfa seeds and other types of sprouts in 1999 and by regulations to require preventive steps against fresh fruit juice contamination in 2002 34 the 2004 action plan includes 40 steps that the produce industry may take under fda guidance in the areas of operating procedures and regulations educational outreach response to incidents of contaminat ion improved communication among
