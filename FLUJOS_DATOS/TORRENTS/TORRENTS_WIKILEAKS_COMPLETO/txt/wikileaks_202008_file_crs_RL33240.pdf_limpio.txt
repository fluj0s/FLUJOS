programs have focused primarily on developing kinetic energy interceptors to destroy attacking ballistic missiles these efforts have evolved over 30 years and have produced signif icant amount of test data from which much can be learned this report provides broad overview of the us investment in this approach to bmd the data on the us flight test effort to develop national missile defense nmd system remains mixed and ambiguous there is recognizable pattern to explain this record nor is there conclusive evidence of learning curve over more than two decades of developmental testing in addition the test scenarios are considered by some not to be operational tests and could be more realistic in nature they see these tests as more of laboratory or developmental effort success and failure rates and their technical causes have shown relative consistency through this period the us flight test effort to develop theater missile defense tmd systems appears more promising in relative terms developmental and operational testing of tmd systems has been more successful than the nmd effort nonetheless tmd systems that evolved from mature existing ground and seabased airdefense systems have demonstrated greater test success than other tmd programs how effective has the us investment been in developing kinetic energy bmd systems observers could make any number of arguments as to what the record means and what could be done to improve the effectiveness of systems under development and of those deployed some observers have suggested that the 110 th congress might review the us

develop and deploy ballistic missile defenses bmd based on the concept of hittokill or kinetic energy kill1 began three decades ago2 this effort gained momentum as the primary focus of the us bmd program in the mid1980s with the announcement of president reagans strategic defense initiative sdi3 since that time the united states has pursued numerous major kinetic energy bmd programs th have produced hundreds of various flight test results these test results and some very limited operational experience in wartime provide sufficient data for at least some conclusions regarding the decadeslong us investment in hitto kill as concept for bmd this overview report examines the us investment in that concept what that investment has produced and raises various questions that might be considered the development of bmd has shown important technological differences between efforts designed to attack and destroy short or mediumrange ballistic missiles and those designed for longrange or intercontinental ballistic missiles 4 therefore this report will review and distinguish between the program results of theater missile defense tmd and national missile defense nmd crs received historical flight test data5 from the missile defense agency mda in june 20056 it is important to note that for each of these flight tests there were various primary and multiple secondary objectives 7 such flight tests are inherently complex and relatively costly therefore multiple test objectives are designed to maximize the potential benefit derived from each flight test the determination as to whether each of these objectives was reached was made by each relevant agency or military branch all of the references to flight test results in this report are 1 kinetic energy kill interceptors seek to destroy targets through direct collision at high speeds the force of the impact destroys the attacking missile or warhead renders it in operable or diverts it from its intended target with such an approach nearmiss has the same effect as large miss distance the targeted warhead or missile is not destroyed from its beginnings kinetic energy kill concepts held the promise of destroying attacking missiles without the potential collateral effects of nuclear weapons explosions inherent in earlier bmd concepts and deployed systems 2 during the 1960s and early 1970s the united states developed and tested nuclear bmd interceptor capability this system was deployed in north dakota for short time in 19751976 this system was dismantled for many reasons including congressional and military concerns over its cost ineffectiveness in the face of potentially massive nuclear attack concerns over the adverse effects that nuclear detonations would have on nearby ground based bmd radars and growing support for agreed upon limitations of us and soviet l ongrange nuclear arsenals in the fy1976 defense budget the army initiated program to examine alternatives to nuclear bmd couple years later this effort led to the first specific kinetic energy program that sought to avoid the problems of nuclear effects on groundbased bmd interceptors by seeking to place guidance and other sensors on nonnuclear missile interceptor itself 3 on march 23 1983 president reagan delivered policy address announcing the establishment of the strategic defense initiative sdi or what was quickly dubbed by others the star wars program in his speech the president expressed his vision that the nations scientists could develop the means of rendering nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete various contemporary and historical accounts confirm that the president intended the development of us bmd to be nonnuclear as well initial funding for the sdi program began in fy1985 4 for instance some of the technological challenges are different because of where the final engagement occurs within the atmosphere or in space and because the closing velocities of these engagements can vary significantly between shorter and longer range attacking missiles 5 there are any number of tests on systems subsystems and components prior to any flight test of the actual missile and interceptor itself preflight test data are not included as part of this report 6 mda congressional research service inquiry flight test results june 21 2005 for official use only 7 for illustration an intercept flight test might have as primary objectives to 1 demonstrate integration of system elements 2 demonstrate sens or operations and 3 dem onstrate kill vehicle performance intercept the target secondary objectives might include 1 demonstrate test monitoring 2 provide risk reduction for future tests and 3 collect data for model verification most primary and secondary objectives could be met even if the intercept objective failed for instance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33240g13g146g151g142g157g146g140g561g7g151g142g155g144g162g561g13g146g149g149g561g143g152g155g561g4g138g149g149

concept has produced mixed and ambiguous results the actual performance in wartime of one kineticenergy system currently deployed by the united states ie the patriot pac3 is similarly ambiguous further it is not yet possible to assess the operational effectiveness the other deployed system ie the national defense system against longrange ballistic missile threats

interceptor longrange bmd or nmd programs since the early 1980s homing overla experiment hoe exoatmospheric reentry interceptor subsystem eris national missile defense nmd and groundbased midcourse defense gmd each of these is briefly discussed below the army developed hoe in the late 1970s and early 1980s to test the viability of the emerging hittokill concept it conducted four intercept flight tests in 1983 and 1984 three of the tests failed to intercept the intended target 8 but the fourth was considered success the army did not identify any secondary flight test objectives n onetheless the nascent sdi program then viewed the single reported success as evidence of the promise of nonnuclear bmd interceptor technologies the technologies tested in hoe served as the basis for its successor program eris eris went through lengthy development program before flight testing began in 1991 with the first of four intercept flight tests although the first was cons idered successful intercept of the target the following three intercept attempts through 1992 failed to destroy their intended targets 9 even so officials concluded that half of the primary and secondary test flight objectives were accomplished and that the primary bmd concept being pursued held significant promise the nmd program followed eris with series of eight flight tests from 1997 to 2001 the first three were planned flyby tests there were intercept attempt objectives the first one failed to launch however the other two were deemed successful in their primary objectives secondary objectives were identified of the five planned intercept attempts three reportedly intercepted their intended targets one ended in failure because the interceptor kill vehicle did not deploy and the other failed because the onboard sensors designed to track and intercept the target failed officials concluded that 17 of the 20 primary objectives were met or partially met and all the secondary objectives by the planned intercept tests were met 8 two failed tests were deemed failures because of hardware related problems the other intercept flight test reportedly failed due to software errors in the onboard computer 9 each of the three failures was due to different reason the interceptor failed to launch the target failed to launch and the third attempt missed its intended target

2002 since that time six flight tests have taken place five of these flight tests were planned intercept attempts with three resulting in failure to intercept10 officials concluded that about 80 of the programs 40 or so primary intercept flight test objectives were met all the secondary objectives were met fully or partially in 2004 the gmd undertook new configuration with different booster and interceptor it flew successful integration flig ht test nonintercept test in early 2004 with all primary and secondary objectives met this system was deployed in alaska and california in 2004 and declared operational after eight missiles were placed in silos subsequently two planned intercept flight tests in december 2004 and february 2005 failed to launch the currently deployed system thus remains to be tested successfully against targets it might be expected to intercept in september 2006 successful flight test exercise of the gmd system too place although not primary objective of the data collection test an intercept of the target warhead was achieved flight tests whose primary objectives are intercepts were scheduled for later in 2006 but have been delayed into 2007 each of the four nmd programs were different but they built on the limited successes of their predecessors of the eighteen or so attempted intercepts since the early 1980s seven of them were considered successful or roughly 39 intercept rate in tests officials cited several reasons including program hardware and software as well as interceptor silo and target launch failures 11 from that there do not appear to be any recognizable patterns that emerge to account for the mostly unsuccessful history of the effort nor is there conclusive evidence of learning curve such as increased success over time relative to the first tests of the concept 20 years ago program supporters can point to limited evidence that under controlled conditions there is reason to support the contention that kinetic energy interceptor technology for use against longrange ballistic missiles holds promise critics of the flight test effort to date 12 whether they support missile defense or not in general can raise questions about the success rate and the realism of the testing effort given generation of us investment in its development can kinetic energy interceptor technologies for use against longrange ballistic missiles be developed successfully and deployed as an effective part of the us military posture the answer appears to be ambiguous at this juncture can the nowdeployed nmd system protect the united states from longrange ballistic missile attacks currently there is insufficient empirical data to support clear answer 10 in one test the kill vehicle did not separate from the booster rocket in the other two launch attempts the ground based interceptor did not launch once because of software problem and more recently because of problem with the missile silo 11 although the causes of failures are varied ie they include hardware software and interceptor and target launch problems and do not necessarily suggest any systemic causes such as system integration some might suggest that quality control throughout the manufacturing systems integra tion and test preparation process could be common root cause 12 on occasion private organizations and others such as the government acc ountability office gao have released analyses of some of these tests sometimes they drew si milar conclusions as those provided by the missile defense agency on other occasions they took issue with the flight test results although many consider these efforts useful and constructive because such studies lack common framework for analysis and also do not examine all of the tests cited their potential significance or meaning for the overall 30year research effort is unclear for instance see gao bmd information on theater high altitude area defense thaad and other theater missile defense systems gaonsiad94167

feasibility of lower atmosphere intercepts five of these flight tests were planned intercept attempts from the data provided by mda all the primary and secondary test objectives in the series were achieved the targets included stationary targets in the atmosphere and an air launched target only one target however was shortrange missile the degree to which any conclusions might be drawn regarding very shortrange hittokill in this effort is therefore limited building on the srhit effort the armys erint flight test program 19921994 conducted five flight tests three of these were planned intercepts two of these three flight tests successfully intercepted their targets the failure cited was hardware related despite the missed intercept the army concluded that all of its primary test objectives for the three tests were met fully or partially and that all but one of the 26 secondary objectives in the three tests were met as far as the two nonintercept flight tests were concerned the army determined that all of its primary and secondary flight test objectives were met the navy developed its own indigenous leap program which flight tested from 19921995 three nonintercept flight tests achieved all primary and secondary objectives of the five planned intercept tests only the second was considered successful intercept however failures were due to various hardware software and launch problems even so the navy determined that it achieved about 82 of its primary objectives 18 of 22 and all of its secondary objectives in these tests building on some of its previous efforts in srhit and erint the armys thaad program nevertheless experienced significant challenges from 1995 to 1999 after three relatively successful nonintercept flight tests almost all of the primary and secondary test objectives were partially or fully met thaad failed to intercept in seven of its nine planned attempts however the thaad intercept flight test program met about half of its primary and secondary objectives because the last two intercepts were successful the last being in 1999 the department of defense and congress agreed to further develop but revamp the thaad

antitactical capability 1991 desert storm performance remains controversial after the war patriot improvements for missile defense were widely supported testing of the patriot pac3 with kinetic energy interceptor began in 1997 after the initial two successful nonintercept flight tests most of the objectives were met the patriot pac3 attempted 27 intercept tests of which 21 about 78 were considered successful intercepts additionally some 92 of the primary intercept test objectives were met as well as almost all of the known sec ondary objectives in terms of actual wartime use the patriot pac3 was used in operation iraqi freedom oif in 2003 but its role was very limited four missiles fired in two successful engagements and thus while suggestive of significant promise its operational effectiveness remains uncertain based on limited empirical data 15 building on its previous efforts as well16 the navy as of mid2005 had conducted six of seven successful intercept tests of its aegis bmd or navy seabased program using the standard missile3 sm3 block 1 missile 2002200517 the most recent test included in the data sheets provided to crs was against warhead target that separated from the booster rocket itself in contrast to earlier intercept tests against scudtype ballistic missiles the most recent flight test intercept attempt in december 2006 was not completed due to technical problems aboard the aegis cruiser involved prior to the launch of the two interceptor missiles themselves primarily because of the patriot pac3 flight test and operational record and the more recent navy bmd program the concept of hittokill for tmd appears promising older tmd efforts were not as suggestive and the foundation fo r the current thaad program is based mostly on prior test failures nonetheless because there is flight test data yet on the current thaad program nothing conclusive can be said about its potential future for success and although the patriot pac3 shows promise some might note that the patriot system itself has been evolving for about 40 years now additionally much of the navy infrastructure and technology supporting the aegis sm3 is decades old and is comparable in evolution to the patriot air and missile defense system g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 central question might be at this stage how well is the united states doing in developing effective ballistic missile defenses based on this kinetic energy kill concept since the announcement of the sdi program in the mid1980s the united states has spent about 100 billion on missile defense with primary focus on the kinetic energy or hittokill concept us programs began looking at that concept decade earlier into the mid1970s 15 nine iraqi ballistic missiles were target ed by patriot another six were launched but not targeted by patriot because they were projected to land in areas that would not cause harm the missiles that iraq fired in 2003 were slower flying and of shorter range than those fired in 1991 the defense department concluded that the patriot system successfully intercepted all nine missiles it targeted seven of the inte rcepts however were made with the older patriot pac2 system which still used proximity warhead to destroy its target while the remaining two were intercepted by the newer pac3 one iraqi cruise missile reportedly eluded the patriot radar and hit sea wall in kuwait city and the patriot system was also involved in three friendly fire inci dents that resulted in the loss of us and british aircraft 16 the navy program has evolved over several decades from seabased air defense and cruise missile defense capability to include ballistic missile defense 17 seabased missile defense hit to kill intercept achiev ed news release

striving to do has indeed proven to be challenging but that progress is being made furthermore success measured in terms of operationally effective deployed bmd systems based on this concept loom on the horizon they could also argue that threats posed from the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction wmd must be addressed by developing effective bmd systems supporters and skeptics could argue the need for an independent comprehensive evaluation of the test record to determine whether any systemic or conceptual challenges are impeding the us effort although some defense officials have provided testimony and private and government agencies have looked in detail at few of these tests some might argue that comprehensive and independent review of the entire record to date has not been undertaken and is warranted18 other observers might argue that alternatives should be pursued as hedge against the possible failure of this concept for either nmd or tmd such alternatives could be military in nature such as reducing the emphasis on bmd in favor of increased emphasis on counterforce ie attacking and destroying enemy missile systems before their missile could be launched alternatives also could focus on other ways to mitigate ballistic missile proliferation eg arms control some alternatives such as return to nuclear bmd concepts or emphasis toward more exotic technologies eg lasers or weapons in space might face opposition on political or technical grounds still other observers could argue that in general the united states needs to make more concerted effort to increase developmental testing across the board before these systems are ready for more realistic testing regimes they could argue that almo st all the testing to date is of developmental nature and that an operational testing regimen has not been developed but remains essential only then they could argue could assessments to confirm the validity of the hittokill concept for bmd be made with confidence g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 steven hildreth specialist in missile defense shildrethcrslocgov
