considered vital to us interests1 us concerns regarding pakistan include regional and global terrorism afghan stability democratization and human rights protection the ongoing kashmir problem and pakistanindia tensions and economic development in the region progress in this latter area has been severely threatened in 2008 by sharp decline in pakistans economic stability culminating in an immediate need for capital assistance us officials and independent analysts are increasingly concerned that failing pakistani economy could undermine multilateral efforts to stabilize south asia and curtail the incidence of islamist radicalism after several years of strong and comparatively stable growth pakistan quickly slid into severe economic crisis in 2008 for reasons discussed later in the report real gdp growth has slowed from 78 per year since 2004 to an estimated 34 in 2008 its official rate of inflation rose from 88 in january to 239 in october 2 since the beginning of the year the pakistani rupee has depreciated by over 23 against the us dollar leading to rising trade and current account deficits during the summer of 2008 apparent capital flight added downward pressure on the rupee worsening pakistans capital account deficit and accelerating the decline in the nations foreign exchange reserve holdingsleading to the possibility that pakistan could default on its sovereign debt obligations3 since his ascension to the presidency in september 2008 president zardari has attempted to address pakistans economic problems with the support of his chief economic advisor shaukat tarin on september 19 2008 acting finance minister naveed qamar released new economic policies designed to bring about macroeconomic st ability and avoid seeking imf assistance that included the elimination of fuel electricity and food subsidies and reduction in the government deficit4 on november 3 2008 tarin announced reforms of pakistans tax system including the politically sensitive taxation of large landowners to reduce the incidence of tax evasion5 president zardari has emphasized the importance of his nations economic problems stating the greatest challenge this government faces is an economic one6 despite the september announcement of new economic policies pakistans foreign exchange reserves have continued their yearlong decline the state bank of pakistans holdings of foreign exchange reserves fell from 142 billion at the end of october 2007 to 41 billion at the end of october 2008 7 of immediate concern pakistan reportedly needs 4 billion to 5 billion in assistance by the end of november in order to avoid defaulting on maturing sovereign debt obligations according to tarin pakistan will need 10 billion to 15 billion over the next two to three years to continue to service its capital account deficits and its outstanding debt8 1 for more information about uspakistan relations see crs report rl33498 pakistanus relations by k alan kronstadt 2 data from

done to poor families and the countrys economy by unprecedented international food and fuel price hikes10 in addition the world bank originally offered 14 billion in assistance11 however the combined adb and world bank loans are insufficient to address pakistans current capital shortfall when plan proved unworkable pakistan shifted to plan b which was to secure commitments for support from an

sees formally asking for imf assistance as last resort the pakistani government is reluctant to accept formal imf assistance for several reasons first there is history of poor relations between pakistan and the imf relations between the pakistani government and the imf may have been further strained by recent reports that the imf applied pressure on the world bank to cancel 300 million in aid to pakistan second the proposed reduction in defense spending will be unpopular with the military and may make it more difficult for the government to combat islamist militancy third the proposed tax reforms especially on agricultural crops might lead to higher food prices and more inflation similarly the elimination of government jobs would exacerbate pakistans already serious unemployment problem fourth the higher interest rates might drive some companies out of business in the words of one pakistani economist given our current political scenario the standard imf program would be disastrous 23 on november 15 tarin announced that pakistan had reached tentative agreement with the imf to borrow 76 billion over the next 23 months24 the first installment of the loanup to 4 billionwas expected by the end of november pakistan is to repay the loan by 201625 according to tarin the only condition set by the imf was that pakistan had to raise its interest rates to counteract its inflation problem president zardari reportedly commented on the imf loan i think its difficult pill but one has to take medicine to get better26 news of the imf loan agreement was quickly met with strongly worded opposition inside pakistan several members of pakistans parliament stated that the loan would lead pakistan into debt trap worsen the national economy and harm the living standards of the pakistani people27 if pakistans agreement with the imf is formally concluded the 76 billion loan is well short of the estimated 10 billion to 15 billion pakistan says it needs over the next two years to avoid financial crisis some observers speculate that the imf agreement will spur help from other potential donors such as china saudi arabia and the united states

assistance it needs it will not end the nations economic problems pakistans recent period of economic growth was based on combination of export expansion and inward foreign direct investments fdi pakistan was able to finance its modest trade and capital account deficits in part due to the inward fdi and in part due to remittances from overseas pakistanis in 2007 and 2008 rise in fuel and food prices combined with political instability led to rapid rise in inflation spike in the trade and current account deficits devaluation of the pakistani rupee and sharp decline in inward fdi foreign investment in pakistan during its fiscal year 20072008 julyjune was down by 384 from the previous year although global fuel and food prices are on the decline the global financial crisis is expected

recession will reduce demand for its exports and inward fdi flows the combination of high rates of inflation and high unemployment apparently have contributed to rise in poverty and hunger in pakistan according to one estimate pakistans unemployment rate in urban areas is nearly 40 and in rural areas over 6028 recent united nations study reportedly determined 10 million pakistanis are undernourished and over half of pakistans population can be considered food insecure 29 some observers speculate that the recent growth in poverty and hunger is exacerbating pakistans political problems when he announced the previously mentioned economic policies in september 2008 finance minister qamar said that the economic stabilization package would create jobs promote agriculture and manufacturing and reduce poverty there is concern in pakistan however that the required higher interest rates will force smaller businesses into bankruptcy and the repayment of the imf loan will stunt future economic growth g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g143g152g155g561g23g495g21g495g561g20g142g149g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 as previously mentioned the us government c onsiders stable pakistani government important for several reasons in addition because pakistan possesses nuclear weapons an unstable government poses threat throughout south asia as result pakistans current capital crisis and its underlying economic problems may pose serious threat to us regional and global interests several recent events and trends however may have harmed us relations with pakistan although the united states provides both military and humanitarian assistance 968 million in fy2008 pakistan is increasingly turning to other friendly nationssuch as china and saudi arabiafor support pakistans trade relations have shifted so that china is its largest trading partner followed by saudi arabia 30 in addition us military incursions into pakistani territory and the signing of nuclear cooperation agreement with india31 have harmed uspakistan relations also some pakistani analysts thought the united states was orchestrating the negotiations with the imf and the friends of pakistan
