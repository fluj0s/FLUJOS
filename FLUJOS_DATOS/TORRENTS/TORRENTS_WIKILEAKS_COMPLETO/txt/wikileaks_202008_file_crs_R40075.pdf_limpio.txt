projections provided by states and current as of december 11 2008 eight states will qualify for the additional shortfall funding totaling 258 million as shown in column of table 1 2 these eight states

states projected under current law to have federal schip funds on april 1 2009 these are the two groups of states discussed above the 35 states projected to be spending from their fy2008 or fy2009 allotments on march 31 2009 as well as the eight states projected to receive mmsea shortfall funding because they will have exhausted all other available federal schip funds the only federal schip funds that will be available past march 31 under current law are unspent fy2007 allotments which are not subject to the mmsea provisions seven states 3 and the 1 201a2 of mmsea 2 the estimates in this

after march 31 four of these states would exhaust those funds during the remainder of fy20094 only connecticut the district of columbia nevada and washington would be able to fund their schip programs with federal schip funds through the end of fy2009 u nder current law solely with their available fy2007 federal schip funds these are states whose schip spending is well below their allotment levels the congressional budget office cbo assumes in its baseline spending projections that the funding for the program in later years will continue at 50 billion5 in other words although the fy2008 and fy2009 allotments under current law are longer available after march 31 cbo assumes those allotments will continue to be available for purposes of estimating the cost of legislation this means that legislation to simply extend the availability of the fy2008 and fy2009 allotments would not be scored by cbo as an increased cost to the federal government assuming the fy2008 and fy2009 allotm ents were available through at least the end of fy2009 27 states column g of table 1 would experience shortfalls totaling 19 billion note however for number of reasons that legislation to also eliminate these fy2009 shortfalls would not be scored by cbo at 19 billion for purposes of its cost estimates cbo assumes some offsets from the medicaid fallback financing discussed in the next section that states would use in the absence of federal schip shortfall funding additionally new jersey for example currently covers parents using federal schip funds permitted under section 1115 waiver such waivers permit states to expand eligibility to groups that might not otherwise be eligible among other things the new jersey schip waiver is scheduled to expire on january 17 2009 recent administration policy has generally been to terminate adult coverage when schip waivers come up for renewal new jersey submitted its projected spending assuming schip coverage of parents would continue for the tirety of fy2009 cbo may exclude those amounts for its purposes

federal schip funds some have the ability to draw down federal medicaid funds as fallback option this can occur in one of two ways first states that have an schipfinanced expansion of medicaid may access federal medicaid funds at the regular medicaid matching rate although this match rate is lower than the schip matching rate6 states that have an schip program entirely separate from medicaid cannot revert to medicaid funds when their schip funds are exhausted except as discussed below column in table 1 shows whether states schip program is medicaid expansion m is separate from medicaid s or consists of both c for combin ation most schip enrollees are in separate schip program7 although historical analyses have shown that states that were projected to have 4 delaware florida tennessee

federal government matching rate for medicaid expendituresthe medicaid federal medical assistance percentage fmapranges across states from 50 to 773 in fy2008 the enhanced schip fmap ranges from 65 to 834 the difference between the percentages results from the states share of expenditures being 30 smaller in schip compared to medicaid 7 see table 1 of crs report rl30473 state childrens health

component to their schip program8 this is also true among the states projected to face shortfall in fy2009 even if the fy2008 and fy2009 funds are available for the entirety of fy20099 as previously mentioned section 1115 of the so cial security act provides the secretary of health and human services hhs with broad aut hority to waive certain statutory requirements in medicaid andor schip some states have approval under section 1115 waiver authority in the event of shortfall to draw federal medicaid funds for the portion of their schip program that is not medicaid expansion arizona hawaii massachusetts oregon and rhode island are known to have such provisions in their approved waivers

regulations that pertain to states ability to terminate schipfinanced coverage none addresses doing so as result of the absence of federal funding hhs may issue guidance for states terminating coverage because of the absence of federal funding however federal statute or regulation prohibits states from continuing to operate their schip programs at 100 state cost with the potential to receive federal match from future schip funds 10 this section briefly discusses some of the pertinent laws and regulations for states terminating individuals schipfinanced coverage which va ry for medicaidexpansion programs in which case medicaid limitations apply based on title xix of the social security act and separate schip programs in which case schip limitations apply based on title xxi

with such an amendment contingent on approval by the secretary11 thus even in the absence of any federal schip funding state would ultimately need to submit state plan amendment spa to terminate coverage in its separate schip program the law states that any plan amendment that eliminates or restricts eligibility or benefits under the plan may not take effect unless the state certifies that it has provided prior public notice of the change in form and manner provided under applicable state law 12 federal regulations also require that if eligibility is denied suspended or terminated state must provide enrollees and applicants timely written notice 13 in addition if eligibility is suspended or terminated the state must provide sufficient notice to enable the childs parent or caretaker
