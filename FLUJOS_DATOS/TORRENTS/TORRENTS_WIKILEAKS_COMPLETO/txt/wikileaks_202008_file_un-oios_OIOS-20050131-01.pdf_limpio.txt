policies leg islation and practices as well as capacity building activities in refugee law other activitie s were public information and awareness campaigns including private sector fund raising in five nordic and three baltic countries since 2002 when the unhcr office in latvia was clo sed the regional representation had taken over the responsibility for the baltic countr ies 4 exit conference

focused on 2002 and 2003 programm activities directly implemented by the regional representation under projects 02apsw ecm200 and 03apswecm200 with expenditure of us 161000 and subprojects 02 apbalcm200 cc and 03apbalcm200 cc with expenditure of us 16800 0 implemented by the lithuanian red cross lrcc 7 the audit reviewed the administration of th regional representation with administrative

numb er of staff working for the unhcr operation in sweden was 19 this included 12 staff on regular posts project staff member in lithuania and six interns 8 the audit activities included review and assessme nt of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations programme management 9 oios reviewed the performance indicators an d related targets established by the regional representation as well as their reporting on the impact and achievement of key activities to assess whether they were adequate for measuring and evaluating the regional representations performance some progress to impr ove these tools had been made however further improvements were necessary to all ow proper independent performance assessment and monitoring for instance for the pr ogrammes reviewed in sweden the majority of performance indicators did not define q uantifiable targets they did not allow to adequately measuring progress towards the achieveme nt of planned outcomes 10 the regional representation responded that the unhcr programmes in western europe had objectives and proposed achievements wh ich were not easily measurable this situation may need intervention from the bureau for europe to provide guidance on setting the standards for such activities as advocating ref ugee related legislation public information and awareness oios agrees that there is degree of challenge in setting performance indicators for such programme areas to ensure those established are useful monitoring tool oios consulted the programme coordination operati ons support section division of operational support dosc dos stated that the recently issued iom0142004 fom0142004 practical guide to the systematic u of standards and indicators in unhcr operations targeted the most important aspec ts of the protection status and well being of refugees residing in defined camp settings the work to cover other unhcr operational sectors is ongoing with current focus n the urban refugee related activities oios appreciates the work undertaken by dos and loo ks forward to the establishment of adequate performance indicators and standards in l operational settings 11 the objectives as they were set for some f projects were not achieved for instance project 04abbalcm200 which had the objective f ensuring that the lithuanian refugee related legislation be established in line with int ernational standards and practices could not be achieved the lithuanian law on the legal statu s of aliens adopted on 29 april 2004 does not satisfy international refugee and human ri ghts law standards in oios opinion the bureau for europe should when establishing objecti ves ensure they are achievable the regional representation indicated that following ex tensive lobbying by unhcr among many other advocates the draft law was in line with int ernational standards thus the objective was felt realistic when it was set 3 recommendation head2right the unhcr division of operational support should co mplete the exercise of defining performance indicators and sta ndards for all sectors of unhcr operations including advocating re fugee legislation and those relating to public informatio n and awareness rec 01c 12 the regional representation indicated that they wou ld welcome the establishment of adequate performance indicators and standards for l egalprotection advocacy and public information and awareness raising activities als feedback and advice from the bureau for europe would be welcome in the development of progr amme objectives ac project monitoring 13 proper project monitoring procedures neede d to be established oios found that formal project financial monitoring of partners act ivities had been conducted since the unhcr liaison office in riga had been closed and th responsibility for project monitoring transferred to the regional representation 14 similarly oios could not see evidence tha t the regional representation had performed any formal performance monitoring of part ners activities although the regional programme officer based in budapest had done some m onitoring in oios opinion regular monitoring visits should be conducted oios sugges ted that the bureau for europe assist the regional representation by providing the necessary training or assigning staff members on mission to perform monitoring activities to ensure this function is carried out competently 15 the 2003 and 2004 subproject budgets for the partner lrc were established in us even though expenditures were incurred in lithuania n litas oios would refer to unhcr manual chapter 4 section 44 whereby subproject budgets should normally be calculated and prepared in the currency of expenditure the l ithuanian currency is relatively stable and should be used as the basis of budget calculations moreover it would have been more appropriate to use euro rather than us and this i s even more pertinent considering the us devaluation over the last two years the regional representation pointed out that the office was dealing with three different currencies of different stabilities also they stated that the funding portion allocated per year by headquart ers was still us regardless in which currency the subproject was prepared oios appreciates that working in number of currencies can at times be complicated nonethel ess oios would reiterate that it is unhcrs policy to prepare subproject budgets in th currency of implementation the currency used by unhcr headquarters in making budge t allocations is therefore not relevant and not valid argument for not establishing subp rojects budgets in local currency 16 the level of achievement by lrc of subpro ject objectives could not be properly measured due to the lack of quantifiable performanc indicators for 2002 while the situation was partly rectified in 2003 lrc did not include i n their narrative report the progress achieved as measured against relevant indicators i mpact and performancec the regional representation will ensure that project reports pro perly reflect progress achieved against relevant indicators 4 recommendations head2right the unhcr regional representation in sweden in conj unction with the bureau for europe should ensure that proper pro ject financial and performance monitoring procedures of partners activ ities are implemented assistance may be required to either train staff in sweden or provide the necessary resources from offi ces in the region or from headquarters rec 02c head2right the unhcr regional representation in sweden should comply with unhcrs policy and calculate and prepare budgets in the currency of expenditure rec 03c 17 the regional representative accepts the above recom mendations and indicated that following the closure of the unhcr office in riga the regional programme officer based in budapest had provided useful support including project monitoring training to relevant staff she added that project reviews were schedule d for the last week of january 2005 and that the regional representation would consult head quarters on the currency issue bc review of implementing partner lithuanian r ed cross lrcc 18 for lrc reasonable assurance could be tak that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements the accounting system was assessed as satisfactory and the chart of accou nts and budgetary codes allocated allowed expenditure transactions to be easily separated per donor and project oios assessed that internal controls systems were generally in place nd operating effectively efforts should be made however to segregate banking responsibilitie s reduce the number of cash transactions and ensure payment requests are systematically prep ared and attached to the supporting documents in addition oios recommended improveme nts to streamline document flow of social and legal assistance expenditures the regional representation has discussed the issues with lrc and confirmed that the structure of segregation was now in place lrc will respect the structure and improve their payment pra ctices 19 lrcs annual expenditure for 2002 and 2003 was below the established threshold for audit certification of us 100000 nevertheless an audit was conducted at the end of 2001 for the project asylum support and tolerancebuild ing activities in lithuania implemented in 2000 and 2001 funded by the europea n union euc unhcr and the international federation of red cross and red cresc ent societies ifrcc an unqualified audit opinion was expressed 20 lrc was implementing programmes funded fro m several sources including the eu and the lithuanian government we understand that u nhcrs contribution is essential to secure cofunding which national ngos provide whil approaching the eu financial sources any reduction in unhcr funding would subsequently r educe the funds provided to lrc from the eu 21 lrc did not submit with the final spmr s taffing table listing project staff and showing for each staff member the name functional title period of employment and total cost 5 charged to the subproject the submission of sta ffing table is control mechanism over staffing costs oios confirmed however that labou r contracts and salary related taxes were maintained in accordance to the local legislation nd that staff costs agreed to the established budget cc public information and public awareness 22 an amount of swedish krona sekc 70000 u s 9000 or 10 per cent of the 2003 budgetc was paid to the nongovernmental organizati on nykterhetsrorelsens bildningsverksamhet the educational activity of th sobriety movementc nbvc in november 2003 to initiate the research for the film production integration of youth in the nordic region the regional representation had not signed any contract to substantiate what was the expected outcome of the contribution there fore it was not clear what the end deliverable from nbv would be further the draft p roject budget estimated unhcrs outlay to be sek 1000000 some us 140000c this exceed ed the regional representations annual programme budgets for 2002 and 2003 the re asoning for participating in the preliminary stage of this project was unclear the regional representation indicated that the film project was initially seen as potential good tool to further the goals of refugee integration in the region also on receipt of the draft budget of sek 1000000 from nbv it was made clear that such expectations were nonsensi cal the regional representation agreed unhcrs participation in the project should have been based on signed contract 23 the regional representation also made co ntribution of sek 50000 us 5600c to the nongovernmental organization demokrati akadem in november 2002 to cofinance the organisation of the swedish forum fo r human rights this was unhcr public awareness activity these expenditures were not supported by sponsorship agreements identifying deliverables to unhcr the regional representation stated that they would endeavour to provide oios with the supporting docum ents 24 for the future for public information and public awareness activities the regional representation should ensure that there is proper d ocumentation justifying the reasons for contributions as well as clearly establishing the xpected benefits the regional representation agreed that for the future they woul d ensure that clear agreements are signed between all parties involved dc private sector fund raising psfrc 25 the regional representation is actively in volved in the psfr activities they estimate that over the last three years they have r aised funds of some us 22 million the majority of this was cash donations from statoil an d pro bono services from the ibm and mckinsey 26 the regional representation is currently u ndertaking various psfr initiatives the recent focus is on targeting private donors in diff erent nordic countries in order to receive donations however the regional representation nee ds giroc bank account in each country to simplify the donating process and to make it mor practical for private donors the unhcr treasury informed us that the general policy of the organisation is to minimise the number of bank accounts in use however there woul d be restrictions to operate bank account if reasonable cash flow is expected the private sector and public affairs service 6 in conjunction with the treasury should assist the regional representation to overcome the technical and administrative restrictions in order to facilitate their psfr efforts recommendation head2right the unhcr private sector and public affairs service in conjunction with the treasury section and the regional represen tation in stockholm should assess the feasibility of opening bank accounts in each of the nordic countries to facilitate donation s from the private sector rec 04c 27 the regional representation indicated that they wou ld welcome the support of the private sector and public affairs service and the t reasury section to facilitate donations from the private sector b procurement 28 procurement activities needed to be improv ed the process should be formalised and the filing system improved oios found that proper competitive bidding procedures were not always applied purchase orders or contracts were n ot systematically issued and exceptions to procurement procedures were not documented or ackno wledged by the local committee on contracts 29 during the period 2002 to 2004 the regiona l representation procured variety of printing services totalling some us 100000 the p rocurement was conducted on caseto case basis and each time the same service provider was engaged oios suggested that the regional representation select printing supplier competitively and enter into frame agreement with the company offering the most compet itive prices this would help to streamline procedures and reduce the administrative workload 30 for other high value services such as lan maintenance shipment of personal effects and travel it had been more than three years since the suppliers had been selected competitively oios recommended that for the procur ement of all services or goods exceeding the acquisition value of us 5000 forma l competitive bidding be regularly conducted this will ensure more competitive prices 31 some of the goods and services acquired we re expensive eg lan system maintenance of only 16 hours per month cost us 25 00 business cards cost us 200 per set and office chairs were us 500 each while appreci ating that goods and services are generally expensive in sweden in comparison to some other european countries oios felt that cheaper options could be identified if the reg ional representation conducted thorough market research for lan system maintenance the r egional representation should request the assistance of the division of information servi ces and telecommunications to find more economical solution 32 the regional representation indicated that they had introduced control mechanisms to ensure that unhcr procurement procedures are adh ered to 7 c security and safety 33 due to the limited presence in sweden unhcr is actively involved in the security coordination in the country the regional representative is appointed as the designated country official and the senior regional external relations officer is the security coordinator nevertheless due to its loca tion the office still needs to conduct some further work to become fully moss compliant the regional representation informed oios that unsecoord would conduct survey of the premis in early 2005 the date has not yet been confirmed d administration 34 in the areas of administration and finance the regional representation generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under revie w 35 oios recommended that the regional represe ntation use unhcr standard payment requests to initiate all expenditure oios noted th at staff members procured personal goods and services such as computer equipment and dhlc t hrough the office oios informed the representative that such practice is not acceptab and results in an administrative burden to the office due to the recording and subsequent reco very of costs from staff the regional representation implemented the use of unhcr standar d payment requests and confirmed that procurement of personal goods and services was discontinued iv acknowledgement 36 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and
