concern over the possible applicability of this strict liability scheme to owners and developers of brownf ield properties was identified as deterrent to their cleanup and reuse in many cases because cercla had provisions for relaxing the liability even for the socially desirable goal of upgrading contaminated real estate the brownfields act helped in this regard by exempting from liability 1 owners of land contaminated by source on contig uous property and 2 prospective purchasers of property known to be conta minated it also explained in detail what constitutes all appropriate inquiry phrase used in the superfund act as prer equisite to land buyers innocent landowne r liability defense5 also even before enactment of the brownfields act epa revised its system of tracking sites6 suspected of contamination with hazardous substances to clarify when further action by the agency was planned at the site and to remove the stigma of being associated with the superfund program the act also included provisions to estab lish and enhance state and tribal response programs particularly for brownfields these programs include the traditional enforcementdriven cleanup pproaches as well as newer voluntary cleanup programs that avoid some of the costs and delays of that line of action and offer incentives for participating most states provide some sort of liability release and other incentives include streamlined process financial or tax incentives and technical assistance the brownfields act authorizes 50 million per ear in grants to states and tribes in addition the 2002 law expanded the definiti on of what is considered brownfield for purposes of grants so communities may now receive funding for minescarred lands sites contaminated by petroleum and buildings or sites that were used for the manufacture of illegal drugs according to epa since the beginning of the brownfields program the agency has awarded 883 assessment grants totaling 2254 million 202 revolving loan fund grants totaling 1867 million and 238 cleanup grants totaling 427 million epa states that this 4548 million of assistance has levera ged more than 82 billion in private investment helped

number of environmental programs has expired but congress continues to appropriate funds for them thus assuring their continuationfunding for brownfields is longer ssential or appropriate because of recent dramatic increases in funding for epas pr ogram and indicated the house had already provided 234 billion in the fiscal year 2007 appropriations bill for the epa program10 however this reference would be to ep as entire environmental management and programs account in epas appropriation b ill hr 5386 which covers variety of environmental activities including 246 milli on for the administrative expenses of epas brownfields program as passed by the house the total appropriation for epa brownfields is actually 1633 milli on however the limination of huds program does raise questions regarding the adequacy of epas funding and authority to meet both cleanup and redevelopment needs during consideration of hr 5576 on th house floor members agreed to an amendment offered by representative gary miller hamdt 1013 to increase the hud community development fund by 15 millio n coupled with 15 million offset to another hud account supporters of the amendm ent stated that the funds would allow the hud brownfields program to continue but the bills langua ge does not explicitly state the purpose of the increase if congress ultimately eliminates funding for huds brownfields program owners of brownfield proper ties still may be eligible to co mpete for economic redevelopment assistance provided through other hud prog rams eg the community development block grant program moreover the house report also earmarked 700000 in huds appropriation for two specified brownfield sites and the senate report earmarked 1450000 for seven named brownfie ld sites despite the lack of funding for comprehensive program to address such needs other federal brownfield programs as early as 1996 epa developed cooperative relationships with other federal agencies to share knowledge on economic redevelopment and environmental principles nd to find ways of applying federal support to brownfields redevelopment in many different types of communities the brownfields federal program

the committee on transportation and infrastructure reporte d hr 5810 on july 28 2006 hrept 109608 part 1 the bill would extend the grant au thority through 2012 at the present level of 200 million annually in additi on it requires the epa inspect or general to report to congress every four years on the manageme nt of the brownfie lds program and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22502crs6 allocation of grants the bill also eliminates requirement presently in the law that 25 of available funding be used for sites where petroleum is the cause for site contamination such sites would still be elig ible for funding but would have to compete with other brownfield sites for priority and funding the bill also would renew through 2012 assist ance to states and tribes at the current level of 50 million annually fi nally it adds factor for epa to use in ranking brownfield grant applications the extent to which the grant would implement green building standards and energy efficient build ing standards this would codify the agencys current practice the committee report also makes two nonlegi slative recommendations one is that epa award the competitive grants more than once year if practicable the other urged the agency to award several multiple purpose grants each year not solely for assessment or cleanup but for both hr 5810 was also referred to the house committee on energy
