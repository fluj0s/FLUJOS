analytical review of the allocation formulas summary the elementary and secondary educati on act esea cont ains 45 separately authorized programs plus approximately 20 specified s ubprograms the largest of these programs distri bute funds by formulas that prescribe how funds are to be allocated among state educational agencies seas or local educational agencies leas nationwide they take the form of mathematical equations through which the us department of ducation ed and in many cases also seas calculate grant amounts for each potential grantee mee ting statutory eligibility criteria they almost always include one or more popula tion factors and may also include state or lea minimum grant provisions eligibility thresholds expenditure factors fiscal accountability provisions and re servations of funds for variety of purposes the recipients of majority of the f unds under almost all esea formula grant programs are leas under most of these programs grants are provided to leas via seas that is they are stateadministe red formula grant programs funds are allocated by ed directly to leas onl under limited number of esea programs the most influential esea allocation formulas are those under the t itle ia program both because this is the largest esea program and because there are five esea programs under which grants are made in part or in full in proportion to grants calculated under title i part as resu lt majority of esea funds are allocated under formulas in which the primary popula tion factor is schoolage children in poor families and state expenditure factors are applied the share of all public k12 educati on revenues that is provided under esea programs varies substantially among the states although esea funding constitutes only approximately onetenth or less of total public k12 education revenues in all cases except puerto rico the average esea program grant per schoolage child poor and nonpoor increases as the state av erage poverty rate rises with the third of states having the highest poverty rate s receiving 14 times as much as low poverty states at the same time an opposite tr end is found in average esea grants per schoolage child in poor family with low poverty states receiving 13 times as much as states with the highest poverty rates most esea allocation formulas include state or lea minimum grant provisions as result states with the smallest schoolage population receive approximately 17 times as much as the re maining states per schoolage child and approximately 22 times as much per schoolage child from poor family this report will be updated if substantial changes ar made in one or more esea program allocation formulashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721contents introduction 1 g n r l s f r m u l g r n t c h r

retired specialist in educ ation policy also contributed to this report 2 the general education provisions act gep provides that the authorization of appropriations for or duration of an applicab program shall be automatically extended for one additional fiscal year unless congress in the regular session that ends prior to the beginning of the terminal fiscal year of such authorization or duration has passed legislation that becomes law and extends or repeals the authorization of such program 20 usc 1226aelementary and secondary education act an analytical review of the allocation formulas introduction the primary source of federal aid to k12 education is the elementary and secondary education act sea particularly its t itle i part program of education for the disadvantaged1 the esea was initially enacted in 1965 pl 89 10 and was most recently amended and reauthorized by the child left behind act of 2001 nclb p l 107110 esea programs are explicitly authorized through fy2007 although they were automati cally extended for one additional year through fy2008 when congress did not act upon reauthorization legislation by december 31 20052 the 110th congress has considered proposals to amend and extend the esea although it appears likely that esea reauthorization will again be on the agenda of the 111th congress the nclb initiated major expansion of federal influence on several aspects of public k12 education pr imarily with the aim of increasing the accountability of public school systems and individual pub lic schools for improving achievement outcomes of all pupils especially the disadva ntaged states that receive grants under esea title ia must impleme nt in all public schools and school districts variety of standardsbased ssessments in reading math and science make annual adequate yearly progress ayp determinations fo r each public school and local educational agency lea and require virtually all public school teachers and aides to meet variety of qualification re quirements state ayp policies must incorporate an ultimate goal of all public school pupils reaching profic ient or higher level of achievement in reading nd mathematics by the end of the 20132014 school year further states participating in esea title ia must enforce series of increasingly substantial consequences for most of thei r schools and almost all school districts that fail to meet the ayp standards fo r two consecutive years or more major esea programs other than title ia provide grants to support the education of migrant students recruitment of and professional development forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721crs2 teachers language instruction for limited english proficient lep students school safety and drug abuse prevention prog rams afterschool instruction and care expansion of charter schools and other fo rms of public school choice education services for indian native hawaiian and alaska native students impact aid to compensate leas for taxes foregone due to certain federal activities and wide variety of innovative educationa l approaches or instruction to meet particular student needs the esea contains 45 separately author ized programs plus approximately 20 specified subprograms the methods by which federal funds are provided to grantees under these programs fa ll into five general categories programs under which federal f unds are allocated by the us department of education ed to states as well as to all or most leas via one or more formulas specified in the esea example esea title i part education for the disadvantaged programs under which federal funds ar allocated by ed to states via statutory formula while state educational agencies seas suballocate these funds either on competitive or discretionary basis or via statedeveloped allocation formula consistent with general statutory guidance example esea title iv part b 21st century community learning centers programs under which fede ral funds are allocated by ed directly to leas via formulas specified in the esea example esea title viii impact aid programs under which federal funds are allocated by ed to state andor local grantees on competitive or discretionary basis example esea title v part d subpart 6 gifted and talented students and programs under which fede ral funds are allocated by ed to single eligible grantee specified in the esea example esea title ii part c subpart 2 national writing project esea allocation formulas are mechanisms established through statute or other official policy documents that define how appropriated funds are to be allocated among seas or leas nationwide they take the form of mathematical equations through which ed and possibly also seas calculate specific grant amounts for each potential grantee meeting statutory eligibility criteria they almost always include one or more population factors but typica lly include number of additional factors this report discusses and analyzes the current allocation formulas for esea programs in the first three categories listed above it provides the following 1 description of general categories of factors used in the eseas allocation formulashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721crs3 3 see the following reports for more detaile d descriptions of lected esea program allocation formulas crs report rl33731 education for the

general patterns and issues related to these formulas other crs reports provide more detailed discussions and analyses of the allocation formulas of majo r individual esea programs3 this report will be update d infrequently when major changes occur in esea program allocation formulas general esea formula grant characteristics it is important to understand the voca bulary commonly applie d to federal k12 education allocation formulas therefore an explanation of key terms precedes the discussion of the esea formulas level of recipient entity nd level at whic h grants are calculated by ed under most esea formula grant programs grants are made to leas via the seas if leas are the ultimate grantees in state formula grant program the esea program may provide for substate distribution of grants by seaadministered competition through statutory substate allocation formula directing seas how to determine lea grants or less frequently through statutory lealevel form ula with grants calculated by ed itself but distributed to leas by seas with limited options for seas to adjust the lea grants as calculated by ed under few esea formula grant programs lea grants are calculated and directly allocated by ed eg impact aid formula factors allocation formulas have one or more factors that target funds to seas leas or other entities to accomplish or facilitate some policy outcome for example program aiming to serve children from poor families w ould have formula based on estimated numbers of schoolage 517 years children in poor families in simple formula each state would be allocated funds in proportion to the estimated number of such children living in that state that is states proportion is obtained by dividing its number of schoolage children in poor fa milies by the total number of suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721crs4 children nationwide for example if 14 of all schoolage children in poor families live in california this simple formula would allocate 14 of all state grant funds to california formula can include more than one population factor and it can weight the factors differently for example formula could distribute 50 of funds based on total schoolage population and 50 based on schoolage children in poor families population factor the most common allocation formula factor is population factor almost all federal k12 education program allocation formulas include such factor the most common population factors are schoolage ch ildren in poor fa milies and total schoolage children in addition several esea programs allocate funds on the basis of population fact or that is specifically related to the programs purpose such as indian pupils migratory children or children whose parents live or wo rk on federal property usually population factor is direct but sometimes it is indirect for example if program allocates gr ants in proportion to grants made under esea title i this provision indirectly incorporates the title ia formulas population factors p rimarily schoolage children in poor families title ia grant factor many esea programs allocate some or all of their funds in proportion to gr ants made under the largest esea program aid for the education of the disadvantaged under title i part for example gran ts under esea title ii part d education technology are made in proportion to title ia grants subject to higher state minimum grant provision than under title ia thus grants calculated unde r title ia become an allocation factor for several other programs eligibility threshold many esea programs require leas to meet population factor thresholds in order to be eligible to receive grants for example under the title ia concentration grant allocation formula leas must meet either of two population factor eligibility thresholds 1 6500 population fact or children mostly schoolage children in poor families or 2 population factor child percentage population factor children divide d by total schoolage population of 15 in order to receive grants expenditure factor several esea program allocation formulas include an expenditure factor these are based on state or less frequently lea average per pupil expenditure for public k12 education expenditure factors ar intended to adjust for state or local differences in the costs of providing public k12 education although they are often criticized as reflecting differences in ability to pay for educational services as well in most cases floors and ceilings based on percentages of the national average are applied to this factor eg floor of 80 and ceiling of 120 of the national average per pupil expenditure usually an expenditure factor ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721crs5 4 for example the esea title ia target ed grant allocation formula has eligibility thresholds of 10 children counted in the t itle ia population factor primarily schoolage children in poor families and 5 population factor child rate if an lea should meet these criteria and receive targeted grant in year 1 but fall below one of the thresholds in year 2 it would receive funds in year 2 ev though the targeted grant formula includes lea hold harmless of at least 85 of preceding year grantsdirect but sometimes it is indirect for example if program allocates grants in proportion to grants made under esea title ia see above this provision indirec tly incorporates the title ia formulas expenditure factors hold harmless some formulas establish minimum state or lea grant equal to specified percen tage of the amount received in previous year usually this is the immediately preceding year although sometimes it is base year that may be several years in the past the minimum percentage may be the full amount received in the previous year ie 100 or more often some lesser percentage eg 85 raising state or lea to its hold harmless level almost always reduces grants to other states or leas that do not benefit from the hold harmless hold harmless amounts are only guaranteed if funds are sufficien t to pay for them if not hold harmless amounts are ratably reduced see below to meet the level of the appropriation further in almost all cases hold harmless provisions only apply to grantees meeting program eligibility criteria for the current year not necessarily every grantee that received grant in the preceding year4 foundation grant under some esea programs each state or lea first receives foundation gran t amount then additional appropriations if any are allocat ed on the basis of population and possibly other formula factors if funds are insufficient to pay the full foundation grant amount then each grant ee receives an equal proportion of its foundation grant the foundation grant may be an equal amount per grantee eg 3 million per state or more often it is the amount received in base year under one or more antecedent programs the latter usually occurs when two or more programs are consolidated into one new program in reauthorization of the esea minimum state grant in addition to hold harmless amounts see above which are always expressed in terms of percentage of previous year grant several pr ograms have state minimum grant expressed primarily in terms of percentage of all allocations to states or as fixed dollar amount per state such minimum grant provisions are aimed at providing what advocates argue is minimum viable grant to all states state minimums are set at percentage of total state grants typically 025 035 or 05 occasionally they are fixed dollar amounts eg 500000 or thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721crs6 5 if state fails to expend the requisite level of funds the esea program is reduced according to the proportion by which the required level 90 of the preceding year is missedgreater or lesser of fixed amount or percentage of the total in some cases one or more caps may be placed on these minimums eg state minimum might be 025 of total state grants subject to cap of 150 of the national average grant per population factor child multiplied by the state total number of such children when applying the minimum the money to increase grants to relatively low population states that would otherwise receive less than the minimum amount comes from all other states which would see their initial grants ratably reduced ratable reduction or ratable increase this is the process of either reducing or increasing grants as initially calculated in order to adjust for the level of availabl appropriations or application of certain formula factors such as state minimum or lea hold harmless these reductions or in creases are applied in proportion to initial grants ie they are ratable for example raising certain states to minimum grant amounts requi res that funds be redistributed from states with initial grants above the minimums ratable reduction reduces funds in proportion to their initial grants for states above minimum levels nd redistributes these funds to states with initial grants below minimum levels when ratable reduction occurs all states or leas above the minimum have their initial grants reduced by the same percentage resulting in different dollar amount changes similar processes of ratable reduction occur in the application of hold harmless provisions fiscal accountability requirements most esea programs include one or more of thr ee types of fiscal accountability requirements these are intende d to assure that federal funds provide net increase over state and local funds devoted to k12 education the two most common esea fiscal accountab ility requirements are 1 maintenance of effort recipients must provide from state and local sources leve l of funding either aggregate or per pupil in the pr eceding year that is equal to at least some specified percentage usually 90 of the level in the second preceding year5 and 2 funds must be used so as to supplement and not supplant state and local funds that would otherwise be available for the same purpose as under the esea program in question third type of fiscal accountability requirement comparability applies only to title i parts c and d services provided with state and local funds in schools pa rticipating in title ia must be comparable to those in nontitle ia schools of the same lea httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721crs7 6 the esea statute refers to the bureau of indi an affairs bia however in practice the bia has been superseded by the bureau of indian education bie 7 the esea includes in section 9601 genera l authorization for the us secretary of education to reserve up to 05 of appropria tions under any esea programs except those under titles i and iii for program evaluations if such reservation is not separately and explicitly authorized this authority is exercised on occasion 8 some authorizing statutes specify that the ad ministrative setaside may be the larger of dollar amount or percentage of the grant such provisions aim to ensure that administrative funds for smaller states are sufficient to administer the programtreatment of puerto rico outlying areas and the bureau of indian affairs6 esea programs usually distribute funds by formula only to the 50 states the district of columbia and puerto rico the latter two entities are defined as states for the purposes of program formulas other entities usually receive funds from amounts that are reserved from the total appropriation these set asides can include funds for th outlying areas american samoa guam commonwealth of the northern marianas and the us virgin islands and funds provided to the bureau of indian affairs bia for services to certain indi an students typically total of 1 of program appropriations is reserved for these entities other reservations from appropriations under many programs before remaining funds are allocated to states portion of appropriations is also reserved for such national activities as competitive grants program eval uation research or technical assistance related to the overall program7 further adjustments by seas of lea grants as calculated by ed many state grant formulas pe rmit states to reserve proportion of their total grant for state level activities these activities include state administration of the program together with statewide services such as technical assistance and program evaluation aimed at assisting and improving the impleme ntation of the program under title ia states are required to reserve 4 of state grants subject to certain limitations desc ribed later in this report for school improvement activities typical total state setaside might be 5 of the state grant with more than 1 of the grant ie 20 of the setaside8 for administration and 4 for other state activities the following tables 19 summarize the provisions of esea allocation formulas with respect to many of the fo rmula factors or provi sions discussed above as illustrated in table 1 the recipients of major ity of the

level and state total grants are the total of allocations for leas in the state adjusted to apply state minimum grant provisions under the fourth formula education finance incentive grants grants are first calculated for each st ate overall with state totals subsequently suballocated by lea using different form ula primary rationale for using four different formulas to allocat shares of the funds for single program is that the formulas have distinct allocation patterns providing varying shares of allocated funds to different types of leas or states eg leas with high poverty rates or states with comparatively equal levels of spending per pupil among their leas in additionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721crs19 9 for additional discussion and analysis of th four title ia allocation formulas

formulas contain elements that are deemed to have important incentive effects or to be significant symbolically in addition to their impact on allocation patterns in the discussion below each of the four esea title ia allocation formulas is discussed separately9 basic grants basic grants are the original title ia formula authorized and implemented each year since fy1966 it is also the formula under which the largest proportion of funds is allocated 47 of fy2008 appropriations and under which the largest proportion of leas participat approximately 91 in fy2007 largely due to its low lea eligibility threshold see below however because all post fy2001 increases in title ia appropriations have been provided for the targeted and education finance incentive grant form ulas see below the proportion of title ia funds allocated under the basic grant fo rmula has been declining steadily since fy2001 when it was 86 compared to some of the other title ia formulas the basic grant formula is relatively straightforward grants are based on each leas share compared to the national total of populati on factor multiplied by an expenditure factor subject to available appropriations an lea minimum or hold harmless and state minimum these formula factors are described below followed by mathematical expression of the formula population factor children aged 517 in poor families according to the latest available estimates for leas from the census bureaus small area income and poverty estimates saipe program these constitute approximately 96 of all formula children for fy2007 b in instituti ons for neglected or delinquent children or in foster homes approximately 39 of all formula children for fy200710 and c in families receiving temporary assistance for needy fa milies tanf payments above the poverty income leve l for family of four ss than 01 of all formula children for fy2007 each element of the population factor is updated annually eligibility threshold in order for an lea to be eligible for basic grant the number of children counted in the population factor must constitute at least 10 such children and at least 2 of the total schoolage population expenditure factor state average per pupil expenditure for public k12 education subject to minimum of 80 and max imum of 120 of the national averagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721crs20 11 the hold harmless rate is 85 of the previous year grant if the leas schoolage child poverty rate population factor divided by to tal schoolage population is less than 15 90 if the schoolage child poverty rate is between 15 and 30 and 95 if the school age child poverty rate is greater than 30 12 if all of an leas schools participate in title ia then services funded from state and local revenues must be substantially comparable in each school of the lea 13 through fy2007 the minimum expenditure factor applicable to puerto rico was lower than that for any state the nclb provided for the elimination of this special provision in stages although scheduled increases in the pu erto rico expenditure factor are not to be implemented if doing so would result in decrea in the grant to any state the final step in this process was not implemented as scheduled in fy2007 however it was implemented in fy2008further multiplied by 040 the expenditure f actor is the same for all leas in the same state lea minimum grant or

continues to meet the basic grant formulas eligibility thresholds11 minimum state grant each state is to receive minimum of up to 025 of total basic grant appropriations if total basic gr ant funding is equal to or less than the fy2001 level as has been the case each year since fy2001 thus far and up to 035 of total basic grant appropriations in excess of the fy2001 amount if any state may not as result of the stat minimum provision receive more than the average of 1 025 of the total fy2001 amount for state grants plus 035 of any amount above the fy2001 level and 2 150 of the national average

has been the case every year beginning with fy1967 these am ounts are reduced by the same percentage for all leas subject to lea hold harmless and state minimum provisions until they equal the aggregate level of appropriations fiscal requirements there are three title ia fiscal accountability requirements which are applicable to total lea gr ants under all four formulas 1 maintenance of effort recipient leas must provide from state and local sources level of funding either aggregate or per pupil in the preceding year that is at least 90 as high as in the second preceding year 2 title

population factor pf would be the weighted child count as described above education finance incentive grants efig the efig formula is in several ways significantly different from the other title ia allocation formulas as with targeted grants efig gran ts were initially authorized in 199422 but funds were appropriated for them until fy2002 after the formula was in the case of efig considerably modified by the nclb beginning in fy2002 all increases in title ia appropriations have been allocated as either efig or targeted grants thus as with targeted grants efig grants cons titute substantial 21 of fy2008 appropriations and growing portion of total title ia grants they are allocated among large majority of leas 83 in fy2007 the distinctive elements of the efig formula begin with the fact that the first stage in the process of calculating grants is based on data for states as whole not leas lea grants are determined in separate later stage of the allocation process second major difference is that th efig formula includes not only population factor and an expenditure factor but also two unique factors these are an effort factor based on average per pupil expenditure for public k12 education compared to personal income per capita fo r each state compared to the nation as whole and an equity factor based on va riations in average per pupil expenditure among the leas in each state third distinctive feature of the efig formula is that while population factor child counts are not weighted when calculating state total grants they are weighted in the separate process of suballocating state total grants among leas this intra state allocation process is based on the sa number and percentage scales as used for targeted grants although the weight s attached to each point on those scales varies among states based on the states equity factor final difference betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721crs29 the efig grant and other title ia formulas is that the expenditure factor is modified through application of slightly more narrow floor and ceiling constraints for efig grants thus state total efig grants are based on each states share compared to the national total of populati on factor multiplied by an ex penditure factor an effort factor and an equity factor adjusted by state minimum then each leas share of the state total efig grant is based on weighted population factor count for the lea compared to the total for all leas in the state adjusted by an lea hold harmless provision these formula factor s are described below followed by mathematical expression of the formula population factor in the firststage calculation of state total efig grants this factor is the same as for basic grants the estimated number of children aged 517 in poor families b in institutions for ne glected or delinquent children or in foster homes and c in families receiving tanf payments above the poverty income level for family of four in the secondstag suballocation of state total grants among leas as under all stages of the allocation process for targeted grants weights are applied to these child counts before they are actually used in the formula this process is the same as for targeted grants with respect to the number and percentage scales used and use of the greater of the two weighted child counts to calculate lea grants however for efig grants only the weights attached to each point on the number and percentage scales differs depending on the states equity factor described below this variation is illustrated in table 11 below as

other esea program allocation formula effort factor the effort factor is based on comparison of state average per pupil expenditure appe for public elementa ry and secondary education with state personal income per capita pci more specifically it is the ratio of appe to pci for each state divided by the ratio of appe to pci for the nation the resulting index number is greater than 10 for states wher the ratio of expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary education to personal income per capita is greater than average for the nation as whole and below 10 for states where the ratio is less than average for the nation as whol narrow bounds of 095 and 105 are placed on the resulting multiplier so that its influence on state grants is rather limited and its importance is largely symbolic equity factor the equity factor is based upon measure of the average disparity in average per pupil expenditure among the leas of state called the coefficient of variation cv the cv is expressed as decimal proportion of the state average per pupil expenditure in the cv calculations for this formula an extra weight 14 vs 10 is app lied to estimated counts of

formula is illustrated in table 15 and figure 3 below as discusse d above this factor is intended to reward states with relatively high levels of expenditures per pupil for public k12 education compared to their vel of personal inco per capita this factor is equal to the average per pupil expenditure appe for public elementary and secondary education divided by state pers onal income per capita pci for each state divided by the national average of this rati in other words it is the ratio of appe to pci for each state divided by the ratio of appe to pci for the nation the effort factor is greater than 10 fo r states where the ratio of expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary education to pe rsonal income per capita is greater than average for the nation as whole and belo w 10 for states where the ratio is less than average for the nation as whole however the range of the effort factor is limited to 095 to 105 the limited range and ther efore the limited impact on grant levels of this factor is evident only 14 states fall within the narrow range between the minimum of 095 and the maximum of 105 while 18 states are at the minimum of 095 and the remaining 20 states are at th maximum of 105 if all other relevant factors are held constant state with maximum effort factor 105 would receive an efig grant of 11 more than if its ffort factor were

basis of their total number of schoolage children from larg est california to smalle st district of columbia as shown below there is substantial va riation in average grants per schoolage child as well as grants per schoolage ch ild in poor family among states in all population size ranges for example among the 5 smallest jurisdictions wyoming vermont north dakota alaska and the district of columbia the average grant per schoolage child ranges from 592 to 1407 while the average grant per schoolage child from poor family varies from 3 957 to 10 935 this variation results largely from 3 factors the varying impact of caps placed on state minimums under the title ia allocation formulas varia tions in schoolage child poverty rates higher poverty rate is associated with high er grants per schoolage child but at least in the smallest states lower grants per schoolage child from poor family and the eligibility of alaska for substa ntial funds under titles vii and v iii smaller but s till substantial variation also may be seen among states in other size ranges nevertheless overall the average grants per child are generally much higher for the smallest states than for the remaining states the average for the 12 smallest jurisdictions new hampshire and sma ller is 644 per schoolage child and 4879 per schoolage child from poor family similarly these jurisdictions received 518 of esea formula grants for fy 2007 but have only 314 of the nations schoolage children and 246 of the sc hoolage children from poor families in contrast the average for all of the other states plus puerto rico is 386 per school age child and 2254 per schoolage child from poor family thus the smallest states receive approximately 17 times as much as the remaining states per schoolage child and approximately 22 times as much per schoolage child from poor family this results primarily from the state minimum grant provisions in many of the esea allocation formulas although the differences in average gran ts per child between the smallest and other states are quite substantial the small states receive relatively modest share of total esea funds the total share of funds received by the 12 smallest jurisdictions 11 smallest states plus the district of columbia for fy2007 was 52 even if these small states were to receive the same amount of esea funds per child as other states the net increase in funds reallocated to the larger states would be relatively marginal for example if the share of funds going to the smallest states were reduced by half the average increase for the remaining states would be approximately 27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721 crs85 table 17 total esea grants per child for fy2007 states ranked by their total number of schoolage children state share of

estimates program table prepared by crshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721crs90 differences among states are less obvious or large than in the state population size analysis above however especially if one focuses on groups of states according to their schoolage child poverty rate as in figure 6 two significant patterns appear first the average grant per schoolage ch ild increases as the state average poverty rate rises from 309 per child for low povert states to 363 for states in the middle range to 445 for high poverty states 144 time s as much as for low poverty states this reflects the fact that most esea funds are allocated under or in proportion to the title ia allocation formulas and timated schoolage child ren in poor families is the primary formula factor in those at the same time an opposite trend is found in aver age grants per schoolage child in poor family this figure declines from 2820 for low poverty states to 2393 for states in the middle range and 2182 for states with the highest poverty rates this is reflection of at least 3 factors first many of the states with the lowest poverty rates are small and receive high grants per child as result of state minimum provisions eg new hampshire wyoming vermont north dakota and delaware second large proportion of the low poverty rate states have high expenditure factors eg connecticut ne w jersey massachusetts and others while large proportion of the highest poverty rate states have low expenditure factors eg california arizona tennessee north carolina alabama arkansas mississippi and others and third the targeting on high poverty areas under the figure 6 esea grants per child by state poverty ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34721crs91 title ia concentration targeted and ducation finance incentive grant formulas is carried out at the lea not the state level as was noted above these formulas tend to favor leas with especially rge numbers of schoolage children in poor families in many cases leas with such high concentrations of poverty are found in states with low poverty rates overall eg baltimore city maryland or boston massachusetts while in seve ral states with high povert rates poverty tends to be widely dispersed eg west virginia or mississippi
