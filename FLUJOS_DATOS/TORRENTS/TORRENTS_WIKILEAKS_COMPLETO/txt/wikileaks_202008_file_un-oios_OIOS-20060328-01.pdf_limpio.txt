its 1996 report to the ga in the c ontext of formalizing the contracting and procurement actions by the for t he unjspf so as to develop clear and workable procedures that duly recognize t he particular responsibilities and constraints imposed on the secretary of the pension board by the unjspf regulations and rules and on the officials by th financial regulations and rules 14 under the solution proposed by the board which was subsequently approved by the ga in its resolution 51217 the secretaryg eneral would continue to make available to the unjspf the services of the pd and the hcc

understood that the officials and offices would in arriving at their recommendations follow the relevant financial regulations and rules and b the secretary would in this regard also adhere to the financial regulations and rules it being unders tood that under compelling circumstances those rules themselves provide for w aivers of certain requirements as referred to below 16 as separate matter the general assembly agreed t authorize the secretary of the pension board to undertake in certain limi ted and exceptional instances contracting and procurement activities for the fund directly on its own authority 17 the unjspf general procedure 56rev 1 guideli nes for undertaking direct procurement action dated 30 september 1999 provided that the instances referred to above which were expected to be quite rare are i when the unptd could not complete the process with in the required time frame ii when the secretary was unable to accept particula r recommendation made by the pd or by the hcc or iii when the pd informed the secretary that particula r contract could not be carried out by that office employment of consultants by unjspf 18 the unjspf also adopted procedures regarding the em ployment of consultants these are set out in the memorandum f understanding on personnel 4 policy and procedures for unjspf dated 30 june 2000 between the then ceo of the unjspf and the then assistant secretarygeneral for human resources management of the it provides that the unjspf shall fol low guidelines for the usage of consultants gratis personnel and retirees as s et out in various administrative instructions issued on the basis of general asse mbly mandates and further that consultants would be selected through competit ive process and an evaluation will be undertaken of the project work performed b supplier prequalification procedures 19 in march 1998 the issued revised procurement manual establishing more comprehensive process for evaluating the quali fications of companies that were permitted to bid on and perform contracts the procurement manual has been subsequently revised 20 the 1998 procurement manual provided that the selec tion of suppliers for solicitations of contractors was to be based pri marily on the supplier roster of registered suppliers although contractor could be awarded contract without first having been qualified for the supplier roster such contractor was registered on temporary basis and was required to successfully complete registration within 180 days in order to remain on the qualified supplier r oster in addition before awarding any contract to company not on the supplier roste r the pd was obligated to ensure that the supplier was qualified c competitive bidding requirements 21 in february 2001 when consultant company was award ed its first unjspf contract following competitive bidding organized by the pd the financial regulations and rules and the procurement rules of the specified that contracts for services required competitive bidding and that the award generally must be made to the lowest acceptable bidder in essence the app licable procedure is as follows 22 in coordination with the substantive office requ esting procurement action the pd was tasked with administering the co mpetitive bidding process beginning with the preparation of request for pro posal rfp which was then issued to companies that had been determined by the pd to be qualified to bid on the contract the rfp contains comprehensive and unambi guous technical specificationsdescriptions of the scope of the wor k to enable suppliers to compete fairly 23 after receipt of proposals they were reviewed to d etermine if they substantially met the terms of the rfp and if the b idder possessed sufficient facilities personnel and managerial capabilities to perform th contract satisfactorily 24 after due consideration of the bidding information the pd would recommend company to receive the contract award in keeping with the interests of fairness and transparency in the bidding process the financial rules provided that each determination or decision required of an authorized purchasing officer be supported by written findings of that officer to be placed i n the appropriate case file maintained by the responsible department or office 5 25 it is important to note at this point that rule 40 3 of the 1998 procurement manual suppliers recommended by requisitioners or consultant provides that suppliers should not be recommended by requisitione rs or substantive offices such practice undermines the principles of segregation of responsibilities between requisitioning and procure ment entities in exceptional circumstances if such recommendations are received procurement officers will evaluate in consultation with chief of sectiondivision with due care the desirability f retaining the recommended vendor in the invitees list furthermor consultant who has been engaged to prepare or review the specifica tions andor to assist in the evaluation of proposals should not be allowed to recommend vendors for the tender or itself submit n offer 26 the 1998 procurement manual also required that the pd recommendation be subject to review by the headquarters committee on contracts hcc and the approval of the assistant secretarygeneral for the office of central support services if the contract was greater than us200000 the pu rpose of the hcc review was to verify that the proposed procurement action was in accordance with the united nations financial regulations and rules and that th recommendation for an award was based on fairness integrity and transparency d ethical rules relevant to the award of contract s 27 party contracting with the must warrant that n official has received or will be offered any direct or indirect benefit s result of the contract moreover the contractor must acknowledge that breach of th is warranty would constitute breach of an essential term of the contract 28 apart from the above contractual condition the has promulgated ethical standards that govern the manner in which staff mem bers must discharge their duties these standards are contained in the charter of the charter the staff regulations of the staff regulations and th staff rules of the staff rules all of which are definite and binding on t he organization and its staff 29 among other things the regulations and rules provi that staff members shall conduct themselves at all times in manner b efitting their status as international civil servants and shall not engage in any activity

and impartiality that are required by that status 6 30 they further provide that staff members shall not u their office or knowledge gained from their official functions for private gain financial or otherwise or for the private gain of any third party includi ng family friends and those they favour 7 6 staff regulation 12 f 7 staff regulation 12 g 6 31 similarly staff rule 1012 n requires each staff member to inform the secretarygeneral if dealing in his or her offic ial capacity with any matter involving an entity in which he or she holds fi nancial interest directly or indirectly and to eliminate the conflict either by divesting the interest or ending any involvement in the matter unless authorized by the secretarygeneral 32 furthermore any form of discrimination or harassme nt including sexual or gender harassment as well as physical or verbal ab use at the workplace in connection with work is prohibited 8 33 the report on standards of conduct in the inter national civil service 1954 1954 standards guided the staff in executing their duties and was replaced in 2001 by the standards of conduct for the internatio nal civil service 2001 2001 standards although not binding the 1954 standa rds and the 2001 standards provide additional guidance on conflict of interest issues for example the 1954 standards warn that repeated instances of partialit or bias would do serious harm to the organization the 2001 standards provide as re gards procurement and hiring that international civil servants should avoid assi sting private bodies or persons in their dealings with their organization where this m ight lead to actual or perceived preferential treatment the 2001 standards also provide additional guidance on working relationships staff management relations

investigation team v investigative details 39 the memorandum of staff members 1 and 2 did not provide information about the identity of those alleged to have breache d the rules on conflict of interest rather it speaks about senior consult ant referred to as the former boss of the current officer of imss who consistently btained through front company contracts from the unjspf thereby making huge pro fits in an endless cycle of new projects and extension and who has received from u njspf year after year over us350000 as salary 40 further it suggests waste of resources in conn ection with the contracts awarded for information technology services on the grounds that despite millions spent basic activities required by the fund have still not been computerized staff members 1 and 2 state in their memorandum that all documents they possessed were available upon request however when interviewed by idoios they could not produce any documentation to support their allegati ons when queried on this issue both stated that their information was based on fidential reports which they received mostly from unjspf staff members in their capacity of staff representatives and suggested that idoios should obtain relevant i nformation and documentation from these staff 41 following specific investigative steps the oio s investigators established that the persons referred to in the

advised himher that heshe d identified contractor with experience to undertake the necessary work and rec ommended that the unjspf enter into fivemonth contract with consultant co mpany starting in june 1998 at cost of us100000 operations officer agreed with these recommendations and heshe and imss officer interviewed consultant comp any president in hisher capacity as systems consultant with consultant comp any 45 citing the urgent necessity of this analysis i n june 1998 unjspf official 1 exercised the discretionary power conferred to him her by the pension board discussed in paragraphs 1617 and entered into an institutional or corporate ica contract with consultant company without competitiv bidding 46 in late 1998 when it became apparent that cons ultant companys study required more time unjspf official 1 authorized an other ica contract with consultant company without competitive bidding for two months however heshe emphasized that heshe did not wish that unjspf be documented as following the route of exceptions more often than adhering to est ablished procedures 9 47 however the record shows that despite these in structions by unjspf official 1 consultant company received an additional seven ica contracts from unjspf for total of nine contracts without competitive biddi ng the rationale provided by the unjspf on each succeeding contract was that consult ant company was familiar with the project and that it would take too much time an d money to get another vendor up to speed the award of these contracts was authori zed by unjspf official 1 9 unjspf official 1s handwritten note related dated 16 december 1998 on this issue addressed to operations officer and imss officer reads as follo ws it seems to that the options before are delay the exercise so we can go through competitive bidding involving break in t he work and loss of monetary or b bite the bullet and go with another exceptio nal approval for now my decision clearly has to be b at the same time we must ma ke greater efforts in our planning so as to avoid such limited options i recognize th work demands and time pressures but we must begin reviews of contract ex pirations 4 to 6 months in advance i urgerequest that this be done and mec hanism of checks and actions be followed in this regard beginning with the first l ine supervisor for the projects concerned and then involving the next one or two yers or supervisors and the executive officer i do not wish that unjspf be documented as following the ro ute of exceptions more often than adhering to establish ed

these contracts consultant company received p ayments totaling us34345038 48 idoios found evidence that unjspf considere d candidates other than consultant company for any of these contracts sim ilarly there is evidence that unjspf made any checks on the background of consult ant company independently for example by requesting db report on consulta nt company or that unjspf attempted to independently determine whether consul tant company presidents fees were consistent with those charged by other consult ants andor companies which provide similar type of service b contracts awarded

contract and procurement official 1 signe d on behalf of the 51 the review of the documentation related to the above contract disclosed the following vendor registration 10 52 first prior to 3 january 2001 consultant comp any was not registered 10 vendor of the and therefore was not on the roste r of vendors however article 50101 of the procurement manual version 31 march 1998 that was in effect at the time provided that entry onto the roster can be by unregistered supplier being awarded united nations contract 11 hence consultant company could be awarded the contract although not registered vendor 53 nevertheless article 60401 selection of sup pliers and public advertisement for tenders provides that the selection of suppli ers for solicitations should be made in way which ensures the integrity of the process and the confidence of all users suppliers and oversight bodies the selection proc ess should rely on the professional judgment of the procurement division pd and should be based primarily on the supplier roster of registered suppliers emphasis added 54 idoios noted on the above points that on 3 jan uary 2001 procurement officer 1 assigned to this matter made handwritt note in the buyers action log special form designed to record the activi ty undertaken by procurement officers in the case that imss officer wants the m consultant company included 55 during hisher interview with the oios investig ators procurement officer 1 confirmed that imss officer told himher then that heshe wanted to have consultant company included on the list of invitees although i t was not registered supplier heshe pointed out however that the request by im ss officer to have consultant company included in the list was not unusual becaus requisitioners sometimes made such requests to ensure that many potential vendors are included 56 as noted in paragraph 25 article 403 of the 1 998 procurement manual specifically clarifies the principle of segregation of responsibilities between requisitioning and procurement entities performance bond and favouritism 57 procurement officer 1 also noted that although the rfp required performance bond of 20 of the total net amount of the contract or standby letter of credit the contract was amended to provide that in lieu of performance bond consultant company was to defer its initial invoice of us50000 for february 2001 heshe said that hisher then supervisor procureme nt official 1 made this decision procurement official 1 told idoios that pd readily accepted retention of the first invoice in lieu of the performance bond however this concession served the interest of consultant company not that of the 58 on this issue idoios noted that when the hcc questioned the fact that consultant company did not confirm its ability to p rovide performance bond or letter of credit they were informed jointly by the pd and unjspf that consultant 10 consultant company was registered provisionally on 3 january 2001 but was not registered formally until 11 february 2002 11 50101 continues to state that such registratio n will be on temporary basis for period of 180 days 6 months or the duration of the contract whi chever is longer 11 company had verbally confirmed their ability to do so nevertheless the contract was amended on 14 march 2001 to read it has been mutually agreed that in lieu of the receiving standby lc performance bond from consultant company ltd to ensure the complete and timely receipt of the tangiblesthat c onsultant company ltd will defer the initial invoice of us50 000 for february 2001 this deferred invoice will be held by the until satisfactory completion of the contract consultant company president signed on behalf of co nsultant company and procurement official 2 on behalf of the 59 however the payment history extracted from the unjspf accounting system shows that all invoices submitted by consultant com pany under the first contract had been paid without deferral the table below mmarizes information in the two preceding paragraphs on the above contract action date action date of elapsed days contract signed 050201 performance bond amendment date 140301 37 days invoice 1

60 as shown in the table above actual payment ter ms in most cases were less than net 30 days although the contract specified n et 30 days moreover the initial invoice was not deferred as provided in the 14 marc h 2001 amendment 61 when asked whether heshe knew that consultant company president had supervised imss officer before the latter had joine d the procurement officer 1 replied in the negative heshe stated that had he she known this heshe would have scrutinized the contract more carefully for exampl by looking more closely at the evaluation criteria used and would have tried to g et better understanding of the project heshe added that imss officer should hav distanced himherself from the whole procurement process to avoid situation of ctual or alleged conflict of interest 62 idoios noted with surprise that company 2 an international company with over 100 years history and worldwide presence and thousands of employees scored lower in the area of web experience than consulta nt company small company established in 1985 located and operated by consult ant company president from the basement of hisher home the technical evaluation was performed in unjspf by team in which imss officer participated as the chie f of imss 12 award of contract 63 the record disclosed that the unjspf had inform ed the pd and the hcc that its standing committee had approved funding for add itional new projects related to the engineering of several functions within the fun ds operations area and that the mandated timeframe for the implementation of those projects was extremely short requiring completion by december 2002 unjspf argu ed that this timeframe was achievable if the proper resources were identified and assigned to the projects early in the process 64 considering the above factors and in view of t he complexities and costs involved in the project the unjspf recommended c ontinuation of its relationship with consultant company however the documentatio n examined suggests that the scope of the additional work went beyond the strate gic it and management consulting to the establishment of project manage ment infrastructure and to the further refining of the unjspf member organization technology assessment and needs analysis study this appears to be separat exercise that if properly done required separate solicitation procedure and sele ction of supplier 65 as result of the first part of the work stra tegic information technology and management consulting study for the unjspf consul tant company produced report which recommended that the unjspf undertake further study of the technological requirements and also set up projec t management office idoios notes that this was the subject of the next contrac t awarded to consultant company 66 finally idoios further noted that in the reco mmendations of its report consultant company specifically suggested that the unjspf it project team should consist of director who must be an it profession grade staff member and project manager who need not be unjspf staff mem ber this contract ended on 1 february 2002 and on 1 march 2002 unjspf gave consu ltant company two sole source contracts for total of three months from 1 march 2002 to 1 june 2002 for total of us90000 to undertake project management duties still required second contract 67 following second solicitation

us600000 this contract was signed on 29 may 2 002 by consultant company president on behalf of consultant company and by procurement official 1 on behalf of the 68 procurement records show that the pd issued the rfp to 50 vendors inviting them to submit up to three proposed candidates by the closing date the pd had received 14 proposals with resumes of 22 candidates unjspf evaluated the candidates and shortlisted five for interviews tha t were conducted by imss officer and procurement officer 2 consultant company was the only firm to have met the minimum threshold of 80 percent however idoios could not determine how the scores were actually arrived at given that the doc uments pertaining to the interviews conducted with the shortlisted candidates such as the questions asked and their answers were not in the file 13 69 the contract provides that in lieu of providing the with performance bond consultant company would defer 10 of each mo nthly invoice for cumulative performance holdback of us60000 over t he term of the contract however idoios noted that during the rfp clarific ations which were available to all the potential bidders there was question as to whether the performance bond could be waived for that rfp the response was tha t the performance bond is requirement and would not be waived however proc urement official 1 told idoios that the decision to permit consultant comp any to defer one of its invoices in lieu of providing bond was an acceptable solut ion for the 70 unjspf set forth procedures for payment of invo ices approved by unjspf official 2 on 12 september 1995 it states that imssrelated charges for contractors are to be sent to chief of imss for preliminary app roval and then submitted to the executive officer through the chief of operations for payment the chief of imss is to monitor all imss related payments in coopera tion with the executive office 71 review of documentation revealed that in fact there was deferral of any portion of the invoices for this contract in addi tion this contract was amended twice each time extending funding for consultant company presidents services as provided by consultant company for year and retaining all other provisions of the second contract during the term of the first amendment the full amount of each invoice was paid except for the last four invoices from w hich 10 of the contract price was withheld per invoice in accordance with the contrac t provisions the outstanding balance on this contract was paid to consultant com pany 12 days after the date of its last invoice the first payment on the second ame nded contract the only payment made at the time of the idoios review also had 10 of the invoiced amount withheld from consultant company 72 during its meeting the hcc made several querie s in relation to this contract the hcc recommended that the position be regularize d as staff post or that consultant be retained on short term contract bo th of which alternatives would result in lesser expenditure of funds although supporting information was provided in the minutes procurement officer 2 and imss officer who attended that meeting asserted to the hcc that the contract amount was in the midrange of the prices submitted by the companies b the candidat was the most qualified and c ohrm would not offer contract longer than six mon ths idoios also noted that when interviewed imss officer stated that consulta nt company president would only work as contractor which provided hisher p rotection under us corporation laws and paid more than heshe would receive as c onsultant 73 the unjspf informed the hcc that consultant com pany president had worked on several unjspf projects the last of whic h was in 2000 however idoios notes that consultant company had held to tal of ten contracts with unjspf at that point 74 the hcc approved the contract but taking into account the nature of the work and the likelihood that the project requirements wo uld continue well beyond 31 may 2004 it recommended that the unjspf make renewed fforts to have the function regularized as staff post 14 75 when asked to comment on the two pd contracts f or consultant company and the actions by hisher subordinates procurement of ficial 1 confirmed to idoios that heshe had had discussions with unjspf representati ves during which the latter had complained to himher that the pd takes too long to complete the contracting process through competitive bidding therefore the unjspf explained that it needed to resort to the award of direct contracts as per the discretionary power given to its secretary 76 procurement official 1 further advised that dur ing hisher discussions with unjspf official 1 operations officer and imss offi cer heshe told them that they could not continue to provide consultant company pr esident with institutional contracts and further told them that they should ma ke greater effort to go through competitive bidding through pd alternatively hes he suggested that the unjspf could retain consultant company president through t he use of ssas nevertheless heshe continued to support these contracts 77 procurement official 1 further commented that t he pd had experts in that specific scope of work and had to rely heavily on t he substantive office for details procurement officer 2 informed idoios that heshe was new to pd when assigned to the second contract and sought guidance from pro curement official 1 and information from imss officer 78 procurement official 1 said that heshe was not aware of the prior relationship between imss officer and consultant company preside nt heshe commented that the unjspf should have advised the pd of the matter in which case heshe would have suggested that imss officer not be involved in the technical evaluation portion of the procurement ex procurement exercise 79 the contract was brought up for proposed one year extension with an additional optional one year extension at the hcc at that time the hcc reiterated its earlier recommendation to have the function of project management office coordinator regularized as staff post instead of outsourcing it at high level of remuneration relationship between imss officer and consultant co mpany president 80 the evidence obtained by the oios investigators disclosed that the allegation that consultant company president had supervised im ss officer before the latter joined the is true this was confirmed by the p 11 form 12 dated 21 may 1990 submitted by imss officer to the prior to hishe r recruitment and through interviews conducted with unjspf staff members inc luding senior managers and imss officer and consultant company president 81 procurement official 2 and operations officer t old idoios that imss officer had informed them of hisher prior professi onal relationship with consultant company president as early as 1998 when consultant company president was 12 imss officer stated on the p11 that consultant co mpany president was hisher supervisor from august 1981 through march 1987 at company 1 imss officer also listed consultant company president as reference although the p11 specifi that one listed as supervisor cannot be also l isted as reference 15 awarded the first of the series of successive contr acts by unjspf both stated that they were very satisfied with the work done by cons ultant company president at the unjspf similarly other unjspf staff interviewed i n connection with the same matter stated that they had either heard andor kne w directly from consultant company president andor imss officer that they had worked together 82 however the oios noted that unjspf official 1 and unjspf official 3 and none of the pd staff members involved in the procur ement of contracts awarded to consultant company were aware of this prior relatio nship 83 when asked by idoios why the unjspf had awarde d repeated contracts to consultant company presidentconsultant company wit hout competitive bidding all unjspf staff involved with the matter including th most senior managers replied that the unjspf has special status that the proj ects were both urgent and important and that resorting to the pd would have been too consuming they all also stated that consultant company president provided xcellent work for the unjspf 84 however other interviewees who were not involv ed in the consultant company procurements offered different account first most of them especially those who were not aware of the prior relationship between imss officer and consultant company president advised idoios of th general perception prevalent within the unjspf that there was possible conflic t of interest between the two as one staff member said we all knew that it was abo ut friend giving business to friend 85 when asked to comment on the allegation of wast of resources in connection with the contracts awarded for the information tech nology services most of those interviewed advised that they could see results and rejected the allegation that basic operations were still performed manually actions by imss officer 86 the investigatory record shows that imss office r had been instrumental in the process regarding the recruitment of consult ant company president by the unjspf b prepared or was involved in the prepar ation of all subsequent unjspf documentation on the contracts awarded by unjspf to consultant company c supervised and evaluated the work performed by cons ultant company president d certified that the services rendered by consultant company president had been adequate requirement before payment was made an d liaised with and assisted pd staff members in the preparation of documentatio n regarding the contracts awarded to consultant company following competitive bidding these activities by imss officer included the technical assessmenteval uation of the companies which responded to the rfps issued by pd and the intervie wing of short listed candidates for the second contract interview of imss officer 87 when interviewed by idoios imss officer ackno wledged that consultant company president had been hisher supervisor befor heshe joined the united nations but that was more than ten years prior to the first unjspf contract with 16 consultant company however heshe rejected the legations of collusion between himherself and consultant company president claim ing that heshe recommended consultant company president to the unjspf because heshe thought hisher highly qualified and experienced and that heshe would be able to resolve the problems which were affecting the unjspf especially the the n urgent y2k issue 88 imss officer offered to provide idoios hisher personal financial records bank accounts to show heshe had not received kic kback review of the records heshe did provide did not reveal any payments or t ransactions that appeared suspicious or improper relevant to this investigati on 13 interview of consultant company president 89 consultant company president first refused to m eet with the oios investigators in connection with this investigation and suggested that they speak with hisher lawyers however after intervention from the unjspf management heshe met with the investigators at hisher home which h as the same address as consultant company 90 during hisher interview consultant company pr esident confirmed hisher prior working relationship with imss officer howe ver heshe rejected the allegations of collusion between himherself and im ss officer arguing that the unjspf selected himher because heshe was the bes t qualified person in hisher field 91 at the request of the oios investigators consu ltant company president supplied documentation which was not be located in the relevant procurement file such as copy of the certificate of incorporation for consultant company however consultant company president refused to provide fin ancial information about consultant company such as data on tax returns on the income received as payment under contracts awarded by the and idoios has n means to compel himher vi findings 92 as outlined in the introduction of this report idoios set out to answer the following three questions was the selection of consultant company conducted i n accordance with the united nations financial and procurement regul ations including the competitive bidding rules b did imss officer have prior relationship with sultant company president and did hisher actions on the selection of consultant company president and the contracts awarded to consultant c ompany amount to conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest and violate the united nations charter and staff conflict of intere st rules 13 idoios has authority to obtain bank records or banking information about staff or others 17 c were the actions of persons other than imss officer on this procurement proper within the context of procurement procedu res was the selection of consultant company conducted i n accordance with the united nations financial and procurement regulations inc luding the competitive bidding rules 93 the investigatory record clearly shows that nei ther the unjspf nor the pd followed all the established rules on procurement i n connection with consultant company unjspf ica contracts 94 in the case of the unjspf the evidence shows t hat consultant company president was the only candidate considered for the work undertaken under the contracts awarded to consultant company and it vio lated its own procedures regarding direct procurement in connection with the contracts awarded to consultant company 95 further the evidence shows that rather than re lying quasiexclusively on information provided by imss officer given hisher relationship with consultant company president who is for all intents and purpo ses consultant company the unjspf managers should have tried to obtain informa tion about consultant company independently for example by requesting db report before awarding successive contracts to the company 96 similarly there is evidence that the unjspf managers attempted to establish independently whether the fees charged by consultant company president were indeed consistent with those charged for simil ar work by other consultantscompanies 97 even if one were to accept as reasonable the aw ard of the first ica contract to consultant company the explanations provided on th further extensions are not satisfactory indeed unjspf official 1 when he she was asked to extend the first contract with consultant company stated that the u njspf should comply with established procurement procedures rather than rely on exceptions but that did not occur procurement department contracts 98 in the case of the pd while there were competi tive bidding exercises for the two contracts awarded to consultant company the ir regularities noted in this report raise questions about the integrity of the procurem ent process based upon the evidence adduced idoios finds that the pd violate d its rules on these procurements 99 for example as noted above consultant company failed to provide the performance bond andor letter of credit required b contract 1 and the rpf for contract 2 furthermore despite the amendment of contract 1 which allowed the deferral of one of its initial invoices and the co ntract 2 provision requiring deferral 18 of percentage of each invoice there was reaso nable explanation from pd as to why these exceptions were allowed 100 further the fact that the pd relied heavily n the technical evaluation by the unjspf which rated consultant company higher than well established companies such as company 2 and the fact that the interviewi ng process of candidates by the pd and the unjspf was not properly documented similar ly raise questions about the integrity of the process did imss officer have prior relationship with sultant company president and did hisher actions on the selection of consultant company president and the contracts awarded to consultant company amount to conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest and violate th united nations charter and staff conflict of interest rules 101 there is dispute that imss officer and cons ultant company president had prior relationship but idoios found evidence that imss officer held directly or indirectly any financial interest in consultant company 102 similarly there is evidence that imss offi cer had otherwise colluded with consultant company president for example by receiv ing improper gifts or remuneration from the latter in exchange for assist ing with unjspf contracts the refusal of consultant company to provide access to its financial records raised doubts in this regard which are not resolved 103 there is evidence however that by hisher ac tions starting from the day when heshe recommended the recruitment of consultant co mpany president until the award of the last contract to consultant company i mss officer placed himherself into position which created the appearance of c onflict of interest and favouritism towards consultant company president notable in th absence of competitive bidding at the unjspf and the pd and the lack of proper doc umentation on high ratings to consultant company presidents firm additionally the actions of imss officer in approving consultant companys invoices under the p d contracts without noting the required deferral of funds in lieu of performance bond was to consultant companys benefit and the unjspfs detriment were the actions of persons other than imss officer on this procurement free from impropriety 104 as regards the actions of persons other than c onsultant company president idoios finds that albeit to varying degrees the actions of both present and former unjspf managers notably operations officer and pd staff members notably procurement official 1 involved in the consultant company procurements had direct impact on the appearance of conflict of inte rest and favouritism in this case specifically operations officer failed to properly manage the contracts awarded to consultant company heshe simply accepted imss of ficers recommendations of the use of consultant company presidentconsultant company despite serial exceptions to procurement regulations and practices which left the unprotected procurement official 1 approved the substitution of the requirement of performance bond by consultant company which was contrary to t he best interests of the 19 with reason for doing so compliance with estab lished procurement rules and procedures would have avoided or greatly reduced th appearance of conflict of interest moreover the apparently careless disreg ard for established procedures in the continued utilization of consultant company cannot be said to serve the best interests of the additional allegations of the memorandum 105 as mentioned in the introduction of this repor t in addition to the allegations pertaining to procurement irregularities the memor andum by staff members 1 and 2 also referred to personnel related matters which i nclude allegations of favouritism discrimination and harassment 106 although idoios did not specifically investig ate these allegations based upon interviews conducted with both unjspf managers and staff from several sections of the unjspf idoios comments on several related issues as follows 107 first as regards the complaint by staff membe rs 1 and 2 although the memorandum purported to represent the unjspf staff at large most unjspf staff interviewed by the oios advised that they were not consulted about these issues and commented that the memo did not represent their vie ws 108 similarly most interviewees strongly objected to the fact that staff members 1 and 2 copied the memorandum to people not involved with the unjspf such as the chairman of the fifth committee and the vicechairm an of the acabq 109 further the unjspf managers and most unjspf s taff told idoios that staff members 1 and 2 had personal interest in co mplaining against the unjspf management because they had either pending appeals against management andor felt that they were not treated fairly idoios finds t hat while staff have the right to address complaints this right should be exercised in manner consistent with their obligations as staff members 110 despite these issues many unjspf staff interv iewed did feel that there is insufficient communication between managers and sta ff and that there is lack of transparency especially in recruitment and promoti on cases as well as in extension of employment beyond retirement age most added that m ore action in this respect was needed on the part on the ohrm specific cases 111 although several examples of perceived favouri tism as regards promotions were provided to idoios investigators numerous co mments were made about one particular case involving an alleged intimate affai r between supervisor and hisher subordinate and also about the manner in which the unjspf management handled it 112 the interviewees commented that the supervisor in question failed to maintain proper boundaries between hisher professional and personal life and exhibited bias in the performance assessment of the subordinate whom heshe favoured which had negative effect on the workplace environment of tha t office 20 113 after the alleged affair ended idoios was to ld that the supervisor harassed the subordinate and denied himher promotion the interviewees further advised that the relationship between the two staff was well kno wn in that office and that it adversely effected the normal relationship within t hat particular unit several interviewees added that the above mentioned subordi nate staff surreptitiously taped hisher supervisor and played the tape to whoever wanted to listen 114 the oios subsequently learned that although bo th the unjspf management and ohrm were aware of the alleged affair the supe rvisor left the unjspf and formal inquiry was initiated on the matter vii recommendations 115 in light of the evidence adduced the oios
