overview summary faced with spring planting decisions and the prospect of having to operate farm programs under outdated permanent agricultural statutes because of expiring provisions in the 1990 farm law the house and senate passed omnibus farm legislation in the early months of 1996 following quick resolution of the house senate bill differences the president signed hr 2854 the federal agriculture improvement and reform act also called the 1996 farm bill on april 4 1966 pl 104127 at the core of us farm policy are federal programs that support farm income and some commodity prices the 1996 law makes substantial policy changes to many of these programs it replaces the earlier target price deficiency payment system for grains and cotton with predetermined and capped annual contract payments to participating producers through 2002 payments are tied to overall crop history rather than to individual crops and longer are linked to market prices earlier nonrecourse commodity loan and marketing loan repayment provisions are largely maintained however the new law ends annual federal acreage reduction and strict planting requirements with respect to the other federally supported farm commodities the new law 1 reauthorizes the dairy price support program but phases it out by the end of 1999 and requires consolidation of federal milk marketing orders and 2 extends the sugar and peanut programs for 7 years with some modifications but keeps largely intact their broad program structures the trade title of the new law extends through fy2002 authority for the export enhancement program eep and market access program map formerly the market promotion program or mpp the dairy export incentive program deip export credit guarantees and pl 480 food aid programs the conservation title of the new law builds on conservation initiatives enacted in 1985 and 1990 and in major departure from previous policy converts the majority of conservation spending to entitlements by financing them with commodity credit corporation ccc funds the new law also authorizes new structure for the delivery of rural development assistance that increases states discretion over the allocation of federal rural development funds and authorizes an annual transfer of 100 million from the us treasury for 3 years to establish fund for rural america extensions of funding authority and revisions to agricultural research programs credit and crop insurance are also in the new law the food title of the fair act extends the food stamp program through fy1998 and the commodity donation programs through fy2002 and authorizes funding for new communitybased food security projects major costreducing changes to the food stamp program and authority for the program through fy2002 are

traditionally modifies and renews many us department of agriculture usda programs through omnibus legislation called farm bill federal programs that support many farmers income and certain commodity prices have traditionally been the core of omnibus farm bills1 additionally farm bill typically includes modifications to programs affecting soil and water conservation forestry domestic and foreign food assistance export market development agricultural research and education farm credit and rural development many of the provisions of the previous farm bill the food agriculture conservation and trade act of 1990 pl 101624 expired at the end of fiscal or calendar year 1995 others were due to expire at the end of the 1995 crop or marketing year when the 104th congress began consideration of new farm bill in 1995 the farm sector by most measures of economic performance was faring relatively well although some farmers in some regions had suffered production disasters due to drought or floods or experienced low market prices farm income and farm equity had increased overall in the previous 5 years consumers were also faring well with modest increases in food prices most of which were driven by higher marketing costs rather than higher farm prices nonetheless questions pertaining to us competitiveness perceived inequities in the distribution of program benefits the general economic wellbeing of todays farm households and the comparatively small role of farming in the employment and income base of many rural communities were all forces shaping the commodity program debate in addition commodity price support programs are always key issue in the farm and budget debates in part because so many farm belt producers rely on them each year to supplement their incomes and also because 70 or more of harvested us cropland is planted to these crops over the past decade annual outlays for the grains and cotton programs have averaged about 94 billion or 70 of the average of 135 billion in total annual outlays for all farm commodity support making grains and cotton prominent targets in the search for budgetary savings 1 the federal government has provided commodity price support for producers of food grains wheat rice feed grains corn sorghum barley oats rye cotton oilseeds soybeans sunflower seed canola rapeseed safflower mustard seed flaxseed peanuts sugar cane and beets and milk the tobacco program is authorized separately under the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 as amended 7 usc 13111316 and 7 usc 1445 the wool and mohair price support programs previously authorized under the national wool act of 1954 as amended ended with the 1995 marketing year under the provisions of pl 103130 crs2 the 104th congress began 1995 with consideration of new farm policies to replace the expiring law high on its agenda however the year ended without enactment of major farm bill which was caught up in congressional efforts to balance the budget in 7 years the fy1996 budget resolution that congress completed on june 29 1995 had assumed 488 billion reduction in mandatory usda spending over 7 years when compared with the february 1995 congressional budget office cbo baseline 134 billion for agricultural programs nearly 20 reduction 304 billion for food stamps approximately 10 reduction and 46 billion nearly 6 reduction for child nutrition programs in late november 1995 congress cleared for the president reconciliation measure hr 2491 intending to save 123 billion in farm commodity and other agricultural programs and 391 billion for food stamps child feeding and other domestic nutrition programs sweeping savings and structural changes in domestic nutrition programs also were included in massive welfare reform bill hr 4 that was vetoed by the president subsequent welfare reform bill which was enacted contained somewhat moderated but still substantial changes in domestic feeding programs shortly after the president vetoed the 7year budget bill on december 6 1995 and before subsequent white housecongressional budget talks faltered cbo updated its baseline to december 1995 projecting usda commodity credit corporation ccc spending under current services at about 487 billion over 7 years compared with 566 billion in its previous february baseline the 8 billion lower agriculture spending number reflected economists assumption that higher than expected grain and cotton prices would necessitate smaller federal farm payments which were directly tied to market prices under the expiring law thus many agricultural interests began arguing that farm program cuts should be scaled back to fit the lower baseline projections or that the higher than needed savings be redirected to increases in such areas as conservation or rural development in the wake of the budget impasse congressional farm leaders returned to work on freestanding farm bill the first action came in the house agriculture committee which reported freestanding bill the agricultural market transition act hr 2854 on january 30 1996 on february 7 the full senate bypassing agriculture committee action cleared 6432 its own farm bill the agricultural reform and improvement act s 1541 later readopted as hr 2854 to satisfy procedural requirements which contained essentially the same commodity provisions but dairy title as in the house bill like the house bill the senate legislation included major conservation and international trade and aid titles in addition to new commodity price support measures however it was more wide ranging than the house committee bill with additional titles adopted during floor debate covering research agricultural credit rural development and food stamps among others2 2 on february 27 1996 house agriculture committee chairman pat roberts introduced separate measure the agricultural and regulatory relief and trade act hr 2973 containing research conservation trade rural development credit and other provisions and said that he only wanted to consider this bill after work on hr 2854s 1541 was finished momentum to consider this legislation was lost when the conferees on hr 2854 acted to continued crs3 on february 29 1996 the full house passed 270155 hr 2854 containing commodity and related provisions that paralleled those in the vetoed balanced budget act key and controversial element of the plan called for replacing farm income support for grains and cotton with 7 years of fixed but declining payments disconnected both from actual market prices for commodities and from most usda planting requirements other provisions of hr 2854 would have extended but modified the sugar peanut and dairy programs major amendments were adopted on the house floor that significantly altered the agriculture committee version adopted on january 30 1996 this included major changes to the dairy title and expansion of the conservation and agricultural trade and aid titles of the committee version other major floor amendments were not successful including those to 1 phase out the peanut and sugar programs and traditional grains and cotton programs 2 mandate 35 billion in additional spending for rural development 3 divert 19 billion from commodity program subsidies into research and 4 substitute farm bill similar to the senate version after hr 2854 was reported by the house agriculture committee the congressional budget office cbo estimated that the overall bill would achieve 7 year savings of about 54 billion below the current services spending baseline projected in december 1995 however the various floor amendments notably conservation would have reduced this savings estimate possibly by as much as 3 billion or more the entire senatepassed bill would have resulted in 7year savings of just under 1 billion according to cbo estimates once the house approved its farm bill on february 29 1996 efforts began immediately to work out the differences between the two chambers versions members of congress were under pressure from farmers facing spring planting in only few weeks furthermore the lack of new farm law would have placed the usda in the position of having to implement wheat and feed grain programs mandated by the permanent authority of the agricultural act of 1949 the policy mechanisms of the permanent law are generally considered to be inappropriate in the current economic environment as they can cause significant budget exposure on march 21 1996 conferees completed action on the substantial differences between the senate and house bills among the differences that proved most difficult to resolve were dairy policy rural development programs and whether or not to preserve the 1949 permanent mandatory support authority the conference agreement which passed the senate by vote of 7426 and the house by vote of 31889 ended up looking more like the senate bill but with some important differences the president signed the bill the federal agriculture improvement and reform act fair act or 1996 farm bill into law on april 4 1996 pl 104 127 the fair act is projected to result in outlays of roughly 60 billion over the next 7 years more than 21 billion below baseline spending estimates under previous law as estimated by cbo approximately 44 billion of these outlays are 2 continued expand the conference bill to match the scope of the senateapproved farm bill s 1541 crs4 for the commodity export and other programs funded through ccc mandatory spending in the bill for conservation and related programs accounts for nearly 13 billion of the estimated outlays these outlays along with additional spending on rural development and several smaller items serve to offset much of the projected commodity program savings in the bill these figures exclude the cost of and any projected savings in the food stamp program which was reauthorized in the fair act with virtually changes for only 2 years and commodity distribution programs which the act extended for 7 years savings in the food stamp program were achieved later as part of comprehensive welfare reform legislation pl 104193 hr 3734 this law is projected by the cbo to reduce total federal spending for food programs by 26 billion over 6 years of which 233 billion will be savings in the food stamp program achieved primarily by placing restrictions on eligibility and by reducing benefits reductions in spending for the child nutrition programs account for the balance of the projected savings for more information see crs reports 96903 the us department of agriculture appropriations for fy1997 and 96304 the 1996 farm bill comparison of selected provisions with previous law major provisions of the 1996 fair act title iagricultural market transition act this comprehensive title makes significant changes in the mechanisms by which the federal government provides price support to producers of wheat feed grains cotton rice and oilseeds congress also made changes to the support programs for milk peanuts and sugar in separate subtitles of this title the agricultural market transition program was an idea originally contained in house agriculture chairman pat roberts freedom to farm act hr 2195 subsequently it appeared in the 1995 budget reconciliation bill that the president vetoed h 2491 and then again in the freestanding 1996 senate and house farm bills s 1541 hr 2854 that became the 1996 fair act the program replaces previous target price deficiency payments with fixed production flexibility contract payments for 7 years total funding for contract payments is locked in for 7year period at about 37 billion the proposal largely preserves the existing design and levels of support through nonrecourse commodity loans and marketing loan repayment provisions among the other significant departures from past policy are an end to usdaimposed annual acreage cutbacks and to strict planting requirements the act also retains the permanent authority of the agricultural act of 1949 this was in concession to the minority partys concern that eliminating permanent authority would remove the need to reconsider farm policy when the fair act expires in 2002 and could result in the disappearance of all farm supports relatedly subtitle g of title i establishes commission on 21st century production crs5 agriculture to conduct comprehensive review of domestic agricultural conditions the effects of the new market transition contracts and other factors and to make recommendations for future farm policy initial and final reports are due in june 1998 and january 2001 respectively the elimination of baseacre planting constraints the elimination of annual acreage reduction programs and the relatively broad planting flexibility afforded by the agricultural market transition program are the features that will most affect production agriculture in the coming year farmers are expected to make greater efforts to increase production in response to high prices than would have been possible under the expiring programs for more information see crs report 96351 wheat feed grains cotton rice and oilseeds provisions of the enacted 1996 farm bill dairy the federal government traditionally has used two major policy tools to support milk markets the dairy price support program and federal milk marketing orders usda indirectly supports farm milk prices by its standing offer to purchase surplus dairy products from processors federal milk marketing orders also administered by usda have permanent legislative authority federal orders regulate processors fluid milk bottlers or manufacturers of dairy products that sell milk or milk prod ucts within an order region by requiring them to pay not less than an established minimum price for the grade milk they purchase from dairy producers the new law reauthorizes the dairy price support program including usda authority to purchase surplus cheese butter and nonfat dry milk through december 31 1999 the level of support is maintained at the current level of 1035 per hundredweight cwt for the remainder of 1996 but then drops to 1020 in 1997 1005 in 1998 and 990 in 1999 the program will terminate on december 31 1999 and be replaced on january 1 2000 with recourse loan program for processors of cheese butter and nonfat dry milk to assist them in managing their inventories of these products in return for the lower level of price support and the gradual elimination of the program the deficit reduction assessment paid by milk producers to defray the cost of the price support program under previous law is eliminated the new law also requires reduction in the number of milk marketing orders to at least 10 but more than 14 and gives usda 3 years to administratively achieve this goal if at the end of 3 years usda has not completed the consolidation the department will lose its current authority of assessing producers and processors for the cost of administering milk marketing orders and instead usda will have to absorb the cost in its budget if consolidation is delayed by legal challenge the 3 year deadline given to usda would be extended by the duration of any injunction the structure of federal milk marketing orders has long been the subject of policy debate producer groups in the upper midwest wisconsin and minnesota contend that federal orders are in need of reform while many dairy processors contend that orders are marketdistorting and should be gradually eliminated milk producer groups in the northeast and southeast generally support the current order crs6 system and maintain that any changes to the system should be handled administratively by usda the new law also gave the secretary of agriculture the power to grant the six new england states the authority to enter into regional dairy compact for period of time that would end at the same time as the adoption of marketing order consolidation on august 9 1996 the secretary announced that he had found compelling public interest in such compact thus allowing the six states to begin implementation prior to the farm bill the legislatures of those states had already agreed to enter into dairy compact that would create an interstate commission with the power to set minimum price paid by dairy processors to dairy farmers in the six states at level above the federal minimum price however such compacts must first be approved by congress as required by the us constitution the new england states sought approval for the compact because dairy farm groups in the region maintain that the minimum milk prices dictated by federal orders have not been sufficient to cover the costs of production of familysized farms thus forcing many farmers out of business opponents maintain that the compact will artificially encourage the production of milk within the northeast region at the expense of other parts of the country that have lower production costs and can sell at lower prices separate provision in the new law explicitly permits california to keep in place its higher nonfat solids standards for fluid milk and leaves the national standards unchanged the house agriculture committee version of the farm bill would have increased the national minimum nonfat solids standards of fluid milk to the california level the provision was deleted from hr 2854 on the house floor proponents of an increase in the national standards contend that milk fortified with nonfat solids is better tasting more nutritious product that would likely increase consumer demand for fluid milk the opposition led by dairy processors and some consumer groups counters that fortifying milk with nonfat solids would be so costly that the higher consumer costs would more than offset any positive effects of the higher standards for more information see crs issue brief 95103 dairy policy issues and crs reports 96419 dairy and the 1996 farm bill legislative history and 96 440 dairy provisions of the enacted 1996 farm bill sugar and peanuts both the sugar and peanut programs came under attack during the 104th congress from opponents seeking to take advantage of changed political climate and broader interest in reforming farm programs sugar and peanut users food manufacturing companies proposed outright repeal or significant changes arguing that market forces and not federal controls should determine the availability and price of each commodity some processors ie shellers that prepare peanuts for sale to peanut product manufacturers or export cane sugar refiners that process raw sugar into white sugar ready for human and industrial use proposed reforms they argued were needed to improve their longterm competitiveness as intermediaries in the food marketing chain producers and initial processors of sugar crops and peanut growers acknowledged the need to tackle market orientation and program cost issues and proposed changes to address such concerns crs7 the new law extends the sugar and peanut programs for 7 years and largely keeps intact their broad program structure however some features initially proposed by the sugar and peanut producing sectors were modified to partially respond to the marketoriented objectives sought by users of both commodities sugar the enacted 1996 farm bill authorizes sugar program through 2002 repeals standby restrictions on the marketing of domestically produced sugar freezes price support loan rates at 1995 levels 18 cents per pound for raw sugar 229 centslb for refined beet sugar and increases by 25 the budget deficit reduction marketing assessment rate paid by processors the programs nocost requirement was repealed perhaps inadvertently in the drafting of the bill two controversial provisions responded to sugar user concerns the first authorizes usda to make recourse loans repayable only in cash to raw cane sugar mills and refined beet sugar refiners whenever usda announces fiscal year import quota level lower than 15 million short tons if the quota announced is equal to or not above this level usda will offer nonrecourse loans where growers can forfeit or hand over sugar offered as collateral as full payment the second requires usda to impose about 1 centlb penalty on any processor having taken out nonrecourse loan who forfeits sugar to the ccc the production sector opposed this provision which was pushed by some sugar users seeking an opening to gain possible access to lower priced sugar in general the three most affected interest groups growers and sugar processors cane refiners and sugar users were somewhat dissatisfied with the final sugar program provisions the sugar production sector argued that it will face considerable price uncertainty whenever recourse loan policy would come into effect sugar users contended that the proposed program offers little change from current policy and does not lower sugar support levels cane sugar refiners expressed concern that retaining current price support levels means more refineries will close and that us cane sugar refining capacity will continue to shrink during senate floor debate february 7 1996 senator gregg offered an amendment that effectively would have continued the sugar program for only 2 years instead of for 7 years as proposed for the other commodities thereby subjecting it to renewed and separate scrutiny the amendment was defeated 3561 on the house side floor amendment by representatives dan miller and charles schumer to phase out the sugar program over 5 years was defeated by closer vote of 208217 this left the sugar program provisions in both the house and senate farm bills nearly identical peanuts the new law authorizes price support for peanuts through the 2002 crop continues the quota system with some changes and is likely to eliminate all of the peanut programs projected budget costs the new quota for peanuts limits the amount that all eligible growers can sell for domestic food use two levels of price support will continue to be available high level for quota peanuts and much lower rate for peanuts produced in excess of each farms quota referred to as additionals budget savings of over 400 million are achieved by eliminating the minimum national quota and undermarketings provisions and requiring growers to pay additional assessments if needed to cover program costs one related change will allow usda to set the quota at level equal to domestic food demand rather crs8 than above it final provisions also include some features of the peanut growers proposal and compromise between 1995s 678ton quota loan rate and the peanut shellers call for support level around 550ton price support on quota peanuts will be reduced 10 to 610ton starting with the 1996 crop and then be frozen at that level through the 2002 crop growers opposed any support reduction manufacturers argued that the reduction was not deep enough to reverse the decline in domestic peanut use during senate debate in early february 1996 senator santorum offered an amendment to phase down quota loan rates and beginning in 2001 to eliminate the quota system altogether the amendment was tabled defeated 5936 on february 7 house floor amendment by representative shays to phase out the peanut program over 7 years by making steep annual reductions in the quota loan rate also was defeated by vote of 209212 on february 28 the main features of the new program were the same in both the house and senate passed farm bills with few differences one final compromise makes producers who effectively sell their crop to the federal government for 2 years rather than to buyer who makes written price offer at the quota support level 610ton ineligible for price support benefits for one year conferees also 1 settled differences reflecting regional rivalries and peanut type supplydemand imbalances on how program losses are to be shared and 2 agreed to allow the sale and lease of 40 over 5 years of countys poundage quota across county lines but still within the same state for more information see crs issue brief 95117 sugar policy issues crs report 96606 farm commodity programs sugar and crs issue brief 95118 peanuts policy issues crop insurance and risk management miscellaneous provisions in title i of the 1996 farm bill make several changes to the federal crop insurance program administered by usda under the new farm law producer longer is required to acquire the minimum level of crop insurance coverage as long as the producer waives in writing any eligibility for future disaster payments it also allows usda to continue to offer the basic level of insurance coverage in states or regions that have an insufficient number of approved private insurance providers but requires usda to shift policies to private companies when private coverage is adequate the new law also creates new office of risk management within usda with jurisdiction over the crop insurance program and makes seed crops and aquaculture eligible for payments under the noninsured assistance program other provisions institute separate pilot programs for insect infestation nursery crop insurance coverage futures and options trading and revenue insurance the permanently authorized livestock assistance programs which assist livestock producers when they lose significant portion of their onfarm feed to natural disaster are terminated for more information see crs report 96477 crop insurance and risk management provisions in the enacted 1996 farm bill crs9 title iiagricultural trade us agricultural exports are important to the financial health of the farm and agribusiness sectors agricultural exports reached record 60 billion in fy1996 up from 541 billion in fy1995 and surpassing the previous record of 438 billion set in fy1981 agricultural exports are projected to decline little in fy1997 to 58 billion four types of programs assist agricultural exports 1 export subsidy programs including the export enhancement program eep 2 market development programs including the market access program map 3 export credit guarantee programs gsm102 and 103 and 4 us foreign food aid programs the new farm law makes number of important changes in agricultural export programs it authorizes through fy2002 maximum funding levels for eep that are lower in early years than the maximum levels allowed by the uruguay round agreement on agriculture it authorizes mpp through fy2002 but at reduced level of 90 million annually it includes specific authorization for the first time for the foreign market development program cooperator program which heretofore had been included as line item in the budget of the foreign agricultural service the new law authorizes the level of export credit guarantees for buyers of us agricultural products in foreign countries at 55 billion the current level it extends authorities for pl 480 food aid programs concessional sales humanitarian donations and bilateral development grants to fy2002 the agreement also reauthorizes the food for progress program and makes some changes in section 416b foreign commodity donations changes included in the new law appear to reinforce both the market development and humanitarian aims of food aid programs private entities become eligible for title i sales agreements intergovernmental organizations in addition to private voluntary organizations and cooperatives become eligible for funds to defray projectrelated and administrative costs the agreement authorizes 4 million metric ton food security commodity reserve of wheat corn sorghum and rice to meet unanticipated emergency humanitarian food needs in developing countries the agreement calls for the secretary of agriculture to develop strategy for implementing federal agricultural export programs and to establish quantitative goals against which to measure the success or failure of the strategy provisions on some of these programs are also contained in the fy1997 agriculture appropriations act pl 104180 the act limits eep funding to 100 million contains restriction on the level of map funding and supports the authorized level of 55 billion for export credit guarantees it provides for total pl 480 program level of 1110 billion in fy1997 776 million less than in fy1996 but in spite of the overall reduction the conferees provided for an increase in funding for title ii of pl 480 humanitarian food donations overseas for more information see crs issue brief 95088 agricultural

94303 pl 480 history and legislation programs and policy issues title iiiconservation the conservation provisions of the fair act more fully integrate resource conservation and environmental concerns with agricultural policies continuing trend that started with the 1985 farm law and continued with the 1990 farm law provisions in this title change the resource conservation effort in significant ways that go beyond individual programs total funding for conservation is estimated to grow by about 300 million per year majority of the conservation funding will be mandatory the conservation agenda is broadened by adding wildlife considerations to many programs and by further elevating nonpoint pollution as program priority and some conservation programs will be targeted to priority areas which are to be designated in each state the farm bill hr 2854 that the house agriculture committee voted out on january 30 1996 contained limited conservation provisions largely adopting the provisions that had been included in reconciliation legislation these provisions were limited to amendments to the conservation reserve and wetlands reserve programs and creation of new costsharing program to assist livestock producers the senateapproved omnibus farm bill s 1541 included much more substantial conservation title it contained modified versions of provisions that had been part of the reconciliation package it also included many others that surfaced for the first time during senate floor action many of these ideas had been included as conceptual points in the clinton administrations farm bill guidance issued in may 1995 these provisions were largely supported by the environmental and conservation communities in conference the more farreaching senatepassed provisions generally prevailed furthermore provisions on highly erodible lands and wetlands conservation that had not been in either chambers bill but had been sought by agricultural interests were added by the conference committee these provisions include reauthorizing the crp and wrp making them both entitlements allowing landowners who meet certain qualifications to terminate crp contracts early limiting the use of permanent easements in future wrp enrollments and setting maximum enrollment limits creating new 200 million per year 130 million in fy1996 entitlement for conservation costsharing called the environmental crs11 quality incentive program eqip and dedicating half the funding to addressing problems associated with livestock production creating several new grazing measures including land management program national natural resources conservation foundation wildlife habitat program farmland protection initiative and floodplain easements program creating pilot conservation program option with capped funding levels each year for producers who participate in both the crp and the market transition program by providing 10year contract rather than 7 years in returning for meeting specified resource conservation requirements and amending the highly erodible cropland and wetland conservation provisions to provide producers with greater flexibility for meeting conservation requirements for more information see crs reports 96165 conservation provisions in s 1541 and h r 2854 comparison and 96330 conservation provisions in the 1996 farm bill summary title ivnutrition assistance major changes to domestic food assistance programs were part of legislative initiatives in the 104th congress to revamp federal farm support balance the budget and reform welfare food stamp spending figured prominently in legislative decisions about omnibus farm measures as the congress confronted difficult choices between food and farm program spending this delayed agreement in 1995 on omnibus farm legislation needed to reauthorize food stamp commodity donation and agricultural support programs expiring at the end of fy1995 these programs however were funded by fy1996 appropriation law pl10437 and food program authorities were extended under the food title of the omnibus farm bill pl104127 that ultimately was enacted in april 1996 historically the inclusion of food assistance title in the farm bill has helped bring urban support for farm programs and farm support for food aid programs incorporating 7year extension of food stamp and commodity donation programs into the senate farm bill was credited along with conservation and rural development titles with garnering wider support for the bill this year as well in the house where it was assumed that changes to food programs would be contained in welfare reform legislation nutrition program provisions were contained in the 1996 farm bill that this chamber approved ultimately farm bill conferees compromised on 2year extension of the food stamp program and 7year extension of several pilot projects for employment and training programs for food stamp recipients nutrition assistance for puerto rico and american samoa and commodity donation programs like the emergency food assistance program efap and the commodity supplemental food program csfp they also agreed to the creation of new community food security program which allows the secretary to spend not more than 1 million in fy1997 and up to 27 million in each of fiscal crs12 years 19982002 to make grants to communities to help them meet the food needs of lowincome populations both welfare reform and budget reconciliation measures approved by the house and senate during the 104th congress contained provisions substantially revising the funding and structure of federal food programs during the first session the house and senate passed welfare and reconciliation bills hr 4 and hr 2491 that achieved 7year net outlay savings of 301 and 335 billion respectively in projected spending for domestic food programs 85 of the reductions were from food stamp program changes these bills were vetoed by president clinton in the second session the congress approved welfarebudget measure hr 3734 that the president signed pl104193 this new law extends appropriations authority for the food stamp act through fy2002 and is projected by cbo to reduce net federal spending under this act by total of 233 billion over 6 years primarily through new restrictions on eligibility for nonworking recipients and noncitizens and reductions in benefits total food program reductions from this law including those for child nutrition programs are projected to be about 26 billion over 6 years the enacted welfare measure also combines the efap and soup kitchen food bank programs and requires that 100 million be used annually from food stamp funds to buy commodities for the emergency feeding facilities distributing food to the needy under this program major source of contention between the two chambers and between the administration and congress namely provisions requiring child nutrition block grants and allowing states the option to blockgrant food stamps under certain circumstances and placing ceiling on food stamp spending were not contained in the 1996 welfarebudget law however new food stamp eligibility requirement was included for ablebodied adults without dependents that generally limits them to 3 months of eligibility unless working at least halftime this had been opposed by the administration the administration also opposed the prohibition on food stamp eligibility for most legal aliens and the reduction in benefits for those with high shelter costs both of which were in the enacted measure in signing both the farm and welfare measures the president expressed concern that some of these laws provisions might endanger the safety net for farmers and for poor americans and indicated that he would press for corrections if this occurred for further information see crs report 96861 federal food programs legislation in the 104th congress crs report 95475 national school lunch act facts and

provisions of the 1996 farm bill title vicredit congress frequently includes credit title in omnibus farm legislation as vehicle for making policy changes to usda credit programs as well as addressing issues that relate to institutional lenders such as commercial banks and the farm credit system fcs the new law contains credit title that directly affects eligibility for usda farm loans and the servicing of its delinquent accounts among its many provisions the credit title would eliminate requirement that usda provide operating loans to certain farm borrowers even if they are delinquent on previous loans deny new farm loans to any borrower who had delinquent loan on which the debt was forgiven reduce the mandated period usda must wait to notify borrowers that they are delinquent and to inform them of their loan servicing options continue the shift in usda lending resources from direct loans to guaranteed loans and expedite the sale of acquired usda farm property the agreement closely resembles the credit title in the senate version of the farm bill the house version of the farm bill did not contain credit title however separate bill hr 2590 introduced by house agriculture committee leadership would have applied more stringent qualifications than the senate bill for new usda farm loans and would have restricted usdas options for servicing delinquent borrowers because

credit system regulatory relief act of 1995 pl 104105 hr 2029 which affects the operations of both the farm credit system fcs and farmer mac this legislation was expedited because certain regulatory issues affecting the farm credit system required immediate congressional attention additionally many policymakers contended that the worsening financial condition of farmer mac warranted prompt
