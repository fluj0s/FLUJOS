38 billion in fy2006 this report reviews the funding history of the programs since the 2002 farm bill was enacted it will be updated periodically introduction major issue in the upcoming farm bill debate is likely to be funding for conservation programs current authorization for mandatory funding for most of these programs under the farm security and ru ral investment act of 2002 pl 107171 expires at the end of fy2007 mandatory f unding means that the amount authorized by congress is available unless limited to smaller amounts in th appropriations process if appropriators do not act the amount that wa s authorized is provided to the program these mandatory funds are provided by the u s department of ag ricultures commodity credit corporation financin g institution for many agriculture programs including commodity programs and export subsidies while most conservation programs curre ntly are authorized using mandatory funding discretionary funding is used for six conservation progra ms for discretionary programs appropriators decide how much f unding to provide each year in the annual agriculture appropriations bill subject to any maximum limit set in law conservation program advocates prefer ma ndatory funding over discreti onary funding they believe that it is generally easier to protect author ized mandatory funding levels from reductionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22243crs2 1 the one exception to this statement is that the 1985 farm bill pl 99198 authorized mandatory funding for the conservati on reserve program in fy1986 and fy1987during the appropriations process than to secu re appropriations each year however since fy2002 congress has limited funding for some of the mandatory programs each year below authorized levels in annual appropria tions acts advocates for these programs decry these limitations as significant changes from the intent of the farm bill which compromise the programs ability to provide the anticipated magnitude of benefits to producers and the environment others including those interested in reducing agricultural expenditures or in spending th funds for other agricultural purposes counter that even with these reductions ove rall funding has gr own substantially mandatory conservation funding before 2002 congress provided mandatory funding for selected conservation programs for the first time in the 1996 farm bill pl 1041271 prior to 1996 all conservation programs had been funded as discreti onary programs conservati on program advocates viewed mandatory funding as much more desira ble approach and congress agreed enacting provisions that moved some conservation programs from discretionary to mandatory funding some advocates viewed this change in funding as major achievement in the 1996 farm bill amounts authorized for thes programs at the time may seem modest when compared with todays levels progra ms funded with mandato ry funding and their authorized levels under the 1996 law included the following conservation reserve program maximum of 364 million acres at any time through fy2002 with dollar amount specified wetland reserve program max imum of 975000 acres at any time through fy2002 with dollar amount specified environmental quality incentiv program 130 million in fy 1996 and 200 million annually thereaf ter through fy2002 wildlife habitat incentives progra m total of 50 million between fy1996 and fy2002 farmland protection prog ram total of 35 million with time span specified and conservation farm option 75 million in fy1997 increasing each yearto high of 625 million in fy2002 the 2002 farm bill the 2002 farm bill greatly expanded ma ndatory funding for conservation authorizing the annual funding levels shown in table 1 mandatory funding was provided both for expiring programs that were reauthorized and for new programs created in the legislation the increase in authorized funding levels was wi dely endorsed for many reasons conservation supporters had long b een seeking higher funding levels and this was another significant step in that effort an argument that proved particularly persuasive in this farm bill debate was documentation of large backlogs of interested and eligible producers who were unable to enroll because of lack of funds demand to participate in some of the programs exceeded the ava ilable program dollars several times over and some members reasoned that higher funding was warranted to sa tisfy this demand httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22243crs3 2 in addition during the fy2001 appropriations process congress had provided onetime funding to several conservation programs beyond what had been authorized in the 1996 farm bill these onetime appropriations were congre ssional and administration responses to combination of forecasts of federal budget surpluses and high demand to participate in the programs funding for fy2002 is not included in table 1 as the fy2002 appropriations legislation was enacted on november 28 20 01 six mont hs before the 2002 farm bill program funding decisions had to be based on prior legisla tion indeed by the time this farm bill was enacted the fy2003 appr opriations process was well along2 however the 2002 farm bill did authorize money in fy2002 fo r several mandatory pr ograms spending limits on mandatory appropriations since fy2002 in each year since fy2002 annual agricu lture appropriations acts have capped funding for some of the manda tory conservation programs be low authorized levels the programs that are limited and the amounts of the limitations change from year to year one program the wetland reserve program has been capped in enrolled acres which appropriators translate into savings based on average enrollment costs table 1 compares the authorized spending level for each of the programs with the amount that congress actually provided through the ppropriations process it does not include any mandatory conservation programs enacted since the 2002 farm bill including the conservation reserve program technical assistance account enacted in pl 108498 the healthy forest reserve enacted in pl 108148 and the emergency forestry conservation reserve program enacted in pl 109148 many of the spending reductions originat in the administrations budget request since the farm bill states th at the secretary shall spe nd the authorized amounts for each program each year congress must act to limit spending to lesser amount the mix of programs and amounts of reduction in the ad ministration request ve varied from year to year congress has concurred with the administration request some years for some programs starting in fy2003 the requested reductions in mandatory funding below the authorized levels shown in the table are as follows in fy2003 the request was submitted be fore the farm bill was enacted and did not include any request s to reduce funding levels in fy2004 the request was to limit the wetlands

watershed re habilitation and ama programs discussion while congress has reduced funding for some mandatory conservation programs either in support of an admin istration request or on its ow n the reductions did not exceed 10 of the total until fy2005 however the gap between authorized levels and actual amounts continues to grow as percentage this gap has grown from 24 of the total authorized amount in fy2003 to 127 in fy2006 even with these changes however actual total funding has ri sen almost 720 million over the same fouryear time period which is an increase of almost 25 from the fy2003 authorization3 reductions have not been uniform am ong programs the largest mandatory program the crp has not been limited in an way by appropriators since the 2002 farm bill was enacted the secondlargest program eqip has absorbed the largest reductions from authorized levels totaling 396 milli on between fy2003 and fy2006 funding for third program the csp has been amende d four times since 2002 as initially enacted it was the first true conservation entitlement program that is any individual who met the eligibility requirements would be accepted into the program congress has capped csp and then repeatedly reduced the cap to fund other activities usually disaster assistance more generally the table show s that reductions have varied from year to year and program to program since 2002 at one extr eme the watershed rehabilitation program has received mandatory funding in any year it is one of the five conservation programs authorized to receive discretionary appropriati ons as well and those have been provided and at the other extreme the crp has not been limited in any way some of the programs have unusual characteristics that affect how they are treated for budget purposes as noted in the table footnotes for example the grasslands reserve nd klamath river basin programs each have total authorized level th at is not subdivided by fiscal year in the authorizing legislation for those programs the amount that was spent each year not the remaining lifetime authorization is include d for purposes of calculating the percentage by which funding is reduced as result of the many variations in how these programs are authorized some in acres and others in dollars and some as total amount and others by year there are several alternative ways to calculate the annual and tota l reduction from the authorized level however all of these calculations lead to the same general set of observations first overall funding for the suite of manda tory agriculture conservation programs hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22243crs6 been reduced each year second the magnitude by which this suite of programs is being reduced has been growing each year third these reductions may still be significant to current or potential beneficiar ies of those program fourth even with the reductions overall funding for the group of mandatory pr ograms has continued to rise finally funding for the discretionary agricultural c onservation programs varies more from year to year with much larger percentage reductions than the mandatory programs in some years greater variation in funding for discretionary programs supports the view of conservation proponents that us ing the mandatory approach has been more successful and predictable approach to conservation program funding in recent years for more information on each of these programs see crs report rl32940 agriculture conservation programs scorecard by jeffrey zinn and tadlock cowan concluding observations when considering whether reductions in mandatory funding for conservation programs compromise the conservation effort th ree points are relevant first measure of how conservation funding is viewed in relation to other agriculture funding was provided in the fy2006 reconc iliation process which required the agriculture committees to reduce total usda mandatory program funding by 30 billion over five years including reduction of 176 million in fy2006 conservation provided 934 million of those savings with reductions for fy 2006 this amount is about 25 of the total reduction that was enacted 37 billion over five years the savings came from lowering caps on spending for csp and eqip in future years which also required authorizing them beyond fy2007 and eliminatin g unspent funds for the watershed rehabilitation program carried over from earlier years part of the debate was whether conservation is being asked to bear disproportionate share of these reductions for more information see crs report rs22086 agriculture and fy2006 budget reconciliation second it appears highly likely that reduc tions to mandatory program spending at the current scale will continue reductions have been in every administration request and annual appropriations bill since fy2003 it is less certain however whether these reductions will continue to grow as percentage of the total future change will depend on both congressional support fo r conservation specifically and broader pressures that influence overall federal spending it is likely that the affected programs and the magnitude of the reductions will continue to vary from year to year making it difficult to forecast the future based on the past third supporters of conser vation programs may look fo r ways to address the challenge of spending reductions in the next farm bill however several broader forces may make it difficult to authorize higher f unding levels or to protect current funding levels for these conservation programs one fo rce may be broad effort s to control federal spending second force may be competiti on among various agriculture constituencies for limited funds the fy2006 reconciliation pr ocess provided an indication of how congress will treat conservation when it must make decisions based on this competition third force may be limits on the capacity of federal conservation agencies at current staffing levels and with the current approach to plan and install all the conservation practices that additional funding would suppor t and it seems likely that increasing staff levels in federal agencies to provide more conserva tion will not be an option
