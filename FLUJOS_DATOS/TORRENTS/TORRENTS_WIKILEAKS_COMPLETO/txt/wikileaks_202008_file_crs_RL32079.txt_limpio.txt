sourcing targets updated january 12 2005 l elaine halchin analyst in american national government government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress federal contracting of commercial activities competitive sourcing targets summary the bush administration initiated distinctive program of competitive sourcing in 2001 the thrust of this reform is to subject commercial activities to public private competition using the policy and instructions contained in office of management and budget omb circular a76 commercial activities are defined as federal activities that could be performed by the private sector as required by the federal activities inventory reform fair act pl 105270 agencies compile lists of their commercial activities and associated fulltime equivalents ftes and submit them to omb by june 30 of each year an important component of the administrations initiative has been the introduction of goals or targets in 2001 omb announced longterm goal for competitive sourcing submit 50 of the ftes listed on fair inventories to competition deadline accompanied this goal omb also established interim goals for agencies compete 5 in fy2002 and an additional 10 in fy2003 omb also developed an executive branch management scorecard to rate agency progress on the presidents managements agenda pma of which competitive sourcing is one component in 2002 some critics of the competitive sourcing targets suggested that they were arbitrary congressional interest in the competitive sourcing targets and how they were developed was reflected in two legislative measures in 2003 section 647 of pl 1087 division j hjres 2 108th congress required omb to provide considered research and sound analysis in support of its goals or face the possibility that funds made available in the bill which was the consolidated appropriations resolution could not be used to apply enforce or establish any goal or target for competitive sourcing the house committee on appropriations report hrept 108 243 that accompanied hr 2989 the fy2004 appropriations bill for transportation treasury and independent agencies directed omb to submit reports to the senate and house appropriations committees on any new competitive sourcing targets hr 2989 as amended and passed by the senate also included two provisions on competitive sourcing though neither addressed the issue of targets or goals an omb report competitive sourcing conducting publicprivate competition in reasoned and responsible manner issued on july 24 2003 explains competitive sourcing strategy although the report did not explicitly state that it was responding to section 647 of pl 1087 division j it did note that omb had dropped its numerical targets opted for collaborative ombagency process in the development of competition plans and revised the competitive sourcing criteria for the executive branch management scorecard second omb report dated september

governmentwide initiative to subject activities or functions performed by federal agencies that are deemed commercial to publicprivate competition commercial activity is defined by the office of management and budget omb as recurring service that could be performed by the private sector whereas an inherently governmental activity is an activity that is so intimately related to the public interest as to mandate performance by government personnel1 as explained by the administrator of the office of federal procurement policy ofpp in early 2002 competitive sourcing is means to an end with the means being competition generally publicprivate competition and the end being better management of our government and better service for our citizens2 omb expects competitive sourcing to result in significant performance improvements such as reducing costs improving accountability or increasing efficiency3 1 us office of management and budget circular a76 revised may 29 2003 pp d2 and

agencies to compile lists of their commercial activities and submit them to omb by june 30 of each year the first set of inventories was produced in 1999 the requirement for agencies to prepare lists

total of 15 of their commercial ftes by the end of fy2003 congressional testimony provided by the thenadministrator of ofpp in march affirmed that this had been the original goal we put 15 percent up over 2 years as goal that we thought was appropriate for almost every department and agency to meet because they had not subjected as general proposition particularly at the civilian agencies they had never subjected any of these jobs that are clearly commercial in nature to the pressures of competition21 19 us office of management and budget competitive sourcing conducting public private

federal procurement policy administrator angela styles in us congress committee on governmental affairs whos doing work for the government monitoring accountability and competition in the federal and service contract continued crs6 however the administrator also noted that omb had begun working with agencies to develop goals suited to their particular circumstances we sat down with each department and agency over the period of the past i would say 6 to 9 months to determine what was an appropriate plan for that agency there are agencies where it is not appropriate right now for them to be competing 15 percent22 next at hearing in september the administrator explained that the combined target of 15 was governmentwide goal not goal that each agency was required to meet i would like to take an opportunity to clarify what is tremendous amount of confusion and misrepresentation about our goals first its an aggregate 15 percent governmentwide goal its not 15 percent at each agency23 criticism of ombs competitive sourcing targets surfaced in 2002 the primary allegation was that the goals or targets were arbitrary in march for example senator george v voinovich voiced his concerns about ombs targets i am concerned that the benchmarks the administration has adopted for its competitive sourcing are arbitrary and potentially damaging as were the clinton administrations downsizing efforts what measurement criteria did the administration use to come up with 50 percent figure what is the logic behind it24 in april the commercial activities panel cap issued its report on circular a76 and related issues25 one of the panels recommendations was that the government adopt 10 sourcing principles developed by cap the sixth principle was avoid arbitrary fulltime equivalent fte or other arbitrary numerical goals while the panel did not comment explicitly about the administrations competitive sourcing targets it did explain its rationale for avoiding arbitrary goals 21 continued

commercial activities panel cap was established at the direction of section 832 of pl 106398 convened in spring 2001 by the comptroller general the panel was charged with examining circular a76 and fair members included senior federal government officials industry and union representatives and competitive sourcing experts after yearlong study cap released its report improving the sourcing decisions of the government on april 30 2002 crs7 this principle reflects an overall concern about arbitrary numbers driving sourcing policy or specific sourcing decisions the success of government programs should be measured by the results achieved in terms of providing value to the taxpayer not the size of the inhouse or contractor workforce any fte or other numerical goals should be based on considered research and analysis the use of arbitrary percentage or numerical targets can be counterproductive26 later in 2002 the comptroller general commented in correspondence and in congressional testimony on ombs targets i have seen evidence to indicate that ombs numerical fte goals were based on considered research and sound analysis in addition i am not aware that ombs fte goals took into full account the capacity of agencies particularly civilian agencies to conduct publicprivate competitions27 i believe the administrations current quotas targets call it whatever you want violate the sourcing principles recommended by cap because they are arbitrary28 ombs response to these charges was that the interim goals were an effort to prompt agencies to establish the infrastructure necessary to conduct competitions at hearing in september the thenadministrator of ofpp elaborated on this point let be clear about the application of this aggregate governmentwide goal of 15 it is not intended as an arbitrary quota such as the ones that were put into effect through most of the 1990s when the workforce was reduced by 324580 ftes like you mr chairman representative thomas m davis i have always opposed arbitrary fte cuts and caps as this subcommittee has heard say before competitive sourcing is not about outsourcing or downsizing the workforce to the contrary it is about creating incentives and opportunities for efficiency and innovation through competition thus as we work with agencies and evaluate their progress the real issue is whether an agencys plan first builds an infrastructure for publicprivate competition and then implements competitions over the longterm while omb will presume that an agency has built such an infrastructure if it competes 15 percent of its commercial ftes we have been careful not to apply this goal in rigid or arbitrary manner29 2003 targets pl 1087 hjres 2 108th congress consolidated appropriations resolution 2003 congressional

effort to prevent the use of arbitrary quotas and to learn more about ombs development of its competitive sourcing targets congress included this provision in pl 1087 while nothing in this section shall prevent any agency of the executive branch from subjecting work performed by federal government employees or private contractors to publicprivate competition or conversions none of the funds made available in this act may be used by an agency of the executive branch to establish apply or enforce any numerical goal target or quota for subjecting the employees of the executive agency to

additional 10 percent by the end of fiscal year 2003 these figures were intended to ensure level of commitment that would help institutionalize use of the tool within each agency with experience omb recognized that its initial numericallybased directions were inadequate the guidance provided management incentives or disincentives process for evaluating progress and mechanism for interacting with the agencies to reinforce strengths and correct weaknesses to address these concerns omb created scorecards to measure progress using trafficlight ie redyellowgreen grading system under the scorecard approach numerical mandates were converted to incentives an agency would move from red score to yellow score if it completed competitions for 15 of the total commercial positions listed on their

identified commercial activities available for competition they consider in disciplined way which of these might benefit most from comparison with the private sector agencies are generally focusing use of publicprivate competition on commonly available routine commercial services where there are likely to be numerous capable and highly competitive private sector contractors worthy of comparison

particularly those efforts related to targets or goals sought to institutionalize publicprivate competition across the federal government and spur the development of sufficient infrastructure within agencies for carrying out competitive sourcing tasks and activities the initial goals remained in place with some modification which lasted briefly as result of clay johnson iiis april 17 memorandum until the thenofpp administrators congressional testimony on july 24 2003 there does not appear to be any publicly available information that documents whether ombs goals were successful in prompting agencies to establish infrastructures sufficient for conducting competitions and performing related tasks if only some agencies were successful in this area it remains to be seen what means omb might use to continue to promote infrastructure development among federal agencies another related issue is whether omb plans to assess the capability of each agency to handle its competitive sourcing workload while the revised scorecard criteria may provide some insight into these issues the criteria alone may not be sufficient the criteria tend to focus on output however outputbased criteria are not necessarily wellsuited to measuring other features or characteristics such as agency capacity or the quality of competitions and inventories hr 2989 transportation treasury and independent agencies appropriations act 2004 the house committee on appropriations report that accompanied the transportation treasury and independent agencies appropriations bill for fy2004 hr 2989 108th congress included recommendation concerning competitive sourcing targets the committee report stated crs17 the statement of the managers accompanying the treasury and general government appropriations act 2003 pl 1087 directed omb to provide report to the committees on appropriations later than 30 days following the announcement of those competitive sourcing goals targets or quotas specifically detailing the research and sound analysis that was used in reaching the decision although the 15 percent competitive sourcing target has been reiterated on several occasions since the enactment of that act ombs position is that the reporting requirement has not been triggered because new target has been announced the committee notes that the 15 percent target is governmentwide and separate targets could be established for individual agencies depending on their circumstances to the extent that omb establishes individual agency targets in its internal guidance the agency is directed within 30 days of establishing such targets to submit report to the house and senate committees on appropriations that indicates each agencys competitive sourcing target the report should specifically detail the research and analysis that was used in determining each agencys individual target goal or quota to the extent that such targets change over time omb is directed to maintain an uptodate record of such changes and convey the changes periodically to the house and senate committees on appropriations and the appropriate legislative committees40 hr 2989 was enacted as division f of pl 108199 which came to be known as the consolidated appropriations act for fy200441 the competitive sourcing provisions are found in section 647 section 647a which apparently applies only to those federal agencies that receive appropriated funds under division f requires agencies for certain types of publicprivate competitions to prepare plan for most efficient organizations and to take into consideration how the conversion differential would affect the contractors cost estimate sections 647a through are thought to apply governmentwide section 647b requires agency heads to submit annual reports to congress on their competitive sourcing activities required elements include the number of completed competitions the number of announced but not yet completed competitions the number of ftes associated with completed and announced competitions the cost of conducting competitions estimated savings actual savings the projected number of ftes scheduled to be competed in the next fiscal year and description of the agencys competitive sourcing decisionmaking process the initial report is due 120 days after the date of enactment which was january 23 2004 the remainder of section 647 allows agency heads to establish performance period greater than five years for any agency function that was won by federal employees in publicprivate competition permits agency heads to use appropriated funds for monitoring the performance of any activity that has been subjected to publicprivate competition and requires that any work converted to contractor performance cannot be moved to

development food and drug administration and related agencies appropriations act for fy2004 crs18 providing considered research and analysis to congress it is unclear whether ombs 2003 report qualifies as an appropriate response to the requirement for providing considered research and analysis on competitive sourcing goals to congress as required by pl 1087 and reaffirmed by house action on hr 2989 in 2003 without explicitly stating that it was responding to congresss request for information ombs report provided an explanation for its initial goals of 5 10 and 50 and stated that omb had dropped these goals in favor of targets established through collaborative process between itself and agencies42 should the explanation for ombs interim and longterm goals be deemed insufficient the fact that omb has abandoned these goals could possibly be construed as relieving it of the responsibility to provide considered research and analysis for its original targets nevertheless it is possible that interest in competitive sourcing targets and ombs role in their development could continue should congress wish to obtain the research and analysis used to develop agency competition plans it may need to contact federal agencies and departments including omb language in ombs competitive sourcing report noted that agencies have developed competition plans using their commercial inventories as baseline43 specifically agencies have considered in disciplined way which of the commercial activities available for competition might benefit most from comparison with the private sector agency decisions have been informed by wide variety of factors including but not limited to workforce mix attrition rates capacity to conduct reviews the percentage of service contracts and the strength of the agencys contract management capabilities44 omb also acknowledged its role in agency competition plans through individual interactions with the agencies to evaluate progress omb learned that baselines would need to vary based on mission needs and conditions unique to the agency45 omb reviewed all agency baselines and negotiated new baselines with number of agencies these negotiations in combination with the continued broad discretion afforded to agencies to identify appropriate 42 however in written response to july 24 2003 letter from senator joseph lieberman on competitive sourcing targets omb director joshua b bolten stated that ombs competitive sourcing report also dated july 24 2003 included facts rationale and strategy supporting competitive sourcing joshua b bolten director us office of management and budget letter to senator joseph lieberman july 30 2003 43 the use of past tense in this passage suggests that omb had dropped its initial goals and had begun working with agencies on customized competition plans prior to the release of its july 24 2003 report 44 us office of management and budget competitive sourcing conducting public private competition in reasoned and responsible manner july 2003 p 4 45 the competitive sourcing report did not define or explain its use of the term baselines apparently the reference in the second passage concerned the number of ftes sufficient for an agency to earn yellow rating on its scorecard information provided by the us office of management and budget by telephone to the author aug 18 2003 crs19 commercial activities have allowed agencies to create customized plans for the successful application of publicprivate competition46 an agency develops its own competition plan presumably following the process described in ombs competitive sourcing report47 however it appears that this is only an initial plan the final plan is product of negotiations between the agency and omb48 the rationale for final plan could include in addition to an agencys documentation the research and analysis omb used in making its determination about the contents of the agencys plan and any changes that resulted from omb agency negotiations the recommendation in the report accompanying hr 2989 notes that in the event that omb establishes individual agency targets in its internal guidance report on competitive sourcing targets is due to the house and senate appropriations committees the question is how to interpret internal guidance broad interpretation could include written and verbal guidance including negotiations between omb and agencies possible benefit of increasing the visibility of ombs guidance to agencies could be to dispel any concerns that ombs expectations or instructions are communicated treated or perceived as targets encouraging or requesting agencies to publicize their competition plans prior to entering into negotiations with omb also could shed light on this phase of the competition plan process on the other hand increased visibility of the process particularly communications between agencies and omb could disrupt the development of agency competition plans and provide an opportunity for outside parties to attempt to influence the process ombs expectation compete 416000 ftes by dropping the 50 target it would appear omb had abandoned its goal of ensuring that the dynamics of competition would be brought to bear on significant portion of commercial activities49 however as omb noted in its july 2003 report approximately 26 of the workforce from agencies being tracked under the pma are engaged in commercial activities that should be available for competition50 this statement could possibly be construed as prescription for federal government agencies the 26 equates to 416000 ftes51 omb estimated that there are 751000 inherently governmental ftes and 858000 commercial ftes the number of 46 us office of management and budget competitive sourcing

competition in reasoned and responsible manner july 2003 p 5 50 ibid p 3 51 in its competitive sourcing report omb did not specify whether the figures in its aggregate workforce profile are ftes

commercial ftes includes 442000 identified as commercial but not available for competition and 416000 identified as commercial and available for competition52 ombs report does not identify the source of these figures and it does not include an explanation of how commercial functions were sorted into the available and not available categories fair inventories reportedly were the source of these numbers and reason codes were used to determine whether commercial function should be classified as available or not available for competition53 according to ombs estimate the number of commercial ftes available for competition is 416000 this figure represents 48 of the total number of commercial ftes and it is comparable to the original longterm target for competitive sourcing 50 which equated to 425000 ftes while omb elected to eliminate the 50 longterm goal it apparently expects agencies to compete 100 of the commercial functions identified as available for competition in media interview the thenadministrator of ofpp stated what were looking for is for an agency to have plan in place and pretty aggressive plan to compete anything thats open to competition look at the green standard on the scorecard which says we contemplate having plan in place at every department and agency to compete every activity that is commercial in nature and open to competition to get to green we want pretty significant plans in place to compete any activity that is commercial in nature thats about 418000 jobs54 the administrator also reportedly said we still expect agencies to compete everything open to competition55 this statement might reflect the possibility that the number of commercial activities available for competition could fluctuate from year to year freed from blanket targets such as the initial goals of 5 and 10 that each agency was expected to meet agency personnel might in reviewing their commercial and inherently governmental lists determine that some functions had been erroneously classified while it is easy to move functions from an inherently governmental inventory to fair inventory or to shift an activity on commercial list from reason code to reason code b to do the reverse requires more work 52 us office of management and budget competitive sourcing conducting public private competition in reasoned and responsible manner july 2003 p 3 53 information provided

subsequent appeal filed by the american federation of government employees afge resulted in the department of commerce moving its seafood inspection function from the agencys fair inventory to the

of the number of commercial ftes that are available for competition ombs september report on competitive sourcing in september omb released supplement to its july 2003 report in the supplemental report omb described agency competitive sourcing efforts explained how agency progress is measured outlined benefits associated with the 2003 revision to the circular and explained additional

are suitable for competition this plan will constitute the agencys green plan on the management scorecard used to measure agency progress and status on pma initiatives agencies continue to have yellow

through consultation between the two the percentage of available commercial positions in competition plans may seem higher than expected particularly in light of the elimination of the 15 and 50

identify the activities that the agency is planning to announce for competition in fy2004 or other period negotiated with omb c handling of other reason code b activities for activities that are not

constraints identify the most significant factors up to three that limit the agency from giving greater consideration to competitive sourcing than is reflected in its plan also identify what the agency is doing to minimize these constraints and when it expects to have minimized the constraints64 additional detailed guidance is provided in an attachment to the memorandum deadline is provided for submission of initial agency competition plans updated plans are to be completed by august 1 of each year and if any changes have occurred agency management is expected to explain them ombs instructions do allow for an agency to identify functions and associated ftes that will not be subjected to competition by the end of fy2008 the agency must provide rationale for any activities that are excluded from competition plans and b functions and associated ftes that need further study in order to determine whether they should be subjected to competition by the end of fy200865 the notion of developing longterm competition plan that includes all agency functions with reason code b is consistent with ombs july 2003 and september 2003 competitive sourcing reports the criteria for longterm competition plans as described in the december 22 2003 memorandum allows agencies to determine which functions and how many ftes to compete each year that is an agency tailors plan to its particular needs and circumstances encourages agencies to compete all commercial functions that carry reason code b and relies on agencies to develop rationales for carrying out publicprivate competitions these were significant features of the reports issued by omb in 2003 the requirement for all commercial 63 ibid p 1 64 ibid pp 23 italics in original 65 ibid attachment p 2 crs32 activities carrying reason code b to be included on longterm competition plans appears to reinforce the expectation that all of these functions eventually will be subjected to publicprivate competition conclusion ombs approach to the establishment and application of competitive sourcing goals has evolved since the inception of the administrations competitive sourcing initiative in 2001 originally the goals of 5 and 10 applied to each agency later the cumulative goal of 15 was characterized as governmentwide aggregate target meanwhile congress passed legislation directing omb to provide rationale for competitive sourcing targets in summer 2003 omb announced publicly that it had abandoned its numerical goals and that it had begun collaborating with agencies on the development of their competition plans at that time omb also revised the scorecard criteria for competitive sourcing additionally although omb dropped the longterm goal of 50 it indicated that it expected agencies to compete all functions identified as commercial and available guidance issued by omb on green competition plans suggests that agencies should plan to compete most if not all eligible commercial activities it remains to be seen how successful various agencies will be in meeting the revised scorecard criteria and in meeting ombs expectation for competing all eligible functions crs33
