summary the united states is relying heavily on pr ivate firms to suppl wide variety of services in iraq including security fr om publicly available information this is apparently the first time that the united states has depended so extensively on contractors to provide security in hos tile environment alt hough it has previously contracted for more limited security services in afghanistan bosnia and elsewhere in iraq private firms known as private security contract ors pscs serve to protect individuals transport convoys forward operating bases bu ildings and other economic infrastructure and are trai ning iraqi police and military personnel by providing security for reconstruction and stabilization efforts many analysts and policymakers say private contractors c ontribute an essential service to us and international efforts to bring peace to iraq nonetheless the use of armed contractors raises several concerns including tran sparency and accountability the lack of public information on the terms of the c ontracts including their costs and the standards governing hiring and performance make evaluating their efficiency difficult the apparent lack of prac tical means to hold contractors accountable under us law for abuses and other transgre ssions and the possibility that they could be prosecuted by foreign courts is also source of concern contractors working with the department of state or the us military or with any of the coalition forces in iraq are noncombatants who have combat immunity under international law if they engage in hostilities and whose conduct may be attributable to the united states section 552 of the john warner national defense authorization act for fy2007 p l 109 364 makes military contractors supporting the armed forces in iraq subject to courtma rtial but due to constitutional concerns it seems more likely that contractors who commit crimes in iraq would be prosecuted under criminal stat utes that apply extraterritorially or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states or by means of the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act meja generally iraqi courts do not have jurisdicti on to prosecute contractors w ithout the permission of the relevant member country of the multinational forces in iraq some contractors including those with the state department may remain outside the jurisdiction of us courts civil or military for improper conduct in iraq this report summarizes what is curren tly known publicly about companies that provide personnel for security missions in iraq and some sources of controversy surrounding them treatment of legal st atus and authorities follows including an overview of relevant international law as well as iraqi law which currently consists

the us government has used private contractors extensively for protecting persons and property in potentially hostile or hostile situations where host country security forces are absent or deficient but it is not the first time private contractors have been used for such purposes in afghanistan there appears to be some contracting for protecting afghani government officials and the dod is using contractors to provide security for forward operating bases the us government accountability office gao reported that contractors have provided security guards in the balkans and southwest asia noting that in bosnia the army replaced soldiers at the gate and base perimeter with contracted security guards military operations contractors provide vital services to deployed forces but ar not adequately addressed in dod plans gao03 695 june 2003 p 8 the united states also uses private contractors us and foreign citizens for guard duty at us military installations and us embassies and consulates in

they may be armed for information on such contractors see crs report rl32395 us treatment of prisoners in iraq selected continuedprivate security contractors in iraq background legal status and other issues introduction the 110th congress is grappling with broad range of issues regarding the use of private contractors to provide secur ity for people and property in iraq and elsewhere the united states has gradually increased the types of tasks and roles for which it contracts private companies in military operations congress has generally accepted the concept of using unarmed pr ivate contractors to carry out support functions in military operations such as providing food nd laundry services although not without concerns regarding th costs of contracts and alleged favoritism in issuing them but for the department of state and the military iraq is in some ways an atypical situation there the unite d states is relying heavily apparently for the first time in an unstable environment on private firms to s upply wide variety of security services1 especially given shortage of diplomatic security agents and us troops private security contractors are widely viewed as vital to us efforts to protect many iraqi and us government officials general contractors working to stabilize and reconstruct iraq and government facilities nevertheless many members are concerned about transparen cy accountability and legal and symbolic issues raised by the use of armed civilians to perform security tasks formerly performed by the military and federal employees as well as possible longterm effects on these organizations this report first summarizes available information on the private contractors providing security services under us government contracts in iraq2 i t t h nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32419crs2 2 continued legal issues by jennifer k elsea 3 according to one publication not since the 17th century has there been such reliance on private military actors to

directly related to protecting nounprovides information on relevant us international and iraqi law and legal issues involved in the use of armed contractors it concludes with discussion of issues involving the need for and suitability of pr ivate contractors costs oversight and control as well as potential foreign policy implications background the united states is just one of many entities including other governments international organizations and private industry that employ private security contractors in iraq in recent years the united states and many other nations and organizations including the united nations have increasingly turned to private contractors to provide security as well as variety of other functions in support of stabilization and reconstruction efforts3 this increased reliance on contractors has fueled the growth of the private security industry services provided by priv ate security contractors there is some debate as to what constitutes private security contractor some commentators define private security as any activity directly related to protecting person place or thing4 others may use broader definition that includes such activities as providing intelligence analys is operational coordi nation or security training the national defense authoriz ation act for fiscal year 2008 pl 110 181 sec 864 defines private security f unctions as the guarding of personnel facilities or prope rties and any other activity for which personnel are required to be armed in addition to armed s ecurity many private security contractors also offer variety of unarmed services which in number of cases may represent 50 or morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32419crs3 5 contractors providing traini ng that includes the use of weapons may be armed however the use of weapons for training purposes is be ing categorized as an unarmed service because the weapons are used as training tool s and not to provide armed security 6 the estimate does not include iraqi pscs and their employees working for the iraqi government or iraqi private industry estimated based on an email correspondence with lawrence peter director private security companies association in iraq june 14 2008 7 conversation with peter singer brookings institution june 13 2007 8 some americans are working for foreign pscs and are providing security services to foreign clients 9 email correspondence from doug brooks president international peace operations association july 2 2007of the companys revenues as such the services provided by private security companies operating in iraq can be divided into two major categories armed services and unarmed services armed services include static security protecting fixed or static sites such as housing areas reconstruction work site s or government buildings convoy security protecting convoys traveling in iraq security escorts protecting individuals traveling in unsecured areas in iraq and personal security details providi ng

united states v burney 21 cmr 98 1956 concluding that contractors connection with the military despite his indirect employme nt through private company was sufficient to constitute serving with or

quartered and messed on military installation by military personnel and he was accorded privileges normally granted only to military personnel the operational success of that military command depended upon civilians such as this accused and each of the services has found it necessary to rely on civilian technician s to repair and maintain the highly specialized signal and radar equipment now being

charge of desertion135 assuming the constitution permits the tr ial of civilians accompanying the armed forces in wartime particular case will also have to satisfy the statutory requirements of the ucmj to determine whether civilian contractor who is suspected of having committed an offense is subject to prosecution under the ucmj it will be necessary to dete rmine whether he is serving with or accompanying an armed force that is operating in the field the phrase serving with or accompanying the forces was historically construed to require that the civilians presence must be not merely incident to but directly connected with or dependent upon the activities of the ar med forces or their personnel136 courts have found that military jurisdiction over civilia n cannot be claimed merely on the basis of convenience necessity or the nonavailability of civil courts137 the phrase in the field means serving in an area of actual fighting at or near the battlefront where act ual hostilities are under way138 whether an armed force is in the field is determined by the activity in which it may be engaged at any particular time not the locality where it is found139 therefore it appears that contractors will not be subject to military jurisdiction merely because of their employment in iraq they might however be subject to jurisdiction even if the conduct occurs outside of iraq so long as

better suited as shortte rm response to current needs or whether the state department should increase the num ber of fulltime ds agents and security specialists and provide suffi cient appropriations

decade to ease the strain on downsized m ilitary176 by supplementing overstretched active duty personnel beginni ng in the early 1990s with contractors for jobs that do not require military expertis such as feeding housing and otherwise caring for soldiers basic needs policy makers hoped to meet the demands on the force while minimizing an increase in th number of military personnel and repeated callups of reserve units the us gove rnments subsequent turn to private contractors for assistance with wide variety of security needs served the same purposes in iraq particularly the use of private contractors may serve variety of other interests as iraqis constitute significant percentage of private security contractors the use of private contractor s provides cultural nd linguistic advantage over the use of us soldiers and ameliorates much potential friction with the local populations according to one expert they may also forestall possible criticism from us taxpayers for using us soldiers to protect the profitmaking companies that carry out us reconstruction efforts177 without private contract ors the us military would not have sufficient capabilities to carry out an operation of the s cale of iraq according to many analystshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32419crs37 178 the other two ways in which they judged the use of contractors could adversely affect military capabilities were by limiting training opportunities in some military specialties which has occurred in some cases with nonsecurity contractors see gao report gao 03695 opcit p 9 and result in inadequate stocks of

question whether the use of private s ecurity providers in iraq and elsewhere is beneficial to the us military in the l ong run although contracting private sector firms for guard duties may help alleviate the current shortage of military personnel analysts point to potential downsides to the force multiplier argument one important area of concern is whether the use of pscs is detrimental to military force structure has deleterious potential effect on the military missi on is flexible and are of an appropriate quality for personnel effects on the us m ilitary force structure analysts for the 1995 commission on roles and missions corm found that reliance on contractors could prove detrimental to military capabilities in number of ways the first of which was that it could keep the united states from building and maintaining capacity needed for strategic or other important missions178 anecdotal reports that private security firms have been hiring away military personnel particularly special forces personnel with high salaries seem to illustrate the possibility that competing private sector could deplete the military of highly trained personnel in needed specialties proponents of the use of private sect or security providers discount such concerns stating that the numbers employed by private security companies are too low to have significant effect on us capabilities quantifiable evidence of detrimental effect is lacking 2005 gao analysis shows that the average attrition rates for military occupational specialities preferred by private security providers were lower in fy2004 when demand for such providers in iraq was high than in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 these specia lities were army and navy enlisted and officer special operations forces army infantry and military police from all four services in the particular case of army special forces enlisted personnel however attrition was somewhat higher in 2004 than in 2000 and 2001 the gao

problematic some analysts argue these reports however generally discuss inci dents involving contractors who are american not iraqi or other foreign nati onals as noted above proponents argue that sizable presence of iraqis among those providing secu rity under us contracts overall reduces the possible friction that the use of us soldiers in these positions would entail concerns regarding flexibility some analysts also contend that military forces have additional benefits in hostile situations lthough some state that private contractors can be deployed more quickly than military forces others argue that military commanders can respond more quickly to changing situations when military forces rather than contractors are used commanders do not exercise command and control over private contractors nor do they have the authority to amend contracts in the midst of an operation to reallocate contract employees to perform necessary tasks that fall outside the terms of the contract181

parameters for military contractor relationships t he interaction between us military forces and security contractors in iraq is one of coordination rather than control because private security contractors have direct cont ractual relationship with the commander if federal agency or reconstruction contractor issued contract that required the private security firm to coordinate with military units such contract would need to contain clauses giving the commander coordination authority over priv ate security contractors nevertheless according to the document commanders can to certain extent influence the discipline of contractor employees by working with the contracting officer to pursue contract remedies commanders can also limit or revoke an benefits or special status of contractor

and department of state officials have stated that while they believe their efforts to improve management have contributed to the improved performance of pscs they cannot determine to what degree the reduction in shooting incidents is the result of their efforts the general decrease in violence in iraq or the military surge211 recent report issued by the government accountability office found that since the september 16 nis oor square blackwater inci dent both dod and the state department have take n steps to increase staffing oversight and c oordination over psc and that these steps may help reduce the number of psc incidents in iraq212 the report also stated that dod and the state department have improved coordination related to pscs in iraq and points to several steps taken as an illustration of the point213 further the report states that the state department and dod have improved their coordination with the government of iraq214 however the report expressed concerns regarding dods ability to sustain its staffing and training efforts in managing its pscs in iraq as well as pointing to steps that the state department still has to take in implementing the kennedy group recommendation through its oversight responsibilities c ongress might use variety of measures to determine whether the management and coordination taken by the state department and dod are ade quate in controlling the actions of pscs in iraq or whether additional steps are still needed changes in the number of weapons discharge by pscs may serve as an indicator that the issue of psc oversight and management may need to be revisited another measure may be the number and veracity of complaints lodged by the iraqi people iraqi government or us government personnel against pscs also if pscs

posted on the committees website states that the security services provided by blackwater would typically be performed by an army sergeant whose salary housing and subsistence pay range from approximately 140 to 190 per day depending on rank and years of service these equate to an annual salary ranging from approximately 51100 to 69350 per year according to the memo blackwater was providing those services in conjunction with kuwaiti company regency hotel hosp ital company to ess support services worldwide which in turn was providing di ning services and construction for other contractors such as kbr and fluor corporation taking markups and other costs into account the memo concluded that the blackwate r costs are four to tens time higher than the costs of us soldier memo last accessed june 19 2007 through httpoversighthousegov pp 45diplomatic security agents both proponents and opponents of the use of contractors have made cost comparisons but usually have not elaborated on what factors were involved in the assumptions underlying the cost comparisons and whether those factors were comparable the relative direct cost advantage of contractors can vary and may diminish or disappear altogether depending on the circumstances and contract conditions apart from the direct cost of salaries which will vary according to the mix of countries of origin of employed personnel offered the costs to the us government of pr ivate security contracts can depend on any benefits provided and the rms negotiated in contract or subcontract for instance the us government does not pay for benefits such as health insurance or incur longterm liabilities such as disability compensation and pensions when private security contractors are employed on the other hand some analysts contend that the total costs of private security contracts have been underestimated because they do not include the subsidy that the us government in effect provides contracting companies including when former us so ldiers trained at taxpayer expense are employed proponents of the use of private security contractors have said that private security contractors are less expensive than using us military forces because private companies can employ locals and third country nationals whose earnings are fraction of us servicemembers private contractors can incur much lower costs by using local hires extensively as they do not have to transport them house or feed them and can pay wages that are relatively low compared to those paid to us servicemembers private security contractors in iraq keep total costs low by employing many iraqis according to proponents one recent congressional analysis however found that in the case of personnel provided by one company ie blackwater worldwide the total cost of private security personnel was significantly higher than the direct costs that wouldbe incurred by the us military because of markups and other costs charged the

and commitment the desire to entrust the capability to use force legally on behalf of the united states to private companies including t hose employing nonus citizens has foreign policy implications for the united states although many analysts perceive the officially sanctioned private use of force as significantly eroding the modern states monopoly on the use of force whether this erosion is beneficial or detrimental to us foreign policy and to the international order is matter of dispute218 to the extent that private companies are perceived as participating in combat operations it may be difficult for the united states to persuade other states to recognize contractors rights to protection under the geneva conventions on symbolic level the use of private companies may be perceived by
