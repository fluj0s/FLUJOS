iraq has steadily increased the disparity between the higher price of fuel supplied to the united states central command compared to iraqs civilian population has been point of contention several factors contribute to the disparity including the different types of fuel used by the military compared to iraqi civilians the iraqi governments price subsidies and the level pricing that the dods

remain higher than the official subsidized price background the defense energy support center desc the primary agency responsible for procuring dods ground and air transportation fuels buys bulk energy commodities and resells the fuel to various military customers with price markup to cover its cost of operation eg storage transportation and maintenance1 in order to deliver fuel as cost effectively as possible the desc will often provide its overseas customers with energy purchased from regional suppliers however the desc generally charges all of its customers worldwide uniform price for example military unit in iraq pays the same price for jet fuel jp8 as military unit stationed in most other parts of the world2 fuels purchased by the desc include jet diesel motor and aviation gasoline the desc also arranges contracts for direct purchase of fuels at commercial airports and contracts 1 desc falls under the overall command of the defense logistics agency 2 for complete

by air force and army aircraft it is also used in army tactical vehicles for example in the abrams m1a1m1a2 main battle tank it also serves as substitute for diesel fuel in other tactical vehicles motor gasoline is typically used by light nontactical vehicles operated at post camps and stations in iraq the breakdown of petroleum used by dod in fy2007 was 815 jet fuel 158 diesel and 26 gasoline4

indicative of the true cost of fuel as part of an agreement with the international monetary fund fuel subsidies have been and may continue to be reduced see table 4 for current subsidized prices13

information administration official energy statistics from the us government iraq oil see httpwwweiadoegovemeucabsiraqoilhtml it is estimated that the official price for gallon of regular gasoline in iraq now stands at approximately 14415 however as this price is subsidized by the government the black market price of gasoline can be almost three times the official price reportedly hovering around 400 gallon16 the black market price of gasoline may be closer reflection of the true cost of gasoline in iraq than the subsidized government price comparing the cost of fuels delivered to the centcom area of responsibility and the cost paid by iraqs civilian population is difficult number of the fuels used by the us military are generally not used by iraqi civilians where comparable fuels such as gasoline and diesel are used it is estimated that the military units pay higher prices than iraqi civilians paying the official price for number of reasons including 1 the iraqi government subsidizes the cost of gasoline and diesel in iraq17 2 the military likely has higher transportation costs associated with bringing fuel into iraq and 3 the price charged by the desc is the level price that it charges to all its military customers around the world irrespective of the actual cost of fuel supplied to iraq 13 energy information administration official energy statistics from the us government
