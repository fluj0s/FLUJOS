surviva l and disease and conservation assistance are excluded from suspension when co untry is decertified under the drug certification requirements other typ of assistance are excludable upon notification to congress as indicated below under these exclusions from 1350 million t 2885 million of standard foreign assistance would be excluded from suspension and drawdowns of military equipment and foreign military sales would be excluded s well exportimport bank financing would not be excluded and would be cut off exclusi on of narcotics control disaster relief food and medicine an d

assistance b narcotics controlrelated assistance c disaster relief assistance d food or medicine and assistance for refugees in the case of mexico this means t hat 8 million of the state departments international narcotics control inc assistance would be exclu ded from suspension while the 79 million of the department of defenses count erdrug assistance would be excluded from suspension because it is not authorized by the foreign assistance act of 1961 and is for counternarcotics purposes exclusion of child survival and disease programs section 522 of th foreign operations appropriations act f or fy1999 provides that funds appropriated by this act that are made available for child survival activities or disease program s including activities relat ing to research on and the prevention treatment and controlhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30080crs5 of acquired immune deficiency syndrome may be made available notwithstanding any provision of law that restr icts assistance to foreign countries in the case of mexico this means that the 12 million for hivaids prevention would be excluded from suspension exclus ion of conservation programs and possible exclusion of energ programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions following congressiona l notificat ion section 540b of the foreign operations appropriations act fo r fy1999 provides with some exceptions that funds may be u sed notwithstanding any other provision of law f or supporting tropical forestry and biodiversity conservation activities and subject to congressional notification for supporting energy programs aimed at reducin g greenhouse gas emissions in the case of mexico this means that some if not all of the 318 million conservation program would be excluded and that the 282 million program for reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions would be excluded unless congress put hold on the program possible exclusion of funds directed to ngos following notification t congress section 543 of the foreign operations appropriations act for fy1999 provides that any foreign assistance restrictions shall not be construed to restric t assistance supporting programs of nongovernmental organizations ngos provided the president decides the assistance is in the national interest and congress is notified under reprogramming procedures in the case of mexico all of th remainin g economic assistance not excluded above 6750 million might b excluded if congress did not object because all the assistance is channeled throug h ngos however some parts f the fire preventionrestoration program 3 million and the dem ocracy programs 325 million might be more doubtful because of the fact that assistance provides services to the ministry of environment the judiciary and the congress assuming that the assistance that provided services t governmental agencies did not meet fully the ngo test 215 million would b excluded from suspension summary of nonexcludable foreign assistance taking into account the exclusions mentioned above as much as 2885 m illion of standard foreign assistance to mexico might be excluded f rom suspension including all economic assistance and all narcotics assistance leaving only 1 million in imet assistance to be suspended using more restrictive view of the exclusion of assist ance channeled through ngos about 46 million in economic assistance and the 1 million in imet assistanc would be nonexcludable and would be cut off other u s military and export assistance while section 506 drawdowns of military equipment and foreign military sales would be excluded from suspension because obligations and expend itures are involved exportimport bank financing and transfers of excess defense articles are not excludable and would be suspended because these programs re not programmed in advance but depend on the demand for such programs it is difficult to judge the effect of suspension if mexico wer decertified based on the amount of assistance in recent years the suspende d assistance could amount to few million dollars in xcess defense articles but could amount to up to 2 bil lion in exportimport bank financing per year since export import bank programs were developed to support the sales of us products these suspensions would be harmful to us exporters as well as to mexican buyershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30080crs6 c what assistance could be provided despite decertification of mexico if the president exercised special waiver authorities although th president might be reluctant to exercise special waiver authorities he has broad statutor authority to wa ive restrictions and to provide foreign assistance section 614 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended provides that the president ma authorize the furnishing of assista nce under the foreign assistance act and the arms export control act without regard to any provision of foreign assistanc authorization or appropriation acts when he determines and notifies congress i n writing that to do so is important to the security interests of the united states despite the decertification of colombia in late february 1997 president clinto n exercised the special authorities of section 614 in augu st 1997 to provide 30 million in foreign military fina ncing fmf and 600000 in imet assistance to colombia although the presidents authority under section 614 is very b road it does not extend to all assistance since exportimport bank financing is not authorized by th foreign assistance act the p residents special waiver authorities would not apply in that case conse quences of decertification of mexico on multilatera l development bank lending what amount of loans has mexico received from relevan t multilateral development banks mdbs section 490a2 of the foreig n assistance act of 1961 as amended requires the us executive director f multilateral development banks mdbs to vote against any loans or other utilizations for any decertified country the term multilateral development bank is defined in the same section to mean the international bank for re construction and development ibrd or world bank the interamerican development bank idb the asia n development bank the african development bank and the european bank fo r reconstruction and development while the international monetary fund imf is an international financial in stitution it is not an mdb within the meaning of the drug certification legislation the only institu tions that are relevant for mexico in this case are the wo rld bank and the interamerican development bank the amount f lending that mexico has received from these banks is indicated below in table 3 based on information from the two institutions mexico has been major borrower from the world bank and the i db with most of the loans being under the regular loan facilities at the banks unsubsidized quasi market repayment rates generally ½ percent more than the banks pay to borro w money commercially on world markets these loans have supported programs t improve health care reform the social security system strengthen education moderniz agriculture promote energy efficiency provide water and sanitation i n rural areas and develop better roads pending and proposed loans are generally to support the same types of activities pending world bank loans would suppor t education programs air quality improvement and financial restructuring and support proposed idb loans would support improved distribut ion of electricity strengthening of state and municipal governments protection of social expenditures an d improvement of

2150table 3 multilateral development bank lending to mexico most recent fiscal years and pending loans millions of us dollars b how would current mdb loans to mexico be affected if mexico were decertifi ed multilateral development bank loans for mexico that were approved previously would not be affected at all by decertification the drug certificatio n legislation provides only that the united states representative would oppose future loans to any decertified country this means that the still pending loans for mexico would be the most immediately effected by the drug certification requirements c what would be the impact of us representatives voting agains t multilateral development bank loans to mexico if mexico were decertified in the event that mexico were decertified under the drug certification requirements the us executive directors of the world bank and the inter american development bank would be required to vote against any future loans for mexico including th loans mentioned above as pend ing or proposed it is unlikely that negative vote by the united states would determine the outcome of the loans even though votin g rights are determined by contribution and the united states is the single larges t contributor to both banks on the one hand bank loans are generally approved b majority vote and the united states 1715 share in the world bank and its 3110 share in the interamerican development bank would not be sufficient to bloc k approval with various combinations of countries able to outvote the united states on the other hand decisions on mdb loans are generally taken by consensus an d us views might carry considerable weight in delaying or modifying loan proposals some officials suggest that us opposition t loans would carry greater weight if the opposition was seen as objection to th purposes or terms of the loans rather than as compliance to legislative requirement t directly related to the loans it should be noted that colombia was decertified under the drug cert ification requirements in 1996 and 1997 but that colombia received 1397 million in loans from the world bank and at least 2145 million in loans from the idb in the two year period when th us representative voted against loans to col ombia comparing these loans to other periods when the united states did not vote against loans for colombia is difficul t because lending varies greatly by year httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30080crs8 d could the president waive the requirement for us representatives to vote against mdb loans of decertified countries using special waive r authorities officials at the general counsels office at the treasury department expressed the preliminary opinion that section 614 special waiver authorities relating to the provision of foreign assistance would not apply to the requirement that us representatives vote against proposed loans for decertified countries
