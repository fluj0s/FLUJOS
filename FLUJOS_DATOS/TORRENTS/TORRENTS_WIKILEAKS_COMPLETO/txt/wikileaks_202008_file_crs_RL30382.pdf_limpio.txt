httpwwwcsisorgpacforccjapansouth korea relations converging interests and implications for the united states introduction closing the usjapansouth korea triangle although the us has longstanding bilateral alliances with both japan and south korea mistrust between tokyo and seoul and japanese constitutional barriers to collective security often have prevented trilateral relations from assuming the shape of true triangle1 in the 34 years since the 1965 normalization treaty was signed relations between japan and south korea often have been antagonistic rather than cooperative despite us attempts to encourage better relations and despite sharing many common security and economic interests bilateral tensions prevented routine consultation between the japanese and south korean governments particularly in the military services and in the lower levels of the two countries bureaucracies although pressing economic and political issues often compelled pragmatic cooperation between tokyo and seoul until recent months such consultation was carried out only between top leaders and was done primarily on an ad hoc basis2 recent improvements in japansouth korean relations over the past year for several mutually reinforcing reasons relations between south korea and japan have improved dramatically to point where arguably the two countries are at their closest ever motivated principally by the desire to unify policy toward north korea and the wish to capitalize on common economic interests south korean president kim dae jung and japanese prime minister keizo obuchi in october 1998 declared that they had forged new partnership this achievement was made possible by president kims conspicuous avoidance of verbal attacks against japans imperial past critical icebreaker for improved relations since the fall of 1998 the two countries have held regular meetings between cabinetlevel officials japan has submitted its firstever written apology for its 35year occupation of the korean peninsula south korea has dropped many of its barriers to japanese imports the two militaries have established communication hot lines ministers of the two countries have

japanesesouth korean relations has significant implications for us foreign policy particularly us policy toward north korea improved bilateral relations have been accompanied by an unprecedented degree of trilateral coordination among the us japan and south korea with respect to north korea as part of the process undertaken by william perry president clintons us north korea policy coordinator the three countries in march 1999 established trilateral coordination mechanism called the trilateral cooperation and oversight group tcog under which senior officials are to meet regularly to focus on north korea policy seven such gatherings occurred between march and november 1999 including threeway summit between president clinton japanese prime minister obuchi and south korean president kim in september many observers have argued that the trilateral unity forged under tcog consultations that are often referred to as the perry process played role in convincing north korea to declare moratorium on further tests of its taepodong longrange missile3 in the near future maintaining cooperative relationship between south korea and japan may become even more significant the perry report portions of which were released last october calls on the us to gradually and conditionally normalize relations with pyongyang in the hopes of inducing north korea to freeze its missile and nuclear weapons programs4 this position is in broad agreement with president kims sunshine policy of engaging rather than confronting north korea5 many argue that increased japanese involvement primarily in the form of economic assistance and food aid will be critical to convincing the north korean leadership to alter its military policy indeed some observers believe that north korea agreed in the summer of 1999 to moratorium on tests of its longrange missiles because it expected that japan would resume shipments of food aid which had been halted following pyongyangs august 1998 launch of taepodong2 over japan also in response to the missile test japan halted charter flights to north korea froze diplomatic normalization talks and briefly suspended its financial participation in the korean peninsula energy development organization kedo in november 1999 japan resumed charter flights to north korea on december 1 former prime minister tomoiichi murayama led 16member multiparty delegation

opportunities for the us over the longer term closer cooperati on between seoul and tokyo helps enhance stability in northeast asia major us objective for instance the two countries have begun planning coordinated responses to potential crises such as an attack by north korea or sudden influx of north korean refugees additionally greater bilateral harmony should make it easier for the us south korea and japan to plan coordinated responses to sudden or gradual reunification of the korean peninsula in the economic sphere increased cooperation between the japanese and south korean governments will present the us with opportunities as well as challenges on the one hand to the extent that the lowering of trade barriers between the two countries boosts their economies us exports are likely to increase because firms and individuals in both nations will have more funds to purchase us products on the other hand united front between japan and south korea could pose challenge to us positions in international trade negotiations in the runup to the seattle ministerial meeting of the world trade organization wto in november 1999 for instance japan and south korea have joined the european union in resisting liberalization of agriculture markets and have demanded the revision of the wtos antidumping rules positions that are opposed to us policy factors propelling japan and south koreas convergence regional security and economic crises regional crises have provided the immediate impetus for the improvement in south korean and japanese relations on the security side the heightened concern about north koreas missile program has been the most important development driving the two nations together after the august 1998 taepodong test and north korean naval incursions into japanese waters in march 1999 japanese officials began to perceive need to increase military coordination with south korea additionally when the japanese government unilaterally suspended its participation in the korean peninsula energy development organization kedo and adopted harder line toward pyongyang in the aftermath of the missile test us and south korean foreign policymakers made concerted effort to improve trilateral consultation in order to convince japan to resume its economic assistance package6 in the economic sphere the nearcollapse of the south korean economy in 1997 led south korea to make significant overtures to japan in order to obtain japans financial assistance as part of the 58 billion 1997 international monetary fund rescue package seoul agreed to phase out its import diversification system whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30382crs4 bans imports of selected japanese products japan reportedly had demanded this move as precondition for backing the imf support program and for extending 10 billion in bilateral loan commitments to south korea more than twice the amount pledged by the us also in 1999 south korea lifted its ban on 48 japanese goods and partially liberalized inflows of japanese cultural products the erosion of traditional obstacles to better relations while regional crises have provided the immediate impetus for better relations longterm forces over the past decade also have been working to erode obstacles to fuller cooperation between japanese and south korean officials the end of the cold war during the cold war japan and south koreas individual alliances with the us created perception in both seoul and tokyo that ties with each other were merely ancillary to relations with the us this was particularly the case among japanese policymakers who until recently tended to regard relations with south korea as comparatively insignificant the end of the cold war and the prospect of us withdrawal from the region have led officials in tokyo and seoul to regard each other as significant partners in their own right and not merely as secondary elements of their respective relations with the us in addition to the dominating us presence the structure of the us alliances during the cold war inhibited better relations between south korea and japan whereas the us alliance with seoul was primarily aimed at containing north korea the usjapan alliance was aimed mostly at the soviet union thus differing goals in their respective us alliances discouraged japan and south korea from cooperating on military matters by the time of kim daejungs trip to japan in 1998 this situation had changed markedly with the collapse of the soviet union severely reducing the military threat in asia japan has come to regard north korea as its major immediate security challenge the question of whether the us will scale down if not withdraw its forward presence in east asia also has led seoul and tokyo to treat relations with each other as important in their own right deemphasis on historical issues so near yet so far is phrase often used in both japan and south korea to describe the emotional and historical chasm that divides the two countries despite their geographic proximity the most prominent obstacle to better relations has been the inability to overcome the mistrust spawned by south korea and japans shared history mutual suspicions traditionally have filtered into virtually all areas of the bilateral relationship even those ostensibly unrelated to historical issues japan annexed the korean peninsula in 1910 and for the next 35 years attempted to submerge korean culture since imperial japans defeat in world war ii postwar japanese leaders repeatedly have failed to convince south koreans that they truly acknowledge and have apologized for the wrongs committed during the occupation simmering south korean resentment has been stoked from time to time by korean politicians seeking to distract public attention from domestic problems korean bitterness has also been inflamed by events in japan including remarks by japanese politicians denying or downplaying prewar japans imperialist actions allegations that japans ministry of education had censoredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30382crs5 7worst of friends the economist october 3 1998 8byungjoon ahn japanese policy toward korea in

issued public condemnations of japans wartime behavior and china failed to receive written apologyhistory textbooks portrayal of world war ii and revelations that the japanese military forcibly recruited korean comfort women to provide sexual services to japanese soldiers during world war ii when japanese officials have talked of playing bigger role in asia south korean leaders often have reacted with suspicion or even outright hostility on the japanese side opinion polls regularly show that the majority of the population believe that south korea is an untrustworthy neighbor sentiment that has occasionally been exploited by opportunistic politicians unresolved territorial disputes clashes over fishing rights and koreans reputation in japan for unreliable business dealings have fed this grassroots leeriness of south korea which occasionally has undermined tokyos official efforts to forge closer relations on another level japanese officials occasional concerns about offending south korean sensitivities often has made them reluctant to pursue closer ties with korea and to publicly talk about upgrading japans role in korean peninsular issues7 the legacy of the past has also broken through in bilateral discussions over the legal rights of the 700000 or so ethnic koreans living in japan many of whom are descended from families forcibly relocated during the occupation for years ethnic koreans have experienced numerous humiliations including fingerprinting requirements bans on holding teaching and civil servant posts and the absence of voting rights despite the fact that most were born and educated in japan seoul often has made the legal status of this ethnic minority an issue in government to government deliberations8 during the past year leaders in tokyo and seoul have taken positive steps to address some of these historical disagreements or at least to divert attention away from them during his official visit to japan in october 1998 president kim avoided harsh verbal attacks against japans imperial past move that was greeted as magnanimous gesture by most japanese in return prime minister obuchi presented him with written apology to the south korean people for japans wartime aggression9 the apology the first ever issued by japan in writing paved the way for the south korean government in september 1999 to take the unprecedented step of inviting japanese emperor akihito to south korea another sign that south korea is deemphasizing historical issues was seouls official silence regarding the japanese diets august 1999 decision to legalize the rising sun emblem and imperial hymn as the nations official flag and national anthem respectively seouls acceptance of improved japannorth korean relations for much of the past 50 years south koreans have harbored suspicions of japanese policy toward north korea many officials in seoul have criticized japans occasionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30382crs6 10douglas ostrom complementarity and competition japansouth korean trade washington dc japan economic institute 1998diplomatic approaches toward pyongyang as attempts to play the two koreas against one another in order to extract maximum benefits for tokyo moreover many south koreans believe that most japanese officials want to keep korea divided because of tokyos fears that unified korea particularly one potentially armed with nuclear weapons and able to access lowcost north korean labor would pose military and economic threat to japan thus until the kim government assumed power in 1998 south korea usually insisted that japan consult with seoul before improving relations with north korea some analysts have argued that domestic politics worsened the gap between japan and south korea over the appropriate north korea policy throughout the cold war japans socialist party often advocated improving relations with pyongyang in part to appease the socialists the ruling liberal democratic party ldp made many overtures toward north korea as consequence japan frequently flirted with twokorea policy partially for domestic political reasons in recent months domestic political changes in tokyo and seoul have helped to narrow the gap over north korea policy in japan series of electoral defeats have reduced the socialist party to fraction of its former size thereby reducing the need for the ldp to reach out to pyongyang simply to placate the socialists more importantly on the south korean side president kim has reversed seouls long standing opposition to stronger relations between pyongyang and tokyo because japanese aid to north korea is crucial to the success of kims sunshine policy president kim has encouraged japan and other nations to normalize relations with north korea south korea joined by the us also has urged tokyo to resume shipments of food aid to pyongyang move japan has resisted thus far indeed in marked reversal of the two countries traditional positions it is now japan that is taking hard line against north korea while south korea is advocating conciliatory policy of economic and political engagement in late 1999 japan has backed away somewhat from its refusal to deal with north korea in the aftermath of the taepodong2 missile launch resuming charter flights to north korea and on december 1 dispatching multiparty delegation led by former socialist party prime minister tomoiichi murayama to pyongyang to help jumpstart normalization talks that have been stalled since 1992 deemphasis on economic competition and trade imbalan ces the economic relationship between south korea and japan has been characterized as one of complementarity and competition10 on the one hand firms in both countries have benefitted from extensive bilateral trade flows in 1996 the last full year before the south korean economy was sent reeling by corporate and financial crises japan was south koreas secondla rgest export market and secondlargest source of imports with total trade surpassing 32 trillion 266 billion at 120 100 shipments to japan accounted for over 7 of south koreas exports similarly south koreahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30382crs7 11marc

second to the us as japans most important export market and source of imports11 on the other hand south korean and japanese firms compete headtohead in variety of sectors most notably automobiles semiconductors shipbuilding and steel additionally seouls trade deficit with tokyo since the 1950s often has been source of bilateral tension in particular south koreas exceptional reliance on imports of japanese intermediate goods including electronic parts and machinery has worried seoul that it has become economically dependent upon its former colonizer periodically the korean side also has charged that japanese companies are engaging in mercantile practices by refusing to transfer technology to korean firms12 in the past south korean governments used the trade deficit as justification for requesting bilateral economic assistance from japan and for demanding that japan open its markets to korean products in recent years trade issues have not created the same tension as in the 1980s and early 1990s despite the fact that south koreas bilateral trade deficit continued to hit recordbreaking highs in the middle of the decade peaking at 146 billion in 199613 part of the reason for the disappearance of trade disputes from the bilateral agenda may be that japan has accounted for diminishin g shares of south korean exports and imports since 1990 primarily due to the explosion in south koreas trade with the rest of east asia in 1990 for example south korea shipped 26 times as many goods to japan as to taiwan singapore malaysia and indonesia combined by 1996 however combined exports to these four countries had surpassed shipments to japan14 moreover as mentioned above the south korean economic crisis led seoul to remove many barriers to japanese imports perhaps most significantly president kim and prime minister obuchi have institutionalized bilateral economic consultations under the two leaders march 1999 proclamation of an agenda for koreajapan economic cooperation economic planners from the two sides have met to discuss establishing bilateral investment treaty and free trade area furthermore for the first time seoul and tokyo have set up working level meetings to consult on policy in the proposed wto round of trade talks in the runup to the negotiation which opened in seattle on november 30 1999 both countries have adopted similar positions on number of issues what is remarkable about the recent bilateral cooperation in the wto is that during the previous multilateral round of trade talks called the uruguay round 19861993 the two sides failed to coordinate

developments have encouraged convergence between the two countries there are also still many points of contention lingering historical passions remain and could erupt into major bilateral dispute over issues such as wartime comfort women territorial disputes fishing rights and continued japanese trade surpluses ethnic koreans in japan still face discrimination and seouls patience may wear thin if the japanese government fails to follow through on recent promises to grant voting rights to this ethnic minority at the popular level although there are signs that an increasing number of south koreans accept larger regional and global role for japan public opinion polls in both countries reveal that mutual distrust remains strong15 south koreans remain wary of steps that enlarge japans defense capabilities including tokyos recent decisions to develop indigenous military satellite technology and to join with the us in developing theater missile defense system many observers hope that the soccer 2002 world cup to be jointly hosted by japan and south korea will help to bridge the cultural gap notably by making it easier for koreans and japanese to travel between the two countries although recent north korea policy coordination between south korea the us and japan has been remarkably successful differences over how to deal with pyongyang are likely to surface since the taepodong missile launch japan has advocated hard line against pyongyang stance that occasionally has created conflicts with kim dae jungs sunshine policy although japanese officials have resumed some of the economic assistance that they halted in the aftermath of the taepodong crisis they may feel compelled to resume their harsh position if they perceive that north korea is failing to abide by promises to freeze the taepodong missile program additionally since 1997 bilateral human rights issues between japan and north korea have triggered fierce antinorth korean sentiments in the japanese diet most prominent are alleged abductions of japanese citizens by north korean agents and the international travel restrictions on the japanese wives of north korean men responding to the public mood in japan tokyo has made additional humanitarian aid to pyongyang contingent on progress on outstanding human rights issues south korea and the us however have been pressuring japan to shelve its human rights concerns16 additionally concerns about antagonizing china may lead seoul and tokyo to scale back their overtures toward one another south korea in particular is acutely sensitive to shifts in triangular politics among the three countries for example when seoul broached the idea of joint naval exercise with japan this year it was also careful to make similar offer to beijing which chinese officials turned down some experts warn that if china continues to remain cool toward improved ties with seoul south korean officials may feel less enthusiastic about strengthening ties with tokyohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30382crs9 the true test of improved bilateral relations will be whether the newfound cooperation transcends the temporary convergence of security interests regarding north korea and whether such cooperation survives change in leadership in seoul president kim has been the driving force behind seouls warmer relations with all its neighbors including japan if as many experts predict kims ruling coalition suffers defeat in the april 2000 parliamentary elections seoul could modify its sunshine policy toward pyongyang the us role in japansouth korean relations many observers speculate that over the coming decade leaders in the us and northeast asia will confront number of challenging regional issues such as the possible reunification of the two koreas the sustainability of the 100000 us troops in asia possible changes in the size and posture of the japanese military and policies toward china greater degree of trust between japan and south korea would help stabilize the region as they brace for these potential changes the united states will play an important role in shaping the future of japan south korea relations former us defense secretary has been widely praised for institutionalizing trilateral coordination on north korea policy in his capacity as us north korea policy coordinator and many observers argue that us leadership will be vital for the perry process to continue furthermore as the major ally of both japan and south korea the us is in position to encourage and facilitate bilateral and trilateral confidencebuilding measures these steps will be critical to persuading japanese leaders that potentially unified korea is not danger and to convincing south koreans that diplomatically more assertive and militarily capable japan
