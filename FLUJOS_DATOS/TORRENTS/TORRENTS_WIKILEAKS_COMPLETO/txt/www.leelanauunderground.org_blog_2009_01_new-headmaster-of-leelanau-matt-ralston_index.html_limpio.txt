teachers i have ever met however he does not stand for misbehavior this is from his latest email to our hill community all i am writing to inform you that the map room will be closed to student use until further notice i have reminded good number of you that the map room is not part of the student center and is designed to be quiet study area i remind people several times each day of the two signs which are not subtle or hidden which tell you not to eat or drink in the area when i passed through the map room after lunch i found two broken chairs with legs and backs where to be found if the student or students responsible for this misuse and destruction of this great space will come see or one of the deans then the closure will be shorter in duration mr ralston i wish him all the

quote 4 anonymous okay so when is the isacs representative coming to leelanau anonymous when will the isacs representative be coming to leelanau this is good question and its one i unfortunately do not have an answer for i heard this isacs story from multiple sources who i trust very much and it could be that the situation has changed since then or that my sources were incorrect i am also now hearing completely different side of the story i am only as good as my sources if anybody has information on this such as the report leelanau has submitted to isacs school employeees students etc i encourage you to send it to at leelanautalkatgmailcom sources write the rules if you dont want to release the documentsevidence then i wont as long as i can see evidence contrary to what ive been told about isacs ill update this site to reflect that and issue an apology for distributing information that is inaccurate on related note i think that especially given these allegations it would be good move for school administrators to release these isacs reports other schools have opted to publish their isacs reports online from what i have seen of them there is compelling reason for the school to keep them secret adb name email will not be published website subscribe to comments feed almost there dates present recent posts note to seniors some statistics leelanau news blood drive leelanau golf
