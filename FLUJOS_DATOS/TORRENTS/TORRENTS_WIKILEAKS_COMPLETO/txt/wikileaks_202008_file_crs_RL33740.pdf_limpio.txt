the usjapan alliance has undergone significant changes in the first term of the bush administration converging us and japanese objectives in confronting north koreas nuclear and missile programs and japans participation in us operations in iraq and afghanistan reinforced the notion of the usjapan alliance as one of the central partnerships of us foreign policy particularly in asia in 2007 political developments in japan and diverging policy approaches to north korea created some distance in the relationship but defense officials continue to work on implementing significant agreements to upgrade the alliance as us personnel and facilities in japan are realigned as part of the broader pentagon strategy of deploying more mobile force japan is expected to take an active role in contributing to global stability rising nationalism and tensions between japan and its neighbors indicate that there are risks to strengthening the alliance some observers say that alliance transformation could ultimately be destabilizing if regional powers feel their own security is threatened by more assertive japan or if japan fails to live up to us expectations changes to the usjapan alliance are of interest to congress because of the range of us security interests in east asia those concerns include the development of north koreas nuclear weapons programs the presence of militant islamic groups based in southeast asia the possibility of conflict with china over taiwan and the overall ascendance of china as potential challenger to us influence in the region for its oversight and budgetary responsibilities congress has an interest in how the alli ance might change under current proposals after brief historical review this report examines policy changes that have driven actual and proposed shifts in the alliance key features of the proposals include reduction in the number of us marines in japan the relocation of controversial marine air base in okinawa expanded

asia under the treaty of mutual cooperation and security about 53000 us troops are stationed in japan and have the exclusive use of 89 facilities throughout the archipelago1 okinawa hosting 37 of the facilities is the major us forward logistics base in the asiapacific region the security landscape of east asia is changing driven by chinas ascendance with the organizing principles of the cold war obsolete and resurgence of nationalism in countries with history of conflict uncertainty is increasing th bush administration designated the usjapan alliance as the fulcrum of american presence in the region an approach that holds both promises and risks some strategists see strong advantage to employing japans help as part of containment strategy to deter china from asserting itself in ways hostile to us interests in addition the japanese sdf may alleviate some of the burden on the us military by expanding its role in noncombat missions overseas on the other hand japans neighbors harbor historical distrust of tokyos ambitions japans relations with beijing and seoul reached low point under former prime minister junichiro koizumi leading to concern that regional rivalries could become destabilizing although relations have improved under koizumis successors china and south korea remain wary of any sign of japanese ascendance as japan is poised to take more active role in contributing to global stability primarily through increased coordination with the us military leaders in beijing and seoul are concerned that the japanese military will benefit from enhanced capabilities and challenge their own sense of security further after enjoying period of extremely close relations the usjapan relationship has slipped somewhat as the bush administration adjusted its policy on north korea as the bush administration has moved aggressively to reach deal on denuclearization with north korea in the sixparty talks distance has emerged between washington and tokyo political uncertainty in tokyo following abes abrupt resignation in september 2007 also calls into question how robustly alliance reform efforts will proceed po litical changes both in and between washington and tokyo could undermine regional security strategy that depends on unwavering ties

japan grants the us military basing rights on its territory in return for us pledge to protect japans security unlike other defense treaties with allies this pledge is not mutual japan does not extend

defense the normalization of relations between china and the united states and the us withdrawal from vietnam one major irritant was resolved when prime minister eisaku sato and nixon signed joint communique that returned administrative control of the okinawa islands to japan in 1972 although the united states has continued to maintain large military bases on the territory the establishment of

selfdefenseoriented policy but call for an more integrated security strategy and military that employs multifunctional flexible defense forces to deal with the changing security environment the reports emphasize the need to make the usjapan alliance more robust and credible and single out missile defense intelligence exchange and operational coordination as areas for cooperation the new framework presents shift from considering the alliance as only means to defend the territory of and areas surrounding japan to adopting global perspective that views the secur ity of japan and the

cooperation between japanese and american firms developing the system requires that japan improve its joint operations capability and upgrade its command and control networks to allow timely decisions further cooperation will require that japan lift or relax its ban on exporting arms as japanese defense officials have urged in order to further develop us japan research and development coordination

work more closely with us forces japan has created joint staff office that puts all the ground maritime and air selfdefense forces under single command under the previous organization joint command was authorized only if operations required multiple service participation which had never occurred in the sdfs history in july 2005 an amendment was made to the law establishing the sdf that required the joint chief of staff to counsel japans defense chief on all sdf operational matters and that all military orders will be given through the jcs in both peacetime and during contingencies the need

factors that could restrict japans ability to cooperate more robustly with the united states the most prominent and fundamental is article 9 of the japanese constitution drafted by american officials during the postwar occupation that outlaws war as sovereign right of japan and prohibits the right of belligerency it stipulates that land sea and air forces as well as other war potential will never be maintained however japan has interpreted this clause to mean that it can maintain military for selfdefense purposes and since 1991 has allowed the sdf to participate in noncombat roles overseas in number of peacekeeping missions and in the usled coalition in iraq the principle of collective selfdefense is also considered an obstacle to close defense cooperation the term comes from article 51 of the charter which provides that member nations may exercise the rights of both individual and collective selfdefense if an armed attack occurs the japanese government maintains that japan has the sovereign right to engage in collective selfdefense but 1960 decision by the cabinet legislation bureau interpreted the constitution to forbid collective actions because it would require considering the defense of other countries not just the safety of japan itself participation in noncombat logistical operations and rear support of other nations however has been considered outside the realm of collective self defense abe had spoken out about the need to reconsider this restriction but efforts to alter the interpretation stalled after his resignation during their deployment to iraq the interpretation prevented japanese forces from defending other nations troops 19 some japanese critics have charged that japanese aegis destroyers should not use their radar in the vicinity of american warships as they would not be allowed to respond to an incoming attack as the united states and japan increasingly integrate missile defense operation the ban on collective selfdefense also raises questions about how japanese commanders will gauge whether american forces or japan itself is being targeted under the current interpretation japanese forces could not respond if the united states were attacked bush administration officials have criticized japans legal interpretation of defense policy in 2004 then us secretary of state colin powell told the press that he supported japans bid to become permanent member of the security council but added that if japan is going to become full active member of the security council and have the kind of obligations that it would pick up as member then article 9 would have to be examined in that light 20 this followed similar comments by former deputy secretary of state richard armitage as early as 1997 armitage stated that japans selfprohibition on engaging in collective defense longer is applicablein fact it can be harmful21 visiting tokyo in november 2007 us defense 19 sdf members on overseas missions are not permitted to

on defense issues in japan appears to be shifting somewhat but the pacifism that characterized postwar japan remains significant whereas in the past japanese public opinion strongly supported the limitations placed on the sdf this opposition has softened considerably since the late 1990s the japanese public has expressed ambivalence about the value of article 9 and the ban on collective selfdefense as well the threat of north korea growing trepidation about chinas intentions the fear of international terrorism and the personal popularity of koizumi made the japanese public more accepting of the sdf dispatches to iraq and elsewhere despite these shifts however some regional analysts question whether the japanese public is ready to accept magnified role for japan in international security matters many observers have recognized trend of growing nationalism in japan particularly among the younger generation some japanese commentators have suggested that this

most prominently by former deputy secretary of state robert zoellick which aims to convince beijing to contribu peacefully to the international system that has allowed its economic and political rise the containment aspect of us policy seeks to counter china that could develop in ways inimical to us interests the usjapan alliance plays role in both approaches in the former japan could serve as

war formula for the usjapan alliance is outdated and that the forward presence of 53000 us troops is an unnecessary burden to the us military they assert that japan has the resources to develop into more autonomous defense force and could cooperate with the us military in areas of mutual concern on more limited normal country tocountry basis further advocates argue that the eventual withdrawal of us forces from japanese soil could cement more durable strategic partnership than the current configuration 31 opponents of this strategy argue that the largescale us military presence is necessary in region with simmering tension and the rise of china power that may challenge us hegemony in asia some military experts argue that reducing the number of marines stationed in japan while maintaining air and sea assets could reduce some of the burden on local communities and still maintain strong us deterrence in the region

to deflect regional concerns that japan is remilitarizing the sdf could focus its activities largely on humanitarian and reconstruction activities japan already has participated in several international peacekeeping missions as well as contributed to disaster relief efforts endorsement of humanitarian operations makes sdf dispatches more palatable for both the japanese public and other nations japanese policymakers drew upon resolutions to justify japans participation in operations in afghanistan and iraq the united states could encourage such participation by offering specific training for sdf troops for example japanese defense officials have expressed interest in learning more about disaster relief from the us military utilizing nonmilitary assets such as the coast guard instead of the msdf could reduce the concern about japan exceeding its selfdefense framework washington could also benefit from the presence of japanese troops in areas where us troops are not welcome the 2006 pew global attitudes project showed that japan was one of th worlds most favorablyviewed states as the us image worldwide slipped 32 to encourage japan to play more active role in international operations the united states could advance its support for japans bid to become permanent member of the security council unsc although the bush administration has backed japan it did not support the so called g 4 proposal which would grant nonveto unsc membership to germany india and brazil china permanent member of the unsc and south korea have voiced opposition to japans bid the

operations and training particularly in east asia the development of multilateral cooperation among the united states japan and other regional allies may help assuage concerns about japans growing capabilities33 if historical and political tension can be overcome security cooperation with the south korean military may be particularly productive given the two countries geographical proximity common security concerns and shared democratic values some analysts have suggest ed reviving the trilateral coordination and oversight group tcog 34 established in 1998 by defense secretary william perry to draw south korea and japan into dialogue on mutual issues of concern35 other us defense partners in the regionaustralia thailand singapore the philippines and potentially indiamay also be interested in developing security ties with japan if the united states provides cooperative frameworks multilateral exercises such as the an nual cobra gold exercise in thailand provide possible arena for sdf forces to become more integrated into regional defense cooperation some have suggested that military engagement with china could help ease regional tensions 36 admiral timothy keating commander of us forces in asia and the pacific has been proponent of renewed us military ties with beijing with particular focus on joint exercises in humanitarian operations after long hiatus because

the establishment of working group to create northeast asia peace and security mechanism although the six parties have focused most attention on the disarmament provisions of the agreement analysts say that such forum could resolve outstanding territorial concerns establish cooperation in fields like energy security and ease the distrust that has characterized postworld war ii relations us leadership would likely be crucial to forming such mechanism some experts argue that such regional organization could allow japan to follow the exam ple of germanys reintegration into europe 37 to

defense relationship is an appealing option for strengthening us security for many reasons japans powerful economy and developed democratic system make it natural and stable partner for the united states and its wellfunded military can complement us defense capabilities since the late 1990s strategic interests in washington and tokyo appeared to converge on countering the threat from north korea and hedging against chinas growing influence bush and koizumis leadership and strong personal rapport pushed forward unprecedented agreements on bilateral cooperation military support for usled operations in afghanistan and iraq reinforced the notion that the alliance had developed global reach despite these advances political developments since then may have decelerated the progress change of leadership in tokyo and strategi c shift toward negotiation with north korea in washington challenge the robustness of the alliance in the short to mediumterm some observers predict period of downturn for usjapan relations the experience may serve as cautionary tale to those who saw the alliance changes as major retooling of the strategic relationship in the longerterm the united states must also pay heed to regional dynamics japans increased assertiveness unnerved china and south korea in the face of regional tension the challenge for the united states is to take advantage of strong defense cooperation with japan without reinforcing the notion among some that japan is remilitarizing in way that destabilizes the region transforming the usjapan alliance brings the promise of delivering stalwart and capable ally closely integrated with us forces however closely aligning american priorities with japan in region with widespread unease about japans past behavior could limit us diplomatic flexibility realizing the stated goals for the alliance will require not only sustained management of usjapan bilateral concerns but also careful attention to regional security dynamics
