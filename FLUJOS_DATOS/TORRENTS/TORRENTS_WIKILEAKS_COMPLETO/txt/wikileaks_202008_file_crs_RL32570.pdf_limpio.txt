constitution prohibits in the absence of congressional au thorization over this period there has been continuing interest in knowing how much waste is being shipped across state lines for disposal and what states might be affected by proposed legislation this report provides data useful in addressing these questions total interstate waste shipments continue to rise due to the closure of older local landfills and the consolidation of the waste management indus try slightly more than 39 million tons of municipal solid waste cr ossed state lines for disposal in 2003 an increase of 11 over 2001 waste imports have grown significantly since crs began tracking them in the early 1990s and now represent 242 of the municipal solid waste disposed at landfills and waste combustion facilities in the last 10 years reported imports have increased 170 pennsylvania remains by far the largest waste importer the state received more than 91 million tons of msw nd 14 million tons of other nonhazardous waste from out of state in 2003 most of this waste came from new york and new jersey pennsylvanias waste imports represented 23 of the national total virginia the secondlargest importer received 55 million tons in 2003 40 less than the amount received by pennsylvania michigan the thirdlargest importer received 45 million tons of msw from out of state imports to both virginia and michigan increased substantially in the last year up about 1 million tons in each case nearly twothirds of michigans total imports about 28 million tons came from the canadian province of ontario these imports grew as the toronto area closed its last remaining landfill other states showing major increases were ohio illinoi s new jersey georgia south carolina tennessee oklahoma and texas in all 28 states had increased imports in the current report and 10 states reporte d imports that exceeded 1 million tons while waste imports increased overall veral states including pennsylvania indiana iowa and new york reported sh arp declines in imports in the current survey pennsylvanias imports fell for the second year in row about 15 million fewer tons of imports were received at pennsylvania landfills in 2003 than in 2001 factors causing this decline included th imposition of an additional 500 per ton state fee on waste disposal and the absence of rail service at pennsylvania landfills new york remains the largest exporter of waste with new jersey in second place these two states account for 37 of all municipal solid waste crossing state lines for disposal six othe r states missouri illinoi s maryland massachusetts ohio and washington the district of columbia and the canadian province of ontario also exported more than 1 million tons eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32570contents introduction 1 t t l s

legislation on interstate shipment of wast has been introduced in every congress since the 100th in the 104th congress the senate passed s 534 the bill would have granted states authority to restrict new shipments of municipal solid waste from out of state if requested by an affected local government in the 103rd congress both the house and senate passed interstate waste legislation hr 4779 and s

information on interstate shipment of municipal solid waste concerned about increased wa ste imports some stat have attempted to regulate this commerce federal courts however have declared these state restrictions unconstitutional if states are to have such authority congressional action is required since the late 1980s congress has cons idered but not enacted numerous bills that would grant such authority2 over this period there has been continuing interest in knowing how much waste is bein g shipped across state lines for disposal and what states might be affected by pr oposed legislation th is report provides data useful in addressing these questions it updates information provided in earlier crs reports3 the report presents information gather ed through telephone contacts with solid waste officials in the 50 states the distri ct of columbia and the canadian province of ontario the data obtained from these contacts are summarized in tables 1 2 and 3 and figures 1 and 2 table 4 presents additional information including the names and telephone num bers of state contacts and in some cases weblinks to detailed reports on solid waste management in the specific state httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32570crs2 4 we rely on imports rather than exports as our measure of total shipments because we believe that waste management facilities and states have greater interest in accurately measuring imports than they do exports of ten the amounts received and their source are subject to formal legal reporting requirement s andor fees with penalties for failure to report exports are not generally subject to such requirements 5 because many of the larger importing states now differentiate msw from other non hazardous waste imports we compared tota l msw imports to epas national estimate of msw generation 2292 million tons in the late st available year 2001 for epa data on waste generation see municipal solid wast basic facts at http wwwepagov epaoswernonhwmuncplfactshtm stat ereported waste generation summarized in biocycle magazines annual survey is substantially higher 3694 million tons in 2002 but may include other nonhazardous waste provided it was disposed at msw facilities for statereported data see scott m kaufman ra goldstein karsten millrath and nickolas j themelis the state of garbage in america biocycle january 2004 p 33 removing canadian waste from the total imports would so reduce the percentage of waste crossing state lines for disposal from 17 to 16 6 much of the waste destined for recycling may also have crossed state lines but waste destined for recycling does not carry the same s tigma as that sent for disposal and recycling facilities do not generally require permits by state agencies thus amounts shipped across state lines for recycling cannot generally be tracked by the solid waste agenciesnot all states require reporting of wast imports and very few track exports so the available data are incomplete and in some cases represent estimates rather than actual measurements in number of cases faced with conflicting reports from exporters and importers or quantitative data at all we provided our best estimate based on discussions with stat officials or other sources sixteen of the states provided data fo r period other than calendar year 2003 either their latest fiscal year or different calendar year this adds another layer of imprecision we combined data for what ever was the latest reporting period even though in these 16 cases this meant combin ing data from different time periods the exceptions from the 2003 reporting period are not ed in the appropriate tables but the reader should perhaps keep in mind that many of the totals repor ted here are our best estimate rather than precise figures total shipments the data show that total interstate waste shipments continue to rise4 imports in the current survey totaled 390 million tons 17 of the 2292 million tons of municipal solid waste generated in the united states5 of municipal waste disposed as opposed to recycled or composted the percentage is even higher epa estimates that 680 million tons of municipal solid wa ste were recycled or composted in 2001 leaving 1612 million tons to be disposed in ndfills or incinerators of this amount 242 crossed state lines for disposal6 between crss year 2002 report reportin g

decided was waste management holdings inc v gilmore 252 f3d 316 4th cir 2001waste import highlights twentyeight states had increased im ports of municipal waste since 2001 with the largest increases occurring in virginia and michigan the increases in these two states 14 million tons in virginia and 09 million tons in michigan over the twoyear period total 57 of the tire increase nationally the preponderance of these two states in the 2003 waste statistics demonstrates another element of the emerging picture of interstate waste shipment 49 of total municipal waste imports are disposed in just three states pennsylvania virginia and michigan as shown in table 1 pennsylvania continues to be the largest waste importer disposal facilities in the state receive d 91 million tons of msw and 14 million tons of other nonhazardous waste from out of state in 2003 the amounts represented nearly half of all solid waste disposed in the state and 235 of the national total for interstate shipments pe nnsylvania has abundant landf ill capacity relatively low tipping fees and is near two major states that have shortage of disposal capacity new york and new jersey despite the states continued predominance on the list of waste importers pennsylvanias imports declined in both 2002 and 2003 cumulative decrease of more than 15 million tons of msw imports this happened simultaneously with continued growth of interstate waste shipment in and through the middle atlantic states several factors appear to have been at work first in the last two years pennsylvania imposed new state fee of 500 per ton on waste disposal added to preexisting fees the state now collects 725 on each ton of waste disposed in the state this may have provided suffici ent economic incentive for some haulers to dispose elsewhere second the state appears to be receiving less waste from new york city whose mayor has adopted goal of shipping all of new york citys waste by rail rather than truck pennsylvania has landfills served by rail so some of this waste has been diverted to large landfills in virginia that do have rail service after pennsylvania virginia is the largest waste importer with imports totaling 55 million tons of msw and 11 million tons of other nonhazardous waste waste imports to virginia have increased sharpl since 2001 as noted above the state has attempted to restrict imports but has not been as successful as pennsylvania in part because it has chosen variety of measures that have run afoul of the constitutions interstate commerce clause these have included ban on barge shipping of wastes on virginia rivers truck regulations that applied only to commercial solid waste transporters and daily limits on the amount of waste that virginia landfills could accept7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32570crs8 8 see for example three ohio landfills want more garbage trucked in cincinnati enquirer august 16 2004 at http wwwenquirercommichigan the thirdlargest waste importer for the past several years saw outof state waste grow by 103 million tons in 2003 following slight decline in 2002 substantial amounts of waste come to mich igan from illinois indiana and other neighboring states but the biggest source accounting for 62 of michigans outof state waste is ontario canada ontario is of course also michigans neighbor but the fact that it lies in foreign country and that it has large expanses of open land where landfills might be sited seems to have added additional notoriety to its waste shipments ontarios shipments to chigan have grown as the toronto area awarded new contracts for waste disposal and closed its last two landfills at the beginning of 1999 the toronto area was ge nerating about 28 million tons of waste annually of which about 700000 tons were shipped to michigan by early 2003 however there was virtually local disposal capacity in the toronto area and almost all of the waste was being shipped to michigan where large disposal sites offered very low cost disposal in other highlights ten states reported imports exceedin g 1 million tons per year in the latest year an increase of two from our last survey two years ago new jersey georgia and south carolina joined the millionaires in 2003 while indiana went the other way dropping below the million mark for the first time since 1995 in addition to the 10 states importing more than million tons another 22 states had imports exceeding 100000 tons for the fifth year in row new jersey is on the list of major importers with 167 million tons of msw imports in 2002 2003 data were not yet available the state is still major exporter of waste as well receiving states timate new jerseys exports at 58 million tons in 2003 but the absence of flow control local government requirements that waste within their jurisdiction be disposed at local facilities which were overturned by the courts in the mid1990s has led wastetoene rgy facilities in new jersey to import waste to replace the local waste that is now being disposed elsewhere as result large amounts of waste are entering new jersey from new york other states reporting major increases in imports were ohio georgia and south carolina ohio has had 15 million ton increase in msw imports be tween 1998 and 2003 and appears poised to import even more according to press reports and conversations with industry observers8 the state has prepared draft permits that would expand ndfill capacity by 176 million tonshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32570crs9 9 telephone conversation september 2 2004 10 transfer stations receive waste from collec tion trucks compact it bale it and load it on larger trucks for disposal elsewhereaccording to one analyst9 georgia experienced sevenfold increase to 14 million tons over the same period and south carolina more than doubled imports to 12 million tons in the last two years oklahoma made its second appearan ce on our list of importers the state reports that in septem ber 2001 it began receiving 1500 tons per day about 500000 tons per ear of waste from wichita kansas some of this waste has since been diverted to landfill in topeka kansas but oklahomas red carpet landfill still imported nearly 334000 tons of wa ste from kans as in 2003 according to kansas officials texas moved from 33rd to 25th on our list with an import increase of 217000 tons since 2001 louisiana app eared to be the major source of the increased imports sending more than 140 000 tons to landfill in newton texas very near the louisiana border new york saw big drop in waste imports following rapid growth in 2000 and 2001 the state had imported 839700 tons of waste in 2001 an increase from 539000 tons in our previous survey but in this years survey imports declined sharply totaling only 311417 tons in 2003 although there are comprehensive data imports to transfer stations10 are political issue in some locations transfer stations are generally located in urban areas and are subject to less stringent regulation than disposal facilities heavy truck traffic and odors have aroused concerns in some neighboring communities connecticut rhode island and th district of columbia have reported significant amounts of outofstate waste imported to transfer stations then exported to other states fo r disposal new york citys plan to export most of its waste to transfer stations in new jersey raised substantial cont roversy before being rescinded while waste imports increased overall 14 states reported declines in waste imports in several cases the declines were small but seven of the states pennsylvania indiana kentucky new xico nevada new york and iowa had declines exceeding 100000 tons major exporters as shown in table 2 eight states new york new jersey missouri illinois maryland massachusetts ohi and washington and the district of columbia each exported more than 1 million tons of waste to facilities in other states in the latesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32570crs10 11 illinois like most states does not report waste exports this export estimate was derived from data provided by neighboring statesreporting period and nine other states expor ted more than half million tons the canadian province of ontario also exporte d substantial amount of municipal waste nearly 3 million tons most of it to michigan new york new jersey missouri illi nois and maryland the five largest exporting states accounted for 54 of waste exports nationally new yorks exports rose to 8247610 tons in 2003 according to nine receiving states an increase of 754000 tons over 2001 the increase reflects the march 2001 closure of new york citys fresh kills landfill the citys last disposal facility new jerseys estimated exports 58 million t ons have also grown dramatically in new jerseys case the cause of increased exports is the overturning of the states flow control law which until 1997 directed much of the states waste to highcost local facilities for disposal the state law was overturned and the state exhausted its appeals in october 1997 exports have since grown by about 35 million tons per year illinois exports at 21 million tons declined by nearly 1 million tons in 2003 after several years of rapid growth despite the decline the states exports in 2003 were still more than double the amount reported for 199411 most of the exports originate in cook county chicago and its s uburbs which has relative shortage of disposal capacity illinois as whole reported more than doubling of landfill capacity between 1995 and 2003 but chicago is located near the border of both indiana and wisconsin so increases in capacity elsewhere in illinois may not affect disposal decisions in the metropolitan area in all 11 states the district of colu mbia and ontario cana da increased waste exports by more than 100000 tons each in the period while 5 states had major decreases in addition to new york ne w jersey and ontario discussed above missouri kansas georgia and massachuse tts showed the largest increases among states showing decreased exports only illinois showed large drop net imports and exports table 3 combines import and export data to rank the states by net amounts imported or exported the table shows that 23 states were net importers 22 plus the district of columbia were net exporters thirtyfive of the 50 states had net imports or exports exceeding 100000 tons in the reporting period 20 exceeded 500000 tons perhaps most interesting given the tendency to identify states as either exporters or importers 23 states both exported and imported in excess of 100000 tons of municipal solid waste up from 17 in our 2002 report several factors are at work here in the larger states there are sometimes differences in available disposal capacity in different regions within the state areas without capacity may be closer to landfi lls or may at least find cheaper disposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32570crs11 12 waste

locations in missouri as noted earlier the movement of waste also represents the regionalization and consolidation of the waste industry in 2003 the three largest firms waste management allied waste and republic services acc ounted for 67 of total revenues of the industrys 100 largest firms12 these large firms offer integrated waste services from collection to transfer station to disposal site in many locations often they ship waste to their own disposal facility across border rather than dispose of it at an instate facility owned by rival as small landfills continue to close the number of us landfills declined 54 between 1993 and 2002 from 4482 to 207113 this trend toward regionalization and consolidation is likely to continue the amount of waste being shippe d across state lines for
