from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to tom wigley wigleyucaredu ben santer santer1llnlgov subject re help please date tue oct 6 133534 2009 tom agreed that ncdc must have some data gaps but this isnt very clear from the web site giss is inferior not just because it doesnt use back data they also impose some urbanization adjustment which is based on populationnight lights which i dont think is very good their gridding also smooths things out plotting all three together for land only though they look similar at decadal timescales giss does have less yeartoyear variability when i last looked i assume ncdc should add the back data in although there isnt the need if infilling is going on ok ive never looked to see if ncdc changes from year to year i think you can say that giss is inferior to crutem3 in ch 3 of ar4 i put the station number counts in giss and ncdc have more but almost all of this is more data in the us their nonuse of base period giss using something very odd and ncdc first differences means they can use very short series that we cant as they dont have base periods but with short series it is impossible to assess for homogeneity so some of their extra series may be very short ones as well as you know the more important thing is where the stations are and in time the paper i sent you by adrian simmons shows great agreement with crutem3 when subsampled according to cru grid boxes also shows that erainterim is very good erainterims absolute is also within 02 deg c of the cru 14 deg c value it would give about 138 for 196190 sometime i should write this up as more and more people seem to be using 15 deg c away from tomorrow till next tuesday cheers phil at 2323 05102009 tom wigley wrote phil thanks again re ensovolcs it was who did this first wigley tml 2000 enso volcanoes and record breaking temperatures geophysical research letters 27 41014104 then in paper with ben with you as coauthor santer bd wigley tml doutriaux c boyle js hansen je jones pd meehl ga roeckner sengupta s and taylor ke 2001 accounting for the effects of volcanoes and enso in comparisons of modeled and observed temperature trends journal of geophysical research 106 2803328059 i think my iterative method is better than thompsons method he has some weird volcano results removing the dynamic bit is not much use in my view so i have all these series with volc and enso removed or just enso removed but accounting for volcano obfuscation i also use running approx 20year regressions usually as you know the ensoglobalt link breaks down in the 1930s so using relationship that comes from eg 100year regression would impose spurious antienso signal on the data in the 1930s i think this is important ignored by thompson the reason for this breakdown is obscure but i think it is because for some reason the n34soi link ie really the sstwalker circulation link weakens in the 1930s we need to look at this more fully in models i also have these series for different regions of the globe i need to revise and update these it is tricky to get the regional volc signal because of snr problems at the smaller spatial scale i wrote all this up more than 10 years ago but have not got around to finalizing it to submit for publication i have number of other papers like this once i get done with an issue to certain level i get sidetracked on other issues the amplification does work for warming and cooling theory says about 30 for tltsurface this works for overall variability and for rss trend but oddly the enso and volc amplification seems to be greater than this ive asked ben for his thoughts on why re ncdc it seems that there must be data gaps this is the only way that global can differ from ns2 it also seems that the ncdc data must be ersst3b but their web site is not clear on this perhaps ben knows thanks for the giss info so this means that their series does not change from year to year whereas hadcru does albiet by only small amounts does ncdc change each year the giss thing means that it must be inferior to hadcru and ncdc should i say this in my report to epri tom phil jones wrote tom i dont think ar4 ch 3 went into the tltsurface amplification issue you can get the pdf of the chapter from here 1httpipccwg1ucareduwg1wg1reporthtml this amplification issue is only addressed in some recent papers mainly bens the timescale argument is quite convincing it is pity that there is only pinatubo that you can test it on chichon ought to work but it is confused by enso does the amplification work well for the 199798 nino did you pick up that thompson et paper due out in j climate soon factoring out enso and volcanoes might help in isolating this 2httpwwwatmoscolostateedufacultythompsonphp where there is link to the paper and also the data 3httpwwwatmoscolostateedudavetthompsonwallacejoneskennedy it seems as though you can get all the extraction parts need for the dynamic bit anyway my thought is as pinatubo gives the amplification then enso ought to as well thought might be to take dave thompsons enso and volcanic subtraction series then scale them by thermodynamic theory value then subtract these from rss and uah small issue of base periods to sort out and assume there is lag need to do this with ncdc surface as well have to use dave ts numbers here this cant do the 20n20s just the globe it would of course at this and any other time be very nice to show that uah is wrong couple of minor things in the paper the amplification should work for cooling as well not just warming trends in fig 5 in your legend louah should be uahlo this is in fig 4 as well by the way meant to add this to the earlier email ncdc ersst3 side does talk about missing data so any of this would mean the nhsh2 wont equal the global average that ncdc calculate i recall you asking about giss one thing i have learned about giss is that they have cut off date of the 8th of each month after this date nothing is changed for the previous month and nothing earlier either this means they never incorporate any back data and they dont get the second tranche of climat data which comes about the 16th of the following month countries like paraguay and bolivia mostly come in this way plus some in africa ill see tom peterson later in the week ill ask him about their cut offs i think they dont change month later this wont lose you much data though it was tom who told about the data they cant use cheers phil at 0525 04102009 tom wigley wrote hi phil im writing report for epri where i have to discuss the instrumental temperature record what they are particularly concerned with isare the criticisms that have been leveled at the surface record especially differences from msu data i think ccsp 11 does good job on this not sure about ar4 which i need to recheck but things have changed since ccsp 11 and ar4 and i think i can make better case against uah than either of these reports could you please look at the attached and give your opinion and comments tracked if that makes it easier in my view the evidence that the uah data are flawed is overwhelming but i want to make the case in logical and balanced way have i succeeded the audience level for this is ipcc report level perhaps bit lower so i need to be relatively simple but authoritative the msu issue also comes up later in my report where i discuss the ijoc santer et paper which is only mentioned briefly in the attached extract one thing i thought i might add is more about the other two surface data sets key point may be that 1998 is not the warmest year in the giss record do you trust giss ive not looked at noaa perhaps this still has 1998 as warmest thanks for your help by the way this report was due to epri last week im hoping to get it to them by friday 9 oct best
