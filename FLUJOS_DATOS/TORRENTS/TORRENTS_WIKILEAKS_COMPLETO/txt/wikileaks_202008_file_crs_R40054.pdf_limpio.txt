transitioning toward independence after ruinous civil war and the syrian and israeli occupations that followed the united states and lebanon have historically enjoyed good relationship due in part to cultural and religious ties the democratic character of the state large lebaneseamerican community in the united states and the prowestern orientation of leba non particularly during the cold war current us concerns in lebanon include strengthening the weak democratic institutions of the state limiting the influence of iran and syria in lebanons political process and disarming hezbollah and other militant groups in lebanon following syrian withdrawal from lebanon in 2005 and the war between israel and hezbollah in the summer of 2006 the bush administration requested and congress appropriated significant increase in us assistance to lebanon since 2006 us assistance to lebanon has topped 750 million over three years including for the first time over 410 million in us security assistance for the lebanese armed forces and internal security forces of lebanon several key issues in uslebanon relations could potentially affect future us assistance to lebanon political agreement among lebanese parties in may 2008 brokered by the qatari government and the arab league in doha ended 18 months of political stalemate the period was marked by cabinet resignations political assassinations labor strikes war between hezbollah and israel an insurrection by foreign and palestinian militants and the worst sectarian fighting since lebanons 15year civil war since then sectarian violence has continued in the northern city of tripoli where sunni factions supported by saudi arabia and alawite groups supported by syria have clashed and three bombings have targeted the lebanese armed forces raising concerns about potential regional proxy war in lebanon fighting has subsided somewhat since reconciliation brokered by lebanese prime minister fouad sinior took effect on september 8 2008 in addition the international community has cont inued to call for the disarming of all of lebanons militia groups in particular these demands have focused on hezbollahs militia which claimed victory in 2006 war with israel improving its popular image in lebanon efforts to enforce united nations security council resolution 1701 which calls for the groups disarmament are further complicated by the more prominent role that hezbollah gained in the unity government followi ng the doha agreement the next administration and the members of the 111 th congress will be faced with upcoming parliamentary elections in lebanon scheduled for 2009 the outcome of the elections could further complicate uslebanon relations particularly if they result in political paralysis or more substantial role for hezbollah in the government in addition the ongoing sectarian violence in tripoli demonstrates the regional and international struggle over iranian influence in the levant the growing threat of radical sunni movements and syrias efforts to move out of isolation all of which weigh heavily on the lebanese government and uslebanon relations this report provides an overview of lebanese politics recent events in lebanon and current issues in uslebanon relations and will be updated to reflect major developments

tensions remain high in lebanon for much of 2008 sporadic fighting has continued in the northern city of tripoli between sunni residents of the bab tebbaneh neighborhood and alawites aligned with the opposition in jabal mohsen in june the lebanese armed forces laf were deployed to tripoli to stop the fighting the tripoli conflict pits sunnis against alawites sect whose members include the leadership of syria and appears to be fueled by slowbur ning proxy war involving iran saudi arabia and syria 1 sunnis in tripoli many of whom espouse the principles of salafism may be supported financially and ideologically by saudi arabia saudi arabia may be seeking to counter syrian support of both the alawite community and hezbollah along with iranian financial ideological and military support for hezbollah and other shiite groups the violence has calmed since the signing of reconciliation agreement brokered by prime minister siniora on september 8 2008 but two bombings since then have left 15 soldiers dead targeted attacks against the laf viewed by some as the only national institution in lebanon are of particular concern to observers some express concerns that us security assistance to the laf has made it target for extremist attacks others blame syria or prosyrian agents who might want to weaken the force ahead of reoccupation of lebanon 2

state that the purpose of the deployment is to combat smuggling and to safeguard the border against terrorists attempting to enter lebanon following twin bombings in tripoli and damascus earlier that month some observers however expressed concerns that the troop buildup could indicate that syria is positioning to reenter lebanon those concerns were somewhat abated at least temporarily when on october 14 2008 following months of talks the governments of lebanon and syria established formal diplomatic relations for the first time since the two countries gained independence reports in dicate that the governments plan to exchange ambassadors and open embassies some time before the end of 2008 g3g152g158g151g561g24g146g156g146g157g561g157g152g561g21g162g155g146g138g561 in early december

american university of beirut aub wa s founded in 1866 by americans in lebanon and continues to receive the support of the united states government and the congress today contributing to the long standing cultural ties between the two in addition the large lebanese american community further strengthens the cultural ties and has supported us assistance to lebanon in various forms despite longstanding contact and interaction between the united states and lebanon some might argue that lebanon is of limited strategic value to the united states unlike many american partners in the middle east lebanon has us military bases oil fields international waterways military or industrial strength or major trading ties with the united states others would disagree pointing to lebanons strategic location as buffer between israel and syria lebanons large palestinian refugee population and its historical role as an interlocutor for the united states with the arab world g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 during the 19751990 civil war the united states expressed concern over the violence and destruction taking place in lebanon and provided emergency economic aid military training and limited amounts of military equipment in addition the united states briefly deployed military forces to lebanon in the early 1980s the forces withdrew after bombing at the us embassy in april 1983 and bombing at the us marine barracks in october 1983 killed 272 civilians and members of the us armed forces in lebanon the united states supported and participated in various efforts to bring about ceasefire during the civil war and subsequent efforts to quiet unrest in southern lebanon along the lebaneseisraeli border the united states supported lebanon in its reconstruction following the civil war with economic assistance aimed at rebuilding lebanons badly damaged infrastructure and political support for democratic independent lebanon see appendix in 1996 the united states helped negotiate an agreement between hezbollah and israel to avoi d targeting civilians and is member of five party force monitoring this agreement the united states also endorsed the secretary generals findings in may 2000 that israel had completed its withdrawal from southern lebanon since israels withdrawal from lebanon in 20 00 us efforts have focused on countering

political party militia wing and an overseas terrorist capability the united states also opposed the ongoing syrian occupation of lebanon as part of its policy to contain syria as state sponsor of terrorism the bush administration reacted strongly to the assassination of the former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 criticized the syrian presence in lebanon and demanded the withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon the united stat welcomed the formation of new lebanese government following the withdrawal of syri an forces in april 2005 after meeting with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on july 22 2005 secretary of state condoleezza rice said i think that you cannot find partner more supportive of lebanon than the united states5 the united states also supported the united nations in establishing an independent tribunal to prosecute those responsible for hariris assassination largescale fighting between israel and hezbol lah in mid2006 complicated us policy toward lebanon in broader sense the conflict jeopardized not only the longterm stability of lebanon but presented the us government with basic dilemma on one hand the administration was sympathetic to israeli military action against terrorist organizationand president bush spoke in favor of israels right to selfdefense on the other hand the fighting dealt set back to administration efforts to support the rebuilding of physical infrastructure and democratic institutions in lebanon when the fighting ended hezbollah and syria two forces that oppose the ussupported march 14 government were strengthened following the war hezbollah emboldened by increased popular support began to push for an increased role in the government in lebanon and internal government disputes led to vacant presidency and 18 months of political stalemat the united states watched cautiously while continuing assistance and support for the march 14 coalition until january 23 2007 when hezbollah called general strike aimed at toppling the government in response thenunder secretary of state nicholas burns called on arabs and europeans to throw their support behind prime minister siniora against those who would tr to destabilize his regime following the doha agreement in may 2008 that ended the stalemate secretary rice reiterated us support for the government of lebanon and its complete authority over the entire territory of the country the united states welcomed the new unity government in lebanon following the doha agreement and supported the choice of michel suleiman to fill the vacant presidency lebanese president michel suleiman visited washington on september 26 2008 while in the united states to attend the general assembly meeting in new york he was the first lebanese head of state to do so since 1996 as the incoming obama administration and the 111 th congress reevaluate us policy in the region the us approach toward lebanon could become harbinger of new direction or continuation of the status quo while the united states wants to promote stability and curb iranian influence in lebanon there is debate over how best to achieve these goals the united states could continue its support for the antisyrian march 14 coalition government promoting democracy and stability with economic and security assistance another alternative is to address the situation in lebanon as part of larger regional initiative possibly one that centers on syria israel and the peace process however events may ultimately dictate us course of action in 5 bbc monitoring middle east text of

devote more financial resources to reconstruction and military assistance the withdrawal of syrian forces fr om lebanon and the coming to power of the more moderate march 14 government prompted the administration and congress to increase us assistance to lebanon the summer 2006 war between hezbollah and israel heightened the need for additional economic aid as the lebanese government and its international and arab partners vied with iran and hezbollah to win the hearts and minds of many lebanese citizens who lost homes and businesses as result of the conflict from military standpoint the war also highlighted the need for more robust lebanese military to adequately patrol lebanons porous borders with syria and prevent hezbollahs rearmament the fy2007 emergency supplemental

maintain the delicate political balance of its confessional system see below and ongoing sectarian tension the legacy of civil war and foreign occupation left government institutions weak and recovery

facilities and has sworn to eliminate israel is perhaps the greatest obstacle to us efforts to bolster the prowestern forces in lebanon with hezbollah deeply entrenched in lebanese shiite society the movement has become fixture in the lebanese political system and symbol of resistance against israel for many in the region this dual identity has benefitted hezbollah and there have been recent indications that it is willing to renounce armed struggle against israel and become solely lebanese political movement there also is little evidence to suggest that iran and hezbollahs strategic relationship could be severed despite the fact that hezbollahs agenda may be more nationalist while irans may be more revolutionary panshiite though some analysts argue that hezbollah has grown more independent of tehran since the 1980s hezbollah still requires advanced weaponry and outside funding while iran requires proxy to pressure israel and the united states both parties have found this relationship to be mutually beneficial hezbollahs claim of victory in the 2006 war with israel and its swift humanitarian aid delivery following the conflict increased the organizations popularity among lebanese particularly the shiite population prisoner exchange with israel 19 and the gains hezbollah made in the government during the may negotiations at doha also might have served to further improve the organizations public image in the face of ongoing violence and upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for 2009 the lebanese government and the international community have struggled to manage hezbollahs role in the government and to deal with its militia wing israel has expressed concern about reports that hezbollah continues to receive arms through unsecured borders and the fact that the governme nt of lebanon includes members of hezbollah in august 2008 israels security cabinet voted to reverse longstanding policy that considers the government of lebanon and hezbollah

government declared national day of celebration closing government offices schools and banks despite government attempts to present the swap as national triumph analysts have expressed concerns that the exchange bolstered support for hezbollah and that national power in lebanon appears to be in the hands of nonstate actor on the other hand some argue that the resolution of the issue of prisoners and renewed dialogue about the disputed shiba farms territory could undermine the legitimacy of hezbollahs armed wing which the organiza tion maintains is necessary to support the resistance to

that the shooter was behaving naturally or instinctively he also expressed condolences to the family of the pilot hezbollah turned over the shooter to the lebanese government but the incident raised

state and until recently syria never formally recognized lebanon as state from geostrategic standpoint lebanon is considered by the syrian government to be buffer between syria and israel the lebanese economy also is deeply penetrated by prosyrian business interests syria is also criticized for its role as an intermediary between iran and hezbollah in lebanon and emerged as key if indirect actor in the 2006 war between israel and hezbollah primarily through its role as conduit for the delivery of rockets and other weaponry to hezbollah units in southern lebanon since 2006 both and israeli

questions about the character of the institution some argue that weapons provided to the laf might one day be used against israel particularly if they fell into the hands of hezbollah militants this argument is driven by concerns that the laf leadership or members of the laf are sympathetic to or even allied with hezbollah in the 2006 war between hezbollah and israel israel reportedly attacked laf naval radar stations after it was discovered that hezbollah used laf radar to track an israeli vessel that was struck by hezbollah missiles in may 2008 prime minister siniora removed the chief of
