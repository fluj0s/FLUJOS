collected by the hra in the personnel administration unit are certified by the human resources officer hro and transmitted to ohrm for input into imis 8 there were prior reviews of the personnel administration unit by oios or the board of auditors 9 draft of the report was shared with the chief human resources planning section in july 2005 whose comments which were received in august 2005 are reflected in this final report in italics ictr has accepted most of the recommendations made and has initiated action in the majority of the areas identified ii audit objectives 10 the overall objective of the audit was to advise the registrar ictr on the adequacy of arrangements for handling staff entitlements this involved assessing the administration of mobility hardship and nonremoval allowances education grant and dependency allowances b evaluating the adequacy effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls c evaluating whether adequate guidance and procedures were in place d determining the reliability and integrity of the data available from the present systems reviewing compliance with regulations and rules and administrative instructions iii audit scope and methodology 11 the audit focussed on the adequacy of ictrs arrangements for processing mobility hardship and nonremoval and education grant and dependency allowance for the period january 2003 to december 2004 it included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records the review excluded education grant travel and mother tongue claims because records were not available 12 based on information received at the end of april 2005 from ohrm total of 135 staff members were paid mobility allowance in 2003 at cost of approximately us796000 and 141 staff members in 2004 at cost of approximately us816000 13 approximately 620 ictr staff members were paid hardship allowance in 2003 at cost

according to information provided by ohrm 392 staff members were paid dependency allowance in 2003 at cost of us17 million and 413 in 2004 at cost of us18 million iv audit findings and recommendations delegated authority 17 the delegation of authority in human resources matters to the registrar of ictr was initially granted in memorandum dated september 1997 which was replaced by memorandum from the undersecretarygeneral for management dated 14 march 2002 the memorandum outlines the current staff regulations and rules that can be implemented it also sets out the conditions for monitoring the implementation of the delegation and the terms of the delegation of authority for the classification of posts in the p category up to p4 and in the gs category oios was satisfied that the delegated authority from unhq on human resources matters was clear and was being followed by ictr huma n resources planning section hrps b organisation structurefunctions structure 18 hrps is divided into three units recruitment personnel administration and training and staff welfare hras within the pau are responsible for serving different sectionsunits within ictr under the supervision of hro oios was informed that the section is gradually shifting towards teambased approach giving human resources team the responsibility of handling all services provided to client from recruitment to separation oios welcomes and agrees with this initiative b staffing 19 the current staffing levels of the teams within the pau take into consideration the number of staff members supported by each team but not the workload of the teams the distribution of duties is regularly reviewed and the last review was conducted in february 2005 each hra is responsible for providing personnel administrative support to specific sections within ictr and an hra is expected to service between 80 up to maximum of 120 international staff members currently each hra administers between 90 to 95 international staff members or approximately 160 locally recruited staff members c filing of documents 20 oios found the personnel files to be badly documented and there were many inconsistencies and gaps in the information provided each personnel file consisted of six parts but there was organization in the filing of documents such that documentation could be found randomly placed in all six parts oios felt that greater attention was required in organizing the information in staff members files as missing documents could easily be undetected 4 recommendation to ensure the easy retrieval of documents and the efficient management of ictr staff members files the human resources planning section hrps should review the current filing system hrps should also consider the creation of checklists used in the processing of documents which would provide useful tool in records management rec 01 21 ictr commented that hrps would act accordingly oios notes the response and will close the recommendation upon notifica tion of the outcome of the review of the current filing system and receipt of any copies of checklists developed c planning and monitoring work plans 22 oios is pleased to note that work plans were prepared in accordance with stai20023 performance appraisal system and were in agreement with the mandate and mission of the section the plans were developed for the biennium for all the units within hrps and were updated annually b target dates for submission of staff entitlements 23 oios was pleased to note that target dates for submission of claims have been incorporated in all circulars on procedures issued to staff members on entitlements whilst this was an excellent initiative to give guidance to staff its value was largely lost as data was kept recording what happened in practice however tracking actual dates is necessary to determine whether any changes are required to the submission date or whether additional measures are required to make staff aware of submission deadline c time frames and benchmarks for the processing of entitlements 24 time frames and benchmarks were established for the processing of entitlements consequently ictr could not demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of current arrangements oi observed that pau had procedures for collecting statistical data to monitor and report on the timeliness of processing entitlements from when applications or requests are received in the pau to payment of the entitlement in the opinion of oios document control system should be developed where the hras record the date of receipt of the request the date of completion and each document assigned an identification number for tracking purposes oios found that the time to process home leave request could vary between two days and two months and to process education grants claims between two weeks and nine months recommendation to improve the efficiency and timely completion of its operations and assist in measuring and monitoring performance the ictr personnel administration unit should collect statistics on the 5processing time frames for entitlements for the establishment of targets and milestones logging system should also be introduced where human resource assistants record the date of receipt of request date of completion and assign an identification number to the request for tracking purposes rec 02 25 ictr commented that implementation was underway oios notes the response and will close the recommendation upon receipt of details of the logging system implemented and details of the statistics collected on the processing time frames for entitlements d management information 26 the pau had mechanism or procedures for collecting basic information such as the number of staff entitled to partic ular benefit which would assist in monitoring the workload and its allocation among the teams for example there is data on the number of staff members entitle d to education grant the number of children eligible the number of claims ma for education grant travel and which schools the majority of the students attend th is information would assist the pau in estimating the volume of activities the tim frames within which the major schools operate and in monitoring staff members who may not have submitted their claims in addition the pau is not provided with copy of the allowances administered by the ohrm at unhq and paid as part of sta ff members salaries ictr is therefore not able to verify the accuracy of data nt to ohrm for entry into imis oios is therefore concerned that ohrm could be charging ictr incorrect amounts for staff entitlements in the absence of any controls over the work performed recommendations to improve efficiency and streamline the processing of ictr staff entitlements the personnel administration unit should develop mechanism and procedures for the identification recording analysis and maintenance of basic data for staff entitlements they administer such as numbers of staff entitled to education grant number of children eligible the type of schools they attend and the staff members claiming education grant travel rec 03 to safeguard against erroneous payments to ictr internationally recruited staff and to verify the accuracy and completeness of information in imis at headquarters the registrar should request the office of human resources management to provide ictr with webbased access to imis so that the information entered in imis can be reviewed on periodic basis rec 04 27 ictr commented that the audit reco mmendations are noted and hrps would coordinate with ohrm on recommendation 04 oios notes the response and will close recommendation 03 upon receipt of details of the mechanism and procedures developed for the identification recording analysis and maintenance of basic data for staff entitlements and 6 b recommendation 04 upon notification from hrps that they have been provided with webbased access to imis so that the information entered in imis can be reviewed on periodic basis d mobility hardship and nonremoval allowance accuracy of mobility calculation 28 pau advised oios that details on th number of persons and the amount of mobility allowance paid was only availabl from ohrm at the request of oios the payroll unit at unhq provided an imis printout showing the staff members in receipt of mobility during 2003 and 2004 sample of fourteen staff members out of approximately 140 paid in 2003 nd 2004 was taken and their personnel notification details were checked against the imis printout discrepancy of approximately us300 was found in the paym ent to one staff member oios was concerned about the accuracy of the calcula tions as there was evidence that ictr undertook reconciliations to verify the information in imis this is addressed by recommendation 04 and additional recommendation is raised b eligibility of international staff for mobility allowance 29 of the 14 cases mentioned above in all the cases the criteria for eligibility were met c accuracy of hardship calculation 30 oios sampled the personnel action notifi cation details of 62 international staff from population of 620 in 2003 and 650 in 2004 and reviewed the accuracy of the annual computations of hardship element problems were noted 31 unhq did not provide hrps with any information on the hardship allowance paid monthly to staff members oios re viewed sample of 62 staff members and their personnel notification details on the st aff members files were checked against the imis printout requested from ohrm differences varying between us10 and us2000 were found in payments to seven st aff members this indicated that reconciliation had been undertaken to confirm that the correct amount was charged to ictr oios was concerned about the lack of this control and the inability of oios to verify the accuracy and completeness of payments made and addressed this concern under recommendation 04 above d eligibility of international staff for hardship allowance 32 oios sampled 10 percent of internationa l staff members in receipt of hardship allowance and noted problems with eligibility incorrect categorization of duty stations 33 the audit team sampled 62 out of pproximately 600 staff members and noted problems with classification of duty stati on for internationally recruited staff 7f guidelines on nonremoval 34 payment of nonremoval element is limited to period of five years at one duty station exceptionally the chief of admini stration may extend the period of payment for further period of up to two years upon certification in memo dated february 2001 from the chief division of administrative support services dass all internationally recruited staff members we re informed that ohrm would continue the payment of the nonremoval element for an additional two years to all concerned staff members ictr being an ad hoc ag ency staff members are considered as external candidates when applying for posts in the secretariat resulting in lack of mobility options this decision was also taken to minimise the high turnover of staff in ictr after five years of conti nuous service due to reduction in staffs income oios agrees with the decision and commends the efforts of ictr to retain its staff members g accuracy of nonremoval calculation 35 out of sample of 62 staff member s 56 were paid nonremoval allowance during the years 2003 and 2004 oios was satis fied that the allowance had been handled in accordance with staff rule 10727 h discontinuation of nonremoval allowance 36 payment of nonremoval allowance to three staff members recruited in 1995 was extended in 2001 for another two years as authorised by ohrm oios noted problems but observed that staff memb ers were not notified of the pending discontinuation of the nonremoval element of the mobility and hardship allowance recommendation to ensure efficiency in the administration of nonremoval allowance the human resources planning section should advise human resources officers through circular to inform all staff members of the pending discontinuation of nonremoval allowance rec 05 37 ictr commented that hrps would proceed as suggested oios notes the response and will close the recommendation upon receipt of copy of the circular sent to human resources officers requesti ng them to inform staff members when their nonremoval is to be discontinued education grant guidance 38 oios noted that pau st aff members were not provided with specific guidance to assess and process education grant claims for the 2003 and prior school years in the opinion of oios such guidance is essen tial to ensure consistent processing of education grant claims oios is therefore pleased to note that information circulars were issued in july 2004 by the chief da ss and the chief hrps with respect to education grant and special education grant for disabled children 8 b conditions of entitlement for special education grant claims 39 four staff members received special ducation grant in 2003 school year oios reviewed two of these cases and conc luded the overall arrangements by pau for handling these cases appeared to be adequa except that the pau did not have any procedures in place to comply with section 151 of stai20042 education grant and special education grant for children with disability and paragraph 55 of stic20025 education grant and special education grant for disabled children which state that staff member is required to provide evidence that he or she has exhausted all other sources of benefits that may be available for the education and training of the child including those that may be obtained from state and local governments and from the united nations contributory medical insurance plans and b comply with stai20042 section 111 which states eligible staff members may only claim the special education grant upon certification by the medical services director recommendations to ensure that costs to the are minimised and to comply with stai20042 and stic20025 the personnel administration unit pau should require staff members to confirm that there are alternative means open to them for the special education of their children to assist in verifying the accuracy of claims from staff members head pau should undertake research on the types of alternative sources and benefits that would be possible for staff members and this information should circulated to all staff members rec 06 to comply with stai20042 the pau should ensure all claims for special education grants are supported by satisfactory medical evidence regarding the childs disability as certified by the medical services director rec 07 40 ictr did not comment on these recommendations oios will keep recommendation 06 open pending clarification whether pau will request staff members to confirm that there are alternative means open to them for the special education of their children and whether they intend to undertake any work to assist staff members in determining whether there are alternative means of funding available b recommendation 07 open pending clarification whether pau will undertake action to ensure all claims for special education grants are supported by satisfactory medical evidence regarding the childs disability as certified by the medical services director 9 c education grant travel claims 41 oios was not able to review any ictr education grant travel claims as ictr were not able to provide listing tailing which staff members undertook and claimed for such travel in 2003 school year this concern was addressed under recommendation 03 and additional issues were raised d claims for tuition in mother tongue 42 oios was not able to review any clai ms for tuition in the mother tongue as ictr was not able to provide any supporting documentation as required by stai20042 for staff members who claimed such expenses in 2003 school year recommendation to comply with stai20042 the pau should ensure that all mother tongue claims are supported by the required evidence and issue an internal circular to staff members informing them of the required documentation that should be submitted rec 08 43 ictr commented that hrps would act accordingly oios notes the response and will close the recommendation upon receipt of copy of the internal circular sent to staff members informing them of th required documentation that should be submitted in support of mother tongue claims distance learning 44 in its audits of unon eca unog nd unhcr education grant oios noted that distancelearning courses were not yet eligible for reimbursement stai20042 considers correspondence c ourses as nonadmissible except where such courses are the only available substitute for fulltime attendance at school of type not available at the duty station or where such courses are related to academic subjects that are not included in the regular school curriculum but are required for the childs subsequent education oios is concerned that the conditions of stai20042 section 35 c would not allow distance learning as an alternative but only as an exception though this form of trai ning can be cost effective alternative to attending classes and is gaining accep tance world wide distance learning is especially important for duty stations such as arusha or kigali where there is need for correspondence courses as the choice of educational institutions is limited recommendation to ensure that the widest possible training opportunities are offered to staff chief human resources planning section hrps should liaise with counterparts within the secretariat and suggest to ohrm modification of section 35 of stai20042 to give greater flexibility in the recognition of online training as an alternative rather than as an exception this would recognise current educational trends and developments and to allow for more convenient and flexible educational arrangements for staff members children rec 09 10 45 ictr commented that hrps would liaise with ohrm on subject and revert oios notes the response and will close the recommendation upon notification of the outcome of discussions with ohrm seek ing modification of section 35 of stai20042 to give greater flexibility in the recognition of online training as an alternative rather than as an exception f dependency allowance
