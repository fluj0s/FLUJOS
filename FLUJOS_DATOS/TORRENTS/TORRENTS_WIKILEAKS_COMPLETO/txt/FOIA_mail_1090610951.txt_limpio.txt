from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to dwlarsonuoguelphca subject re date fri jul 23 152911 2004 doug maybe steve sent you the two emails ive resent ignore my ramblings at the end of one but i was getting little fed up the legates email is at the end in case youre interested the pdf is worth read odd that he writes press release then starts working on paper weve very occasionally written press release but only after the paper has come out i tried to explain the missing rings they arent missing but due to the samples not being right for density measurements all schweingrubers chronologies are constructed this way traditional ring width measurements arent made some of the russian groups hes worked with have added extra ring width cores and sometime get longer series but all the data keith and i work with is from fritz so if density is missing then rw is also fritz did almost all the coring 99 of the sites we only help coring on couple of occasions this comes from alignment tracking as you say but fritz also says it is partly due to the need to extract the lignin and to avoid resin when we cored together he was always saying we werent doing it properly getting twisted cores im not proper dendro person as i only got into this because of keith it may not be lignin but something has to be extracted with solvents the polar urals site was collected by fritz and stepan shiyatov there are living trees back to the 1500s and then stumps at slightly higher elevation stepan has been back more recently and regeneration is occurring at higher levels but it is taking time tree lines take while to respond to the recent warmth in some regions once the trees are established and not killed by frostssnow in winter they survive even if it gets cooler i discussed this in review paper in rog attached the section on the issue is brief all the cores were collected over couple of days fritz made mistake with the labelling for one core and that explains the 400 years of missing values someone at wdcp must have combined the cores with the same ids dendro people are always looking for the oldest trees and we kept the earliest series in steve seems to have thing about these and the 10th and 11th centuries but they are correctly dated fritz uses loads of plots and pointer years and doesnt make mistakes normally there is very distinct year at ad 1032 fritz is also cross dating with lww and eww and other features and not just on rw i say not just he normally does with density at the coring stage fritz had idea of the ages of the stumps well just the number of years there may have been samples off the front that couldnt be dated at all for all i know i suspect though they are roughly the same calendar age as the site has distinct dates for the start of trees which represent regeneration periods maybe you can try and explain the treeline argument to steve when he had to omit parts of cores he was always able to know where the two parts sat in the sequence we need to keep them together to do things like rcs anyway i have to go home its been very wet lately and the grass has grown the lawn must be mowed when the sun shines keep pushing that he should write up what he does and ross in proper journals ee and climate research are not read by many now i only look at them when i get alerted and i remain exasperated cheers phil legates email phil jones has made valid point in that some of the articles cited in my critique do not directly address problems with mann and jones mj but rather address problems with earlier works by mann bradley and hughes mbh and other colleagues fair enough i have changed the critique to reflect that fact the revised version has been posted since july 19 at 1httpwwwncpaorgpubbaba478ba478pdf however i still contend that most of my original arguments namely the problems with the shaft blade and sheath apply equally to mann and jones as well as the other mann et manifestations of the hockey stick mj incorporate data from number of the same sources as those used by mbh for example manns unpublished pc1 from the western north american treering data cooks tasmanian tree rings thompsons quelccaya and dunde ice core oxygen isotope records the latter embedded in yangs chinese composite and fishers stacked greenland ice core oxygen isotope record calibration and verification of mj includes the flawed mbh curve thus any errors in mbh effectively undermine the calibrationverification results of mj leaving this study unsupported and any problems with the underlying common proxies identified in critiques of mbh will also result in identical problems in mj my criticism regarding the blade is that 06 deg c warming for the last century is noted by the ipcc whereas mj and other m et representations have up to 095 deg c warming in their observed record see mjs figure 2 where for the global and nh reconstruction their estimates for 2000 exceed 04 and 05 nearly 06 respectively mjs nh curve is included in the attached graph thus i stand by my criticism of mj on this point which is more egregious in mj than other m et representations from jones the trend over the 20th century in the figure and in the instrumental data ipcc quotes 06 deg c over the 19012000 period fact but legates is eyeballing the curve to get 095 deg c figure isnt given in mann and jones 2003 take it from the trend is about the same as the instrumental record funny but there is figure in mj see their figure 2 as for eyeballing an apparently nonexistent curve i attach figure from soon et 2004 that contains portion of mjs figure 2 to allow others to decide for themselves whether mj suggest twentieth century warming of 06 deg c or 095 deg c moreover maybe someone can explain why every time mann and his colleagues draft another curve the temperature in 2000 gets warmer and warmer after the fact my criticisms regarding the sheath largely from paper on which i am working stem from the characterization of the uncertainty by mj that arises solely from the fit statistics to the 16001855 period using crossvalidation with not observations but composites of three previously compiled reconstructions including that developed by mbh the focus of known flaws and errors in the shaft note that some of the same data are used in both mbh and mj which doesnt allow for truly independent crossvalidation my rather obvious point was not that fit statistics should not be included as jones asserts but that mj included errors in either input realization observations or proxy data or other obvious sources of error the claim by mbh and mj is that only the model lackoffit contributes to uncertainty is inherently flawed considerable errors exist in the representation of both fields annual temperatures from both observations and proxy records and must be incorporated clearly there is spatial bias associated with observations that are biased away from the oceans high latitudes and high altitudes the spatial problem is far more pronounced when only handful of proxies are used to represent the global temperatures at earlier time periods both mbh and mj are equally guilty in this regard david r legates several people have
