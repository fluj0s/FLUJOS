of the senate as senate publication most of the lists were issued in the spring of the first session of each congress in the 99th congress the list used as source was marked preliminary as were all the lists pub lished during the first session of that congress the dates of the publications are footnoted at the end of each table as noted the 107th congress is an exception due to the unusual circumstances of the equally divided senate 2 at the beginning of the 107th congress the senate was divided equally between republicans and democrats as result demo crats chaired all committees for the first 17 days of the session and republicans assumed the committee chairmanships following the inauguration of vice president richard cheney an historic power sharing agreement sres 8 was presented by party leaders and agreed to on jan 5 2001 in june 2001 after one republican announced his intention to become an independent and switch party caucuses the republicans were reduced to 49 ats and the democrats with 50 seats gained control of the senate provision of sres 120 agreed to on june 29 2001 gave the majority one seat advantage on each senate committee except for the ethics committee the resolution further provided that senator would lose committee seat by virtue of the resolution for more details see crs report rl30881 senate organization in the 107th congress

number of senators representing particular pa rty may change during congress due to the death or resignation of senator or as c onsequence of senator changing party affiliation the data in this report are from the earlie st available information of each congress contained in primary documents 5 data referenced for the 107th congress in this report were compiled after the june 2001 party switch see

congresses covered in this report reflects the committees as established and titled in that congress fo r each congress table shows the party division in the senate total number of seats on each

chamber and for each co mmittee are also presented vacancies on committees as noted in the secretarys lis ts are counted in individual and overall committee totals for consistency the following statistical information and selected analyses are based on the tables to illustrate trends over time and to highlight varia tions from traditional practices4 comparative analysis of ratios in general it has been the practice of the senate to apportion committee seats to the majority and minority parties in manner that corre sponds closely to the party strength in the full chamber the data for the 94th through the 110th congresses appear to indicate that the practice has been fairly consistent with the historical trend with slight majority overre presentation in certain instances with the exception of the committee on ethics on which equal party strength is required and the select committee on intelligence which by rule has oneseat majority edge regardless of which party has majority status see table 1 during the 17 congresses the widest majorityminority party division was in the 95th congress in this congress there were 61 majority democrat seats 38 minority republican seats and one inde pendent who caucused with the majority factoring in the independent the majority increased its strength to 62 seats with majorityminority caucus seat margin of 24 seats congresses with the three narrowest part divisions in the senate were the 107th 108th and 110th congresses in the 107th congress an independent played pivotal role by caucusing with the majority democrat party which resulted in 51 caucus seats for the majority democrat and 49 for the minority republican5 in the 110th congress one independent and one independentdemocra t both caucused with thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34752crs3 6 in the period examined independents were elected to the 94th through 97th congresses and the 107th through 110th congresses these independents caucused with democrats while one conservativerepublican caucuse d with the republicans in the 94th congressdemocrats and consequently sh ifted the balance of power in favor of the democrats which gained majority control in the chamber with 51 caucus seats6 thirty years ago the majority democrat had substantial numerical advantage in the three consecutive congresses the 94th 95th and 96th congresses the 94th congress witnessed majorityminority caucu s seat margin of 22 in favor of the majority democrat which held 61 caucus seats in the 95th congress the majority democrat increased to 62 caucus seats w ith caucus margin of 24 seats the majority democrat had 59 caucus seats with caucus margin of 18 seats in the 96th congress 109th and 110th congresses the total number of committee seats increased from 353 in the 109th congress to 372 in the 110th congress in the 109th congress the majority republican held 55 seats compared to 44 for the minority democrat with one i ndependent who caucused with the minority the majorityminority caucus seat margin in the chamber was 10 with caucus seat margin of 35 in total seats in committees in the closely divided 110th congress 1 indepe ndentdemocrat and 1 independent who caucused with the mocrats provided the democrats with majority control which resulted in majority minority caucus seat margin of 2 in the chamber and 18 in total committee seats committee sizes during the period examined there was total of 22 standing and permanent select committees with legislative jurisdiction in the 94th congress 20 in the 95th congress and 19 from the 96th through the 110th congresses the size of committees in the congresses covered by this report ranged from 6 ethics to 29 appropriations in all 17 congresses th appropriations committee had the distinction of being the largest committee in the 110th congress the committee had total of 29 seats 15 majority democrat and 14 minority republican seats the data indicate that the sizes of senate committees have generally increased since the 94th congress with corresponding increase in the number of committee assignments senator typica lly receives total committee seats in the 17 congresses

modern reform efforts by judy schneider betsy palmer christopher m davis and colton campbell 8 data referenced for the 107th congress in this report were compiled after the june 2001 party switch see footnote 2 for detailsstanding committee assignments an individual senator may have to three7 however senators now serve on average on nearly four standing committees each the growth in assignments reflects the interests of senators in serving on more committees and the need for party leaders to seek waivers of assignment limits to assure working control for the majority on critical committees committee caucus seat margins during these 17 congresses the majorityminority caucus seat advantage in the chamber ranged from two seats in each of the 107th 108th and 110th congresses to 24 seats in the 95th congress in the 110th congress the majorityminority caucus seat margin was two 49 democrats 49 repub licans with one independentdemocrat and one independent caucusing with the democrats in the chamber in each committee except ethics there was majorityminority caucus seat margin of one seat the same oneseat margin is also evident in each committee except ethics in the 107th congress in which there were 50 majo rity democrat 49 republican and one independent who caucu sed with the majority8 in both the 105th and 106th congresses in which there were 55 majority republican seats and 45 democrat seats there was twoseat margin in all committees except for ethics and inte lligence conversely in the 101st congress the other major party was in control w ith the same party division 55 majority democrat seats and 45 minority republican seats the seat margins in committees ranged from one to three seats except for ethics which was close to twoseat average as noted earlier the 95th congress had the widest party division with 24 caucus seats but the majorityminority caucus seat margin in committee varied greatly excluding ethics the majorityminority caucus seat margins in the committees ranged from one to seven with about thir d of the 20 standing and permanent select committees having three or four seat margin only one committee appropriations had majorityminority caucus seat margin of seven it would appear that having gained clear advantage of such large majority the party in control did not perceive the need to secure wide margin on every committee prospects for the future an examination of committee party ratios in the senate over the 17 congresses suggests trend the majority party ratios on committees roughly approximate majority party strength in the senate chamber regardless of which party is in controlhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34752crs5 each party has experienced changes in political fortunes each understands that the majority of today could become the minority tomorrow including the unusual circumstances of the 107th congress majority control of the senate switched more than six times since the 96th congress the absence of any standing rules or any apparent initiatives to establish formal rules for committee ratios may indicate that the senate might continue its long standing practice of relying on negotiati ons between majority and minority party leaders barring any drastic departure from past practice determination of majority minority committee ratios would likely continue to be based on the senate principles of custom consultation and comityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34752crs6 table 1 comparison of senate majority caucus seats in chamber and committees 94th 110th congress congress majority partysenate chamber majority caucus
