century the american bar association aba announced series of general ethics rules for attorneys although subsequently revised first as the model code of professional responsibility and then as the model rules of professional conduct these canons have remained little changed in substance over the years each of the states has adopted standards drawn either from the abas mo code or its model rules most of the united s tates district courts have required lawyers practicing before them to follow the rules of the states in which the court is located by operation of provision in their annual appropriation s provisions justice department lawyers have been required to obey the rules of states in which they are dmitted to practice since the 1930s1 the socalled contact rule feature of both the rules of virtually every state and most united states district courts is the source of the most common objection t mcdademur tha the contact rule bars one attorney from dealing directly with th client of another without permission it is designed to prevent attorneys from takin g2 unfair advantage of unschooled opposing litigants the basic rule is essentially the same in virtually every american jurisdiction i t applies only to contacts with those represented by another wyer it holds lawyers responsible not only for their own contacts wit h opposing parties but for the contacts by their alter egos ie those working under their direction such as fbi agents undercover agents or sometimes informants it applie s whether the client is human or corporate it applies even if the client makes the initia l contact and does not want his attorney informed it is applicable in both civil and criminal cases in mos t jurisdictions it applies in criminal cases only after the client has bee n arrested for or charged with criminal offense the rule in few states however has been construed to apply prior to arrest and indictment the breath of the rules application and its perceived impact on federal w enforce ment civil and criminal investigations induced the department of justic promulga an exemption for department attorneys first in general memorandum an d then by regulation based on to the attorney generals law enforcement powers s2503 grants the attorney general the authority courts have thus far held she lacks to grant an exemption s 855 calls for the judicial conference to craft

officers and employees of the federal bureau of the investigation the5 drug enforcement administration and the immigration and naturalization servicegrand juryrelated ethics rules are neither as uniform nor as judicially well received as the contact rules few states have rules imposing conditions on the circumstances under which attorneys may be subpoenaed to testify about their clients few more have rules requiring prosecutors to bring exculpatory evidence to the att ention of the grand jury concerns here seem less pressing because some of the courts have been more receptive to the departments arguments that rules exceed the au thority of the federal district courts and the state and because internal department guidelines seem to have reduced the risk of overreaching in the area

mcdademurtha stands for the proposition that the most realistic vehicle fo r punishing abuse of authority by federal pr osecutors lies with the disciplinary authorities of the federal district courts and the state bars where the misconduct is alleged to hav occurred implicit in this view is the belief that any damaging conflicts with federal law enforcement interests should be resolved legislatively s 250 sta nds for the proposition that vesting disciplinary authority over federa l prosecutors anywhere but in the department of justice poses potential threat to thei r effectiveness the prospective impact of expansive interpretations of the contact rule on attorneydirected undercover investigations and inquiries into improper corporat behavior are usually offered to explain the need for passage of s 250 s 855 returns the law to its status prior to the enactment of mcdademurtha bu t directs the judicial conference to formulate contact rule
