fence along the usmexico border near san diego in the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act iirira of 1996 by 2004 only nine miles had been completed and construction was halted because of environmental concerns the 109th congress subsequently passed the real id ac t pl 10913 div b which contained provisions to facilitate the completion of th 14mile fence these provisions allow the secretary of homeland security to waive all legal requirements determined necessary to ensure expeditious construction of author ized barriers and roads in september 2005 the secretary used this authority to waive number of mostly environmental and conservation laws subsequently the secure fence act of 2006 pl 109367 removed the specific iirira provisions authorizing the san diego fence and added provisions authorizing five stretches of twolayered reinforced fenc ing along the southwest border while the specific authorization of the san diego fence was deleted the project appears permissible under separate more general authorization pr ovision of iirira in the 110th congress s 1639 introduced by nator edward kennedy on june 20 2007 would amend 102 of iirira to

united states border patrol usbp is the lead federal agency charged with securing the us international land border with mexico and cana da the usbps san diego sector is located north of tijuana and tecate mexican cities with combined population of 2 million people and features natural barriers to entry by unauthorized migrants and smugglers2 as part of the prevention through deterrence strategy which called for reducing unauthorized migration by placing agents and resources directly on the border abutting population centers in 1990 th usbp began erecting physical barrier to deter illegal entries and drug smuggling in the san diego sector using the broad powers granted to the attorney general ag to control and guard the us border3 the ensuing primary fence was completed in 1993 and covered the first 14 miles of the border starting from the pacific ocean and was c onstructed of 10foothigh welded steel4 this fence and the subsequent threetiered fence see discussion below was constructed with the assistance of the departme nt of defenses dods ar my corps of engineers according to the bureau of customs and border protection cbp the primary fence in combination with various laborintensive usbp enforcement initiatives along the san diego border region ie operation gatekeeper proved to be quite successful but fiscally and environmentally costly5 for example as undocumented aliens and smugglers breached the primary fence and ttempted to evade detection usbp agents were often forced to pursue the suspects through environmentally sensitive areas it soon became apparent to immigration officials nd lawmakers that the usbp needed among other things rigid enforcement system that could integrate infrastructure ie multi tiered fence and roads manpow er and new technologies to further control the border region the concept of threetiered fen ce system was first recommended by 1993 sandia laboratories study commissioned by the immigration and naturalization service ins the study concluded that aliens attempting to enter the united states from mexico had shown remarkable resourceful ness in bypassing or destroying obstacles in their path including the existing primary fence and postulated that threefence barrier system with vehicle patrol roads between the fe nces and lights will provide the necessary discouragement6 congress responded to these enforcement needs in part with the passage of the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act iirira of 19967 this comprehensive law among othe r things expanded the existing fence

section 102 of iirira improvem ent of barriers at the border section 102 of iirira concerns the improve ment and constructi on of barriers at our international borders as desc ribed later several of the provisions in 102 were amended in the 109th congress to facilitate the construction of the san diego fence as well as other border barriers the following paragraphs however discuss 102 as originally passed in iirira to provide historical pe rspective and comparative analysis section 102a appears to give the ag8 broad authority to in stall additional physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the united states border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the united states the phrase vicinity of the united states border is not defined in the immigrati on and nationality act 8 usc 1101 et seq or in immigration regulations the section also does not stipulate what specific characteristics would designate an area as one of high illegal entry this subsection has not been amended section 102b before its amendment in the secure fence act of 2006 pl 109 367 mandated that the ag construct ba rrier in the border area near san diego specifically 102b directed the ag to constr uct threetiered barri er along the 14 miles of the international land border of the united states starting at the pacific ocean and extending eastward section 102b ensured that the ag would build barrier pursuant to his broader authority in 102a near the san diego area other nonamended provisions in 102b provide authority for th acquisition of necessary easements require that certain safety features be incorporated into the design of the fence and authorize an appropriation not to exceed 12 million section 102c before its amendment in the real id act as part of pl 10913 waived the endangered species act of 1973 16 usc 1531 et seq and the national environmental policy act nepa of 1969 42 usc 4321 et seq to the extent the ag determined necessary in order to ensure expe ditious construction of the barriers authorized to be constructed under 1029 the waiver authority in this provision appears to apply both to barriers that may be constructed in the vicinity of the border under 102a and to the barrier that is to be constructed near the san diego area under 102b httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22026crs4 10 if the same person is apprehended multiple times

be misleading statistic for several reasons including the datas focus on events rather than people10 and the absence of reliable estimates for how many aliens successfully evade capture th factors aside however apprehensions data remain the best way to gain glimpse into the reality facing usbp agents and the trends in unauthoriz ed migration along the border as figure 1 shows apprehensions remained stable during the early 1990s in the san diego sector despite the construction of the primary fence in 1993 after the iiriras mandate for increased enforcement along the southwest border in 1996 including construction of the triplefe nce apprehensions dropped rapidly in the san diego sector in the late 1990s from 480000 in fy1996 to 100000 in fy2002 the reduction in apprehensions was even more marked in the areas where fencing was constructed within san diego sector the usbps imperial beach and chula vista stations saw their apprehensions decline from 321560 in fy1993 to 19035 in fy2004 reduction of 94 over the 12 year peri od although much of this reduction in apprehensions in those stations and in sa n diego sector may have been due to the construction of the triplefence the sector also saw an increase in other resources that may account for part of the reduction for example the number of agents assigned to the san diego sector increased significantly during this period from 980 agents in 1993 to 2274 in 199811 additionally the number of underg round sensors deployed in the san diego sector almost tripled from 1993 to 1998 nd the fleet of vehicl increased by over 150 over the same period12 the increase in manpower and resources re flected the usbps policy of rerouting unauthorized migration away from population cen ters to remote border regions where their agents have tactical advantage over bor dercrossers other sectors especially thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22026crs5 13 coalition of environmental groups had filed lawsuit alleging that the government had not

sector in arizona saw apprehensions increase significantly in the late 1990s proponents of border fences point to the drastic reduction in apprehensions along the san diego sector as tangible proof that these fences succeed in their goal of reducing crossborder smuggling and migration where th ey are constructed opponents attribute part of the decrease in apprehensions to th increase in manpower and resources in the sector and pointing to the increase in appr ehensions in lesspopulated sectors contend that the fence only succeeds in rerouting unauthorized migration recent developments the controversy by 2004 only nine miles of th 14 miles of fence authorized to be constructed had been completed two sections including the final threemile stretch of fence that leads to the paci fic ocean were not finished because of environmental concerns and litigation13 in order to finish th fence the usbp proposed to fill deep canyon known as smugglers gulch with over 2 million cubic yards of dirt the triplefence would then be extended across the filled gulch californias coastal commission ccc however essentially halted the completion of the fence in february 2004 the ccc determined that the cbp had not demonstrated among other things that the project was consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the policies of the california coastal ma nagement program state pr ogram approved under the federal coastal zone management ac t czma 16 usc 1451146414 specifically the ccc was concerned with the potential for significant adverse effects on 1 the tijuana river national estuarine research and reserve 2 state and federally listed threatened and endangered species 3 lands set aside for protection within californias multiple species conservation program and 4 other aspects of the environment the ccc held that congress did not specify particular sign in the iirira and that the cbp failed to present convincing argument that the less environmentally damaging alternative projects it rejected would have prevented compliance with the iirira congressional action although the iirira initially allowed dhs to waive two major environmental laws it did not incl ude the czma in its purview congress accordingly attempted to pass gislation to facilitate the co mpletion of the fence the 107th congress in 446 of the homeland secur ity act pl 107296 expressed its sense that completing the 14mile border project shoul d be priority for the secretary of dhs the 108th congress considered measures that would have allowed the secretary of dhs to waive the czma and other environmental laws but bill passed both chambers15 however the 109th congress subsequently passed th real id act of 2005 pl 10913 div b which authorized the secretary of homeland security to waive all legal requirements determined necessary to ensure ex peditious constructi on of barriers andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22026crs6 16 from cbp congressional affairs september 25 2006 17 the waiver also

authority appears to apply to ll the barriers that ma be constructed under iirira that is both to barriers constructed in the vicinity of the border and to the barrier that is to be constr ucted near the san diego area the 109th congress also passed the secure fence act of 2006 pl 109367 which removed the specific provisions authorizing th san diego fence and added provisions authorizing five stretches of twolayered reinforced fenc ing along the southwest border cbp has estimated that this fe ncing will total roughly 850 miles16 while the specific authorization of the san diego fence was

96 million or roughly 21 million mile19 dhs is proposing to hire priv ate contractors to expedite the construction of the remaining 45 miles of fencing this fact and the complex construction project of filling smugglers gulch may account for part of the difference in cost the fy2006 dhs appropriations act pl 10990 provides 35 million for the construction of the border fence in san diego for fy
