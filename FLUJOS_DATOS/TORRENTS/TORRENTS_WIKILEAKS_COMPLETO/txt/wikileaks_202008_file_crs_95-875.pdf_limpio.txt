conversion and the federal role an update lennard g kruger specialist in science and technology science policy research division summary the united states remains the only majo r industrialized country in which nonmetric measurement system is predominantly employed section 5164 of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 amended the metric conversion act to require fede ral agencies to use the metric system in their activities legislation in the 104th and 105th congress limits federal tric convers ion activities particularly in instances where states local governments and the private sector may be required to convert to the metric system in order to participat in federally funded programs background the united states remains the only majo r industrialized country in which nonmetric measurement system is predominantly empl oyed thus while miles pounds and degrees farenheit ie the english system of measurement are widely used in the united states kilometers grams and degrees celsius are favored throughout the rest of the industrialized world voluntary use of the metric system also known as the international system of units or si has been legal in the united states since 1866 and certain segments of society particularly scientists and industries involved in intern ational trade have embraced metric units for many years calls for wi despread metric convers ion intensified during the mid1960s particularly after the unite d kingdom began its conversion from the english system to metric in 1968 congre ss passed the metric st udy act of 1968 pl 90472 which authorized 3 year department of commer ce study on the feasibility of metric conversion in the united states the study concluded that c onversion to the metric system was in the best interests of the nation particularly in view of the increasing importance of technology and intern ational trade to the us economy in 1975 the metric conversion act pl 94 168 was passed by

antipathy to conversion to the metric system nd the metric boards efforts were largely ignored and in so instances vociferously opposed by the american public in 1982 the metric board was abolished by the reagan administration by the late 1980s however concern over u s industrial competitiveness in world markets led congress to again encourage metric conversion this time by requiring federal agencies to go metric in their respective activities section 5164 of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 amended the metric conversion act of 1975 to designate the metric system as the p referred system of weights and measures for united states trade and commerce the ame nded act required all federal agencies to begin using the metric system in procur ements grants and other businessrelated activities except when such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to us firms agencies were also required to report annually to congress on actions taken to implement fully the metric system of measurement1 as followup to pl 100418 executive order 12770 metric usage in federal government programs issued in 1991 by president bush further required federal agencies to formulate and implement metric conversion plans federal agency metric conversion activities federal agencies were initially slow in re sponding to the metric conversion mandate march 1990 general accounting office gao report found that most federal agencies had not shown commitment to metric conversion2 after executive order 12770 was issued agency compliance measurably imp roved committee print issued december 1993 by the house committee on science sp ace and technology reported that 29 out of 36 federal agencies had reported their metric activities to congress as required by pl 100418 the study concluded that general commitment toward converting to the metric system by each federal government agency reporting appears clearly evident3 meanwhile january 1994 gao report on metric conversion found that while federal preparations for metric c onversion were well underway basic problems limited federal metric procurement grants and other business activities showed mixed progress and federal agencies indi cated need for greater support from the private sector and the public4httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95875crs3 4 continued 1994 p 36 5

activities of all federal agencies nist chairs the interagency committee on metric policy icmp and is required by executiv order 12770 to report to the president annually regarding metr ic conversion progress made by individual federal agencies the most recent report the 1993 metric progress report concluded that metric conversion progress among agencies is widely variable and depends upon the metr ic readiness of the industries particular agencys programs affect budget limitations and the amount of visible high level leadership within the agency5 notable examples of metric conversion ac tivities in the federal government include the proposed metric conversion of federal highways discusse d below requirement that all new federal buildin g construction projects be conducted in metric units and federal trade commission ftc rule requiring consum er product packaging to be labeled with dual english and metric units6 other agencies however ve determined it unfeasible or unpractical to convert par ticular activities to metric at this time the gao found that metric conversion problems encountered by federal agencies frequently involve opposition from the private sector or the public generally speaking the more directly proposed conversion affects th private sector or the public the greater the resistance7 thus for example the secretary of agriculture has granted general exemption from metric conversion for projects or programs that directly aff ect individual farmers or farm programs the national weather service in the department of commerce while gathering all of its data in metric units converts back to the inchpound system before providing its data to the public proposed metric conversion of federal highways an issue that has received much attention from congressi onal policy makers and the pub lic is the proposed metric conversion of the federal highway system on june 11 1992 the federal highway administration fhwa announced its metric conversion policy which stipulated that all highway construction plans specifications and estimates be prepared in metric units of measurement by september 30 19968 after that date fede ral aid highway program funds would not be authorized for nonmetri c projects unless specific exception washttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95875crs4 9 to date the fhwa has granted exceptions for over one thousand construction projects 10 us dept

fhwa and the american association of state highway transportation officials aashto to meet the september 30 1996 deadline for metric conversion however on november 28 1995 the president signed the national high way system designation act of 1995 pl 10459 which provides that be fore september 30 2000 the s ecretary of transportation shall not require any state to use or plan to use the metric system with respect to designing or advertising or preparing plans specif ications estimates or other documents for federalaid highway project legisla tion introduced into the 104th congress by representative duncan hr 3617 and reintroduced into the 105th c ongress by representative bachus hr 813 and senator baucus s 532 would indefinitely remove the federal mandate fo r metric conversion in federal highway projects see discussion in next section of this report the issue of highway sign conversion was considered separately from fhwas overall metric conve rsion policy and was not subject to the september 30 1996 deadline on august 31 1993 the fhwa announced in the federal register solicitation of public comments on options it was considering for coordinating an orderly transition of distance weight and speed traffic control sign legends from english to metric units10 in response to the fhwa notice series of b ills were intr oduced in congress which sought to prohibit the use of federal funds for metric conversion of highway signs additionally department of transportation appropriation bills for fy1994 pl 103 122 fy1995 pl 103331 and fy1996 pl 10450 specifically prohibited use of appropriated funds for metric conversion of highway signs on june 27 1994 the fhwa announced its decision in the federal register not to require the implementation of metric signs until at leas t after 1996 or until further indication of the intention of congress on this subject is received11 the fhwa stated that one of the factors in its decision was possible future cong ressional restriction on using federal funds for metric signs accordingly the national highway system designation act of 1995 pl 10459 prohibits fhwa from requiring the states to expend any federal or state f unds for metric conversion of highway signs meanwhile an april 1996 battelle study commissioned by fhwa has estimated that the cost of metric highway sign conversion could range fro m 156 million for routine replacement to 826 million for dual posting metric legislation in the 104th and 105th congress similar to the metric provisions of the national highway system designation act much of the metricrelated legislation introduced in the 104th congress sought to limit metric conversion activities in the federal government particularly in cases where the federal government is seen to be imposing metric conve rsion mandates on the stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95875crs5 12 us advisory commission on intergovernmental relations the role of federal mandates in intergovernmental relations preliminary report january 1996 p 9 13 modular construction products are components which must fit together with each other as specified in an architectural design exampl include brick concrete masonry block suspended ceiling components raised fl ooring components and sheet goods section 302 of the unfunded ma ndate reform act of 1995 pl 1044 signed into law on march 22 1995 directed the advisory commission on intergovernmental relations acir to study specific federal mandates including requirement s of the departments agencies and other entities of the federal government that state local and tribal governments utilize metric systems of measurement on january 24 19 96 the acir issued its preliminary report on federal mandates the commission identified fhwa metric conversion require ments for federal highway construction as federal manda and recommended the repeal of requirements that state and local governments convert to metric on fede ral timetable as condition of receiving federal aid12 metric proponents have objected to the acir findings asserting that metric conversion has already been implemented by most states that the metric system is becoming increasingly accepted by the construction community and that metric conversion costs constitute tin percentage of total federa l highway funds received other legislation in the 104th congress soug ht to amend the metric conversion act the federal reports eliminati on and sunset act of 1995 p l 10466 which was signed into law on december 21 1995 repeals section 12 of the metric c onversion act requiring federal agencies to report to the congress on their metric conversion activities further amendment to the metric conversion act was included in depa rtment of commerce dismantling legislation which was attached to the house version of the debt limit extension bill hr 2586 subsequently vetoed by the president this provision would have repealed the provision of the metric conversion act which re quires federal agencies to use the metric system in their procurements grants and other businessrelated activities additionally the metric program at nist would have been abolished finally bill passed by the 104th congress pl 104289 sought to curb some federal agency requirements that businesse s convert their modular construction products13 to hard metric specification in order to s upply federal construction contracts while the vast majority of products pr ocured for federal constructi on are soft converted which means that an existing product is relabeled in metric units but does not change size some modular products are required in hard tric sizes in order to be dimensionally coordinated with other building components hard metric c onversion requires in addition to the expression of the dimensi ons of product in metric units physical change in the dimension of that product in order to conform to rounded metric unit certain construction materials industries prima rily makers of concrete masonry block and recessed lighting fixtures objected to hard metric requirements arguing instead for soft metric conversion the savings in construction act of 1996 p l 104289 signed into law on october 11 1996 applies only to concrete masonry units and recessed lighting fixtures the law prohibits federal agencies from specifying hard metric dimensions fo r concrete block and lighting fixtures unless certain criteria are met including determination by the agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95875crs6 14 see statement of representative john dun can congressional record house may 14 1997 p h26501that the costs of the modular metric compone nts are estimated to be equal to or less than the total installed price of using nonhard metric products additionally pl 104289 directs each executive agency awarding construction contracts to designate metrication ombudsman who will respond to industry complain ts and concerns regarding construction metrication issues in the 105th congress metric related legisla tion remains focused on the federal highway construction issue hr 813 int roduced by representative bachus would remove the extended deadline of septem ber 30 2000 from the national highway system designation act pl 10459 thereby indefi nitely prohibiting fhwa from requiring the states to convert their federa l highway projects to metric its section 303 of the surface transportation authorizati on and regulatory streamlin ing act s 532 introduced by senator baucus contains identical language similarly there are plans in the house to attach such language to legislation reauthorizing the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act istea14 proponents of removing th federal mandate for metric conversion cite the costs of conversion experienced by high way contractors and maintain that metric conversion decisions should be left to the states opponents of hr 813 including the department of transportation point out that over 40 states are already surveying and designing their new projects in metric units and that states have spent nearly 71 million to convert standard plans specifications and computer programs removing the federal mandate they argue would create confusion in the highway construction industry and re verse progress that most st ates have already made in converting to the metric system
