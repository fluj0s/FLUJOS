rtnership based on numerous overlapping interests shared values nd improved economic and trade re lations india is in the midst of rapid economic expansion and many us companies view india as lucrative market and candidate for fore ign investment for its part the current indian government sees itself continui ng the economic reforms started in 1991 aimed at transforming qua sisocialist economy into more open marketoriented economy however the us government is concerned that indias economic reforms are progressing too slowly and unevenly bilateral merchandi trade has grown from 6 billion in 1990 to 33 billion in 2006 although india was only the 21th largest export market for the united states in 2006 the united states has become india s leading trading partner mostly due to the growth in indias exports to the united states however recent increases in trade with china have made it close sec ond to the united states in 2006 the us bilateral trade defi cit with india totaled 13 billion in 2006 indias gross domestic product gdp grew by 92 growth ra second only to china among asian nations indias economic growth has also brought about the emergence of sizeable middle class and the largest number of billionaires in asia but the countrys mostly rural population rema ins comparatively poor and largely isolated from the benefits of growth in addition there is growing concern that the economy is overheated as evidenced by rising rate s of inflation moreove r despite several years of strong growth investment in in frastructure is lagging creating potential bottleneck for longterm economic expans ion finally attempts at additional economic reforms aimed at resolving these and other economic problems are constrained by indias political dynamics despite the significant liberalization of indias trade and foreign investment policies there remain number of bilateral and multilateral trade issues between the united states and india the united states seeks greater market access to indias agricultural market and key service sector s for its exports and for foreign direct investment the united states is also cerned about outsourci ng and would also like to see improvements in indias intellect ual property rights protection india for its part calls for the lowering of perceive d us barriers to agricultural and service imports as well as an expansi on of the h1b visa program many of the more prominent indou s trade issues may have indirect implications for congress the growth of indias services exports to the united states has contributed to congressional consideration of po ssible legislation to provide greater assistance to displaced us workers also indias growing demand for crude oil has raised the possibility of boosting bilateral energy cooperation finally the passage of the hyde ac t in 2006 pl 109401 has led to the negotiations of bilatera l peaceful nuclear cooperati on 123 agreement which cannot go into

economic and trade relations introduction economic and trade relations between the united states and india have experienced number of ups and downs si nce indias independence in 1947 during much of the 1950s and early 1960s the unite d states was leading trading partner for india providing the nation with about third of its imports however those economic ties quickly subsided when india fostered closer ties with the soviet union following the indopakistani war of 1965 for the next 40 years political and economic relations between india and the united states were rather cool since 2004 washington and new delhi have been pursuing strategic partnership based on numerous shared values and improved economic and trade relations1 india is in the midst of ra pid economic expansion and many us companies view india as lucrative market and candidate for foreign investment for its part the current indian govern ment sees itself continuing the economic reforms started in 1991 aime d at

exports and foreign direct investment moreover there are significant differences in the stances of the two countries in various multilateral trade fora including the current doha round of negotiations for congress resolution of some of the key economic and trade issues may involve alterations in current federal law in particular changes in laws pertaining to agricultural goods pharmaceuticals

economies in the world indias real gross domestic product gdp rose by 92 in 2006 growth rate second only to china among asian nations th strong gdp performance in 2006 capped five years of rapid economic expansion tr ansforming india into the third largest economy in asia after japan and china its recent economic success is generally attributed to combination of internal and external factors internally series of economic reforms begun when the current prime minister was finance minister have stimulated solid growth of indias manufacturing and service sectors externally relatively strong global economy combin ed with indias trade and investment liberalization policies have stimulated increased trade and investment flows to and from india despite the recent growth indias econom confronts several challenges to its future prosperity first although the nations manufacturing nd services sectors have grown rapidly there has been relatively little j ob creation second its agricultural sector has experienced relatively slow growth for many years with more than half of indian households still reliant on agriculture for their income the standard of living for much of the country s population remains relatively low there are indications that most of the i ndian populace remains untouched by and thus unimpressed with the countrys widely touted economic boom3 third the standard of living of indias rural and urban poor is being threatened by an emerging economic challenge infla tionary pressures after seven years of modest inflation at or below 4 per year inflation in 2006 was nearly 7 and has risen to about 8 in the first part of 20074 indias poor have been especially hard hit by major increases in the cost of food in recent years in the longer run india faces three dditional barriers to economic growth lack of infrastructure bureaucratic obstacl and environmental degradation indias economy is already hindered by its inadequa transportation system and electricity shortage similarly indias complex and entrenched bureaucracy frequently creates barrier to implementing new economic policies and programs at the same time its large population and recent rise in i ndustrial output are putting more and more pressure on indias environment exacerbating existing problems in providing its people with clean potable water as well as clean airhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34161crs4 5 prime minsters address at t he economist round table on india the economist march 13 2007 6 see httpwwwstategovpscarlsrm200672175htmeven with the continued strength of the economy and the singh governments attempt to balance its economic policies many analysts see india facing number of economic challenges and belie ve there are still several important economic reforms that india should make to increase the bene fits generated by its restructured economy in particular critics of the current economic policies point to the unequal distribution of the benefits of the econo mic reforms noting that th rapid economic growth has not brought corresponding reduction in poverty in india particularly in rural areas for some the solution is to press forward more aggressively with the economic reforms by greater liberalization of indias domestic economic and international trade policies for others the solution is reve rse elements of the reform and refocus agriculture and indias rural population in march 2007 prime minister singh ddressed roundtable hosted by the economist magazine in his remarks prime minister singh provided fairly comprehensive overview of his administrati ons view of the current status of the indian economy arguing that indias ec onomy will probably continue its rapid growth for another decade or more5 however singh also pointed out indias need for additional reforms including changes to its banking and financial system its labor markets and its public service delivery mechanisms in light of indias past and planned reforms he stated i find it surprising when i continue to hear complaints about our economy still bein g relatively inwardlooking economy the bush administration seems to hold different view of indias economic conditions maintaining that the singh government ought to push forward more actively with its economic reforms in september 2006 us ambassador to india david mulford said to an audience in new delhi todays business environment in india is more favorable to trade and investment but there are signs of pause in the reform process in recent months privatizations have stopped and political reality suggests that reform of other key sectors and policies of central interest to investors will take longer than envisioned it is important to bear in mind there are serious economic costs to any loss of momentum on the reform front the solution to attracting much greater private sector investment in ergy and infrastructure development is blend of policies that includes better governance market sensitive regulatory regimes continued liberalization of the fi nancial sector that enables foreign and domestic private capital to finance major projects and the timely resolution

economic and trade policies over the last 60 years reveals pattern of conceptual economic theory moderated by pragmatic political and economic considerations major shifts in economic policy were typically initiated with significant changes and then follo wed by period of gradual adjustments following its independence in 1947 th government of prime minister jawaharlal nehru of the indian nationa l congress party inc adopted an economic policy emphasizing rapid i ndustrializa tion import substitution and relatively high levels of government participation in economic production monopolies were granted to state enterprises in number of industr ies considered of ec onomic or strategic importance private companies in other i ndustries were often subject to licensing requirements and legally constr ained in their size of operation the agricultural sector was key focus of the first five year plan with the imple mentation of various subsidy programs food price controls and re strictions on the transport of agricultural crops labor laws provided workers with protection from managerial misconduct but also significantly reduced labor mobility both exports and imports were controlled by licenses and tariffs foreign direct inves tment was also severe ly restricted both by industry and size successive indian governments still headed by prime minister nehru remained relatively true to these policies for both its first and second five year plans 1951 56 and 195661 with m oderately successful results r eal gdp grew at an average annual rate of 36 for the first five ear plan and 25 for the second five year plan agricultural production rose 44 and manufacturing output increased 144 however the economic policies were also leading to growing merchandise trade and current account deficits that were depleting indias foreign reserves for the third five year plan 196166 prime minister nehru and the inc made an adjustment in its economic policies shifting focus away from rapid industrialization over to program of self sustaine d growth at the same time indias trade policy shifted from import substitution to efficient substitution of imports which in effect opened up new trade opportun ities for goods considered crucial to economic growth and development this adjusted economic policy remained in effect until the end of the seventh five year plan in 1990 in 1990 and 1991 india was struck by number of political and economic shocks on the political side the inc refused to form coalition government following poor showing in the elections of 1989

prime minister rao made major and controversial change in economic policies designed to restore faith in the rupee replenish the nations internationa l reserves and stimula economic growth these reforms were overseen by hi s finance minister manmohan singh the initial round of reforms included several elements first efforts were made to reduce indias perpetual fi scal deficits at both the fe deral and state levels second the number of sectors reserved solely fo r the public sector were reduced from 18 industries to just three military aircraft and warships nuclear energy generation and railway transport third india liberaliz ed international trade by reducing import tariffs eliminating import restrictions and opening up india to foreign direct investment fourth india liberalized its financial markets by dismantling its interest rate controls reducing government regulations and permitting greater competition following the initial round of economic re forms indias real gdp growth rate accelerated from around 34 per year in the 1980s to 57 during the early 1990s however toward the end of the decade indias economic growth began to slow some analysts attributed the economic slowdown to failure of the federal government to continue and to complete the economic reforms initiated at the beginning of the decade other analysts argued that economic problems generated by the reforms were creating structur barriers to continued growth the ensuing debate over the merits of the 1991 reforms contributed to second period of gradual economic re form in the second half of the 1990s and into the current decade since 1991 india has made number of significant changes in the structure of its economy including the termination of state monopolie s for all but three industries the elimination of the license raj prior to the reforms there was rather elaborate system of licenses and regulations governing the establishment of business in india making it very timely and expensive process to start new concern the abolition of import licenses for most commodities major reduction in average and peak tariff rates for imports reduction in domestic price contro ls for key consumer goods and restructuring of many of the nations various subsidy programs however some analysts argue that ma ny indians are skeptical about economic reforms in general thus posing marke ting

transforming its import control mechanisms from quantitative restrictions to tariff based system that favored the import of some types of produc ts but deterred the import of other types of produc ts
