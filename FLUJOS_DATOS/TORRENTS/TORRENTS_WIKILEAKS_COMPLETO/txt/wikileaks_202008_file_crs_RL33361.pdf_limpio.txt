managers with less than 15 years of service at retirement11 the above examples illustrate the continuing erosion of retiree hea lth plans in the private sector state and local governments are currently much more likely to sponsor retiree health plans than private sector employers all fifty states offer health benefits to their retirees in some or all age groups12 some local governments offer retiree health benefits state and local governments ve started measuring their retiree health benefit liabilities and costs in preparation for the implementation of gasb 45 confronted with the magnitude of th unfunded liabilities many are likely to consider cutbacks in retiree health benefits retirees fortunate enough to be covered by employ ersponsored retiree health insurance may be required to pay substantial premiums for the coverage according to consultant surveys that provide breakdown for under and over65 retirees and private and public sector plans of t hose employers that sponsor retiree health insurance plans 30 to 40 provide access only plans in which retirees pay for the full cost of coverage13 since it is often difficult for older individuals to find reasonably

etirement health benefit cost to mean the same as the postretirement health benefit expense the postretirement health benefit expense is the amount recognized in an employers income statement usually this is the same as the postretirement health benefit cost accounting for employersponsored retiree health insurance private sector employers sfas 106 since the early nineties accoun ting standards have had major influence on the level of retiree health cove rage offered by private sector employers in 1990 the fasb released sfas 106 that dramatically changed accounting standards for postretirement health benefits provided by private sector employers sfas 106 stated that similar to pensions retiree health benefits were to be considered form of deferred compensation that created an obligation for employers as employees rendered service prior to sfas 106 employers had shown the retiree health benefit cost for year as the p ayasyougo amount or the amount paid out for retiree health benefit claims for that particular year sfas 106 specified new method for determining the postre tirement health benefit cost15 the postretirement health benefit co st determined unde r sfas 106 required recognition of health care benefits to be pa id not only to current retirees but also to future retirees the postretirement health benefit cost dete rmined under sfas 106 was typically several times higher than the payasyougo amount that it replaced on the employers income statement higher costs lower an employers profits and can lead to lower stock price for publicly traded company it should be noted that while the accrual accounting specified under sfas 106 results in higher cost in the year of implementation the cost shows more level pattern than under prior accounting practice under payasyougo accounting the postretirement health benefit cost typically increases year after year as the employee population ages under sfas 106 an employer is requi red to post each year the difference between the postretirement health bene fit cost and the amount funded by the employer for postretirement health benefits as liability to the employers balance sheet the amount funded by the employer fo r postretirement health benefits is the amount put aside by the employer in an i rrevocable trust for prefunding of the retiree health benefit plan or the payasyougo retiree health benefit amount if the employer is not prefunding the retir ee health benefit plan sfas 106 also required the obligation for postretirement health benefits to be disclosed in the footnotes to an employers financial statement the obligation was to be determined as the actuarial present value of future retiree health benefits to be paid to employees that were attributed to service provided by employees up to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33361crs7 16 for public corporation the total assets ss the total liability constitutes shareholders equity this is also called the book value of the corporation and is used as rough guide as to whether the corporations shares are reasonably valuedmeasurement date the obligation was not posted to the employers balance sheet where it would have directly reduced shareholders equity16 for most employers the effect of implementation of sfas 106 was higher postretirement health benefit cost on the income statement and the disclosure of large postretirement health benefit obligation in the footnotes to its financial statement the fasbs objectives in veloping sfas 106 were to improve the representational faithfulness of the employers reported results in the income statement and the statement of financia l position the fasb succeeded in making the retiree health benefit promise much more transparent however faced with new large costs on their income statements many employers began cutting back on retiree health benefit plans beginning in the early nineties private sector employers redesigned retiree health plans by instituting caps reducing commitment based on the age at retirement or years of service of retiree increasing retiree premium sharing or eliminating coverage altogether for either future retirees or all retirees some have blamed the fasb for the cutbacks in employersponsored retiree health benefits alt hough all that the fasb standard did was shed light on promise whose magnitude was until then obscure the underlying reasons for the high postretirement health cost under sfas 106 are high health care inflation increases in health care utilization growing numb ers of retirements and increasing life expectancy employers point out that one of the factors in the high health care inflation is the cost shifting by health care providers for costs that they are constrained from charging the medicare and medicaid programs fasbs proposed revisions to sfas 106 although sfas 106 improved the accounting of postretirement hea lth benefit plans from the prior payas yougo accounting many investors and cred itors believe that the current accounting requirements need to be fu rther revised to make it eas ier to assess an employers financial position and its ability to carry out the obligations of its plans to address these concerns the fasb has embarked on another project that will significantly affect the accounting for postretirement health benefit plans in the first phase of the project the fasb issued an exposur draft on march 31 2006 that makes two major changes to current accounting pro cedures the net funded status of postretirement health benefit plan fair value of plan assets less accumulated postretirement benefit obliga tion would be moved from an employers financial statement footnotes to its balance sheet in addition plan sponsors would be required to measure assets and obligations for the postretirement health benefit plan as of the balance sheet date currently under sfas 106 plan sponsors are allowed to measure plan assets and obligations up to three months earlier than the balance sheet date aligning the measurement date with the balance sheet date is intended to reduce some of the delayed r ecognition available under sfas 106httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33361crs8 17 the accounting standard that applies to priv ate sector defined benefit pension plans is sfas 87 the fasb exposure draft would make analogous changes to sfas 87 as to sfas 106 18 credit suisse report the buck stops where by david zion and bill carcache feb 15 2006 19 shocks seen in new math for pensions mary williams walsh the new york times mar 31 2006fasbs goal is to make the changes proposed in the exposure draft effective for financial years ending after decembe r 15 2006 that would mean 2006 financial statements for firms on calendar year reporting time ta ble the second phase of the fasb project is expected to be more am bitious and controversial in the second phase fasb will consider whether to eliminate smoothing mechanisms accounting rules that allow for delayed recognition of plan asset losses and increases in plan obligations those changes c ould sharply increase postretirement health benefit cost in certain years the fasb exposure draft provisions appl to defined benef it pension plans in addition to opeb plans17 under the fasb proposal for balance sheet posting of funded status the result will be reduced sh areholder equity for many publicly traded companies this could affect the cost of borrowing and credit ratings for such companies an employer seeking to address the situation is more likely to cut retiree health benefits than pensions unlike pensions there are few legal barriers to reducing retiree health benef its furthermore retiree h ealth benefit plans generally have larger deficits than pension plans therefore cutting them would have more favorable impact on the employers financ ial position credit isse has estimated that for the sp 500 compan ies as of year end 2004 the underfunded balance for other post employment benefits consis ting primarily of postretirement health benefits is 336 billion or 104 higher than the underfunded balance for pensions of 165 billion18 reflecting the funded status of opeb and pension plans on the balance sheet would have the most dramatic impact on th balance sheets of old industrial old economy companies with heavily unionized work forces it is estimated that if the proposed fasb acc ounting rule had been in effect as of the end of 2005 the net worth of ford and general motors of 14 billion and 15 billion respectively would have been wiped out and each would have shown net liability instead unfunded retiree health care benefits would be bigge r contributor to this swing than unfunded pension benefits19 state and local governments an accounting standard similar to sfas 106 was released recently for retiree health plans sponsored by governmental employers the government accounting standards board gasb released stat ement 45 in

postretirement health benefit obligation is the cumulativ difference between the arc and the retiree health benefit claims paid outfollows the broad principles establishe d by the financial accounting standards board fasb for private sector employers decade earlier gasb 45 like its predecessor sfas 106 requi res the cost of postretirement health plan to be determined taking into account health care benefits to be paid not only to current retirees but also to future retirees currently most governmental employers record the postretirement health benefit cost for year on payasyougo basis the payasyougo amount is the am ount of health care benefits paid out for retirees in that year the postretirement health benefit cost determined under gasb 45 is called the annual required contribu tion arc for large state and local governments gasb 45 is effective for fi nancial statements for periods beginning after december 15 2006 though there are technical differences in the way the postretirement health cost is determined under sfas 106 and gas b 45 the postretirement health cost determined under either standa rd is likely to be much larger than the payasyougo cost recorded under prior accounting conve ntion the postretirement health cost under gasb 45 could be 5 to 10 times the pay asyougo cost for example in new york city the retiree health benefit co st under current payasyougo accounting is 911 million this is expected to shoot up to between 5 billion to 10 billion under gasb 4520 for the state of maryland the retiree health cost under current accounting for the fiscal year 2006 is 311 million the re tiree health benefit cost using gasb 45 accounting would be 1959 billion21 under gasb 45 the employer is also requi red to disclose the actuarial accrued liability which according to consultants could be as large as 50 times the annual retiree health benefit claims for exampl for the state of maryland the unfunded accrued liability for retiree health be nefits is estimated at 20 billion22 in addition the employer must post the net postretirement health obligation to the balance sheet equal to the cumulative difference between the arc and any contribution that the employer has made to an irrevocable tr ust for prefunding retiree health benefits23 if the employer does not set aside additional funds each year for the payment of retiree health benefits the net postretirement health obligation is likely to grow rapidly large net postretirement health obligation is likely to adversely affect state or citys credit rating and increase the interest rate it pays on borrowing there are two ways state or local government can reduce the net postretirement health obligati on limit retiree health covera ge or start prefunding the retiree health benefit plan by contributing monies to an irrevocable trust to be usedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33361crs10 24 for an example of the effect of the interest rate on arc and the retiree health liability see managing opeb costs under new gasb rules by milliman consultants and actuaries april 2005 at http wwwm illimancom 25 2004 cps data for active employee and depende nt populations indicates that for state and local governments 50 of the population is unionized whereas for th private sector only 14 of the population is unionizedfor payment of these benefits in departure from sfas 106 gasb 45 allows the use of higher interest rate for determina tion of the postretirement health benefit cost if the arc is set aside in trust dedicated to payment of the retiree health benefits since the use of higher interest rate wers the cost and net obligation general rule of thumb is that 1 increase in the interest rate reduces the arc and actuarial accrued liability by 1520 this provisi on will provide further incentive to state and local governments to pr efund retiree health benefits24 although state and local governments are likely to evaluate plan designs with an eye on limiting liabilities it is unlikely that they will cut benefits to the extent that private sector employers re duced benefits in the wake of sfas 106 changing retiree health benefits requires legislation for most states and also for some local governments employees in state and cal governments are unionized to larger extent than in the private sector and are likely to put up greater resistance to cuts in benefits25 prefunding options sponsor of retiree health benefit plan is not legally requi red to make annual contributions to trust prefunding vi an irrevocable trust makes the promised benefits more secure funds set aside fo r payment of retiree h ealth benefits may not be accessed for other purposes by either th employer or creditors funding also lowers the accounting liability and cost for the retiree health plan in many instances funding may lead to higher return on asse ts set aside in the trust compared to the return on the employers general operating funds the tax code in general does not provide as favorab tax treatment for prefunding of retiree health benefits as for pension benefits with respect to assuring that benefits will be paid to employees as promised an ideal funding vehicle for the prefunding of retiree health benefits would have th following characteristics sufficient contributions may be made to allow accumulation of adequate funds for payment of retiree health benefits the rate of return on assets in the trust compares favorably to alternate uses of employer funds contributions made to the trust are tax deductible to the employerand tax free to employees retiree health care benefits paid out of the trust are tax free to retirees assets accumulated in the trust are not accessible to creditors of theemployer in the event of employer bankruptcyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33361crs11 trust assets are recognized as an offset to liabilities for accounting purposes if such an ideal vehicle for prefunding retiree health benefits were to be made available on broad basis unde r the tax code congress might opt to add other legal requirements that are currently missing for example minimum standards for participation

section 115 trust is not taxed and the benefits ought to be tax free to the retiree when received however the irs has issued little guidance with respect to the use of section 115 trusts for funding

trust for this purpose other prefunding vehicles vebas and 401h accounts of defined benefit pension plans are the most common funding vehicles used for prefunding of retiree medical plans employers have sometimes used both veba and 401 h account for the same retiree health plan in order to maximize prefunding some employers have also sought to maximize the aftertax investment income on veba assets by investing trust assets in trust owned life insurance or trust owned health insurance more esoteric funding vehicles that have been used by certain employers include 401k plan subaccounts health stock option plans and 401h subaccounts of money purchase pension plans27 prefunding of retiree health benefit plans is limited although tax policy with respect to pref unding of retiree hea lth benefits is not as clearly favorable as for pension plans private sector employer so inclined could accomplish full prefunding for unionized em ployees and at least limited prefunding for nonunion employees however very fe w private sector companies prefund the postretirement health obligation to any si gnificant extent according to credit suisse of the sp 500 companies 331 offe r opeb mostly

by robin jeweler 30 httpwwwcmshhsgovappsmediapressreleaseaspc ounter1557 accessed on mar 23 2006 since so few employers have earmarked assets to an irrevocable trust for payment of retiree health be nefits employees are vulnerable in addition retiree health benefits can generally be reduced or terminated by an employer at any time as long as the employer has reserved the right to modify the retiree health plan and there is bargaining agreement in effect with an employee union an employer in chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization may not terminate retiree health benefit program without first negotiating proposed modifications with representatives of retirees and second seeking and recei ving court approval to make the modifications29 however many employers underg oing chapter 11 reorganization do end up eliminating or dramatically reducing retiree health benefits public policy implications over65 retirees without employerspons ored retiree health insurance have access to fairly comprehensive health in surance through medicare even though payment of significant medicare premiu ms is required in 2006 the monthly medicare part b premium is 8850 and the average monthly premium for the medicare part d prescrip tion drug program is 3230 however medicare coverage has many gaps the most notable of these are the lack of hospital coverage for very long stays and the socalled doughnut hole in medicare part d coverage for prescriptions medicare does not cover any prescription costs that fall in this hole in 2006 for example medicare part d provi des coverage for prescription costs between 2250 and 5100 in addition medi care beneficiary is responsible for payment of many deductibles coinsura nces and copayments an employer sponsored retiree health insurance

health insurance coverage for retirees by hinda ripps chaikind and fran larkins some are advocating the use of h ealth savings accounts hsas for accumulating assets to pay out ofpocket health care

retiree health care costs31 the bush administration has proposed increasing the maximum amount of contribution allowe d into an hsa if the proposal is enacted into law it would allow for accumulation of larger hsa balances that could be used for payment of outofpocke t health care costs in retirement more direct way to promote employee savings for retirement health care costs might be to modify the current laws and re gulations that apply to vebas although employeepayall vebas can be used to accumulate funds for outofpocket health care costs in retirement current law does not allow payment of an employees veba balance upon termination or premature death allowing such payments or allowing rollover of veba balances to taxfree health retirement account for the employee or spouse would make an employeepayall ve ba more useful savings vehicle for accumulation of funds for an individua ls outofpocket costs in retirement congress may also consider allowing investment income on an

to join th private sector in reducing retiree health care benefits this will lead to renewed calls for national level solutions to the problem of lack of access to reasonably priced health insurance gasb 45 is likely to lead many states and local governments to begin prefunding retiree health bene fit plans some state and local governments may reduce outlays for other programs whereas others may increase property taxes sales taxes or other taxes as employers cut back retiree health benefit coverage ma ny older employees are likely to choose to work few years long er in order to reta in health
