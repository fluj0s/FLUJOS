decision with an emphasis on factors which are likely to be considered in the supreme courts analysis httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30463constitutional aspects of qui tam actions background and analysis of issues in vermont agency of natural resources v united states ex rel stevens summary the false claims act fca originally enacted in 1863 serves as an important mechanism by which fraud against the federal government is combated the act authorizes both the attorney general and private persons to bring civil actions for its enforcement under the terms of the act private individual known as relator may bring such an action on behalf of him or herself and for the united states government these actions are known as qui tam suits and their use dates back to the thirteenth century in england as well as the earliest days of the united states the vast majority of these suits are brought against private entities who are alleged to have committed acts of fraud upon the federal government through the submission of false claims and their validity has been well established however qui tam suits have also been brought against states raising significant constitutional and statutory questions regarding the proper scope of the act specifically it has been argued that such actions are impermissible as states do not constitute persons who may be sued under the act more substantively it has also been asserted that suits by private relators against state violate the eleventh amendment the court of appeals for the second circuit addressed these issues in united states ex rel stevens v vermont agency of natural resources holding that states are indeed within the ambit of the false claims act and that the united states is the real party in interest in qui tam action alleviating any eleventh amendment concerns given the significance of these questions as they relate to state qui tam liability the supreme court granted certiorari in stevens while the second circuits decision is based on widely accepted principles supporting the historical role of qui tam actions it is possible that the supreme court will reverse the decision of the second circuit depending on the factors found persuasive by the court reversal could have substantial implications for qui tam litigation in general specifically ruling by the court that states are not persons under the act would bar any such action against state that has committed fraud irrespective of whether it is brought by the federal government or private relator reversal on the eleventh amendment issue however would only proscribe suits brought by relators where the government chooses not to intervene further complicating matters the supreme court ten days prior to oral argument in stevens issued an order indicating that it would also consider whether qui tam suits violate the standing requirements of article iii of the constitution while the questions being addressed by the court have the potential to greatly impact the false claims act it is unclear whether any change will occur indeed in light of the centuries long history of qui tam actions and the extensive lower court precedent in its favor it is questionable whether the court will radically alter the qui tam landscape httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30463contents overview of the false claims act 1 case history 3 appellate review 4 whether states are

tam actions background and analysis of issues in vermont agency of natural resources v united states ex rel stevens overview of the false claims act qui tam actions arose in england in the thirteenth century as mechanism to assist in the prosecution of fraud against the government specifically as the english government lacked the resources to ferret out and prosecute instances of fraud and other criminal violations against the crown system was established whereby private citizen could be empowered to sue transgressor on behalf of the sovereign and himself and retain share of the fine or penalty imposed upon the offender1 this dynamic is embodied in the latin phrase qui tam pro domino rege quam pro imposos sequiter which means who brings the action as well for the king as for himself2 the traditional acceptance of english law coupled with similar lack of resources led to the employment of qui tam suits by the north american colonies and subsequently the united states itself indeed ten of the first fourteen statutes enacted by congress contained qui tam provisions as enforcement mechanisms3 as the federal government established more efficient law enforcement mechanisms in the nineteenth century the need and support for qui tam suits gradually declined further public support of such actions was low due to the perception that many relators were settling suits for small amounts contrary to the interests of the government accordingly statutory restrictions were imposed that limited the utility of qui tam actions4 during the civil war however qui tam actions were widely used to combat instances of fraud by companies supplying the union army this widespread corruption lead to the formulation of the qui tam provisions in the false claims

an incentive to foster the exposure of fraud against the government6 under the original terms of the act citizen was able to file suit irrespective of any substantive role in exposing the fraudulent practices of defendant this liberal standard resulted in the filing of numerous parasitic qui tam actions based upon information which had already been made public7 in response to these parasitic suits congress amended the false claims act in 1943 imposing strict jurisdictional bar on any qui tam suit predicated on evidence or information which was in the possession of the united states or any agency officer or employee thereof at the time such suit was brought8 as result of this language the ability of individuals to bring suit under the false claims act was severely circumscribed9 the use of qui tam suits declined substantially after the 1943 amendments leading congress to again amend the false claims act in 1986 in an effort to encourage private enforcement suits10 since the 1986 amendments qui tam suits have been pursued vigorously with the recovery of over one billion dollars since 198711 in its current version the fca imposes liability on any person who knowingly makes false claim for payment to the united states12 to aid in enforcement of this proscription the fca provides that person may bring civil action for substantive violations of the act for the person and for the united states government the action shall be brought in the name of the government13 upon bringing the action the relator must serve the government copy of the complaint and written disclosure of the material evidence informat ion he or she possesses the complaint must be filed in camera and remains sealed for minimum of 60 days to enable the government to investigate the allegations however the government may receive an extension upon showing of good cause14 at the end of this investigatory period the government must decide whether to intervene and take control of the suit or to

period upon making showing that discovery proceedings would interfere with the governments investigation or prosecution of criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts18 in instances where the government initially declines to intervene court may nevertheless permit the government to intervene at later date upon showing of good cause in the event of such later intervention the court may not limit the status and rights of the relator19 upon the resolution of successful suit the act provides range of awards to the relator in suits where the government has intervened the relator is eligible to receive between 15 and 25 percent of the amount recovered if it is determined that the relator is not the original source of the information forming the main basis of the suit however the award must be limited to more than 10 percent in situations where the government has not intervened the relator is eligible to receive between 25 and 30 percent of the amount recovered in addition to the award amount the relator is entitled to reasonable attorneys fees20 in cases where the government has not intervened an unsuccessful relator may be ordered to pay reasonable attorneys fees and costs to the defendant if it is determined that the claim was clearly frivolous clearly vexatious or brought primarily for purposes of harassment21 case history in united states ex rel stevens v vermont agency of natural resources an employee of the state of vermont agency of natural resources agency or state brought suit under the false claims act asserting that the agency misrepresented the amount of manpower it invested in federally funded projects inducing the environmental protection agency to provide the state with more grant money than its actions merited22 specifically the relator

intervene in the suit in june of 1996 in july of 1996 the complaint was unsealed and served on the state in response to the suit the state moved for dismissal on the grounds that state agency is not person under the fca and that the eleventh amendment bars suits against states by private citizens the district court denied the motion rejecting both arguments appellate review whether states are persons under the false claims act regarding the question of whether states are persons for the purposes of qui tam litigation the second circuit engaged in an exhaustive textual and historical analysis of the act ultimately concluding that states are indeed covered under the fca the court first noted that treating states as persons under the act would not violate the plain statement rule which mandates that statute not be interpreted in such fashion as to substantially alter the federalstate balance of power unless congress has clearly conveyed such an intent25 in making this determination the court explained that the plain statement rule applies in instances where the federal statute would have the effect of intruding on traditional state authority as opposed to situations where statute simply imposes liability on the states26 given this standard the court stated that the fca does not alter the traditional constitutional balance of federal and state powers so as to require application of the plain statement rule27 upon reaching this conclusion the court began an inquiry into the proper interpretation of the fca under accepted statutory construction standards beginning this analysis the court noted that while the term person does not generally refer to sovereign entity there is set rule compelling exclusion28 specifically the second circuit cited

legislative history and the executive interpretation of the statute are aids to construction which may serve to include state under its terms30 turning its attention to the language of the fca the court determined that the term person is used to categorize both those who may sue and those who may be sued whether by the government itself or by qui tam plaintiff31 the court then noted that several states have acted as qui tam relators under the fca indicating that they viewed themselves as meeting the requirements of 3730b1 which authorizes persons to bring civil action for fraud against the government32 the court also found that congress had clearly favored the ability of states to serve as relators in the 1986 amendments to the act33 the court further stated that states are clearly persons under 3730b1 next the court noted that the term person was also employed in imposing liability under the act34 given this expansive usage the court held that it should be inferred that congress meant person to have the same meaning throughout the statute absent some indication to the contrary35 in light of these factors the court determined that there was support for the proposition that state is person under the fca only for the purpose of bringing qui tam action36 turning to the legislative history of the fca the court further determined that congress intended that states be considered persons under the act specifically the court explained that the impetus for enactment of the 1863 act was stopping the massive frauds perpetrated by large contractors during the civil war37 among the frauds specifically targeted by congress were misrepresentations by state officers in the procurement of military supplies for state troops the costs of which where ultimately borne by the united states38 in conjunction with this legislative history the second circuit noted the supreme courts determination in united states v neifertwhite co that debates at the time suggest that the act was intended to reach all types of fraud without qualification that might result in financial loss to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30463crs6 39 390 us 228 232 1968 40 stevens 162 f3d at 207 quoting

see also bornstein 423 us at 315 46 id at 207208government39 the second circuit then turned to the 1986 amendments citing senate report declaring that the fca reaches all parties who may submit false claims the term person is used in its broad sense to include partnerships associations and corporationsas well as states and political subdivisions thereof40 the court next addressed portion of the1986 amendments providing for civil investigative demands cid that authorize the attorney general to issue written discovery demands as part of false claims law investigation41 noting that this investigative scheme explicitly defined person to include states the court determined that congress would probably not have authorized such investigations into potential fraud by the states unless they are indeed subject to the fca42 in reaching this conclusion the court rejected the argument that the declaration that states are persons in the civil investigative demands provision indicated that states were not included previously the court first explained that this argument was belied by the fact that the cid provision also explicitly referenced natural persons and other entities undeniably covered by the act further the court was unwilling to impute such belief to congress in light of the legislative history of the act given this the court determined that congress regarded states as being covered under the fca historically and would continue to be classified as such after the 1986 amendments43 finally the court also rejected the argument that the treble damages and penalties provided for in the act were punitive characteristic that is usually not associated with suits against the states44 specifically the court explained that the remedies provided for in the fca have been held not to be punitive but remedial multiple damages being recoverable in order to make sure that the government would be made completely whole due to costs and delays associated with the fraud45 accordingly the court determined that there was reason such remedial structure could not be applied to states that commit fraud against the government given all of these factors the second circuit held that the language history and intent of the false claims act clearly established that states fall within the ambit of the act46 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30463crs7 47 id at 201 us const

government that must receive the lions shareat least 70 of any recovery id 53 id at 202b eleventh amendment and sovereign immunity regarding the question of whether states are immune from qui tam actions brought by private relators the second circuit began with an exposition of basic eleventh amendment principles first the court noted that the eleventh amendment provides that the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state or citizens or subjects of any foreign state47 by its terms the eleventh amendments recognition of state sovereign immunity applies only to suits by individuals who are not citizens of particular state however as the court noted the amendment has been interpreted to also bar suits against state by its own citizens foreign nations and indian tribes48 despite these protections it is well established that states do not enjoy sovereign immunity against the united states49 specifically by agreeing to the creation of federal government states are deemed to have permanently waived such immunity as it would conflict with the primacy of the united states50 given this dynamic the second circuit determined that the question at issue centered on whether qui tam suit under the fca is private action barred by the eleventh amendment or legitimate action brought by the united states pointing to the interests vindicated by the fca as well as the governments ability to control the conduct and duration of qui tam suit the court ruled that such actions are not barred by the eleventh amendment51 the court first explained that the united states is the real party in interest in qui tam suit to support this conclusion the court explained that all of the actions triggering liability under the fca center on the use of fraud to secure payment from the government52 the court distinguished the governments interest from that of the relator declaring that while qui tam plaintiff has an interest in the outcome of an action the interest is less like that of party than that of an attorney working for contingent fee further the court stated that qui tam claims simply do not seek the vindication of right belonging to the private plaintiff and if there has been injury to the united states the qui tam plaintiff cannot recover53 as such the courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30463crs8 54 id at 202 see also minotti v lensink 895 f2d 100 104 2d cir 1990 united states ex rel milam v university of texas 961 f2d 46 50 4th cir

corp 312 us continueddetermined that while private citizens may initiate qui tam action the government remains the real party in interest54 the court also found it significant that the government has ultimate control over any qui tam action possessing the authority to intervene at the outset of any such action also absent intervention the government has the right to be kept abreast of discovery in the qui tam suit and the right to prevent that discovery from interfering with its investigation or pursuit of criminal or civil suit arising out of the same facts55 the court also stressed that if the government does intervene it takes control of the suit may limit the relators participation and may not be bound by any act of the relator furthermore the court noted that the government can prevent dismissal sought by the relator and can have the action terminated upon the showing of valid governmental purpose irrespective of the wishes of the relator56 based upon its determination that qui tam actions serve to remedy only wrongs done to the united states and that the government exercises substantial control over their progression the second circuit held that such suits are essentially governmental actions and therefore do not offend the eleventh amendment57 supreme court review because of split among the circuits the supreme court granted certiorari in stevens originally limited to the issues decided by the second circuit however ten days prior to oral argument in stevens the court issued an order indicating that it would also consider whether qui tam suits violate the standing requirements of article iii of the constitution with the addition of the article iii question the court significantly broadened the potential impact of stevens on traditional qui tam litigation statutory construction while reversal on the eleventh amendment and article iii standing questions decided in stevens would require an involved constitutional analysis it is conceivable that the supreme court may merely reverse the second circuits determination that states are persons for the purpose of qui tam litigation avoiding the more substantive issues specifically it is possible that the court will determine that the legislative history of the fca is insufficient to overcome the oftenexpressed understanding that in common usage the term person does not include the sovereign and statutes employing the word are ordinarily construed to exclude it58 as noted above thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30463crs9 58 continued 600 604 1941 59 see united states ex rel long v scs

united states 522 us 52 60 1997 65 pennsylvania v union gas co 491 us 1 11 1989second circuit determined that this precept is not set rule but rather depends largely on the context and legislativ history of the statute in question it could be argued though that the common usage distinction requires at minimum that states are excluded absent an affirmative declaration by congress59 the court of appeals for the district of columbia has stressed this argument noting that this principle is particularly appropriate where the statute would subject states to liability to which they are unaccustomed60 from this it could be argued that the second circuit erred in finding that there was indication that congress meant for the term person to have different meanings under different portions of the act instead of discerning whether the act affirmatively brought states within its remedial ambit61 indeed given that neither the current nor original version of the act defines person to explicitly include the states it is possible that the court will determine that such an affirmative showing has not been made building upon this approach it could be argued that the second circuits determination that the broad usage of persons as including corporations and other entities supported the inclusion of states was incorrect the dc circuit in united states ex rel long v scs business tech inst inc held as such stating that the mere fact that corporations could be held liable under the act was unpersuasive in regards to the states given the affirmative intent requirement62 while this argument seems to undercut the second circuits decision it is important to note that there is per rule prohibiting the interpretation of general liability language to include the states63 rather the practice of excluding states from such statutes is rule of statutory construction applicable where statutory intent is ambiguous in light of this dynamic the maxim that statute can be unambiguous without addressing every interpretive theory buttresses the textual and historical analysis of the second circuit64 furthermore it should be noted that determination that states are not persons under the fca would preclude not only qui tam actions brought by relators but those pursued directly by the united states as well this is particularly pertinent as the supreme court has previously rejected the notion that statutory ambiguity will nullify an action by the united states indeed the court has stated that the constitution presents barrier to lawsuits brought by the united states against state and that for the purposes of such suits states are naturally just like any nongovernmental entity65 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30463crs10 66 long 173 f3d at 876 citing will 491 us at 6869 67 long

susceptible to determin ation that the legislative history of the act is not sufficiently clear to obviate the aforementioned affirmative intent requirement arguments specifically in long the dc circuit found it significant that examples of fraud cited in the 1863 version of the act did not include any state transgressions further the court in long stressed that legislative history indicating an intent to impose liability on state officials is not evidence of an intent to subject the states themselves to liability66 from this the dc circuit determined that there was basis to conclude that congress intended to include states under the 1863 version of the act 67 turning to the 1986 amendments the long court pointed to the supreme courts determination that such subsequent provisions are largely irrelevant as they do not reflect any direct focus by congress upon the meaning of the earlier enacted provisions 68 finally the dc circuit also disagreed with the second circuits analysis of the civil investigative demand provisions enacted in 1986 maintaining that their purpose could be to merely facilitate collection of information from state for use in suit against contractors or other offenders69 in light of these factors it is evident that there is substantial room for disagreement regarding the ambiguity of the fca as it applies to the states as such it is possible that the supreme court will ultimately determine that the statutory text and legislative history of the act are not sufficiently precise so as to bring states within the ambit of the fca however it must be remembered that there is per rule prohibiting such inclusion this factor in conjunction with the remedial rights of the united states and the traditional use of the fca by states acting as relators seems to lend substantial support to the decision of the second circuit b eleventh amendment as noted above the second circuit determined that qui tam suits brought by private relators against state are effectively suits by the united states and therefore do not violate the strictures of the eleventh amendment several other circuit courts have reached the same conclusion70 in united states ex rel foulds v texas tech univers ity however the fifth circuit stated that it was as plain as the sun that private relator does in fact commence and prosecute qui tam actions in which the government does not intervene contravening the express terms of the eleventh amendment71 in reaching this conclusion the fifth circuit criticized the approaches of other courts that have considered the issue proclaiming that the real party in interest analysis was inappropria specifically the foulds court determined that such an approachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30463crs11 72 id at 289 73 id at 289 74 id

or prosecutes the suit for eleventh amendment purposes72 thus the fifth circuit determined that more indepth inquiry was required to ascertain the real actor in qui tam suits the court determined that the question was more complex than other circuits had found noting that congress has not specified the contours of the relationship between the qui tam plaintiff and the united states73 indeed the fifth circuit observed that the relationship could be characterized at one extreme as the government yielding complete control of the suit to the plaintiff or on the opposite end of the spectrum as the deputization of each individual plaintiff to act in the governments interests74 the court found that neither of these characterizations was sufficient in explaining the relationship between the relator and the government stating that the government retains some control over the qui tam suit commenced by the plaintiffsbut does not exercise authoritative control over the case75 building upon this dynamic the court stated that even though the government is relevant party in suits where it has chosen to remain passive it is not the acting party of record limiting its ability to challenge judicial actions given this the court stated that it would be contradictory to classify passive party as commencing or prosecuting suit under the eleventh amendment76 the fifth circuit further rejected the argument that relators are effectively deputized in suits where the government assumes passive role first the court declared that congress cannot delegate to private citizens the united states sovereign exemption from eleventh amendment restrictions in support of this statement the court noted the supreme courts admonition in blatchford v native village of noatak that the consent inherent in the conventionto suit by the united statesat the insistence and under the control of responsible federal officersis not consent to suit by anyone whom the united states might select77 from this statement the fifth circuit explained that the federalist principles at play in the eleventh amendment context dictate that state sovereignty is surrendered only to another sovereign the united states which of course acts through responsible federal officers78 given this maxim the court maintained that the historical conception of qui tam relators as motivated primarily by prospects of monetary reward rather than the public good undermines the possibility that they are deputized to stand in for the responsible federal officers to whom the states have surrendered their sovereignhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30463crs12 79 id at 293 80 id at 293 81 kansas v united states 204 us 331 341 1907 82 blatchford 501 us at 782 see also pennsylvania v new jersey 426 us 660 665 1976

litigation but in fact possesses significant control over the litigation process coupled with the chimerical presence of the united states in cases where it remains passive the fifth circuit determined that the control enjoyed by the relator constitutes commencement and prosecution by private citizen in violation of the eleventh amendments guarantee of sovereign immunity80 this interpretation by the fifth circuit obviously conflicts with the second circuits holding in stevens and the ultimate holding of the supreme court will hinge on which analysis it deems dispositive comparing these differing approaches it seems that while the fifth circuit analysis is tenable certain unique aspects of the false claims act support the second circuits holding in stevens specifically the fifth circuits decision in rejecting the real party in interest analysis applied by the other circuits ignores the principle that the united states status as party to controversy is not determined by the nominal party on the record but rather by the effect of the potential judgment or decree81 in relying on dicta in blatchford for the proposition that the united states cannot remain passive in qui tam action against state it does not seem that the fifth circuit gave sufficient weight to the fact that the decision was limited to the question of whether the united states had delegated to indian tribes the right to sue the states to vindicate its interests specifically the court in blatchford held that while the government may bring suit to benefit particular private parties when sovereign or quasisovereign interests are implicated there was support for the argument that the united states had delegated this authority82 given this application to actions by the united states to essentially vindicate the rights of private parties it does not seem that blatchford is of any real significance in the qui tam context since such suits vindicate an injury only to the united states83 also it seems that the fifth circuits approach minimizes the actual level of control the government possesses over passive qui tam suits as noted by the second circuit relators are required to disclose all material evidence and information at the outset of the suit and the government retains the right to track the case and impose restrictions on discovery prevent dismissal and seek termination upon showing of valid governmental purpose84 furthermore the foulds approach largely ignores the historical role of qui tam actions in vindicating the rights of the federal government

framers viewed the involvement of government attorneys as essential to suit by the united states rather it is important to note that at the time of the convention qui tam relators played substantially larger role than responsible federal officers in the propagation of such suits this practice relates back to the thirteenth century when the english crown delegated qui tam authority to private relators due in part to the fact that the monarchy lacked sufficient number of prosecutors to pursue all instances of fraud this dynamic adhered to the early american experience as well given that the justice department was not created until the latter part of the 19th century85 thus while the fifth circuits approach is tenable the structure of the fca coupled with the historical aspects of qui tam litigation seem to support the second circuits holding in stevens c article iii standing shortly before hearing oral argument in stevens the supreme court issued an order expanding the scope of its inquiry to include the question of whether private individual has standing under article iii to litigate claims of fraud upon the government whereas the original issues in steven s were limited to small subset of qui tam claims namely suits against states the standing issue raised by the court has broad implications for the constitutionality of the false claims act as whole article iii of the constitution defines and limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to adjudication of cases and controversies86 the supreme court has established that to satisfy the requirements of article iii party bringing suit must 1 establish an injury in fact 2 caused by the actions of the defendant 3 that is redressable via judicial decision87 under this standard the standing of qui tam relators is susceptible to attack under variety of rationales first the injury in fact test requires not just an injury to some inchoate interest but rather that the party seeking review be himself among the injured88 as noted above qui tam relator is not generally viewed as having suffered any particular ized personal injury from the alleged fraud since the only harmed party is the united states itself89 given this it may be argued that the relator is merely bringing suit to vindicate general injury to his interests as citizen of the united states which the supreme court has deemed an insufficien t basis for standing90httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30463crs14 91 schlesinger v reservists to stop the war 418 us 208 226 1974 92 see united states ex rel kelly v boeing co 9 f3d 743 748 9th cir 1993 93

nonetheless held that the fca violated article ii 95 id at 8 96 id at 9 97 id at 89 see also morrison v olson 487 us 654 1988 it should be noted however continuedbuilding upon this lack of personal injury it could also be asserted that congress cannot confer standing on relator by creating financial interest in the suit as motivation is not substitute for the actual injury required for finding of standing91 furthermore the aforementioned principles could buttress an argument that in light of the lack of real personal injury congress cannot skirt article iii requirements by assigning the united states claim to the relator for enforcement92 in lujan v defenders of wildlife the supreme court rejected the argument that congress may confer standing by granting procedural right to private party who has suffered injury as such an assignment would interfere with the authority of the executive branch specifically the court explained that to permit congress to convert the undifferentiated public interest in executive officers compliance with the law into an individual right vindicable in the courts is to permit congress to transfer from the president to the courts the chief executives most important constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed93 the court of appeals for the fifth circuit found this reasoning applicable in the qui tam context determining that the false claims act violated the take care clause of article ii94 in riley v st lukes episcopal hospital the court of appeals for the fifth circuit held that fca qui tam actions in which the government does not intervene encroach on two aspects of the executives authority 1 the discretion to decide whether to prosecute claim and 2 the control of litigation brought to protect the governments interests95 the court stressed that when the sole injurythe only ticket to courtbelongs to the government the executives prosecutorial discretion must include the power to decide whether to bring suit given this requirement the court found that qui tam suits in which the government remains passive encroach on executive authority further the court determined that the fca limits the ability of the executive branch to control the litigation as the government may not freely dismiss or settle the action and cannot remove the relator under any circumstances96 having made this determination the fifth circuit proceeded to compare the encroachment of the fca with the loss of executive authority occasioned by the independent counsel provisions at issue in morrison v olson the court opined that this approach was proper under its view that the supreme court had provided thorough analysis of the take care clause and its relationship to the separation of powers doctrine in morrison 97 in conducting this comparison the fifth circuithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30463crs15 97 continued that the factors deemed dispositive by the supreme court in morrison centered on an analysis of the appointments clause of article ii not the take care clause as asserted by the fifth circuit in riley also in morrison the supreme court determined that the for good cause removal requirement of the ethics in government act did not offend the separation of powers doctrine as such requirement provides the executive with substantial ability to enure that the laws are faithfully executed id at 696 furthermore in edmond v united states 520 us 651 661 1997 the supreme court stated that morrison did not purport to set forth definitive test for such constitutional inquiries these factors viewed in light of the significant control the fca gives the attorney general over all stages of qui tam action seem to belie the validity of the fifth circuit s approach in riley see n103 and accompanying

other courts that the fca lacks four features of the ethics in government act that preserved executive control of prosecutions by the independent counsel to sufficiently alleviate separation of powers concerns98 first the court asserted that unlike an independent counsel the attorney general may not remove relator for good cause second the attorney general has control over the decision whether to initiate qui tam suit third the attorney general according to the fifth circuit has control over the breadth of relators suit fourth relator unlike an independent counsel does not have to adhere to the rules and policies of the department of justice99 as such the fifth circuit deemed such qui tam actions unconstitutional in light of these factors there is possibility that the supreme court will determine that private relators lack article iii standing however the aforementioned arguments again seem to ignore the unique characteristics of qui tam litigation that prevent the imposition of such arbitrary precedential templates specifically it should be noted that the threepart test established by the supreme court for analyzing standing issues is not necessarily dispositive rather the substantive inquiry remains whether plaintiff personally would benefit in tangible way from the courts intervention100 this substantiv inquiry seems to be the appropriate analysis in the qui tam context given that the standard delineated in lujan and related cases adheres to suits where parties are seeking prospective relief necessitating an inquiry into whether the requisite interest exists on behalf of the plaintiff this concern is absent in qui tam suits however which the supreme court has recognized as the unusual case in which congress has created concrete private interest in the outcome of suit against private party for the governments benefit by providing cash bounty for the victorious plaintiff101 this conception of qui tam litigation also comports with the historical conception of judicial power as suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30463crs16 102 marvin v trout 199 us 212 225 1905 103 see kelly 9 f3d at 753 104 id at 755 105 1999 wl 1034213 at 35 stewart j dissenting 106 id at 36 107 id at 36 kelly 9 f3d at 755statutes have been in existence since the thirteenth century in england and have been employed by the united states since its inception102 regarding separation of powers concerns it does not seem that the fca encroaches upon the power of the executive branch in such fashion as to render it unconstitutional while the fifth circuits handling of the issue is logically based it should be noted that under the fca the department of justice does retain fair amount of control in suits in which it chooses not to intervene through its ability to seek dismissal to control certain aspects of discovery and to seek alternative remedies103 based upon these various factors the court of appeals for the ninth circuit in united states ex rel kelly v boeing co determined that the fca gives the attorney general sufficient means of controlling or supervising relators to satisfy separation of powers concerns104 furthermore it should be noted that the fca does not appear to impermissibly strip the executive branch of prosecutorial discretion as the fifth circuit contends rather it would seem that decision not to intervene in fact constitutes delegation of prosecutorial authority to the relator as opposed to the elimination of such discretion105 this nuance stems from the fact that mere nonintervention does not constitute an objection to the qui tam suit indeed as noted by the dissent in riley the government only stands to benefit from the suits progress106 finally it must be stressed that in addition to the aforementioned controls the department of justice may prevent relator from voluntarily dismissing suit brought under the fca this fact establishes that the government possesses discretion over suit from its inception to its resolution given this dynamic it does not seem that the fca is as the fifth circuit held an impermissible encroachment on executive power in light of these factors it seems that the government does indeed retain substantial control over qui tam suits obviating any separation of powers concerns107 conclusion from the above analysis it seems that the second circuit correctly determined that qui tam actions by private relators against state comport with constitutional requirements and accepted principles of statutory interpretation further the historical tradition of qui tam suits coupled with the unique dynamics of relator standing under the fca seems to overcome any article iii or separation of powers concerns at the same time however it is possible that the supreme court will circumscribe the potential liability of the states under either the statutory or eleventh amendment arguments discussed above altering the traditional understanding and application of qui tam litigation
