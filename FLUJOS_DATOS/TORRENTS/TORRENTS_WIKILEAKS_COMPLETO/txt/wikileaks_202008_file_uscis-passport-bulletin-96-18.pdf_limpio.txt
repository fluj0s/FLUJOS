coordination with cappt and ins has re vised its interpretation of the section 321a ina requirements for derivative naturalization we now hold that there i s specific order in which the conditions of part must be satisfied for citizenship to be acquired as long as conditions are satisfied before the childs 18th bi rthday we also consider the age limit of 18 applies to all pe rsons who come within the purview of the ina background section 321a ina provides for acquisition of citizenship of minor upon the naturalization of hisher parents provided certain conditions are satisfied because 321a di d not specify that the conditions must occur in any certa in order page 1 of 4 lexisnexis tm cd 1082003 http12700149152mbl pextdllimmigrtn 4211b0a1b441b4aftem platesfndothere were differing opinions among adjudicators as towhether person could claim citizenship under section 321 regardless of the order in which the conditions occ ured the referenced passport bulletin addressed this problem with regard to the two most often asked questions whether the naturalization of one parent must occ ur after the death of the other parent in order for the child to acquire citizenship through the parents naturalization under section 321a2 and whether the naturalization of the parent with cus tody must occur after the parent is divorced or separated and has custod for the child to acquire citizenship through the naturalization of t he custodial parent under section 321a3 the bulletin advised that in order for child to derive citizenship under section 321a the death of an lien parent or the awarding of custody of child follow ing divorce or legal separation must occur prior to the naturalization of the surviving or custodial parent copy of this bulletin is attached for your reference new interpretations through subsequent discussions caocs capt and i ns have agreed on what we believe to be more judicious interpretation of section 321a we now hold that as long as all the conditions specified in section 321a re satisfied before the minors 18th birthday the ord er in which they occur is irrelevant citizenship would b acquired on the date the last condition is satisfied pleas note this interpretation cannot be applied withoutqualif ication in the case of an adopted child who claims citizenship under section 321b ina because section 321b specifically requires that an adopted child be residing in the u nited states pursuant to lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of naturalization with reference to the issues discussed in the bulle tin we now hold as follows naturalization of the surviving parent sec 321a 2 child whose alien parent dies after the naturaliz ation of the other parent would derive citizenship automatic ally under section 321a2 on the date of the alien parents death provided the death occurs before the childs 18th b irthday and the child is residing in the united states purs uant to lawful permanent residence on that date if the chi ld is not residing in the united states on that date but ther eafter enters the united states to begin lawful permanent residence before age 18 citizenship would be acquired on the date of such entry naturalization of the parent with legal custody aft er divorce or legal separation of the parents sec 32 1a3 child who is given into the custody of parent f ollowing that parents naturalization the other parent bein g an alien would derive citizenship under section 321a3 ina on the date custody is awarded provided such date i s prior to childs 18th birthday and the child is residing in the

the united states n that date but entersthe united states to begin lawful pe rmanent residence before age 18 citizenship would be acqui red on the date of such entry legal custody the department has not changed its interpretation f what constitutes legal custody as stated in the refer enced bulletin in cases where the divorce or separation decree does not specify who has custody and the naturalize d parent has physical custody the child can be documented s citizen under section 321a3 provided that all ther conditions of the law are met section 321 does not require sole or exclusive legal custody if the parents hav joint custody decree then both parents have legal custod thus the naturalization of either parent would be suffic ient to satisfy the section 321a3 if there is specif ic question about the sufficiency of legal custody evi dence ocs ppt and ins agree that we should review the ma tter on case by case basis application of the 1978 amendment pl 95417 effective october 10 1978 amended section 321 ina to raise from 16 to 18 the age upon which all the conditions of the law had to be fulfilled in order for citizenship to be acquired the department and ins now interpret this amendment to apply to any person claiming citizenship through parents naturalization und er section 321 who can establish that after december 24 1952 the effective date of the ina and before the persons age of 18 all the conditions of the law were satisfied we do not consider the date the law was amended october 5 1 978to have any significance in the adjudication of such c laims previously we held that the amendment was not retr oactive see 7 fam 11534 4c2 we now hold that the amendment is to be applied retroactively to the effective date f the ina ocs has received several questions from passport adjudicators most recently from the philadelphia nd new york agencies about the interpretation of section 321 regional directors are asked to ensure that all passportagencies and acceptance
