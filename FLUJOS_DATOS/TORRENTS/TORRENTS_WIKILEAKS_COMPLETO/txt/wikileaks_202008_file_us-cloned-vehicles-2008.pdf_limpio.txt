and vehicle identification numbers this report will only specifically address cosmetically cloned vehicles vehicles whose appearance is altered to look like legitimate commercial vehicle cl oned vehicles continue to be an issue for law enforcement agencies across the nation hist orically cloned vehicles have been used to transport money drugs and illegal liens and continue to be used for these purposes today in todays post 911 society the potential use of cl oned vehicles for an act of terrorism within the united states poses viable threat todays law enforcement officers must be aware of the current use of cloned vehicles as well as their potential use law enforcement officers must have the ability to detect and distinguish cloned vehicles from true commercial vehicles scope of report the use of cloned vehicle allows the criminal to blend in with hisher surroundings in order to evade the attention of law enforcement officers on the road this report will assist law enforcement officers in the det ection of cloned vehicles by examining specific instances of cloned vehicles previously encountered by law enforcement officers additionally this report will provide officers with regulatory information identify legal issues and make recommendations in confronting the future use of cloned vehicles by the criminal element issues it is difficult to distinguish between cloned vehicles and true commercial vehicle however there are noticeable differences these differences will be identified and discussed within this assessment various concealment methods are used to conceal contraband in vehicles this report will identify and discuss some concealment methods previously discovered by law enforcement domestic security implications terrorists could use cloned vehicles to carry out acts of terrorism through the use of the internet and other available technology criminals are able to easily obtain the materials necessary to clone vehicle with little fear of detection as there is face to face interaction required to make purchase via the internet additionally with the right equipment the criminal can complete their objective from the comfort of their own home with little or interaction with others currently cosmetically cloned commercial vehicles are not illegal improper use of companys logos and colors without more evidence of criminal activity are trademark violations which are civil in nature and not enforceable by law enforcement officers recommendations provide training for law enforcement officers on the detection of cloned vehicles provide training for law enforcement officers on concealment methods that might be used in cloned vehicle to conceal illegal items coordinate with the commercial entities that provide the services andor materials that could be used to create cloned vehicle to ensure that law enforcement officers are aware of the current technology and resources available law enforcement should encourage the creation of laws state and federal statutes that effectively enact against persons cloning or using cloned vehicles to further their criminal activities llaaww eennffoorrcceemmeenntt sseennssiittiivvee ppaaggee 2 cloned vehicles growing threat to law enforcement technology todays everchanging advancements in technology are an obvious benefit to society as whole and the law enforcement community howeve r this same advanced technology is easily and readily available to the criminal element with internet and business information criminals that are technologically savvy are able to clone vehicle by making use of computer programs such as adobe photoshop to copy or manipulate images or clandestinely utilize certain companies websites to make the products for them for example decals used on cloned vehicles require the knowledge of creating editing or modifying pictures so that they resemble true commercial vehicle dangers of cloned vehicle terrorism in todays age of global terrorism the potential exists for the use of cloned vehicles for terrorist activities ranging from surveillance and preplanning to an actual terrorist attack although cloned vehicle has not been used in terrorist attack within the united states true commercial vehicles have in 1993 ryder truck was used in terrorist attack on the world trade center in new york city new york and in 1995 ryder truck was used in an act of domestic terrorism at the alfred p murrah federal building in oklahoma city oklahoma recent article printed by the associated press titled expert warns of terrorists nuke strategy stated that authorities need to expand their focus on the ways terrorists could deliver nuclear or radiological weapons into the country one method in which to deliver nuclear or radiological weapons into the country could be truck or van driving into place like manhattan because it blends into the background and is easy to acquire cloned vehicle meets these criteria patrol officers and investigators should pay special attention to delivery service and government vehicles during patrols routine tra ffic stops and investigations of suspicious incidents officers should be mindful of vehicles resembling government vehicles andor commercial vehicles typically vehicles and occupants are regionally based plausible exceptions do exist however time factors cost effectiveness availability of service in geographic area and reason for trip should be heavily considered further the use of government vehicles with official markings especially those associated with friendly military government and public safety ent ities could be means of delivering vehicle borne explosive device to target site this thod could allow terrorists to bypass established security protocols and strike hardened highvalue targets it is essential that all law enforcement personnel maintain vigilance and remain alert to the possible use of what appear to be marked official vehicles as part of terrorist operation drugs currency and contraband when an officer encounters cloned vehicle heshe should attempt to determine the motive for the subjects to clone the vehicle the subjects motive may give an officer an indication of what may be concealed within the vehicle the new and innovative ways criminals have been concealing their contraband to repel authorities is too vast to list however this assessment includes few methods that have been used llaaww eennffoorrcceemmeenntt sseennssiittiivvee ppaaggee 3 as shown in example seven in this assessment 1070000 in us currency was concealed inside hollowedout spools of wire in the cargo area of the van the van displayed directv markings and logos and contained cablerelated equipment how to clone vehicle obtain vehicle in the reported incidents below the cloned vehicles were purchased at auto auctions dealerships or were stolen in some cases the registrations of the cloned vehicles remained in the name of the original business even after the vehicle was sold at an auto auction in many of the incidents very sophisticated aftermarket businesses were utilized to make the vehicle appear to belong to legitimate company service or government agency vehicle wrapping vs decals and magnets vehicle wrapping one common method of cloning vehicle is vehicle wrapping members of commercial companies or technically savvy criminals print out very large sheets of wrapping material that include the images and measurements that fit the model of the vehicle the company then covers the entire vehicle even the windows with the wrap car wrap is made of durable vinyl covering that is applied directly to the vehicle window sections are perforated to maintain safe visibility vinyl decals and magnetic logos vinyl decals and magnetic logos are usually sold in pairs and placed anywhere on the vehicle usually one logo on each side the vinyl decals are intended to be permanent but can be removed however once the decals are taken off new decals will be needed to replace them because the adhesive will be worn away magnetic metallic logos are placed anywhere on the vehicle and obviously can be removed and replaced as needed create your own logo from home the following is one of many business websites that allows clients to custom design decal logo via the internet wwwstreetdecalscomcreateasp the client is able to submit logo design to the business via the internet the business then produces magnetic or vinyl decal and ships the decal to the client along with detailed application instructions face to face contact is needed for the transaction cost the cost of vehicle wrapping for cars and vans ranges from 1000 6000 depending on the vehicle larger vehicles can also be wrapped and the cost is proportional to the complexity of the installation vehicle wrapping requires professional installation the cost for magnetic logos depends on the size and color cost estimates range between 45 for pair of singlecolor magnetic logos and 110 for fullcolor magnetic logos assuming standard 12x24 size logo for van or small commercial vehicle the cost for vinyl logos range from 110 for singlecolor with installation 40 without installation and 160 for fullcolor with installation 60 without installation also assuming standard 12x24 size logo llaaww eennffoorrcceemmeenntt sseennssiittiivvee ppaaggee 4 note it would seem logical that

completely familiar with the emergency services and emergency vehicles to include fire and other rescue vehicles operating within their jurisdiction including 24hour contact information to better assist law enforcement emergency service agencies should have verification procedures in place for their vehicles and employees especially in mes of disasters or other events law enforcement should

also be followed when stoppingsearching cloned vehicle can an officer conduct traffic stop based on hisher suspicion that the vehicle is cloned 9 if an officer can articulate the basis of hisher suspicion that the vehicle is cloned ie the border patrol vehicle with the wrong letter in the vehicle id number pg 12 then traffic stop may be legally justified can an officer conduct search of the vehicle based on hisher suspicion that the vehicle is cloned 9 additional information obtained after the vehicle is stopped may provide probable cause for search or seizure of the vehicle one minor indicator probably would not be enough for probable cause though it might provide reasonable suspicion multiple indicators would provide probable c ause it all depends on how clearly the officer is able to articulate hisher reasons for conducting the stop and search caution improper use of companys logos and colors without more evidence of criminal activity are trademark violations which are civil in nature and not enforceable by law enforcement officers llaaww eennffoorrcceemmeenntt sseennssiittiivvee ppaaggee 22 recommendations 1 law enforcement should keep updated with concealment methods as the criminal element has proven ingenious in developing concealment methods ie from hiding contraband in tires to chemically engineering cocaine in acrylic glass 2 law enforcement agencies should stay in constant communication with commercial industries that provide tools for cloned vehicles this will give law enforcement the information needed in order to keep up with new trends that may be available to legitimate companies and allow law enforcement the opportunity to educate the industry on how to detect suspicious clients and encourage the industry to contact law enforcement 3 regarding terroristcriminal activities law enforcement should have communication and verification procedures in place for government vehicles operating within their jurisdiction with specific emphasis on emergency servic and emergency vehicles to include fire and other rescue vehicles emergency service agencies should have verification procedures in place for their vehicles and employees law enforcement agencies should also be aware of the various commercial entities and vehicles operating within their jurisdiction 4 law enforcement should encourage creation of laws designed to criminalize the use of cloned vehicles with clearly defined consistent federal and state statutes available to assist them law enforcement officers can effectively act against people using cloned vehicles to further their criminal activities conclusion without law enforcement intervention the threat posed by cloned vehicles will continue to provide criminals with the means necessary to carry out their initiative as discussed earlier the initiatives may be smuggling drugs illegal aliens or weapons that may be used by terrorists it is important for law enforcement agencies to work together and combine investigative efforts on developing cases that involve cloned vehicles increased communication and the sharing of information will be step in the right direction in stopping criminals from using the commercial and private industries to their advantage llaaww eennffoorrcceemmeenntt sseennssiittiivvee ppaaggee 23 llaaww eennffoorrcceemmeenntt sseennssiittiivvee ppaaggee 24 appendix llaaww
