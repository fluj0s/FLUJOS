amrt each ikss terminal was fielded with one taclane forencryption of the ku link into siprnet tunneling of nipr through second taclane wasachieved by harvesting an existing taclane that resided in each s1s4 vehicle within thebattalions this leveraging of assets internally within the battalions was not possible for attached units ie the air calvary that did not have organic taclane as result analog units were resourcedwith two taclane one from the fielded ikss and an additional taclane from one of thespare systems ostensibly this created capability shortfall if the brigade ever had to employ thespare ikss terminals early in the development and training of the ikss the brigade began theprocess of obtaining accreditation of the ikss network for siprnet and niprnet traffic theprimary issue in regard to encryption was kg175 providing bulk encryption for tacticalnetwork over commercial circuit after working with theater and the defense informationsystems agency disa to validate the security protocol and acknowledgement of thecenter for army lessons learned 6 for official use onlytaclane as primary encryption standard the brigade was approved to exercise the ikss in theater once

each tt facilitated four voice overip voip red side phones hosted off of the brigade subscriber node bsn and an orderwireline though the ikss provided immense capability to the battalions the actual data that passedthrough gateways out of the brigade was predicated on what was being provided from higherheadquarters this issue along with vantage inconsistency and problems with mobile subscriberequipment mse call outs and link stability resulted in initial questions about ikss by brigadeleadership as to whether it was operating as advertised this perception was solely based on thesystems that facilitated interbrigade network connectivity mse vantage and not necessarilythe ikss what must be understood is ikss is transmission medium and data path that isdependant on the network that is being passed to other customers in the network once the vantage and mse stability improved and the capability of the system fully realized the brigade fully endorsed ikss as the most valuable upper tactical internet asset fornetwork access and the war fighter early in deployment the brigade worked with peoc3t todevise sanctuary ikss node outside of the brigades battle space given the mobility of thebrigade and the changing mission sets placing mrt in camp doha kuwait connected to adeployable ku earth terminal system dkets would provide siprnet on demand to tts aswell as

the brigade to receivesiprnet connectivity external of mse theater assets and significantly improved the speed andreliability for the brigade overall the ikss has been the biggest c2 force multiplier within thebrigade and has demonstrated capability that must be included for all followon sbcts as wellas signal transformation architectures the brigade successfully demonstrated the feasibilityviability and flexibility of ikss for any unit operating in noncontiguous battle space the useof commercial satellite networks lessens the impact upon military satellite networks and in somecases can provide cleaner more reliable footprint in an ao being the first unit to everreceive and utilize ku satellite system to the extent the brigade did and the speed at which itwas developed and deployed there were several recommended changes that the brigade hasnoted specific to ikss all systems should be fielded with e100 model taclane and thepotential incorporation of advanced encryption standard aes cisco routers such aconfiguration may negate the need for second taclane for tunneling nipr as is the currentconfiguration using an aes router could potentially facilitate niprnet path directly fromrouter to router and single taclane would tunnel the siprnet each ikss terminalprovides four twowire voip phones for voice services as the deployment progressed it wasevident

sbct battle staff used the fbcb2 component of the abcs as its primary way of distributing operational products across the battlefield the battle captain stated the primaryreason for using fbcb2 to disseminate the products was because eventually the product wouldbe sent down to the stryker vehicle to execute the mission and therefore this process became thestandard the battle ncos explained that the units were directed to adhere to certain procedureswhen sending the products especially overlays bandwidth limitations caused overlays to be sentin layers or in pieces in order to make it through

therefore the ttp of sending the overlays to the brigade fbcb2 firstwas adopted the brigade staff would make the necessary color changes on the fbcb2 box andthen disseminate the overlay to the appropriate individuals the battle captain also explainedthat if the staff had to create an overlay to disseminate they would do it on mcs because of theease the mcs software lends to developing overlays they would then revert to sending theoverlay to the brigade fbcb2 for color adjustments and for final dissemination the brigadereallocates fbcb2 systems from within their organization and equips nondigital units that areattached to the brigade this gives nondigital units the capability to communicate within thebrigade via fbcb2 loss of capability using this method was not factor

casein mosul counterfire operations need not be aimed solely against the mortar crew but moreagainst the reconnaissance elements that lay in the tubes and the trains the crew in addition thebrigade believes that the exploitanalyzedisseminate portion of the targeting process must bepractice more at the combat training centers ctcs for this type of operating environment the majority of mortar attacks are harassment with one to three rounds fired most attacks are not on target the brigade has discovered that the reason most enemy attacks are inaccurate isbecause of the expedient firing techniques use such as firing from vehicle and the skill level oftraining for the operator this could explain the delays between attacks after countermortarmission as antiiraqi force trainers are recruiting and retraining new members insightslessons learned while the roe restricts indirect fires within mosul it does not restrict the use of other nonlethal and lethal fires countermortar operations are constant adjustment by the brigade to adapt to theenemys ttps antiiraqi forces are using second tier personnel to execute mortar fires and first tierpersonnel to train and equip them which is large factor in the ineffectiveness ofenemy mortar fires most if not all countermortar operations arrive too late to achieve desired the effectsbecause the antiiraqi force are capable of displacing within 30 seconds of firing the mere presence of coalition forces will cause the enemy to move to anotherlocation and force him to repeat his process of target selection and delivery the best way to catch mortar team is not after they have fired but by catching themin their homes dotmlpf implicationrecommendation officer training at mos producing courses for intelligence soldiers

observation convoys are the most vulnerable us targets for the antiiraqi forces aif discussion the support vehicles arrived in theater woefully inadequate for the evolving threat the brigade support battalion bsb has greatly beefedup their vehicles to combat thisevolving threat the bsb has been able to acquire some tardec armor kits for different vehiclesand has fabricated steel plated armor for all other vehicles that leave the wire they have made ahalfring armor plate for their gunners their suggested improvement for the tardec armor isbigger windows than the 12inx12in windows that limit visibility only the gunner can fight in amoving battle because of the window size the windshields of all vehicles need to be armoredfor 762mm all doors on the vehicles need to open and close securely and easily crewservedweapons of choice are the m2 and m240b the reason for the mix is to balance the heavyfirepower of the m2 with the quicker more accurate m240b the bsb has purchased riot styleface shields that can stop 762mm rounds protective armor products part number702mtdriver vision enhanced dve is must in all vehicles because of dust and sand headsets forgunners are combat multiplier and life saver as the gunner cannot hear commands from thoseinside the vehicle during fight double stack radios are must to ensure the convoy has thecapability to communicate with their parent unit as

support battalion bsb convoys discussion local national trucks and operators are contracted to supplement bsb assets their protection resides in the fact that they are part of the us convoy their trucks are not armored orarmed and are not as fast or agile as us tactical vehicles there has been at least one instancethat the local national jumped out of his vehicle and left it during fight recovery operationsare difficult since our equipment is not designed for recovery of these local nation civiliantrucks insightlesson learned the use of local national trucks can be great logistic

maintenance and has pushed resupply convoys to corps units in the ao when thethreat was too high for the csb the bsb relies heavily on aerial resupply to elements outsideof the fob as often as is practical the sherpa has been huge logistic multiplier insightlesson learned since the csb is not ssg or eab they are not in direct support of the brigade and therefore the brigade is not always csb
