encouragement to help increase pressure on iran to change course saudi mfa undersecretary for multilateral affairs prince turki bin mohamed bin saud alkabeer requested us recommendations on specific actions saudi arabia could take ref washington would like to provide the following nonpaper to the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa which contains suggestions on how to further enhance saudi arabias nonproliferation efforts with regard to iran 3 on october 16 2008 the financial action task force fatf issued its fourth warning of the serious threat posed by irans lack of sufficient antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing regime ref b during the same plenary meeting fatf also separately issued guidance on the steps that countries should take to implement unscr 1803s call for vigilance over the activities of financial institutions in their territories with all banks domiciled in iran in order to avoid such activities contributing to proliferation sensitive nuclear activities or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems these two actions by the fatf combined with the already widely held view that iranian financial institutions play key role in irans proliferation efforts merit immediate action by countries to mitigate these illicit finance risks objectives 4 srel sau washington requests embassy riyadh approach prince turki or other appropriate senior ksa officials to discuss this issue and provide us recommendations post should pursue the following objectives present the nonpaper at paragraph 5 to ksa officials urge host government to issue public statement that advances the october 2008 fatf statement on iran and encourage all regional partners to do the same encourage host government to carefully monitor any financial and commercial activity with iran within ksa to ensure that iran does not pursue illicit transactions via the ksa encourage host government to use its influence in the gcc to invigorate further actions by regional partners to enhance vigilance over financial and commercial activity with iran as is called for by the financial action task force and unscrs 1737 1747 and 1803 nonpaper 5 srel sau begin nonpaper for saudi arabia during acting assistant secretary patricia mcnerneys visit to saudi arabia on 15 october 2008 she raised the issue of irans nuclear program and the need to increase pressure on the iranian regime to address international concerns surrounding its nuclear activities undersecretary for multilateral affairs prince turki bin mohamed bin saud alkabeer requested suggestions on steps the kingdom of saudi arabia could take in this regard we believe your government should consider taking action on the following key priorities national financial measures export control implementation express resolve on the iranian threat and full implementation of unscrs particularly 1803 your vigilance thus far demonstrates your governments recognition that real action must be taken to protect the regions security by preventing iranian proliferation we believe that if your government implemented the actions suggested in this paper it would not only allow you to exercise influential leadership with regional neighbors it would significantly increase the pressure on iran to cooperate with the international community and address its concerns we would like to present to you the following recommendations and the united states is prepared to work with the ksa to assist with the incorporation of these measures into saudi arabias nonproliferation system national financial measures we urge the saudi government to issue public statement that advances the october 2008 financial action task force fatf statement on iran the saudi statement should recommend heightened vigilance and the implementation of preventive measures per fatfs october statements by all countries with respect to the financial transactions with iran given the significant vulnerability that iran poses to the international financial system statement like this from your government would send clear message to your gcc partners that the risk arising from iranian banking transactions is real and that action must be taken to protect the regions banking system and prevent iranian proliferation on october 16 the fatf issued its fourth warning of the serious threat posed by irans lack of sufficient antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing regime in contrast with prior fatf actions on iran this statement marked significant escalation in concern about the terrorism finance threat emanating from iran and ratcheted up the call for preventive measures that should be implemented by fatf members and other jurisdictions to protect their financial sectors from this risk during the october plenary meeting fatf also separately issued guidance on the steps that countries should take to implement united nations security council resolution unscr 1803s call for vigilance over the activities of financial institutions in their territories with all banks domiciled in iran in order to avoid such activities contributing to proliferation sensitive nuclear activities or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems iran uses deceptive tactics and front companies to disguise its proliferation activities the us recommends that saudi arabia highlight this fact with its domestic businesses and gcc partners we also recommend that you reduce saudi arabian industries corporation sabic activities in irans petrochemicals market the us also proposes that saudi arabia suspend irangcc free trade area talks until iran accepts the p5 1 incentives package us executive order eo 13382 is an authority that allows the us to block the assets of wmd proliferators and their supporters and thereby deny them access to the us financial and commercial systems the us recommends that saudi arabia explore the creation of similar legal authority export control implementation saudi arabia should begin work on drafting comprehensive export control law and adopt comprehensive control list that meets international standards including the standards set by the four multilateral export control regimes australia group missile technology control regime nuclear suppliers group and wassenaar group comprehensive export control system will give saudi arabia the ability to ensure that its trade is secure and will encourage high technology investment the united states is prepared to support saudi arabia in this regard including through our export control and related border security exbs program express resolve on the iranian threat saudi arabia should exercise leadership with neighbors in the region and publicly by expressing concerns about irans continued pursuit of nuclear weapons capability and destabilizing activities in the region we would appreciate public expressions of support for the p5 1 dual track process including encouragement for iran to accept the incentives package saudi arabia should exercise its influence with china in particular to persuade china to reduce its growing energyeconomic cooperation and weapons purchases such efforts by china run contrary to the spirit of the unscrs and the p5 1 dual track strategy high level saudi delegation could communicate to china saudi concerns about the threat posed by irans actions full implementation of unscrs full implementation of unscrs 1737 2006 1747 2007 and 1803 2008 through vigilance and action against irans efforts to circumvent sanctions are key components to maintaining pressure on iran useful step would be for ksa to vigorously implement unscr provisions such as freezing financial assets and imposing travel restrictions on designated entities and individuals prohibit dualuse exports call for inspections of irisl and iran air cargo shipment and exercise vigilance over any activities of financial institutions in ksa with iranian domiciled banks as reference
