master monograph rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandami 25 know thyself and thou shalt know the universe and the gods 2007 supreme grand lodge of the ancient mystical order rosæ crucis 005 published by the grand lodge of the english language jurisdiction amorc inc 07072mandamus 2 concurrence since this monograph is devoted to the history of ur order we will now quote from rosicrucian history and mysteries by christian rebisse as the history of rosicrucianism fits into that of western esotericism it is important to emphasize what underlies this concept the adjective esoteric comes from the greek word esoterikos which is derived from within and eis into the word literally means toward the inter ior and describes that which is not directly accessible it evokes the cept of moving toward the center the interior thus esotericism is the know ledge of that which relates to internal things of which the intellect can touch u pon only to certain extent in short it involves gnosis knowledge that ads to transformation regeneration of the soul furthermore as shown by antoine faivre esotericis m constitutes more way of approaching matters rather than body of defined doctrines its fundamental elements such as alchemy magic strology kabbalah magnetism and various spiritual techniques with wh ich it is associated are not readily apparent it has been pieced together s lowly has penetrated the west gradually and has been subjected to various i nfluences our study will thus lead us to places of its birthmythical and re aland to those countries and times through which it has traveled therefore we will visit egypt greece the arab lands europe during the middle ages rena issance and age of enlightenment france of the belle époque and the new world while on our journey we will meet such extraordinary individual s as hermes trismegistus marsilio ficino giordano bruno john dee theophra stus paracelsus franz anton mesmer joséphin peladan harvey spencer lewi snot to mention someone as unexpected as erik satie we will also c ome across numerous initiatory organizations that have played more or less important role in western esotericism or in the rosicrucian movement christian rebisse rosicrucian history and mysteries3rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 2 dear fratres and sorores before beginning the systematic study of the rosicr ucian teachings we feel it would be useful to give you general notion of the traditional and historical dimension of the order you have just joined such glimpse will enable you to have better grasp of amorcs place in the world f esotericism first of all you should know that the initials amorc are an abbreviation of the full current title of the rosicrucian order whose name in english is the ancient and mystical order rosae crucis in certain texts and documents in our archives it is designated by letters that ar an abbreviation of the latin name that the order had in the pastnamely antiquus arcanus ordo rosae rubeae et aureae crucis which literally means ancient arcane order of t he red rose and of the golden cross as for the traditional symbol of amorc it consists of golden cross with single red rose in the center as far as one may go back in time this symbol has been the same and will remain so forever the golden cross represents the human physical body and the red rose represents the soul on the path of evolution it is not religious in character there exist certain number of variations of the symbol of our order amorcs history amorc is not philosophical movement of recent creation rather its tradition has its origins in the mystery schools of ancient egypt as its name implies these ancient schools brought together enlightened mystic s who met regularly to study the mysteries of life eager for knowledge an d wisdom these mystics aspired to greater understanding of natural univ ersal and spiritual laws in ancient timesin the time of the ancient egyptia n greek and roman civilizationsthe word mystery did not have the meaning it has today in other words it was not synonymous with weird or strange it referred instead to gnosis secret wisdom known only to the initiates in ancient egypt one of the first mystery schools was the osirian school its teachings concerned the life death and resurr ection of the god osiris they were enacted as theatrical pro ductions or more accurately as ritual dramas only those p ersons who had proved their sincere desire for knowledge could participate 4rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 2 over the centuries the mystery schools added grea ter initiatory dimension to the knowledge they transmitted their mystical l abors then assumed more closed character and were held exclusively in templ that had been built for that purpose according to the rosicrucian teaching s the great pyramids of gizeh were the most sacred in the eyes of the initi ates thus contrary to what most historians claim these pyramids were not cons tructed to serve as tombs for the pharaohs they were places of study and mys tical initiation the initiations in the egyptian mysteries included final phase in which the candidates experienced symbolic death lying in sarcophagus and maintained by mystical processes in an intermed iate state they had the opportunity to experience momentary separation betw een the body and soul this separation was intended to show them that they were indeed dual beings after experiencing this the candidates could nger doubt that humans possessed spiritual nature and their destiny was to return to the divine kingdom after having made the promise to never rev eal this initiation and after having committed themselves to follow the pat h of mysticism they were gradually instructed in the most esoteric teachings that mortal can receive the mystical pharaohs rosicrucian tradition relates that pharaoh thutmose iii 15041447 bce considered by histori ans to be one of the greatest rulers of the 18th dynasty was one of the initiates who attended the mystery schools of egypt during this period t he schools functioned in completely independent way and had their own rule s after having been designated by the lectorpriests to succeed his fat her on the throne thutmose iii decided to bring all of these schools together into single order governed by one set of rules so as to create unique organ ization due to his intelligence and wisdom he was chosen grand master and held thi s office until his death it should also be noted that he was the first ruler to bear the title of pharaoh which is of great significance on the mystical leve l about seventy years later pharaoh amenhotep iv was born in the royal palace at thebes admitted at an early age into the order founded by thutmose iii he became grand master and devoted himself to structuring the teachings and rituals meanwhile he officially established m onotheism in an era when polytheism had spread over the face of the earth and he changed his name to akhnaton which ans pious toward aton akhnaton encouraged revoluti on in 5rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 2 the fields of art and culture profoundly humanisti c he dedicated his whole life to fighting against the darkness of ignorance and to the promotion of the loftiest ideals shortly after his death which occurred in 1350 bce the powerful clergy of thebes reinstated the cult of am on however akhnatons work was already permanent part of history from egypt the order spread to greece notably thr ough the intermediary of pythagoras 572492 bce then into ancient rome under the impulse of plotinus 203270 ce it was during charlemagne s time 742814 and due to the work of the philosopher arnaud that the order was introduced into france and then into germany england and th netherlands during the following centuries the alchemists and templars contributed to its spread both in the west and the east as fr eedom of conscience was often lacking the order concealed itself under various names and conducted its activities under the veil of secrecy however it remained extant perpetuating its ideals and teachings participatin g directly or indirectly in the advancement of the arts sciences and civiliza tion in general and always extolling the equality of men and women and true co mmunity among humans cyclical resurgence in certain works discussing rosicrucian history reference is made to an individual by the name of christian rosenkreuz 13781484 as being the founder of the rosicrucians this is mistake in reality the order had already been i n existence for centuries however it functioned according to cycles of activ ity followed by periods of inactivity as the time approached for the orders resurgence arrangements were made for the announcement of the opening of tomb in which the body of grand master crc would be found w ith rare jewels and manuscripts that empowered the discoverers to proce ed with the orders revival for new cycle of activity this announcem ent was allegorical and the initials crc did not designate living individu it is in the light of these explanations that we need to consider the legendary christian rosenkreuz and his history it was in the 17th century that the order came out of its anonymity following the publication of three manifestos in germany and in france these were the fama fraternitatis 1614 the confessio fraternitatis 1615 and the chymical wedding of christian rosenkreuz 1616 these three manifestos blending stories 6rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 2 both historical and allegorical were written by college of rosicrucians the tübingen circle that included johann v alentine andreae 15861654 few years later in 1623 posters originating from the principal college of the rosecross were posted on the walls of paris this marked the beginning of new cycle of the order which was then publicly kno wn as the order of the rose cross in 1693 under the leadership of grand master johan nes kelpius 1673 1708 rosicrucians from different european countri sailed for the new world on board the sarah maria early in 1694 they reached philadelphia and settled down few years later some of them m oved farther west in pennsylvania and founded new colony after establ ishing their own print shop they issued large number of masterpieces of exoteric literature and introduced the rosicrucian teachings to america it was also under the impulse of european rosicrucians that many american institu tions were established and unprecedented contributions were made to the wo rld of arts and sciences in the united states such eminent individuals as b enjamin franklin 17061790 and thomas jefferson 17431826 were i n close contact with this rosicrucian work amorcs current cycle in 1801 the order became inactive in the united states however it remained very active in france germany england switzerland spain russia and the east in 1909 harvey spencer lewis 18831939 who had been student of esotericism for many years and who was particularly interested in rosicrucian philosop hy traveled to france in order to meet officials of the order after submitt ing to numerous examinations and various trials he was initiated in toulouse an d officially charged with preparing for the reactivation of the rosicrucian rder in america just as world war i was about to begin in europe when everything was ready for this reactivation manifesto was issued in the united states announcing new cycle of activi ty for the order which was then given the name ancient and mystical order rosae crucis amorc duly appointed imperator h spencer lewis develope d the activities of the order in america and began to put the rosicrucian t eachings in writing drawing on the archives that had been ntrusted to him by the rosicrucians of france after world war ii this method was extended to the entire world thus amor c 7rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 2 became the guardian of the rosicrucian tradition in all countries where it can freely exercise its activities in 1990 christian bernard then amorc grand master of france was elected by the supreme council to the office of imp erator and to the present day he assumes responsibility for rosicrucian activ ities in the world he is assisted in this task by the grand masters of

rubeae et aureae crucis amorc is not designated as an association lectoriu m society circle or in other similar terms the traditional symbol of amorc consists of golde n cross with single red rose in its center on the traditional level amorc dates back to the m ystery schools of ancient egypt and is connected with the pharaohs thutmose iii and akhnaton on historical level it was in the 17th century t hat the rosicrucians became known to the public with the publication of the three manifestos entitled fama fraternitatis 1614 confessio fraternitatis 1615 and the chymical wedding of christian rosenkreuz 1616 in the present day amorc is considered to be heir to the rosicrucian tradition and is found throughout the worldnotes 1112mandamus 3 concurrence as amorc favors freedom of consciousness its teach ings are not dogmatic or sectarian in character they are propos ed to members as the basis for reflection and meditation with the aim of pass ing on to them traditional knowledge that contributes to their spiritual unfol dment thus the ultimate goal of initiatic development is to reach the rose croix state it is important to emphasize here that the words rosicrucian and rosecroix do not have the same meaning in amorc the first designates an indi vidual who studies the orders teachings and philosophy whereas the secon d indicates an individual who at the end of this study has attained perfect ion in the sense of being wise in his or her judgments and behavior it is to this state of wisdom that every rosicrucian aspires christian rebisse rosicrucian history and mysteries13rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 3 dear fratres and sorores having presented the general outline of our orders tradition and history we will now give you glimpse of the subjects you will study as part of your affiliation ou will thus be able to measure the xpanse of knowledge to be transmitted to you within the four sections of our teachings the postulant section at present you are in the postulant section this section which includes only eight monographs consists of general presentation of our tradition and of the history nd teachings of our order the goal of this presentation is to familiarize you with rosicrucianism it also includes the study of the very first subjects that shall be brought to your attentionnotably time space and consciousness m oreover you will learn the technique of meditation as practiced by rosicru cians the neophyte section we then come to the neophyte section which represents the symbolic antechamber of the ro sicrucian temple indeed this section constitutes an introduction to the subjects presented in the following sections also called the atrium it consists of three degrees each of which is preceded by an initiation that you may perform in your home this initiation does not assume religious or magica l characteristics here is summary of the subjects that you will study in each of these three atriums the first atrium involves general study of matter which is the manifestation of an energy given the name of spirit in the teachings of our order it also includes series of monographs deal ing with thought and certain mental faculties such as concentration and visuali zation to mention only the most important the second atrium consists of an introduction to lfhealing in this atrium we explain the origin and nature of most dis eases afflicting humanity moreover the method by which we apply rosicrucian treatments is presented this method being founded on positive or negative stimulation of certain sympathetic ganglia of the autonomic nervous system the third atrium is devoted to general examinatio n of doctrines concerning the concept of god early religions the origin and nature of the human soul in this atrium are also p resented the great laws governing our spiritual evolutionno tably free 14rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 3 will karma and reincarnation the study of this d egree ends with explanations concerning the way in which rosicrucians conceive c osmic masters and the place they occupy in creation the initiate section as indicated by its name the initiate section marks an important stage because it permits access to the inner circle of our order it includes nine degrees called temple degrees each of which is dedicated to major theme of rosicrucian ontology moreover beginning with this section rosicrucian may go to lodge nd be truly initiated into our tradition it takes sixteen months to reach the first of these degrees the first temple degree reveals the fundamental law s governing the macrocosm and the microcosm it constitutes synth esis of what the mystics of the past particularly the philosophers of ancie nt greece taught on the subjects of the origins of the universe the vibrat ions of the ether and the atomic structure of matter this synthesis includes the most recent scientific data available in this field the second temple degree deals with human conscious ness its objective subjective and subconscious phases are the object of an indepth study allowing clear understanding of what psychologist s teach on the subject of mental faculties nevertheless it should be not ed that the concepts are approached within the context of rosicrucian philos ophy and consequently provide explanations transcending those offered by the field of psychology the third temple degree is dedicated to the laws of life it is shown that these laws as manifested on the earthly plane ori ginate in single cosmic energy vital life force we also explain that the mineral plant animal and human kingdoms form natural chain which supports the evolution of the universal soul after defining criteria common to ll living creatures we then go on to study human life the fourth temple degree is based entirely upon an ancient rosicrucian manuscript while constantly referring to precepts expressed in this manuscript this degree constitutes synthesis of the three pr evious degrees and deals with inspiring philosophical subjects generally speakin g this degree makes it possible to understand how matter consciousness and life form coherent whole and j ointly contribute to cosmic evolution15rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 3 the fifth temple degree is an account of the life nd work of the greatest philosophers of ancient greece its goal is to fami liarize rosicrucian students with the teachings of the scholars of greek antiqui ty and with the legacy of philosophical and scientific precepts which have ways fascinated humanity all of the monographs of this degree are taken from the archives of our order and refer to littleknown historical facts the sixth temple degree is dedicated to rosicrucian therapy and provides rules to be followed so as to maintain good health however the great distinction of this degree is the study of mystical principles that have been used by rosicrucians for centuries to treat those diseas from which we suffer these principles which in way represent subst itute for official medicine are part of the heritage provided by the ancient senes they are based on magnetism and the method of working upon the autono mic nervous system of humans which directs and controls the activity of all the organs of the body the seventh temple degree deals with the psychic bo dy of humans and with the functions characterizing it among whi ch are included psychic projection also called astral travel this degr ee also includes thorough study of the human aura and of the psychic centers many of which correspond to what are called chakras in eastern traditions there follows detailed examination of the traditional vowel sounds mantras and the physical psychic and spiritual influence they exert over hu man beings the eighth temple degree concerns the origin and stiny of humans the subjects that are studied directly concern our spiritual evolution included among these subjects are the concept of god the u niversal soul the human soul and its attributes the beforelife the myste ry of birth the application of free will karma and the method of mastering it the mystery of death the afterlife reincarnation assisting the dying and the power of prayer the ninth temple degree completes the initiate sect ion the first half is devoted to the study of traditional symbolism an d the mystical principles relating to it the second half discusses practices that have always attracted the adepts of mysticism radiesthesia telekinesis vibroturgy telepathy materialization invisibility cosmic harmonization etc it is in this degree that rosicrucians are initiated into th ose faculties which appeal to the soul itself and which allow us to benefit from our divine nature16rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 3 the illuminati section we cannot reveal anything regarding the contents of the illuminati section within the scope of this monograph as it would be premature and contrary to the initiatic ch aracter of our order ou only need to know that it is composed of three degr ees each of them being dedicated to the study of profoundly esoteric subje cts moreover this section contains mystical experiments that are of the highe st importance on both the psychic and spiritual planes if you persevere on the rosicrucian path the day will come when you will gain access to the teachings of these three higher degrees ou have probably wondered about the origins of the rosicrucian teachings as we explained in the last monograph they have th eir source in the mystery schools of ancient egypt to the wisdom perpetuated by the sages of that land were added the concepts transmitted by the gre at philosophers of ancient greece especially the neoplatonists then the sec ret gnosis was enriched by the alchemists of the middle ages and the thinkers of the renaissance such as nicholas flamel cornelius agrippa paracelsus pico della mirandola leonardo da vinci and john dee in the 17th centur eminent rosicrucians defined and developed certain aspects of this ancie nt heritage included among them were francis bacon michael maier robert flud d elias ashmole and comenius other important individuals were members of the order or were in contact with it these include jacob boehme ren é descartes baruch spinoza isaac newton wilhelm leibniz benjamin fr anklin the comte saintgermain cagliostro louisclaude saintma rtin michael faraday papus claude debussy erik satie and edith piaf since 1909 the beginning of amorcs present cycle other rosicrucians specializing in various fields of knowledge have so contributed to these teachings among them we naturally find those who have acted or are now acting in an official capacity in the order an d we also have members who as physicists chemists biologists psycholog ists physicians artists or philosophers work constantly for the cultural enri chment of rosicrucian knowledge we say cultural because the spiritual and initiatic dimension of the rosicrucian tradition is what it always has bee n and what it shall remain forever17rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 3 in the next lesson we will begin our study of the f irst subject presented in this sectionnamely time at this point we inv ite you to meditate on this subject and to jot down in your notebook any ideas that this meditation inspires in you with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class master practical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 18as shown by study of this monograph the teaching s of our order are truly thorough because they deal with every subject that is of interest to mystics they also contain many experiments intended to awak the mental psychic and spiritual faculties of our being they integrat all the knowledge that the initiates have conveyed to one another since ancien t egypt in this regard the rosicrucian tradition perpetuates to the present da the very foundation of the primordial tradition consequently the mere fa ct of being member of amorc constitutes great privilege indeed with l our heart we hope that you will prove yourself worthy of it and that you w ill honor the trust accorded to you as rosicrucian one of the first qualities that ou must acquire is none other than patience indeed there is great temptat ion to wish to progress rapidly on the path of knowledge however keep in mind that there can never be any shortcut in spiritual matters and that the rosicrucian teachings are founded upon progression taking into consider ation the different levels of human nature ou cannot hasten your progress wi thout acting contrary to the spiritual alchemy that will be gradually produc ed within you therefore be patient and never focus on what remains for you to study with each step on the rosicrucian path consider instead what you have already learned and assess the positive effects that your membership in the order has produced in your lifesummary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and ditate in coming days if any of the points are difficult to understand refer to the ex planations given in this monograph moreover we advise you to read this summary again immediately before your next sanctum period 19 the rosicrucian teachings are divided into four ctions the postulant section the neophyte section the initiate section and the illuminati section the postulant section consists of general presen tation of the tradition history and teachings of our order it also includ the first subjects of the rosicrucian teachings the neophyte section represents the symbolic antec hamber of the rosicrucian temple it is composed of three degrees and constitutes an introduction to the subjects treated in the followi ng sections the initiate section consists of nine degrees cal led temple degrees each of them being dedicated to major theme of rosicru cian ontology beginning with this section rosicrucian may join lodge and be truly initiated into our tradition the illuminati section consists of three degrees nd deals with eminently esoteric subjects furthermore this section contai ns mystical experiments of considerable importance on both the psychic and spiritual planes the rosicrucian teachings have their source in the sacred legacy that the order received from the ancient mystery schools ov er the centuries many philosophers mystics and scholars have enric hed this legacy with their own contributions20mandamus 4 concurrence in concurrence with this monograph we offer you quotation of sir francis bacon in the following lines he explains his conception of knowledge and the use that mystics should make of it at this stage in your rosicrucian studies we suggest that you meditate on their prof ound meaning the greatest error of all is mistaking the ultimate end of knowledge for some covet knowledge out of natural curiosity and inquisitive temper some to entertain the mind with variety and delight some for ornament and reputation some for victory and contention many f or lucre and livelihood and few for employing the divine gift of reason to the use and benefit of humanity thus some appear to seek in knowledge c ouch for searching spirit others walk for wandering mind others tower of state others fort or commanding ground and others shop for p rofit or sale instead of storehouse for the glory of the creator and the end owment of human life yet that which must dignify and exalt knowledge is the more intimate and strict conjunction of contemplation and action conjunct ion like that of saturn the planet of rest and contemplation and jupiter the planet of civil society and action and yet here by use and action we do not mean the applying of knowledge for lucre for that diverts the advanceme nt of knowledge as the golden ball thrown before atalanta which while sh stoops to take up the race is hindered francis bacon 1561162621rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 4 dear fratres and sorores from philosophical point of view there exist two methods for approaching the study of divine laws the first consists of ima gining what the supreme cause of the universe may be and using this idea s basis studying the way in which it is expressed on the terrestrial plane the second involves examining ourselves and using that examination as starting point in generalizing about the universal laws and principles which govern both our body and soul as you will note when studying the monographs rosi crucian philosophy is synthesis of these two methods because it ass ociates the study of humans with that of the divine sometimes rosicrucian phil osophy shows how to apply particular cosmic law to our life while at other times it makes evident the cosmic counterpart of principle that governs our being this process is truly mystical application of great hermetic w as below so above as above so below moreover such way of looking t human existence takes human duality into account in the postulant section we will provide you with general notion of what can be said concerning consciousness as it manifest s in humans in doing so we will consider two concepts which mystics and phi losophers contemplate namely time and space scientists have likewis interested themselves in the study of these two concepts however their approach is generally too materialistic they tend to regard time and space s material realities which humans can master only by having recourse to techno logy such point of view is inaccurate because it does not take into ccount the unlimited powers of human consciousness as we will show you in the course of our teachings it is within the innermost part of ourselves that t he means of transcending physical limits imposed upon us by the spatialtemp oral dimension of our existence are found if humans spend so much energy in attempting to quer time and space it is because our way of conceiving those two princ iples is erroneous to large extent it is because we are unaware that our potential intelligence could be put to more useful ends for our own benefit and for the benefit of all humanity accordingly we will demon strate to you that these two concepts are above all prod ucts of the objective consciousness of human beings and th at they 22rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 4 in way constitute the material obstacles to whic h many of us believe we are enslaved we do not wish to imply that we must behave as if t hese two principles exerted influence on our lives what we want you to understand is that it is possible to transcend these conditions and to fr ee yourself from numerous material constraints which exist only by virtue of the importance we grant them if we succeed in this you will have at your disposal solid philosophical base that will give your life direction more in k eeping with what it could be let us now examine in greater detail those poorly u nderstood concepts of time and space time we have noted that since the dawn of civilization human beings have always tried to understand what time is according to anthropologists the first point of reference used for that purpose was the ternation of day and night early humans began by associating the passing of ho urs with such natural manifestations as light and darkness this first ap proach to time was positive for it enabled humans to understand that phenomen on was involved which continued with regularity and against which we are powerless moreover it caused to be born in human consciousness primitiv idea of chronologyin other words the concept of the succession of hours and events one can say at what point human beings grasped t he meaning that is now given to the words yesterday today and tomorrow however when we gained access to these three major dimensions of our conscious life was radically transformed because life was now divided into the past present and future according an ever greater importance to the division of time human beings created various precise instruments for meas uring time so as to have at their disposal frame of reference enabling them t plan their daily activities more efficiently time became basic element of ou r existence to the same degree as the food we need to survive when we observe the hectic pace of modern living w have to admit that the race against time which humans have undertaken for centuries has not ceased to accelerate such state of affairs is fortunate for it is proof of our inability to master principle which should serve us rather than enslave us if all human beings were to give t this principle the proper place it deserves we would derstand 23rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 4 that as long as we adapt ourselves to the material idea we have formed of time we will stray from the natural laws which must guid our existence why because time is not material condition it is p roduct of human consciousness therefore it is impossible to master time except b calling upon our highest psychic and spiritual faculties experience proves that human beings constantly seek to conquer time by mundane and limited means by proceeding in this way we do nothing more than reinforce the power of our illusions we have just stated that time is not material dition it is product of human consciousness such remark deserves fuller explanation because it poses in itself the philosophical problem associate d with this subject let us then use few examples to illustrate this point when we must do something that is unappealing to us we have the impression that the hours do not move rapidly we s ay that time passes slowly on the other hand when we are engaged in some activity we find exciting we do not feel the passage of time and regret that we have to call halt to what we are doing yet in both cases th hours are always of the same mathematical duration in other words each ho ur will always equal sixty minutes this is proof that it is our consciousness that gives relative value to time thus when we are bored or unmotivated our i nner state is such that we feel that we are slaves to the passing hours when our emotional and mental activity is concentrated on subject that interest s us we lose all notion of duration and feel freed from the grasp of time the arbitrary nature of time is even more obvious w hen we sleep because we longer have any point of reference for measur ing it this explains why after having slept all night we may have the feeli ng of having slumbered only few hours likewise many persons having co out of deep coma which lasted several months have had the impressio n that their state of unconsciousness lasted only few days thus per iod of time depending on whether it is lived in state of wakefulness duri ng sleep or in deep coma is not interpreted in the same way by our consciousnes s this phenomenon is even more striking when we dream in this situation you are quite aware that we can experience events i n our dreams that would correspond to several hours or ev several days on the material plane yet it has bee n proven 24rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 4 scientifically that our dream periods do not exceed one or two minutes this example also demonstrates that the notion of time i s arbitrary as it does not always correspond to the usual meaning we assign to it it follows therefore that time as we usually ceive it is state of objective consciousness from the moment we transcend this st ate and pass the limits of conscious objectivity we lose all notion of dur ation that is what happens when we sleep or when for any other reason we are longer conscious of the earthly plane in this sense deep meditatio n can also make us lose all notion of time this is explained by the fact that our mental activity is situated on the subconscious level which by definition is part of the unconscious in future degrees we will show you how to rise volunta rily to that level and thus experience the nontemporal such an experience wil l prove to you that human beings can momentarily transcend the limits of time and have access to both the past and future of human history on the cosmic plane everything occurs simultaneously and constitutes an eternal present it is important to understand at this point that we ascribe such material value to time because we are in the habit of associ ating it with the rhythm that we give to our conscious lifethat is to acti vities which occupy our state of wakefulness and which to certain extent constitute the apparent movement of our existence from that point of view it has become point of reference which allows us to measure arbitrarily the periods when we are conscious of ourselves and our surroundings bu t beyond that point is world just as real world which has its source in cosmic eternity and that each of us possesses within our innermost self our mission is to explore this world because within it resides the basis of our xistence and the key to the mysteries we seek to understand in the next monograph we will continue our study by analyzing in more detail the concept of space because this concept i s directly connected with the concept of time meanwhile we advise you to re ad several more times the explanations given today and to record your com ments in your study notebook beyond the intellectual aspect of the pri nciples presented to you our teachings convey spiritual dimension that app eals to your innermost selfto the deepest levels of you r personality that is why you should not simply read the 25rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 4 monographs you should meditate on their contents in order to sow within yourself seeds that will in the course of time gi ve rise to the noblest of all fruits wisdom acquired from within with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class masterpractical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 26the major faculty enabling us to be conscious of the passing of time is none other than memory thanks to this faculty it is possible for us to retrace our past life we might think that the closer an event is to the present the more easily it returns to memory current experience proves that this is not so because the recall of memories is linked to the interest we took in events relating to them that is why we may recall facts dating back to our earliest childhood and yet be unable to recall some recent event from philosophical point of view this shows that what is important for our consciousness is not the passage of time but the experiences that made it possible for us to know and remember during the coming days we propose that you verify for yourself the cogency of these remarks by trying to trace the course of your own life and by noting the significant events you remember you will certainly note that many memories concern the earliest years of your existence and that you will recall them with as much precision and clarity as though they had only occurred few days ago such finding will show you that time as product of objective consciousness has effect on our inner life what matters instead are the experiences that have affected us on the innermost levelsummary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and ditate in coming days if any of the points are difficult to understand refer to the ex planations given in this monograph moreover we advise you to read this summary again immediately before your next sanctum period 27 from philosophical point of view there exist tw methods for approaching the study of divine laws the first sists of imagining what the supreme cause of all things may be and using t his idea as basis studying the way in which it is expressed in our ma terial existence the second method involves examining ourselves and usin g that examination as starting point generalizing from the entire u niverse the laws governing both our body and soul if human beings spend so much energy in attempting to conquer time and space it is because our way of conceiving thos two principles is erroneous it is also because we are unaware that ur intelligence could be put to more useful ends for both ourselves and for all humanity according to anthropologists the first point of r eference used by humans to divide time into segments was the alternation of day and night one can say at what point human beings grasped the meaning given to the words yesterday today and tomorrow however when we gained access to those three major dimensions of time our conscious life was itself radically transformed because life was now divided into the past present and future if all human beings accorded time the proper place it deserves we would understand that as long as we adapt ourselves to th materialistic concept we have formed of time we will be moving away from the natural laws which must guide our existence time as we usually conceive it is state of obj ective consciousness from the moment we transcend this state and pass th limits of conscious objectivity we lose all notion of duration28mandamus 5 concurrence rosicrucians feel deep admiration for emanuel swe denborg the great mystic and visionary of the 18th century in concur rence with this monograph which deals with space as well as time we propose that you meditate on what swedenborg wrote on this subject in his work entitl ed arcana coelestia as you will note his viewpoint is in accord with the rosicrucian conception of the duality of spacetimenamely that it involves concept specific to our earthly existence and to our objective perception f the material environment there are two things which while humans live in the world appear to be essential because they are proper to nature namel space and time hence to live in space and time is to live in the world r in nature yet in the other life these two things are of consequence in the worl d of spirits indeed they do appear to be of some consequence for the reason th at spirits fresh from the body still retain the idea of natural things yet i t is not long before they perceive that there is space and time there only state and that in the other life states correspond to spaces and times in nature to spaces states as to being esse and to times states as to coming forth existere from this any one can see what kind of an idea we may have while in the world or in nature respecting the things of the other life and many arcana of fai th namely that we are not willing to believe them until we apprehend them by means of the things in the world nay by sensuous things for we must suppose that if we were to put off the idea of space and time and still more space an d time themselves we would become absolutely nothing and thus we would have n othing left from which we could feel and think except something confused and incomprehensible when yet the case is exactly the reverse angelic l ife is of such nature as to be the wisest and happiest of all this is the reason why the word ages in the internal sense does not signify ages but states emanuel swedenborg 1688177229rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 5 dear fratres and sorores after having discussed time in the previous monogra ph we will now examine how human beings perceive space because th two concepts as you will find are closely connected we will retur n to these two subjects in future degrees however it is necessary for us to bring out their basic principles in this postulant section space space as defined in most dictionaries is the rel atively limited expanse separating and surrounding objects this ex panse according to current definitions is the source of the three dimensions which humans can perceive and which as you know are length width and heig htthe latter sometimes being likened to thickness such definition is in complete on the mystical level because it takes into account only visible s pace yet there exist invisible planes which for certain faculties of our consciou sness are as perceptible and real as our physical universe moreover even on th scientific level such manner of defining space does not correspond to an accurate description of the material world and of everything constituting it it is easy to show that knowing only the length wi dth and height of an object does not allow us to know its composition f or example if we ask you to imagine ruler approximately 20 cm 8 inches l ong 3 cm 138 inches wide and 2 mm 116 inch thick you will have c lear mental image of it however these specifications will not allow you to know whether the ruler is made of wood plastic or steel that is why ros icrucians have asserted for centuries that the different forms of matter being integrated in space occupy not three but four dimensionsthe fourth being defi ned by their vibratory frequency this point will be discussed in detail i n the next section in connection with the preceding remarks we will n ow emphasize principle to which we have not given enough attenti on which is that our sense of sight plays an essential role in the perception of space thus if we close our eyes when we find ourselves in an unfamiliar place we lose the notion of our surroundings to large extent this is the case be cause our understanding of space is gained mostly through those distances we p erceive between objects and ourselves this means that if we were incapable of evaluating the void separating us from objectswhet her by means of sight or by touch or hearingwe would hav conception of space it is precisely for this reaso n that we 30rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 5 need not only visible points of reference we also need tactile and audible ones to measure the distance between ourselves and what we perceive as you know we are constantly deceived by our perc eption of our surroundings our interpretation of space is itself subject to illusion for example when we look into the distance we have th impression that things are smaller and closer to one another than they are in reality we call this phenomenon perspective such an effect demonstrates quite well that the objects we see are not necessarily what they appear to be thus tree located about 2 km 114 miles away will seem small wher eas it may actually be ten or fifteen times your height this illusion is due to the fact that we do not see things as they are in reality but only as our mental faculties perceive and interpret them it follows that space like tim is state of objective consciousness therefore it is arbitrary and does not constitute reality that we can rely upon since consciousness is immaterial it follows that space is likewise immaterial in the absolute sense human beings make mistake by trying to conquer it with material devices or instruments thus when exploring interstellar space we have invented increasingly p owerful telescopes when penetrating cellular space we have perfected elect ron microscopes when mastering terrestrial space we have conceived vari ous increasingly rapid modes of transportation however the most powerful telescopes can never cover the whole universe likewise the most sophis ticated microscope can never fully perceive the immaterial essence impregn ating each cell at best it allows us to observe only few of its effects as for the various modes of transport humans have designed they have their own limits let us also note that they are used both to conquer space and to mas ter time it is precisely for this reason that astronomical distances are measure d in lightyears and average speed in kilometers per hour or miles per hour i n other words in spacetime units spacetime over the centuries human beings have been involved in veritable race against time it is obvious that suc h race is also challenge to the mastery of space because one of the greatest preoc cupations is to travel the maximum distance in minimum amou nt of time thus when we need to go to specific place we cannot help thinking of the duration of our trip because i t is often 31rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 5 important that we arrive as quickly as possible so as to carry out our plans as soon as possible because of this urgency we have gotten into the habit of longer living in the present moment but we are alw ays anticipating the future our obsession in designing ever faster cars trains airplanes and rockets is clear proof of this it is certain that we will suc ceed some day in traveling at record speeds and that we will succeed in exerting considerable control over the spacetime duality however from mystical po int of view we will not master it by resorting to science and technology b ecause only consciousness can transcend the limits that time and space impose upon the physical bodies of human beings just as it is possible for our consciousness to tra vel in time and to have access to the past and even to the future of human history it can likewise travel in space and project itself hundreds or thousands f miles from the place where we are located physically when we have taught you how to proceed toward this goal it will be just as easy for you to perce ive what is happening at this very moment in cairo jerusalem or new delhi as i t is to recall scenes that you experienced in your childhood such fact may seem incredible to you and yet it is included never theless among the mystical arts that initiates have used for centuries to accomplish their work in serving humanity and to co mmunicate with the invisible world naturally it requires the develop ment of certain faculties which transcend the possibilities of our objective self such an ability depends upon the transcendent powers of our psychic consciousness because this form of consciousness is unlimited in its perc eptions and can extend itself into infinity you will learn why and how in the higher degrees of your rosicrucian studies we hope that the study of this monograph and of the preceding one has made it possible for you to understand that time an d space do not constitute the basic elements upon which you must establish ur existence we cannot ignore the relative importance accorded them in dai ly life for it would be unreasonable for us to behave as though they wer only illusions of our mental apparatus however we can consider them as simply arbitrary points of reference made necessary by th fact that we are incarnated in physical body and we current ly live on the material plane from rosicrucian point of view 32rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 5 human beings possess spiritual dimension which ca n and must express itself independently of the constraints that time and spac usually impose upon our waking state in the next monograph we will return to human cons ciousness and we will see that its activities oscillate between two worldsthat of the objective consciousness and that of the subconscious such study will enable you to contemplate your existence in new light becau you will understand that human beings are not as limited as we often be lieve ourselves to be in our perception of the world we have at our disposa l extraordinary faculties which only need to be developed one of the major g oals of amorc is that of gradually teaching you the methods to follo w which will make this development effective and useful in your daily life with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class masterpractical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 33we have shown you in this monograph that space lik time is state of objective consciousness resulting from our sensory perceptions especially that of sight if for any reason we are deprived of th is sense touch and hearing then intervene to help us perceive our immediate rroundings ou will note that blind persons have highly developed tactile an d auditory sensitivity they likewise have at their disposal psychic vision th at is more fully developed than that of most sighted individuals this develop ment allows them to compensate for their blindness for cosmic intellig ence constantly seeks to come to peoples aid to prove to yourself that space and time are arbitr ary notions we propose that you perform the following two experiments as soon as you have the opportunity take short t rip which can be made either on foot on bicycle or by car when doing it for the first time cover the distance on foot and note all the impress ions which come to your consciousness then do it by bicycle and then by c ar if this is possible in the three situations you will note that the experiences were not the same why because your perception on each occasion differed whereas the distance traveled was exactly the same when you have the opportunity take short fifteen minute trip following these instructions first travel along road or p ath in straight line then travel for the same length of time only choose an agreeab and varied route that is if possible in an inspiring natural setting again note your impressions in both cases undoubtedly the second trip will seem shorte r than the first although the length of time is the same we advise you to conduct these two very simple expe riments because they will show you that our notion of spacetime is dependent upon the interpretation given to us by our consciousness matter what the distances and durations are in realitysummary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and ditate in coming days if any of the points are difficult to understand

width and height the latter sometimes likened to thickness for mystics there exists fourth dimension defined by the vibratory frequency of all material substances occupying space if we were incapable of evaluating the void separa ting objects we would have conception of space it is precisely for th is reason that we constantly need not only visible points of reference we also need tactile and audible ones to measure the distance between ourselves and what we perceive space and time are states of objective consciousne ss humans make the mistake of trying to conquer space and time by means of material instruments in daily life humans have become incapable of dis sociating time from space thus when we travel to particular place we cannot help thinking of the duration of our travel just as it is possible for our consciousness to tr avel in time and gain access to the past and future of human history it can lik ewise travel in space and project itself hundreds even thousands of miles
