of dcu indicated that the electronic data processing managem ent inform ation system s unit has created databa to assist dcu with the generation of workload statistics developed for 20062007 at the tim of issuing this report discussions were underway to ensure that the inform ation re quested would be quantifiable oios is of the opinion that the proposed 15 workload statistics reflect all the activities undertaken within dcu and would assist m anagem ent in reviewing dcu activities 17 the workload statistics should be supplem ented by the developm ent of indicators designed to m easure ef ficiency of activities and perf ormance against planned work and objectives in com bination with workload sta tistics these indicators would provide valuable inform ation on the adequacy of resources recommendation ¾ to assist in m onitoring how efficiently its resources are being utilised the ictr defence counsel unit should supplem ent existing workload statistics with indicators designed to m easure efficiency and perform ance against planned work and objectives rec 01 18 ictr commented that the defence counsel unit dcu of the defence counsel and detention management section dcdms is convinced that the workload indicators formulated for the 2006 to 2007 biennium b udget are adequate for measuring efficiency and performance against planned work objectives th new workload indicators have already been added to the statistics the challenge is the collection and compilation of the data and entering it into the database oios notes the response and recognises ictrs approach to perform ance based m anagem ent however the collection of workload indicators are the first step and perform ance indicators should now be develope d and used as benchm arks to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of work undertaken consequently oios will keep the 3 recom mendation open pending clarification whethe r ictr intends to develop perform ance indicators and if not why not c external reporting 19 oios was satisfied with the adequacy of arrangem ents for the collection verification completeness accuracy and tim eliness of the re ports produced in accordance with article 32 of the ictr statute the president subm its an nnual report of the ictr to the security council and the general assem bly an annual report ou tlining the activities and achievem ents of the unit is prepared

the biennium 20042005 and 20062007 and problem s were noted as inform ation provided was accurate and com plete appointment of defence counsel appointm ent of counsel 21 adequate m echanism s are in place to ensure that the suspects or accused are inform ed of their rights to defence counsel and legal aid on arrest of suspects or accused duty counsel are available to provide initial legal advice and advise the suspect or accused of his or her rights until counsel is engaged or is assigned by ictr in addition the detainee is also given kit containing the basic docum ents of ictr and the internal rules of undf b establishm ent of roster 22 dcu has m echanism s in place to ensure th at counsel on the roster m eet the criteria stipulated in the rules and directives howe ver arrangem ents for docum ent m anagem ent are weak such that ictr cannot easily dem onstr ate that the m echanism is working oios reviewed the qualifications and experience of 40 defence lawyers from 376 on ictrs roster to ensure that the counsel m et the criteria stipulat ed in rules 44 and 45 of the rules of procedure and evidence and articles 13 and 14 of the dir ective on the assignm ent of defence counsel it was noted that in approxim ately twelve cases even though originals were required by the application form for inclusion on the roster onl copies of certificates were found and there were m any inconsistencies and gaps in the info rmation provided oios is of the opinion that this was due to the f act that the f iles were badly docum ented there was organization in the filing of docum ents so that docum entation c ould be found random ly placed in any of the sections of the f iles oios f elt that greater ttention was required in organizing the inform ation in files as m issing docum ents could easily be undetected 23 although original docum ents are required to accom pany application form s oios felt that arrangem ents for entry on the roster c ould be further strengthened by perform ing and docum enting background checks this could also sim plify checking at later stage when counsel is assigned recommendations ¾ to enable ictr to dem onstrate that its roster is working as intended and to ensure the easy retrieval of docum ents and the efficient managem ent of the files the fence counsel unit should review the current filing system in add ition the developm ent of checklists 4 for all the docum ents required by the application form s would provide useful tool in records m anagem ent rec 02 24 ictr commented that dcu has two secretaries gs4 on gta who manage the dcdms registry these two have never had any filing training or experience in that field before they joined dcu and they n eed lot of training before they can operate efficiently as filing clerks dcu requested the judicial records and archives unit of the court management section to give them inhouse training but they felt that this was not useful for them dcu is negotiating with the training unit to see whether the two can join clerical training programme that is relevant to our needs in addition dcu will request for the appointment of filing clerk on gta for period of three months to assist in resolving the filing issue especially the indexing of all files especially the backlog it is expected that by end of june 2006 the filing problem will have been resolved finally dcu will intensify the use of checklists which were already developed for all documents required by the application forms oios is pleased to note that checklists have been developed for all docum ents required for the application form s and that ic tr intends to provide training for the filing clerks the recom mendation will be left open until oios receives an action plan for the efficient m anagem ent of the f iles within dcu ¾ to ensure that defence counsel are eligible to be on ictrs roster and to sim plify checking on assignm ent of case the defence counsel unit should ensure that background checks are undertaken and docum ented prior to entry of counsels details on the roster rec 03 25 ictr commented that dcu st ates that background checks are indeed taken routinely once counsel on the ictr roster is recomme nded for assignment as lead or cocounsel we have yet to find counsel who was not qualified to be on the list at the time of making recommendation to the deputy registrar c onsequently dcu will not have the time and resources to make rigorous background checks fo r counsel who may never be assigned to case at ictr considering its meager staff complement whilst appreciating that backgrounds checks are conducted oios is of the opinion that this initiative would be enhanced by docum enting these checks oios will close th recom mendation upon receipt of docum entary evidence of background checks m ade of defence counsel c maintenance of roster 26 oios was inform ed that the roster is updated regularly with new applicants however there were procedures in place for maintaining the list to ensure that counsel continue to be eligible for inclusion and that there were grounds for exclusion in addition there was evidence on the files to show that the national bar associations were contacted to verify the professional status of counsel on th roster oios was told that confirm ation was often done through em ails and telephone calls in the opinion of oios m ore form mechanism should be put in place in order that record of responses from the national bar associations could be placed on file and counsel should provide dcu with certificates of good standing on an annual basis to rem ain on the roster ictr commented that dcu agrees with this and on 03 january 2006 letter was transmitted to all counsel on the ictr registrars list of counsel that are eligible to represent indigent suspects or accused persons before the ictr that letter requested them to indicate whether they were still interested in remaining on the list in addition counsel who were interest ed in remaining on the list were requested to 5 provide original certified true copies of counsels practise certificates and letters of good character from their national bar associations or universities oios is very pleased to note the inform ation provided by ictr and in view of this additional inf ormation is not raising any recom mendation d choice of counsel 27 the choice of lead counsel is at the discretion of the accused and there was indication of interference in th process by ictr the accused or suspect usually chooses the lead counsel by subm itting three nam from the potential list of lawyers com piled by dcu and circulated internally for the choice of cocounsel the lead counsel subm its three nam to the head dcu the choice m ade by the accused and by the lead counsel is usually respected but it is at the discretion of the re gistrar in 2004 there were approxim ately two cases of rejection one regarding the selection of lead counsel and the other the selection of cocounsel the reasons for rejection were fully docum ented f assignment of counsel establishment of indigence 28 financial investigator was em ployed by ictr in 2003 to assist in establishing indigence there were arrangem ents in pl ace for the establishm ent and approval of the ceiling for indigence unlike icty who us form ula based on social and econom ic indicators to decide on the indigency of the accused ictr uses the financial threshold of us10000 which was recom mended by consulta nt in the general assem bly report a58366 com prehensive report on the progress m ade by the international crim inal tribunal for rwanda in reform ing its legal aid system oios is of the opinion there m ust be verifiable basis for the am ount used which should include the circum stance under which the amount should be changed recommendation ¾ to ensure an adequate basis for th ceiling ictr uses for indigency the defence counsel unit should establish arrangem ents for the establishm ent and approval of the ceiling used for indigence this should consider the current arra ngem ents used by icty based on social and econom ic factors rec 04 29 ictr commented that dcu states that the report containing the findings of the financial investigator will be studied so that the financial means at the disposal of the accused persons will be ascertained in add ition our counterparts in the hague will be contacted and if possible intertribunal coopera tion meetings should be made for first hand experience of how icty is managing their affa irs we would like to take this opportunity to underscore the sad fact that the financial investigator has not received the requisite support from member states where the accused pe rsons were arrested or where their families are residing moreover despite repeated reque sts the investigation travel budget has not been availed to the financial investigator however request will be made so that funds will be made available to enable the financial inves tigator to visit certain countries commencing with rwanda during the first half of 2006 this w ill enable him to collect the requisite data for use in deciding on ceiling for indigence it should be remembered that unlike icty detainees the ictr detainees were refugees mo st of whom were residing in other countries before they were arrested however review should be made by august 2006 oios notes

to be signed by all detainees but to date 57 of the 69 detainees have not signed the form and 14 of the 57 detainees have never signed declara tion of means f orm oios f elt that the cooperation of defence counsel should be sought to obtain the signatures of the detainees they represent recommendation ¾ to ensure that legal basis is established f or possible f uture contributions to the defence cost s by the accused the ictr defence counsel unit should seek the cooperation of defence counsel to obtain the signatures of detainees they represent on the declaration of means form rec 05 31 ictr commented that dcu agrees with th is recommendation and states that letter will be sent to all lead counsel by the end of february 2006 requesting for their cooperation in obtaining the requisite signatures from the detainees who have not yet done so oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation on receipt of docum entary evidence of discussions held with lead counsel and confirm ation that the declaration of means form has been com pleted by all detainees c confirm ation of assets 32 to date all accusedsuspects have been classi fied as indigent as difficulties have been experienced in getting tim ely feedback from the governm ent of rwanda to confirm the assets of detainees oios confirm ed that of the 18 requests sent by ictrs financial investigator to the governm ent of rwanda between apr il 2004 and august 2005 responses have been received an additional 14 requests are in the process of being finalised efforts by dcdms to make enquiries about the m eans of the accused suspects in the countries in which they were arrested have not been satisfactory the issu has been discussed in m eetings of senior managem ent with the special representative of the rwanda governm ent to ictr but there was indication of any followup action on decisions taken in the m eetings oios is of the opinion that ictr should be m ore proactive in following up on decisions taken in m eetings with the governm ent of rwanda and deadlines should be established for the im plem entation of decisions recommendation ¾ to ensure that decisions taken at m eetings and requests to the governm ent of rwanda are im plem ented the registrar should request the chief external relations and strategic planning section to develop m echanism for the followup action of pending issues 7 and the establishm ent of deadlin for their im plem entation any inaction on the part of the govern ment of rwanda should then be reported to the general assem bly rec 06 33 ictr commented that dcu agrees with this recommendation and looks forward to receiving copy of the said correspondence from the chief external relations and strategic planning section oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of details of the m echanism to be put in pl ace for the followup action of pending issues and the establishm ent of deadlines for their im plem entation d assignm ent of counsel 34 recom mendations on random assignm ent by th board of auditors and oios have been superseded by decision taken by the cham bers to the effect that although an accused does not have the freedom to choose counsel as an affording accused heshe has the right to counsel chosen from the roster however the system in place for the assignm ent of counsel needs to be strengthened currently if the accuse d is considered as indigent three nam of counsel chosen by the accused from the roster are subm itted in order of preference to the head dcu the qualifications and experience of counsel are reviewed by dcu and checks are perform ed to ensure that counsel is in good standing and have not been disbarred in their national jurisdiction recom mendation is then prepared by dcu through the

changed only on exceptional gr ounds request for withdrawal or change of counsel is m ade to the registrar by the accuse d acceptance or rejection of the request is at the discretion of the registrar and m ade in the interest of justice recommendation ¾ to ensure that there is form basis to prohibit the appointm ent of family m embers and close friends of suspects accused and counsel to act as counsel experts legal assistants investigators interpreters or translators unless the assignm ent is in the interest of justice ictr should consider an am endm ent to the directive on the assignm ent

defence counsel arguing that divu lging their travel details etc to dcu will reveal their defence strategy moreover we submit that when defence team members present their request for reimbursement of fees and reimbursement they provide the pseudonyms of the witness they visited the tim spent with himher etc we believe that requesting them to provide this information in the form of mission report which will not be reimbursable as it is b administrative w ill not go down well with th em dcu will request an amendment to be made to the requisite artic in the directive as per comments made to rec

there was however form mechanism in place to ensure that counsel were not assigned to accused at bot h tribunals oios felt that article 15a of the directive on the assignm ent of counsel which st ates that counsel shall be assigned to more than one suspect or accused should be ex tended to include assignm ent to suspects at icty recommendation ¾ to ensure there is form mechanism to identify whether counsel represent accused at both tribunals article 15 of ictrs directive on the assignm ent of couns which states that counsel shall be assigned to m ore than one suspect or accused should be extended to include assignm ent to suspects at icty or other international tribunal court in the interest of justice rec 13 53 ictr commented that they do not agree with this recommendation because the registrar is already taking this matter into consideration when assigning counsel moreover we have been informed that some lead as well as cocounsel are already assigned cases before the ictr icty special court for sierra leone as well as the icc we are considering what will be the effect for thos whose cases are actually in trial ictr questioned how changing this provision would affect them at

showed that the incidence of costs will be greatly reduced using the proposed system when com pared to the current system and that used by icty the lum p sum paym ent system at icty is based on three levels of lump sum depending on the com plexity of the case the proposed ictr lum p sum system takes into account fixed rem uneration for all j udicial activities and predeterm ines the num ber of m embers of the defence team to be involved in particular activity at the tim of the audit the system was being reviewed to addre ss few controversial points raised by counsel and for the final approval of the president the directive on assignm ent of counsel has already been am ended to provide the legal ba sis for lum p sum paym ent system as an alternative to the fixed hourly rate in the opi nion of oios with the introduction of the lum p sum paym ent system m echanism should be put in place to dem onstrate that savings will be made by using this system recommendation ¾ to dem onstrate that the planned lum p sum system allows ictr to make savings as com pared to the fixed hourly rate system with the implem entation of the proposed sy stem the defence counsel unit should introduce m echanism so that com parison could be m ade between the two system s the syst em should also be com pared to the one used at icty to ensure that the best practice is adopted by both tribunals rec 14 55 ictr commented that dcu agrees with this recommendation and we hope that approval will be granted in the near future for the lump sum system as proposed or an amendment thereof to be put in place it will be at that stage that dcu will introduce mechanism to enable us to make comparison of the two systems in addition it is hoped that intertribunal cooperation meetings with our counterparts in icty the hague will be authorised in 2006 this will enable us to have first hand knowledge of the actual savings if any that are being made in the icty lump sum system and make comparison oios notes
