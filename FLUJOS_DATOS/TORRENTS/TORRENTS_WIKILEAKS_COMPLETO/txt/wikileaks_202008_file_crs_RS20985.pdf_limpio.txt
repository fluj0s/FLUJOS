for federal forests ross w gorte natural resource economist and senior policy analyst resources science and industry division summary many forests especially the national fore sts are widely thoug ht to have unnaturally high amounts of dead and dying trees dens undergrowt h and dense stands of small trees this biomass can exacerbate insect and disease infestations and wildfire threats because much of this biomass has little or commercial value some have proposed stewardship contracting to reduce these threat s two approaches have been suggested traditional service procuremen t contracts and contracts that include exchanging goods timber for stewardship services congre ss authorized goodsfors ervices contracting through fy2013 by amending previous pilot program in the fy2003 omnibus appropriations law this report discusses the advantag and limitations of each of these approaches it provides background on the issue and is unlikely to be updated most us forests are in better condition than they were century ago however many forest ecosystems especially the national forests in the intermountain west are widely thought to be in poor health1 interest groups disagree over what constitutes healthy forest what has caused the current problems and what the solutions should be nonetheless most accept that high biomass accumulations dead and dying trees dense undergrowth and dense stands of small trees can contribute to catastrophic wildfires pest problems and lowe r biological diversity the nature and severity of these accumu lations vary depending on the ecosystems and past management of the sites in some forests eg sprucefir and lodgepole pine the problem may be widespread dead trees due to drought andor insects and diseases in others eg southern pines and western mixed c onifers the problem may be dense undergrowth of different species palmetto in th south firs in the west in still others eg ponderosa pine the problem may be st and stagnation too many small trees that are growing very slowly in all these cases biomass is accumulating to historically unprecedented levels but the nature nd level of excess biomass differshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20985crs2 2

forest service timber sale practices and procedures analysis of alternative systems the problem can best be seen and may be most ecologically threatening in forest ecosystems that evolved with frequent surface fi res which burned grass pine needles and other small fuels every 5 to 35 years eg southern pines and p onderosa pine depending on the site and plant species these ecosystems are adapted to the frequent surface fires where most large trees survive however unna turally high biomass levels can lead to stand replacement fires where most trees ar killed in addition small trees and dense undergrowth can create fuel ladders that can carry surface fires upward into the forest canopy changing them to uncontrollable stand replacement fires such fires are thought to have been rare in these forests before the 20th century considerable interest has been expressed in improving the health of forests especially the national forests2 salvage and other timber harvesting is often identified as means of reducing biomass and thereb improving forest health however substantial portion of the biomass that many believe should be removed3 is not of commercial value the small diameters and low quality effectively prevent using the material profitably for producin g lumber paper or energy for addressing the problem in federal forests many have suggested stewardship contrac ting as way to provide local jobs while improving forest health by cutting and removing or burning the excess biomass two basic approaches have been suggested 1 continuing the current approach of contracting to procure serv ices and 2 contracting to exchange goods for services traditional contracting to procure services procurement contracts are used by federal agencies to perform wide variety of tasks and could be used for many forest stewardship services typically contract proposal identifies the tasks to be performed the unmerchantable trees or underbrush to be cut and the treatment of the cut and possibly additional materials left as is piled and burned lopped and scattere d to accelerate rotting or for prescribed burning or even removed from the site it is also possibl though not commonly used to specify the desired resulting condition of the area to be treated rather than specifying the tasks to be performed currently federal agencies awar d contracts to the lowest bidder however congress could specify other factors to cons ider for example local employment or quality of bidders past performance in di recting or further authorizing procurement contracting for stewardship services in addition some have suggested that an commercially valuable material could be collected under procurement cont ract and sold separately at least by the forest service4 this approach commonly known as log sale s is common in europe and has been discussed sporadically for the national forests for at least 40 years the authorization for forest service timber sales so permits log sale s but the agency has not used this authority extensivelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20985crs3 5 kirsten m schmidt james p menakis colin c hardy wendel j hann and david l bunnell

national forests c ohesive strategy is needed to address catastrophic wildfire threats gaorced9965 washington dc april 1999advantages of traditional procurement contracting the principal advantage of using current cont racting methods for forest stewardship is that it is the system the federal agencies currently use for procuring most services it is simple straightforward approach wellknown to agen cy personnel and to the potential private contractors and numerous priv ate contractors exist to bi d on such contract proposals another advantage of using the current c ontracting system is the opportunity for congressional control nd oversight annual budget justifi cations for forest stewardship under the current structure or new structure designed to enhance oversight of federal forest stewardship could give congress way to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of agency efforts while the appropriations fo r such efforts could be targeted to areas of greatest need limitations of traditional service contracting one major limitation of using traditional service procur ement contracting for federal forest stewardship is the potentially enormous federal expenditures on such program the forest service has identified 36 million federal acres of frequentfire forest ecosystems and 39 million federal acres of other forest ecosystems as having high risk of significant ecological damage from catastrophic wildfires due to accumulations of excess biomass5 with treatment costs averaging about 300 per acre ranging from 100 to 10006 treating these 75 million acres could cost more than 20 billion possibly less but also possibly substantially more if the lands at modera risk of ecological damage from catastrophic wildfires another 90 million federal acres of frequentfire forest ecosystems and 66 million federal acres of other forest ecosystems are also to be treated the total cost for all 231 million federal acres could be around 70 billion suggested modifications to traditional rvice procurement contracting for forest stewardship could also hamper efforts at improving federal forest health using resulting desired conditions instead of tasks to be performed woul d probably best improve forest stewardship because it would focus on whats ft on the site rather than on the activities performed or on the biomass wood removed from the site however standardized measures of desired forest conditions for contracting or for reporting on agency stewardship efforts have b een developed making this pproach difficult to implement in addition proponents advocate separate log sales for any commercially valuable wood to be removed however log values often depend on how the log is cut log lengths and locations of major knots the independence of the service contractors from the potential log purchasers would be difficult to assure but important to avoi d possible conflictsof interest and the agency has little experience with log sales t hus traditional service procurement contracting has limitations for improving federal forest healthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20985crs4 7 see crs report rs20822 forest ecosystem health an overview pp 35 8 executive office of the president healthy forests an initiative for wildfire prevention and stronger communities washington dc aug 22 2002goodsforservices contracting most observers believe that to improve forest health it is necessary to combine various activities eg salvage sales with mixedspecies planting or prescribed burning after precommercial thinning7 because of this need and th high cost of many activities some have proposed different approach to contracting for forest stewardship trading goods commercially valuable timber for services other activities in the same area called land management service contracts stewardship contr acts endresults contracts and other terms these goodsfo rservices contracts are essen tially highly modified timber sales where timber purchasers are required to perform other typically related services eg precommercial thinning or watershed restoration and in return pay less for the timber harvested various federal laws prohibit federal agencies from retaining and using the receipts from selling assets eg from timber sales without cong ressional authorization few pilot tests of goodsforservices contract s were authorized in the fy1992 and fy1993 interior appropriations acts pl 102154 and pl 102381 respectively in 1998 congress established broader st of goodsforservices contracting section 347 of the fy1999 interior appropr

required that 14 of those contracts be traditional service contract s with separate log sales and would have required reports comparing the two approaches the differences could not be resolved and the final bill pl 107171 included provision on goodsforservices contracting following the severe 2002 fire season pr esident bush proposed goodsforservices stewardship contracting as way to reduce forest

flexibility and efficiency in the national forest timber sale program background materials washington continuedit authorized stewardship end result contracting through fy2013 it extended the program to blm lands as well as to the national forests it deleted demonstrati on from the provision it modified one of the identified go als to remove noncommercial from cutting or other objectives and it authorized the secretaries of agriculture and the interior to select acontracting officer without constraints 9 the goodsforservices demonstr ation projects and the gene ral expectations of the approach have been modified timber sale s to allow the agencies to impose nontimber harvesting requirements on the purchasers ho wever provision in the statute directly specifies commercial timber sales and harvesting rather the statute authorizes removing vegetation and applying the value of timber or other fo rest products removed to offset the cost of services received it is not clear whether stewardship contracts could be used in areas where commercial timber harvesting is prohibited by statute or administrative decision advantages of goodsfor services contracting one possible advantage of goodsforservices contractin g is greater efficiency and thus lower cost in forest stewardship activities the desired services may require some of the same equipment as timber harvesting and removal and the same personnel might be used for both tasks relying on the same equipmen t and personnel for multiple ta sks on site seems likely to reduce the total cost of performing the tasks thus one contractor and one contract for multiple related tasks that encompass both sale of goods and performance of services might be more efficient than multiple independent traditional contracts for the tasks some proponents also claim that goodsfo rservices contracting is beneficial b ecause it is offbudget financing for forest stewardship concerns over the adequacy of appropriations for forest stew ardship have led some to s earch for alternative funding mechanisms and goodsforservices contracting is one appro ach that has been proposed essentially the federal agencies would be able to buy stewardship services with timber assets as part of modified timber sale contracts instead of with appropriations limitations of goods forservices contracting one limitation of using goodsforservices contracts to improve forest stewardship may be higher contracting costs from combining several activities in one contract one observer noted that the forest service procedures for the pilot test s of goodsforservices contracting were complicated combination of traditional serv ice contracting with standard timber sale contracting the result is an extremely cumbersome process which requires more up front effort than if the ac tivities were done separately10 and thus higher costs than forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20985crs6 10 continued dc usda forest service oct 3031 1996 p 29 11

east provides the longerterm authorization another possible limitation is that in bypa ssing the annual appr opriations process goodsforservices contracting is likely to receive less congressional oversight and control other congressionally authorized federal offbudget financing mechanisms technically permanent appropriations of receipts for specific purposes such as the forest services knutsonvandenberg kv f und and brush disposal funds have received very little congressional oversight the agenci might be able to use goodsforservices contracting for many years with little or public pa rticipation in or congressional control over its use some interests have questioned the appropriateness of goodsforservices contracting generally observers have noted that exchan ging goods for services creates an incentive for managers to increase the sale of goods timber to generate valu to provide services eg precommercial thinning in another context the incentive to increase timber sales to generate value to provide services mitigating and enhancing other resource values in timber sale areas under the kv fund has been described as perverse incentives where managers support an allegedly environmentally damaging activity timber harvests to generate funds to be used for environm ental restoration incl uding to mitigate damage caused by generating the funds11 exchanging timber for forest stewardship activities might create similar incentives especially when the needed stewardship activities for wildfire protection involve cutting and re moving noncommercial woody biomass on or near the ground since timber harvesting exacerbate s the wildfire threat in the short run by bringing combustible and quickly decaying material such as tree limbs and tops to ground level in addition dominant or excl usive use of goodsforservices contracts would emphasize stewardship on lands with commercial timber and might limit the opportunities for stewardship on other fe deral forests that need treatment finally some observers have questioned whether broad scale longterm program was appropriate two propone nts have noted that the success of goodsforservices contracts has been difficult to evaluate12 others have concluded that the goodsfor services pilot projects provide an important experimental opportunity to test alternative contracting arrangements unde r real world conditions13 however although there were tests in the early 1990s and in several r ecent years the effectiveness and efficiency of goodsforservices stewardshi p contracting has not been
