to be made within each locality determined to have nonfederalfederal pay disparity greater than 5 when uniformly applied to gs employees within locality the adjustment is intended to make their pay rates bstantially equal in the aggregate to those of nonfederal workers for the same levels of work in the same locality fepca authorizes the president to fix an alte rnative level of localitybased comparability payments if because of national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare the president considers the level that would otherwise be payable inappropriate at least one month before these comparabilit payments would be payable by november 30 2008 for the 2009 payment the president would have to prepare and transmit to congress report describing the intended alternative level of payments including the reasons why the alternative level would be necessary 16 the president did not issue an alternative plan for the january 2009 locality pay adjustment once the annual and locality pay percentage amounts are determined the actual pay rates are calculated in the following way first the basic general schedule gs is increased by the annual adjustment percentage resulting in new gs schedule these new basic gs rates are then increased by the locality payments for 2009 the resulting pay rates annual locality are compared with the 2008 pay rates annual locality to derive the net increases in pay according to opm the net increase is calculated using this formula 1 plus the new local rate divided by one plus the old local rate times the percentage for the acrosstheboard increase minus 1 times 100

locality payments the council recommended five improvements in the ncs program18 for the january 2004 through january 2006 locality payments phasein of ncs survey data was approved19 the federal salary council recommended that 100 of the ncs data be used beginning with the january 2007 locality payments four of the improvements to the ncs survey have been fully implemented the fifth enhancement on the use of four factors to assign the correct federal grade level to nonfederal jobs will not be fully implemented for an esti mated three years according to the councils memorandum on the january 2009 locality payments the average pay gap was about 6 points higher in 2007 than in 2006 and the gaps in all locality pay areas except for dayton oh 20 increased the huntsville and washington dcbaltimore md locality pay areas showed the largest increases in the pay gap from 2006 to 2007 1233 and 972 respectively the council stated that this likely means the new survey methods tend to match survey jobs to lower general schedule grades21 as requested by the council the bls surveys provided pay data both by establishments of all sizes and by establishments with fewer than 50 employees referred to as small establishments the council reported that the inclusion of the data from the small establishments increases the number of nonfederal employees represented by the data by more than 25 percent and had modest impact on the pay gaps while not ruling out the possibility that data from small establishments could be used in the future the council recommended that the data not be used in calculating locality payments for 2009 and that they be reviewed again next year before making decision on its use in making the recommendation the council acknowledged that some council members have expressed concerns about how well jobs in small establishments match federal jobs 22 since 1994 when locality pay was implemented the bls surveys have included data only from establishments with 50 or more workers 18 these recommendations endorsed by the pay agent were that 1 four factors rather than nine be used to assign the correct federal grade levels to the nonfederal jobs surveyed and grade level guides for occupational families be provided 2 model be developed to estimate missing data 3 the matching of federal survey jobs with nonfederal survey jobs be improved and subcategories be provided for occupations that are not elsewhere classified 4 for supervisory occupations the highest level of work supervised be graded and the grade level be adjusted based on the level of supervision instead of grading the supervisory job itself and 5 criteria be developed to identify and exclude jobs that would be classified above gs15 in government memorandum for the

ncs and 10 ocsp were applied for january 2006 20 the council stated that the decrease in the pay gap for dayton oh primarily resulted from the conversion of civilian employees at the department of defense from the general schedule to the national security personnel system thereby removing the employees from the pay comparisons that underlie the localitybased comparability payments 21 memorandum

management opm which serves as the staff to the federal salary council and the pay agent opm documents federal rates of pay in each of the pay areas and compares nonfederal and gs salaries by grade for each pay area the average salaries at each grade both federal and nonfederal are then aggregated and compared to determine an overall average percentage pay gap for each area by law the disparity between nonfederal and federal salaries is to be reduced to 5 therefore the overall average percentage pay gap for each pay area is adjusted annually to this level by opm this adjusted gap called the target gap is used to determine the locality rates for each pay area recommended to the president by the pay agent after receiving advice from the federal salary council the pay gaps on which the locality payments are based are 22 months old by the effective date of the adjustment thus march 2007 gaps determine the january 2009 locality payments fepca also stipulates that certain percentage of the target gap between gs average salaries and nonfederal average salaries in each pay area is to be closed each year twenty percent of the gap was closed in 1994 the first year of locality pay as authorized by fepca an additional 10 of the gap was to be closed each year thereafter meaning that 30 of the gap was to be closed in 1995 40 in 1996 50 in 1997 60 in 1998 70 in 1999 80 in 2000 and 90

councils recommendations the pay agent endorsed them in its december 6 2007 annual report to the president on the 2009 locality payments the pay agent stated that given the current national emergency however it would be unwise to allow the locality pay increases shown in its report to take effect in january 200933 the pay agent estimated that the cost of the january 2009 localitybased

improvements are fully incorporated into surveys used this year35 the pay agent agreed with the councils recommendations regarding the survey data from small establishments and that new locality pay areas for 2009 not be designated36 the pay agent reiterated that it has serious concerns about the utility of process that requires single percentage adjustment in the pay of all whitecollar civilian federal employees in each locality pay area without regard to the differing labor markets for major occupational groups or the performance of individual employees and continues to believe it is imperative to develop performancesensitive compensation systems37 hearing conducted on june 26 2008 by the house subcommittee on federal service postal service and the district of columbia of the committee on oversight and government reform included an examination of the federal locality pay program the subcommittee received testimony reiterating that fepca should be fully implemented and recommending that the government consider initiatives that would help federal employees in areas where housing costs are particularly high for example the representative for the american federation of government employees afge recommended that the federal government begin to provide variety of housing assistance programs under welldefined circumstances we propose pilot programs that would address the particularly acute problems faced by federal employees and agencies in counties with median house prices that are at least 25 ab ove the median house price within locality in addition 32 ibid p 9
