comments 0 by sarah dotypostbulletin rochester mn an austin mans request that city council members sign petition demanding the sheriff enter into an agreement with federal authorities to enforce immigration laws was rebuffed monday instead the request by samuel johnson an austin man whos organized antiimmigration rallies and says hes member of the national socialist movement created few heated moments at the meeting johnson was there to announce petition that he had created addressed to mower county sheriff terese amazi concerning illegal immigration we demand that the mower county sheriffs department enter into memorandum agreement with the us immigration and customs enforcement to enforce immigration laws johnson said reading from the petition previously the sheriff has said this is federal issue but there is program that trains local officers to enforce immigration law johnson said i was just wondering if anyone here would like to be the first to sign the petition johnson asked the council austin mayor tom stiehm was the first to break the silence saying if anyone wants to sign it speak up i certainly dont want to sign it when johnson asked why he wasnt going to sign the petition about illegal aliens stiehm interrupted this isnt forum for that stiehm said if you want to say something make your statement and then sit down but we arent having forum this isnt forum johnson replied this is petition for the city of austin and the gang problem that is increasingly going on and you cant deny that anymore i think this is clear issue here in the city and it needs to be taken care of now instead of hiding behind the city council and other local agencies johnson left the meeting immediately after his statement after the meeting stiehm explained the comments hed made to johnson the reason i dont support him is because that guy is nazi stiehm said we fought war against the nazis and i am sure as heck not going to support anything they do in response to the petition amazi said they can demand anything they want amazi said the sheriffs department has neither the manpower nor the budget to send deputies to the twomonth outofstate training session which is needed in order to work with ice officials i have looked into this issue she said what the program does is it gives our deputies the ability to work with ice officials it doesnt give them independent status if they want to give the funding then sure but even with that said they still have to work with ice officials we cannot enforce federal laws enlarge photo samuel johnson reads
