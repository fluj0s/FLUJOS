6206c21 shspec162 model session revised parts of this tape are summarized in hcob 23jun62 model session revised this model session will make auditing much smoother it is remarkable in that it doesnt need any extra processes except for the pcs havingness the rudiments here are repetitive processes asked only as long as you get an instant read hcob 25may62 emeter instant reads defines instant read and should be known it is really instant on the end of the last letter of the last word of the question item or command if any read seems equivocal you should check it out it isnt true that the pc knowing the question will react before you have said it all you are not auditing knowing being you are auditing notime reactive bank the bank waits for the entire command and then reacts instantly if the read occurs on br and not on k when you are asking for an arc break it is prior read and you ignore it it is the read that starts on k that you want this is not hard its easy so be sure you use the meter properly the results are marvellous that way sad to say ruds done with prior and latent reads will mess up the pc only ask question twice or more if it had an instant read if there is instant read on the question ask it only once it is of great benefit to have repetitivecommand model session it doesnt change process on the pc all the time so you clean up what you ask for not some variation and there is variation in what you do you ask question get an answer check it on the meter etc it is very easy to do once you find that it works it is so easy that people dont do it at first they do something else which is hard everyone has to some degree the desire to demonstrate that they are an expert because what they are doing is difficult the real experts fool you they make it look effortless and easy when you start auditing on simple coaudit you may find that it is perfectly easy then you will go all the way around the dial to get back to that ease one becames all thumbs over the horrible unknownness of it all once one has gotten into it so the simplicity of this model session is fooler you enter in with the idea that there must be something else to do and with all the alterises wide open the expert has flattened the alteris impulse the amateur goes along fine up to the moment where the pc says something unclear there he gets confused and doesnt know the next time he comes to this point he alters he is nervous about discussing someones problems anyway so he alters and q and as if he gets into habit of doing this he gets results and thinks tech doesnt work but he has never tried it the first discussion of model session was in 1958 when millie galusha and lrh took the things auditors tended to say and made pattern made the session constant then the reason for doing this was recognized the consistency of pattern ran out old sessions at saint hill it became the earmark of professionallooking auditor the rfactor on auditing came up enormously using model session now all the questions in model session can be extended to become repetitive questions if necessary to handle the charge this use of repetitive processes to get ruds in makes model session even more valuable new pcs lack r model session being consistent puts in r this increases the pcs trust he is not being startled the auditor will thus be more real and solid to the pc you have established expectancy in the pc you have also put in arc using model session without departure will get interesting results all by itself if you put someone into session ran only model session and took him nut every day for three days running the pc would start talking about my auditor all by itself model session also has the power to smooth out the pcs needle this is even more true when it is combined with prepchecking and havingness new pc tends to look like someone who is swimming two or three feet out of the water they slip in gradually they dont know what to expect or what will be demanded of them once they find out they will be relieved you could run any set of harmless questions three days running and the pcs reality on session and arc with the auditor would be much greater dont expect any one question in model session to straighten out the pc it is not onebutton proposition dont expect to clean up dirty needle on pc with missed withhold handling or with any one particular action it is done with smooth auditing not part of auditing the needle cleans up gradually as the pc goes through session after session every now and then you will be thrown off because one pc in hundred will react with big change you tend to get stuck in that win and then you keep expecting to find the magic button what really happened was that you had been gradually improving the case before you hit that point freud had luck and then got hung up in the win clear is not made with 3ga alone it is good auditing plus 3ga that produces clear neither part alone to that degree model session is part of clearing by keeping the session predictable and present time clean enough to be audited in thus you get an undistracted pc asking the pc is it all right for to audit you violates the rule of not putting the pcs attention on the auditor so it is not good to ask the are you willing to talk to about your difficulties is ok because it gets him to look at his case and talk to the auditor so it gets him into session in middle ruds you have fourquestion package you look for an instant read on each part if you get read on one the repeated question is the single rud question for instance if invalidated reads you ask what was it get the pcs response ack then recheck invalidated when it is clean go on to check the rest of the four parts in singles if you like to keep him from getting confused the body of the session is where middle ruds are used end rudiments have had some additions the multiple halftruth question is handled the same as midruds on the emeter question one asks how not what was it on question or command drop the one that didnt read on critical you clear it with done on room run havingness if it reads or if havingness is down as indicated by can squeeze havingness began as way to bring joe winter back to pt from down the track calling the pcs attention to the environment it is always beneficial at end of session the following are some flagrant errors that can be made 1 not being expert with the meter 2 not knowing model session script 3 asking question second time when it was clean the first time dont alteris the cleanness of the needle you can put an instant read on meter by reading clean question twice it is reading on protest 4 not checking again after you have had the question read 5 not saying that you couldnt tell what the read was when you couldnt never pretend on meter read 6 failing to give the pc an rfactor on each new step that is important to wipe out his mystery about it all 7 doing what the pc said 8 making irrelevant statements or remarks this always upsets the pc and yanks him out of session
