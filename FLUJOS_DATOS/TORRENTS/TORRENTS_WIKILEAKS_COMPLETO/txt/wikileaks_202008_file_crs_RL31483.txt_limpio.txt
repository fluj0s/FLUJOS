senate and conference versions updated july 26 2002 mark jickling specialist in public finance government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 sidebyside comparison of house senate and conference versions summary this report compares the major provisions of three versions of auditor and accounting reform legislation set out are the versions of hr 3763 passed by the house on april 24 2002 passed by the senate on july 15 2002 and the conference version that was approved by both houses of congress as the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 on july 26 2002 president bush indicated that he would sign the measure into law within few days the cornerstone of us securities regulation is disclosure according to this approach the best way to protect investors from fraud hype and irrational exuberance is to require companies selling stocks and bonds to the public to disclose detailed information about their financial strengths and weaknesses without complete and accurate information investors cannot make rational decisions and the market cannot allocate funds to the most productive users illinformed investment choices hurt individual investors but there are also costs to the national economy in terms of wasted resources jobs not created and innovations forgone if investors decide they cannot trust corporate disclosures they will be less likely to buy stocks and bonds raising the cost of capital for all firms good and bad since the markets peak in early 2000 us stocks have lost about 7 trillion in value the share prices of firms that fail to meet their own profit projections or wall streets expectations are apt to plummet the desire to avoid or postpone stock market losses creates powerful incentive for corporate management to engage in accounting practices that conceal bad news the cases of enron worldcom and growing list of others suggest that this incentive is often strong enough to overwhelm the watchdog mechanisms in place to prevent deceptive financial reporting the sarbanesoxley act seeks to restore confidence in corporate reporting by enhancing the oversight of financial accounting the measure creates new oversight body to regulate independent auditors whose certification the law requires to be affixed to the annual reports of all publicly traded corporations under previous practice auditors were regulated mainly by private professional accounting groups the new board will also be private but will operate under the direct oversight of the securities and exchange commission majority of the five board members will be nonaccountants the board will have sweeping powers to inspect accounting firms set rules and standards for auditing and impose sanctions on violators auditors will be prohibited from providing certain nonaudit consulting services to their audit clients and the oversight role of the board of directors will be strengthened top corporate officials will have to personally attest to the accuracy of their firms accounting and face penalties if financial statements are later found to be erroneous stock trades by corporate insiders will have to be made public within two days and most loans by companies to their executives will be prohibited this report traces the evolution of the sarbanesoxley act by comparing the major features of the bills
