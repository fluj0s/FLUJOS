titled civil service and national security personnel improvement act the bill by making changes in selected federal personnel management statutory provisions is intended to improve the flexibility and competitiveness of federal human resources management in addition to the civilian personnel provisions from the dod proposal it would make significant changes in the personnel management system at the national aeronautics and space administration nasa with limited amendments to the system at the securities and exchange commission sec hr 1836 was ordered to be reported by the house government reform committee on may 8 2003 hr 1588 as passed would incorporate title i of hr 1836 with very few differences one difference is that at the proposed new 5 usc 9902j in hr 1588 section 1121 would specify

introduced in the 108th congress by senator george voinovich s 129 and representative joann davis hr 1601 they contain several of the government wide provisions of the proposed federal workforce improvement act of 2002 s 2651 107th congress that were not enacted as part of the homeland security act of 2002 these bills would amend current law provisions on personnel management demonstration projects recruitment relocation and retention bonuses critical pay civil service retirement system computation for parttime service pay administration agency training and annual leave although some provisions correspond to 6 for further narrative analysis of the department of homeland security personnel provisions see crs report 31500 homeland security human resources management by barbara l

example parttime service computation for retirement there has been effort to incorporate these provisions into this report8 the purpose of this report is to present in tabular format the alignment of the provisions of hr 1836 with current statutory provisions and with those sections of the homeland security act of 2002 related to personnel management and unique to the department of homeland security if hr 1836 or similar personnel management legislation were enacted there would be four chapters in title 5 of the us code that established personnel provisions and flexibilities unique to specific agencies the internal revenue service dhs nasa and dod contributors to this report are l elaine halchin jon shimabukuro patrick purcell jack maskell bob lyke and sharon gressle the report is keyed off hr 1836 the other columns are current law which is title 5 of the us code unless otherwise noted and related personnel provisions unique to dhs under pl 107296 because hr 1588 as passed by the house on may 22 2003 incorporates significant sections of hr 1836 the hr 1588 as passed by the house sections are denoted in bold where appropriate the provisions are similar if not identical differences are noted it is expected this report will be revised in the near future to key off the personnel provisions of title xi of hr 1588 hr 1588 is presumably the vehicle against which the senate will work in making amendments although there has been some discussion about incorporating into other bills the provisions of title iii of hr 1836 as they relate to the personnel systems in the sec and nasa such bills have been reported to date given the scope of the proposed legislation the authors and other contributors have in this first look set out the basic provisions hoping to provide the readers with type of roadmap to the bill the reader should understand that every effort has been made to be comprehensive in identifying statutes currently in effect which would relate to the proposed changes in policy however there may be related statutory provisions that we have not identified 8 for comparison of the proposals in s 129 and hr 1601 see crs report rl31516 civil service
