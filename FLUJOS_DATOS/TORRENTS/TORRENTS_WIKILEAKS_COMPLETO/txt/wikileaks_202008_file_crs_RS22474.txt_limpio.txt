fmct sharon squassoni andres demkee and jill marie parillo foreign affairs defense and trade division july 14 2006 abstract on may 18 2006 the united states proposed draft fissile material cutoff treaty fmct at the conference on disarmament cd in geneva the us draft treaty would enter into force with only the five established nuclear weapon states it would ban new production of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for use in nuclear weapons for 15 years could be extended only by consensus of the parties would allow highenriched uranium production for naval fuel and contains provisions for verification other than national technical means the next step is for the cd to adopt negotiating mandate the prospects for which appear uncertain given continued linkage by some states of fmct negotiations with other disarmament talks the cd meets again from july 31 to september 15 order code rs22474 july 14 2006 crs report for congress received through the crs web banning fissile material

technical means the next step is for the cd to adopt negotiating mandate the prospects for which appear uncertain given continued linkage by some states of fmct negotiations with other disarmament talks the cd meets again from july 31 to september 15 this report will be updated as necessary background efforts to control the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons date back to the 1946 baruch plan1 as cold war enmities solidified however attempts to control fissile material production for weapons were abandoned cutoff negotiations in geneva got boost from president george hw bushs announcement in 1992 that the united states longer produced fissile material for nuclear weapons and president clintons 1993 call for fissile material cutoff treaty fmct negotiations despite consensus on negotiating mandate member states at the conference on disarmament cd failed to start negotiations 1 the baruch plan called for complete managerial control of the production of fissionable materials after which manufacture of atomic bombs could stop reprinted in nuclear proliferation factbook joint committee print 99th congress 1st session august 1985 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 some perceive ban on producing fissile material for weapons as much more relevant today than it was decade ago view supported by the bush administrations may 18 2006 proposal concern about terrorist access to large stockpiles of fissile material has only grown since the cooperative threat reduction programs began in the early 1990s and particularly since september 11 2001 revelations about pakistani scientist aq khans nuclear black market sales of uranium enrichment technology in 2004 have spurred efforts not only to shut down networks but restrict even legitimate technology transfer recent proposals to strengthen the nonproliferation regime including those of mohamed elbaradei director general of the international atomic energy agency iaea have focused on tighter controls on sensitive nuclear fuel cycle technologies renewed disarmament effort and creative approaches toward states outside the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt india pakistan and israel2 an fmct could play pivotal role in implementing that agenda by helping to gain broad support for new multilateral arrangements to restrict enrichment and reprocessing helping to strengthen consensus among npt parties and by achieving concrete step towards disarmament lastly an fmct is viewed by many nonproliferation experts as the sine qua non for nuclear cooperation with india at minimum president bush has proposed to make indian support for fmct negotiations prerequisite for engaging in nuclear cooperation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22474 fissile material most nonproliferation experts consider acquiring fissile material to be the key hurdle in developing nuclear weapons such material plutonium239 uranium233 and uranium enriched in the isotope u235 is produced several ways3 only the isotope u 235 occurs naturally but it cannot be used to create nuclear yield unless it is concentrated significantly4 pu239 is created in nuclear reactor by irradiating natural uranium u238 which absorbs neutron to decay into pu2395 the pu239 must then be chemically separated from highly radioactive fission products to be usable in nuclear weapon6 spent fuel reprocessing plants perform this chemical separation but it can also be done on smaller scale with remote handling and adequate shielding against radiation hazards u233 is produced in reactor by irradiating thorium232 and also requires chemical separation from fission products highenriched uranium heu the ingredient in the first us nuclear bomb is produced by concentrating the isotope u235 in an enrichment plant7 although heu is defined as containing 20 or more u235 weapons grade heu generally requires about 90 u235 2 mohamed elbaradei rethinking nuclear safeguards washington post june 14 2006 3 the us may 2006 proposal does not limit plutonium to just pu239 but extends it to all plutonium except that which contains 80 of pu238 4 natural uranium contains mostly u238 with very little u235 less than 07 5 plutonium is created in reactor but banning such creation could virtually eliminate civil uses of nuclear energy moreover plutonium in spent fuel cannot produce nuclear yield unless separated from waste products and therefore production tends to be equated with reprocessing 6 the discussion here is limited to nuclear weapons with nuclear yields and excludes radiological weapons which simply use radioactive material to contaminate conventional explosives 7 technologies include gaseous diffusion electromagnetic isotope separation laser isotope separation and gas centrifuge isotope separation which iran is developing crs3 which states produce fissile material for weapons nine states have produced fissile material for nuclear weapons the five nuclear weapon states as defined by the npt united states united kingdom russia france and china india pakistan israel and north korea all of these states have unsafeguarded that is uninspected enrichment and reprocessing plants but four are longer producing fissile material for weapons united states united kingdom russia and france8 the united states stopped producing heu for weapons in 1964 and plutonium for weapons in 1988 russia and the united kingdom declared their cessation in 1995 france declared halt in 19969 china is believed to have halted production but has not publicly declared so it is not clear that israel or north korea enrich uranium for weapons and indias enrichment plant reportedly is used to enrich uranium for naval submarine fuel north koreas relevance in fmct negotiations is controversial since there would be great pressure to place its enrichment and reprocessing plants under iaea safeguards by return to the npt rather than as party to an fmct other nonnuclear weapon state parties to the npt reprocess spent fuel japan and enrich uranium netherlands germany argentina brazil japan for commercial purposes these capabilities are under iaea safeguards which verify that nuclear material is not diverted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22474 some states have argued that treaty should cover existing stocks of fissile material the united states has long opposed this approach the dissolution of the soviet union and more recently the september 11 2001 attacks have heightened concerns about terrorist access to weapons of mass destruction materials bolstering the argument to include existing stocks in an fmct according to 2004 estimates there are more than 3700 metric tons of plutonium 1800 tons and highly enriched uranium 1900 tons in the world much of the plutonium is in civilian reactors or spent fuel ponds is safeguarded and not separated from fission products and thus poses lower security risk about 235 tons of plutonium in the civil cycle is separated from fission products already military plutonium accounts for just 110th of the civilian plutonium but about 90 of it is separated an estimated 1570 tons of the worlds plutonium are under safeguards while 155 tons are in military stocks in the five nuclear weapon states10 the situation for heu is reversed with 50 tons under safeguards in civilian programs 125 tons declared by the united states is excess to defense needs and therefore eligible to be safeguarded and 1725 tons in military programs11 given that four of the five nuclear weapon states have declared they have ceased production and russia the united states and the united kingdom have declared material 8 the npt requires nonnuclear weapon states to accept system of inspections and record keeping nuclear safeguards on all nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities the nuclear weapon states under the treaty us uk china france and russia are not obliged to accept any nuclear safeguards but have voluntary safeguards on some civilian facilities 9

httpwwwisisonlineorgglobal_stocksend2003civil_heu_watch2005pdf crs4 in excess of defense needs what remaining barriers exist to including existing stocks in treaty covering existing stocks in cutoff treaty could prove highly contentious because 1 the stockpiles of the five weapon states range from 4 tons to 145 tons and are significantly larger than those of india pakistan and israel 2 it is unclear whether commitment would be mandatory or voluntary and 3 it is unclear whether the parties could agree on equitable cuts fmct at the conference on disarmament cd in response to general assembly resolution 4875l the cd established committee in 1995 to begin work on an fmct the 66member negotiating body in geneva agreed by consensus to the socalled shannon mandate which called for an ad hoc committee to negotiate nondiscriminatory multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices canadas ambassador shannon specifically noted that the mandate did not preclude any delegation from raising issues related to the scope of the treaty whether banning future production covering existing stocks or adding management of stocks during discussions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22474 following the conclusion of comprehensive test ban treaty negotiations in1996 fmct appeared to be the next priority yet cd member states could not agree on program of work in late 1998 cd members agreed to establish an ad hoc committee mostly in reaction to the indian and pakistani nuclear tests earlier that year but the cd was unable to reestablish the committee in 1999 within the cd four basic areas of work nuclear disarmament prevention of an arms race in outer space paros negative security assurances and fissile material production cutoff still compete for priority moreover several states prefer to link progress in one area to progress in another area which some observers call hostagetaking china for one has made its agreement to start fmct negotiations contingent on the start of paros negotiations and other states have done the same with respect to nuclear disarmament negotiations12 in may 2006 the us delegation told cd members it sees need at this time however for the negotiation of new multilateral agreements on nuclear disarmament outer space or negative security assurances13 in june 2006 us official told the cd that there is repeat problem in outer space for arms control to solve14 12 see httpwwwreachingcriticalwillorgpoliticalcdspeeches068juneindiapdf for indian june 2006 position and httpwwwreachingcriticalwillorgpoliticalcdspeeches06 8junechinapdf for chinas position the united states and united kingdom have opposed paros negotiations despite the existence of an ad hoc committee on paros at the cd from 1985 to 1994 13 stephen g rademaker acting assistant secretary for international security and nonproliferation rising to the challenge of effective multilateralism at httpwwwstategovtisnrlsrm66419htm 14 see httpwwwreachingcriticalwillorgpoliticalcdspeeches0613juneuspdf crs5 major fmct issues although negotiations have been stalled for more than decade the cd has convened informal meetings to examine issues of fmct scope duration and verification and entryintoforce15 several issues could generate debate but are likely to be fairly noncontroversial including how to define fissile material all plutonium except reactor grade or just pu239 and production in reactor or in reprocessing plant and provisions for entry into force and duration the most difficult issues to resolve are likely to be whether the scope should include existing stocks what kinds of activities would not be prohibited and whether verification measures are necessary and if so what kind until 2004 when the united states announced that an fmct was inherently unverifiable many observers assumed iaea safeguards would play role with modifications made for inspections in nuclear weapon states the us position may not be accepted by significant number of cd members us proposal on may 18 2006 the us delegation to the cd proposed draft negotiating httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22474 mandate and fmct text the negotiating mandate excludes reference to effective verifiability of treaty in line with the us position that an fmct cannot be adequately verified the proposal seeks to prohibit the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or use of any fissile material produced thereafter in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices16 key elements of the us draft include 15year duration which could only be extended by consensus of the parties scope limited to future production with an exception for production of naval fuel an entryintoforce provision limited to the five nuclear weapon states and provisions for verification us officials have stated that verification would rest with the parties using their own national means and methods17 the us proposal raises few issues requiring consensus to extend the treaty may present very high threshold also the requirement for the treaty to enter into force with just the five nuclear weapon states rather than all states with unsafeguarded enrichment and reprocessing plants may mean that key states that are producing fissile material may be left out india israel and pakistan this would reduce the effect to merely making the status quo if it is true hat china has stopped producing legally binding for limited duration however it is also possible that other npt nuclear weapon states could refuse to ratify until india or pakistan did third allowing production of heu for naval reactors creates particular loophole in the absence of verification measures some states could produce heu for weapons unfettered even by declarations finally one of the few areas of agreement among states in the 1995 negotiating mandate was the need for effective verification so some may view the us approach as undermining what little agreement had been reached 15 these include workshops in 1995 1999 2001 2002 2004 and 2006 16 see httpgenevausmissiongovpress20060518draftfmcthtml for the us draft fmct 17 ibid such national means generally are limited to remote monitoring including from satellites crs6 state has opposed fmct negotiations but china has repeated its desire to reach comprehensive and balanced program of work indias ambassador to the cd reported on may 17 2006 that india supported verification in the fmct and that absence of verification mechanism may engender lack of confidence in compliance with the treaty encourage willful noncompliance and lead to allegations and counter allegations of noncompliance18 pakistans ambassador to the cd quipped that fissile material treaty sans verification sans stocks will be sans treaty19 issues for congress congress may be interested in the progress of fmct negotiations in the context of indias july 18 2005 commitment to work with the united states to conclude multilateral fmct indias support for fmct is one of the key determinations the president must make according to the administrations proposed legislation on us india nuclear cooperation hr 4974s 242920 it is not clear if indian support for verifiable fmct conflicts with support for us efforts but this position could raise questions about how hard india will work to achieve us goals in the cd httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22474 the senate would have the opportunity to advise and consent to us ratification of an fmct should the cd adopt the us approach several questions may arise given historic difficulties in estimating fissile material production can us intelligence capabilities provide confidence in global ban particularly with respect to china how difficult is it to distinguish between allowed enrichment for naval fuel and illicit enrichment for nuclear weapons if the treaty enters into force with just the five nuclear weapon states will it satisfy nonproliferation objectives will key states such as pakistan india china and israel agree to national technical means as the only verification approach 18 see
