revolt in the stars by l ron hubbardprologue the winch on the truck wound inward growling and snapping and groaning sea weed whipped and wound and unwound on the taut protesting cables as they dragged an object toward the beach from under the sea the intensity of the watching group had eye for the beauty of the scene the soft purling of the small waves the sooth ing whisper of the tropical wind the distant clatter of palm the rich gold of sand and crystal aquamarine of water might as well have been tourist poster in waste basket the rigid cordon of marines facing outward automatic weapons in hand had fierce eyes against any threatened intrusion into the site vips that must not be approached an object that was top secret and sergeant with hangover increased their triggerhappy vigilance several supercilious scientists gazed benignly at the water tolerantly and learn edly waiting for the object to appear hop ing one had penetrated the fact that they hadnt clue jedgar the jutjawed czar of all us po lice and security forces scowled with feroc ity at the water god damn president he ought to have his ass kicked getting him out here for what god damn hobbyhappy bastard so its an historical find so it may be from outer space sand fleas when he had an ap pointment at the race track with bennie the dip 30000 payoff via the window damned junkie hed probably blow it or forget it what the hell was he doing out here playing nursemaid to his nibs crap hobby nursemaid thats what he was god damn president bennie better pay up jedgar glared at the water as though about to arrest it on suspicion on the other side of the groaning cables sat disconsolate young man in scubasuit he twisted his helmet and mask in his hands around and around while he might have the nerve to face the monsters of the deep what were those compared to us of ficials damned government he ought to have kept his mouth shut breaks he always lucked out here hed made the find personally and privately and even paid for his own bike gas and air well an orphan is an orphan still there was law about own ership you couldnt give up just like that one more try if it didnt work the young man braced himself got to his feet and wiped some of the sand off his pants how would john wayne handle this on the latelate show one more try the young man ducked under the growling cables and walked up to jedgar who gave him not glance now or never its mine i insist its mine i found it if it werent for you wouldnt even know of its existence jedgar did not even take his eyes off the water he put out an arm and brushed the young man sideways the leading scientist of the group found his own view obstructed he never wore glasses despite needing them as they spoiled his image of the tawnymaned man of science he peered at the young man in his benign voice reserved for assistants he intended to fire he said you dont under stand such finds as this belong to the worldof science to the museums to the universi ties having registered now that there was dispute jedgar tore his eyes from the water and stabbed them at the young man reaching out with sudden and practiced cop hand he seized the front of the young mans scuba suit you give any more crap jedgar yanked the young man close to him and youll be charged with conspiracy to steal archeological treasures section 896 threerevolt in the stars 3 years in jail not one more word out of you not to the public not to your friends not to the press he hurled the young man from him violently so that he staggered and fell this pronounced jedgar is state matter the young man looked up from the ground defeated he looked out to where government scuba diver was guiding in the cables there was sympathy there he looked at the tense marine backs he looked at the scientists he looked at jed gar he was totally completely and utterly ignored he had never felt more lonely he got up and unsteadily wandered across the sand head down shuffling he went out through the cordon and wandered away through the distant crowd the winch cables groaned on coiling and twisting the government scuba diver watched the cables the group on the sand stared waiting greenish seacoated metal object be gan to emerge it had bolt studs apparent seams it was many planed symmetrical first one then two then the eight foot diameter of it came into full view all right yelled jedgar lets get the thing loaded on plane maybe he could still get to the race track washington the fair washington the beautiful home of the incorruptible politi cian and the shining knights of social justice basked in the summer sun owned operated and controlled as usual by the bankers and their police the institute sat on low hill securely backed by the printing plant that poured the newly printed money into the hands ofthe deserving few as much summer sun as could get through the smog entered the win dows of large hall and fell upon the object all eight feet of it had been placedagainst one wall it had been polished up bit at least the sand had been removed it had two small panels oblong sealed rectan gles much like slitted eyes and these seemed to stare blindly into the hall facing it waiting several feet in front of it jedgar and the leading scientist stood the president who had just arrived with his usual escort joined them excitement agitated the presidents eyes ever since he had been little boy he had been interested in such things it might be something from outer space it might be some archeological wonder he had strictly forbidden them to tinker with it these sci entists monkeyed so who knows but what it might be some discovery he could claim the patronage for and help his votes and show he was an intellectual maybe some body would work out its secrets and make some great new weapon he could use as big stick maybe it held secrets that would blow everything up his background train ing for his hobby consisted of chemistry set somebody had given him at the age of ten and which he had used mainly to make explosives the president took his eyes off the object and looked around and what have we guessed so far the leading scientist swept back his tawny hair which he hoped would come to look like einsteins it didnt much matter what he told the president so long as it added up to new grants for the institute and new honors for himself w ell mr presi dent were not at all sure what it is it must have been imbedded in cliff side and when that fell into the sea it exposed itself im having it analyzed now and he pointed to the right of the object beyond the object table of instru ments had been set up those used in car bon halflife estimations of age radiationrevolt in the stars 4 detection electrical detonators all strewn about in disorderly juryrigs whitecoated and serious the instrument man was searching through the scattered papers and getting them in some kind of order all right said the instrument techni cian i think ive got it he frowned heav ily at note its some kind of alloy we have never achieved the leading scientist nodded and said yes hoping it sounded as though he knewit already the instrument technician pulled wad of tape out of the notes and with some dif ficulty stretched it out this is stretching our equipment but id say that according to the carbon age test this thing is tens of millions of years old close to seventyfive million years old at an estimate the leading scientists eyes flashed wider damn the technician you never told laymen things that were likely to scare themoff you damped it down bit but the heedless technician bored on its also been subject to heavy radiation i think but the count is too faint to tell longer dangerous it doesnt appear to be explosive but there is some sort of energy charge in there the president nodded intellectually well why not get on with finding what it does or something jedgar scowled at the scientists scowled at the machine and jutted his jaw at the president jedgar was in pleasant mood he had missed bennie the dip and 30 gs this bastard was just kid playing with toys mr president said jedgar in re spectfulsounding voice i know of your interest in such things and how this is sci entific age and so forth but we aint got anyguarantee that that damned thing wont blow up the secret service would insist the president waved him off with anindolent hand and turned to the leading sci entist go ahead doctor i am truly in trigued the two approached the object leaving jedgar standing alone in the center of the room the two front plates of the m achine continued to stare blindly the leading sci entist poked finger at the left hand one jenkins says this one is apparently move able but theres getting into it with drills it just breaks the bits the president looked curiously at the plate it had number of raised dots and marks and he fingered them first there were ten dots in line low and to the left then circle about an inch and half in di ameter with radius mark then straight line at the level of the bottom of the circle and about as long as the circle was round then two dots at the end of the line but at aheight level with the top of the circle after that came wide gap and to the right of the gap were group of dots arranged so that as dots they made up small individual groups of one to nine part of this last group was square that was empty those said the leading scientist appear to be meaningful some sort of an equation perhaps he coughed depreciat ingly my assistant jenkins says whoever possibly made this didnt want barbarians to open it and put code on it that only an advanced civilization could resolve ways feed the laymen the interesting bits even when one personally might discount them and let assistants take the rap if they were challenged isnt that what you said jenkins jenkins had come out of hole some where and crept up on the group he was short poorly formed as man looking as if he had borrowed his white coat from an elephant his glasses were three quarters of an inch thick which made his pupils lookrevolt in the stars 5 like enlarged specimens he was very very nervous jenkins seldom got very brave andtoday finding himself in company with the president and the top cop of the country he was having hard time with his nerve nevertheless he braved up to it he spoke all in rush when we couldnt make dent in it with sledge hammer i guessed it might be some culture superior to ours so he bogged down the leading scientist looked at him in contemptuous tolerance well well come on jenkins took deep breath i think begging your pardon mr president and all i think thats pi the radius of cir cle he yanked book table of loga rithms out of his enormous jacket pocket and tremblingly opened it to where he had made marker god help him if he was looking smarter than his boss that old bas tard would put an assistant that looked like competition back on an instructors post as quick as look at him the leading scientist said tolerantly well come on matter how silly it may be were quite receptive appalled at his own bravery jenkins dived all the way in that first row of dots on the left must mean common base ten logarithms the circle and line must mean pi the circle is the same length as the line i measured them the two dots there must mean squared the gap must mean equals and that group of dots on the right must mean one through nine and zero so you can punch in the answer if you figure it out he shakingly found place in the book and held it close to his glasses the log of 314 is 04969 and the answer to that squared is 09938 he looked up scared but brave the combination to that thing is 09938 he swallowed if you let push the dots the smile of the leading scientist had certain amount of hydrochloric acid in it never word in all that about how his boss had suggested even if not true an in structors post in some desegregated school would certainly be in order i think said the leading scientist that im at least capable of pushing the buttons without any great expectations of any thing happening he probed an index finger over the dot groups one by one common base log squared was not very advanced math in his opinion although it is true that pi was pretty good idea communication was possible without arbitrary symbols now had they put formula on it in quan tum mechanics flaring green light glared in the other panel the leading scientist and the president jumped back the green turned into racing flashing red that played over their startled faces low whine began to ascend it ended sharply with loud snap jedgar went for his gun the left hand plate ceased to flash and turned into criss cross of white lines like speaker grid in sawtoothed metallic voice the object spoke mark 92 vocotranslator all sound and information is now coming to you by thought concept and visual feedback so that you hear as though spoken in your own language the group looked at it wideeyed the voice continued you have activated the power charge it will last for two years tinuous running and many times that used intermittently it will shut off automatically at the end of this use please step back at least two paces there was an earsplitting whine and creak and crash the whole front face of the object below the panels flashed widerevolt in the stars 6 open it was very hard on their nerves and confirmed jedgars solid opinion which was usually wrong that it was bomb after all the gun in his hand shook but he couldnt see anything to shoot at except deep wide cavity which had been disclosed by the opening doors please be seated said the object po litely the president was suddenly mindful of his traditional white house responsibilities he rose to the crisis clear the room this may contain confidential information it cantalk this more routine attitude served to clear jedgars scrambled wits it was an or der he could understand he scowled aroundhim as he was still holding onto his gun the leading scientist and all others in the room made haste to comply by various doors they left jedgar scurried around the hall and turned keys in locks looked behind and der things with very practiced eye used his gun muzzle to see if bug was any where in the potted palms and satisfied found two chairs and brought them back to the area in front of the object he seated the president and then re versing his own chair and still holding his gun sat down it occurred to him that the damned thing seemed to know they werent ready until they were and he glared at it the president continued to stare into the black cavity it was quite wide and quitedark he nervously hoped monster would spring out of it or that it didnt turn on sudden vacuum suck them in and send them spinning off into space jedgar looked around the roam one final time to see if they were alone the screen at the back of the cavity flickered faltered and then turned on in full colorchapter one the music was faintly oriental and the drums were sad tattered and ripped up operations room showed the signs of battle the man at the desk was handsome young but his face was disfigured with bandage around his forehead the plain khaki blouse he wore was singed over the left shoulder he looked vital competent alive he was holding sheaf of papers in his hand reports notes records we assume he said that as you have solved this capsule your civilization has advanced to high standard of technol ogy possibly nuclear fission computers even space flight or at least you are capa ble of these things in your immediate future you have right to know the violent history of your planet some day when grass has grown again and the few pitiful survivors have multiplied into culture you will know what to do with this and understand it my name is mish loyal officer of the people of the galactic confederation he stretched his hand behind him to the wall there star map glittered and spar kled you may never have heard of the galactic confederation it consisted of 21 stars and their 76 inhabited planets you were one of those planets earth was beautiful jewel then it had vast cities lovely forests and moun tains and billions of inhabitants but all was not calm things had hap pened not just on earth but all over the confederation he propped up screen up on his desk mob appeared on it an angry mob carrying placards surging and seething out side building mish continued throughout the gal axy symptoms of unrest hitherto unknownrevolt in the stars 7 in the confederation were occurring as you can see by these news clips an old woman was being mugged on the street she fell one of the muggers snatched her purse the other kicked her in the face crime was becoming commonplacea littered street lined with broken shop windows appeared when there was power failure in major city thousands of people began fury of looting and burning school yard appeared young girl was being attacked by mob of thugs all these conditions had begun in the past eight years horde of secret police in greygreen uniforms and riot dress were shown charg ing mob the popularity of the government had dropped to an all time low tank was shown attacked by mob they turned it over on its side government building was shown the huge sign tax office was suddenly ob scured by blast of flame the words idealism and patriotism had become meaningless throughout the 76 planets large array of assorted arms and ex plosives were being displayed by police cache discovered in basement enough ma terial to fight regiment gun running had become highly profitable business trucks loaded with bales of drugs were being unloaded by police and tumbled into huge bonfire organized crime was profiting as never before to combat it hundreds of thousands of secret police were being re cruited by the government long ranks of men in greygreen uni forms were shown drawn up colored agitator speaking from aplatform was shown haranguing mob secret policeman lined the speaker up in thesights of blast rifle and fired the agitator was smashed backwards but the government in its turn was using more and more force in an attempt to control the violence civilian sniper appeared on parapet of building beyond him city spread out the sniper fired down into the street and reprisals were earning reprisals in their turn mish folded the screen he looked at his notes and then up again the galactic confederation was very old it had endured for thousands and thou sands of years it had been happy pros perous and peaceful the planets were politically democ ratic the people elected their own gover nors and civil officials and the entire galaxy was governed by the congress of loyal officers of the people these were trained men skilled in political and martial arts when they were graduated from their acad emy they stood for election to the congress and those chosen loyally served the people there was also an executive branch headed by the supreme ruler man also elected by the people and responsible for the day to day running of the confederation but under the laws and appropriations of congress mish laid down his notesthe congress of the loyal officers of the people met every ten years matters of state finances and other concerns had been smooth and routine in the 2053rd congress indeed there had been upsets at all throughout the galaxy the grey invasion had occurred just before that an invader had attempted destruction of the confederation had sailed in in savage attack and had been effectively and efficiently destroyed he had comerevolt in the stars 8 from another galaxy but he had found the confederation prepared and alert and that was the end of him the grey invasion was shot out of space even before full mobilization could occur on earth and our planets and the whole affair had become ancient history the 2053rd congress had done what was necessary to handle all that and it was finished thus it was with considerable concern that the loyal officers came to the 2054th congress revolt was growing in the starsand it was in this atmosphere that the 2054th congress met to decide what course to take on home planet many light years away from earth the loyal officers of the people were arriving from every part of the galaxy chapter two the announcer on his platform gazed across the vast spaceport of home planet behind him military band in resplendent white and blue uniforms blared joyous mu sic before him spread tumultuous vista ofarriving ships surging crowds and whipping flags two thousand planetary troops with their guidons plumes and drummers lined both sides of the concourse facing inward an honor guard police cordons blocked tens of thou sands of people safely away from the landing ships and the concourse the harried staff of the announcer hec tically tried to catch everything in their ra dio cameras tried to spot everyone and write down the names of arrivals and data about them and pass the result to the an nouncer well aware that his voice was carrying across this whole vast assemblage through huge public address horns not only acrossand in almost every room of the limitless city beyond the field but also across the stars to seventyfive other planets the announcer spoke in rapid impressive monologue kept going by the slips passed to him by his staff he was apprehensive just two days ago these mobs had been surging through streets and burning he had thirtythree staff here including his cameramen and this was very visible platform easily rushed he had half million credits in equipment strewn around here and one firebomb would take it all he felt responsible as well what he said was going to this crowd and huge viewscreens around the field as well as eve ryone else in the galaxy the regular an nouncer for such things had declined today and he had had to take over even though he was actually the producer soothe them soothe them nervous business hope is wonderful thing looking across the field of home planet today you would not think that half the inhabited worlds of the galaxy were close to outright revolt such is the confidence of the people in the congress there isnt even demon stration placard out there today he reached urgently to his staff for another slip of paper ship after ship was landing from sky full of ships as each one swooped down loyal officer would step out promptly surrounded by guards and stride toward theconcourse ah what great day great day said the announcer reaching beseechingly for more slips from his staff the most famous names of the entire galactic federation are arriving on this field this af ternoon the two thousand and fifty fourth congress of the loyal officers is beginning auspiciously the high pitched whine of circlingrevolt in the stars 9 ships the roar of the crowd and the upsurge of the band as they began new piece blot ted his voice for moment he stepped closer to his dozen cube shaped mikes and his sound engineer frantically readjusted his levels the loyal officers the loyal officers of the people heading 76 planets for the 21 star systems of the confederation one by one are coming up this concourse one of his staff got piece of paper into his hand and he looked at it urgently and then smiled happily hah here is rawlthe group which had entered the field end of the concourse was larger than oth ers being joined by military officers in white and blue and some civilians they were jostling one another some of them trying to reach through and shake hands with the man at the center rawl was smiling goodnaturedly he was tall athletic man handsome in blunt sort of way he wore the plain khaki trou sers blouse and cap of loyal officer the announcer stood on tiptoe to see better over his mikes rawl the loyal of ficer in charge of earth rawl speaker of the congress you have heard his name connected with every great deed and cency surge in the outer crowds became cheer roaring up to blanket the whine of circling ships rawl was looking up around at the familiar faces smiling trying to shakeeach hand extended to him his progress up the concourse was being slowed by the in creasing pressure he drew long breath and then caught sight of drummer boy in the ranks of the ninth army honor guard and winked at him the drummer boy grinned happily and suddenly added to the din with bursting roll upon his drum just behind rawls group was another mish the center of it pushed forwardtrying to reach rawl the announcer didnt need another slip and there is mish mish loyal officer in charge of the outer limits rawls best friend you know the story well of how these two stood off the entire fleet of the grey invader until our own battle fleet could arrive and you know their daring rescue of the freighter aldebaran mish finally struggled through the mass and tapped rawls shoulder they gripped each others hand and beamed their greeting lost in the excited babble of the groups the swelling roar of the crowd and the band suddenly tearing into grey invader vic tory the announcer was staring down at new sheet of paper jammed into his hand urgently he looked at it his pleasure evaporating and followed the stabbing fin ger of an assistant several radio cameras whirled in that direction standing like naked sword the black tower of the spaceport administration building stabbed at the sky and circling ships balcony near its top was draped in somber green black wreath with twenty one stars hung from the railing just now said the announcer in much changed tone on the receiving bal cony of the administration tower there hasappeared the party of the supreme ruler the announcer made sure the radio cameras were centered on the balcony there he is xenu the supreme ruler of the galactic confederation xenu bitter faced sardonic leaning heavily on cane that was more like club limped forward to the front edge of the draped railing he glared down at the stalled group on the concourse below and did not like what he saw the dark somberness of his civilian suit the darkness of his hair and face seemed to spread outward the cheerrevolt in the stars 10 ing below dimmed off to silence the band faltered and died down the announcers voice was overly loud suddenly for only the whine of ships lay over the field he is accompanied to day by chi the illustrious minister of po lice of the galactic confederation chi jutjawed bulldog faced squat and as crudely built as his civilian suit was rumpled was oblivious by any announce ment he stepped up to xenus side and looked belligerently down at the stalled groups on the concourse the announcer was glad to get off the subject he frantically waved to his cam eramen to target the right side of the bal cony and here is something of interest he has brought with him today his new mistress the lady min lady min caught the cue from the pa and stepped forward to the balcony railing she was warm and smashingly lovely woman splendidly gowned in gold the band abruptly struck up lively theater overture as one needs to be told lady min is the foremost stage star of the galaxy with perfect poise lady min curtsied there was spattering of applause few cheers she spread her hands to receive the applause and it increased she blew kiss and the applause increased again the announcer although he knew she was unlikely to see him and didnt even know him blew kiss back at her in thanks for getting him out of that one that crowd silence had scared him and he had skill inhandling riots putting new forced vitality into his voice to swing the crowds attention off dangerous ground the announcer shouted there seems to be lam of the concourse thats rawlthe radio cameras swiftly whipped to the concourse two cameramen pushedthrough the ranks of the honor guard and added to the press and turmoil trying to gettheir cameras high enough to shoot down over the milling heads rawl and mish were jammed in tight new group had come down from the ad ministration building adding to the civilians military officers press and staff that sur rounded them already the group waspushing big wreath of flowers over peo ples heads and struggling to get closer ah said the announcer look at that the city is trying to give rawl wreath of welcome and they cant even get to him the wreath bit frayed finally made it by knocking rawls hat askew and bashing down on his shoulders rawl and everyone around him was laughing but their laughter was drowned by the rolling roar of cheers from the vast crowds when they saw on thescreen boards the wreath had finally made it city fathers their own hats askew in thepress tried to shout unheard their speech of welcome up on the balcony xenu and chi be held the scene well said xenu bitterly he seems to have lost none of his popularity chi said huh and it was eloquentthey glared at the sky and concourse as the announcers voice continued to roll over the pa system to the city to the planet to seventyfive other inhabited worlds on carrier wave hyperspeed sound and picture and still they come the loyal offi cers of the people tomorrow they will meet in the long awaited two thousand and fiftyfourth congress in the galactic capi tol from every quarter chapter three rawl let the entrance door swing shutrevolt in the stars 11 behind him and gazed across the enormous hall seventysix great flags jutted out on poles high above each one with the plaque of its planet in solid gold below it the great arched windows spread pattern of sun hundreds of loyal officers were at their seats already talking tensely to one an other many caught glimpse of rawl and shouted their greetings at the near end of the room choir stood in ranks upon raised balcony and before them the archbishop of home planet stood his tall mitred cap flashing with jewels rawls eyes went to the rostrum at the distant end of the hall on the first tier were the ministers of the executive branch at the wide desk above it in sombre black robe backed by the glittering seal of the confederation sat xenu supreme ruler for brief instant over that expanse their eyes clashed then rawl began to walk down the aisle the clickclick of the magnetheeled space boots he habitually wore was sharp and punctuating in the room despite the babble of sound chi on xenus left was following rawls progress down the long aisle with ferret eyes and palm that itched for tact with his hidden blaster the calm strength of rawl seemed to spread outward he was giving little heed to the greetings beyond preoccupied nod he had spent the night with committees and as speaker of the congress he knew what he had to do his seat was in the front rank of chairs with empty space between it and the ros trum mish was there already smiling ea gerly rawl stopped and swept his eyes across the hall and back at the rostrum that chi was nasty breed and xenu looked sardonic contemptuously amusedrawl sat down an officer in the row behind him put friendly hand on his shoulder are we go ing to take up this police state thing right away rawl said might as wellmish nodded rapidly head on colli sion the officer behind them said good boy and sat back expectantly huge round gong rested in frame be side xenu he picked up brass hammer and gave the gong hard blow its long doleful sound rolled in waves across the hall carrying audience silence with it xenu spoke now that we seem to have gotten together somehow if late i xenu duly elected supreme ruler by the loyal officers of the galactic confedera tion do declare the two thousand and fifty fourth congress to be in session the choir lifted their voices into hymn the hundreds of loyal officers rose to their feet caps off and stood facing the front of the room the archbishop stood tall and solemn bathed in the sound of the choir behind him as the hymn finished the archbishop raised his palms upward his droning sono rous voice spread through the hall all blessings to almighty god and the galactic confederation upon its 21 stars upon its 76 green planets upon its trillions of population and upon the loyal officers loyal to the people to the confederation and to god and upon this congress may peace and prosperity continue as it has for ages past the loyal officers resumed their seatsa crier stepped forward from the end of the rostrum the congress is now open for its first deliberations rawl stood he looked around him calmly at the loyal officers the rostrumrevolt in the stars 12 this congress said rawl meets in the shadow of possible planetary revolt the last particle of noise vanished from the hall every eye gave him full strained atten tion head on collision mish had said well here it was in the ten years since the last gress certain orders have been issued by theexecutive branch which were not ratified by the 2053rd congress xenu went rigid he had not thought they would dare while we do not wish to be critical said rawl and imagine there are reasons for these orders matter how much mistaken it has been decided by the congressional committees that our first order of business should be to survey these changes put them to vote and rat ify them or not so that their legality or ille gality is clearly established rapid electric buzz of approval spread through the hall xenu braced himself corrected his ex pression to one of political suavity what changes said xenumish instantly produced an ornate folder and passed it to rawl who took it without glancing at it over the past two hundred years or so said rawl certain political ideas and innovations have been put forward from time to time and each time they have been defeated but now beginning eight years ago we find they have become executive orders xenu continued to keep grip on him self he was very sure of his own ground rawl glanced at the folder he held these ideas are personal income tax creditrecords fingerprinting all citizens identity cards passports an angry mutter swept through the hall rawl dropped the folder he lifted hishead for thousands of years we have done without these things and done well yet to day by executive order we find them insti tuted and enforced on every planet of the galactic confederation chi bent and whispered urgently into xenus ear suavely xenu smiled these are law less times it is the executive responsibility to keep the realm peaceful prosperous and calm he tented his fingers and assumed an attitude of stating fact that everybody knew and only an idiot would disagree with by making it possible to identify every citizen swiftly we can catch criminals at once in the back of the hall greyhaired of ficer leaped to his feet if this identity sys tem is so successful then why is it that during the last eight years crime throughout this galaxy has multiplied five times rawl raised his hand in signalthe doors at the rear of the hall crashed open and six pageboys each one pushing wheeled table raced in and rushed to the front of the room the tables each one piled high with documents and reports were rapidly posi tioned before rawl rawl swept his hand indicating the ta bles the congressional committees have not been idle said rawl here your ex cellency are the crime records of all sev entysix planets for the past ten years here also are the complaints and petitions of those planets here as well are the finan cial records and appalling rate of inflation ofthe galaxy he let the hall calm down bit he looked mild and persuasive personal in come tax and credit records carry with them total invasion of privacy identity cards and passports put every citizen at the mercy of personal enemies as well as therevolt in the stars 13 state he picked up some of the petitions long rolls with tens of thousands of names and after glancing at them sought to pass them via page to xenu xenu flattened hishands against them he wanted peti tions rawl continued even more mild and more persuasive such measures are the mechanisms that make slaves of people that sap their initiative and fill them with fear his gaze at xenu leveled his voice be came very firm these are the mechanisms of tyranny and oppression and right minded citizen would ever permit them they are the tools of the sly slavemaster and every one of these measures is stench in the nostrils of free men an abrupt rolling shout of approval burst from the hall he stood very straight the executive branch is regarding populations as domestic cattle to be milked for taxes and the pay ment of loans you are earmarking and branding them with enforced identity cards you are even teaching them in schools that they are animals you do not own them they are not your herd they are free human beings not economic slaves or gov ernment property and any government that violates this fact cannot end in any thing but destruction of both itself and the people this is not opinion this is his tory cheers and applause rolled through the congress savagely xenu cut into it these measures were vital he struck the gong hard for order here i will call witness he gestured behind him and to the crier the crier stood master lord lieuten ant zel chief of the secret police of earth appearing as witness for the ministry of policethe curtains parted and zel came forth he was dressed in greygreen uniform glittering with braid he came to xenus right and stood there black eyes shifting his weasel face suspicious the only way to handle crime said zel is to be able to lay your hands on anycitizen at any time men are all basically criminal without identity cards without the most detailed dossiers for police blackmail came shout from the hall the most detailed dossiers tinued zel without passports to cut down crimi nal travel police work would be utterly im possible youre causing the revolt someone shouted zel struggled on you cannot handle crime wave unless you consider every citi zen potential criminal and you have to have fingerprints of everyone to identify missing persons and bodies laughter from the hall drowned out what he was saying he had not been prepared for this much opposition he looked sideways at xenu looked at the congress and then backward step by backward step he got to the curtains and vanished xenu was hard eyed he clamorously struck the gong he gestured urgently to ward the curtains and the crier the crier caught his cue master lord chu executive president of the galactic interplanetary bank presenting testimony for the treasury the curtains slipped apart and fat pudgy man very much like pig slid for ward his civilian clothes were quite plain but he wore four diamonds in his tie and huge diamond on each hand he was very nervous and was twistingrevolt in the stars 14 the rings on his fingers i am very honored for the privilege to address the congress of loyal officers doubtless he repressed giggle this slight misunderstanding can be cleared up you see and he didnt succeed in repressing the giggle this time you see the confederation is not solvent it has hepaused and looked very pleased very bad debts er loyal officer leaped to his feet in the hall it was completely solvent at the time of the last congress chu nodded energetically well yes perhaps it was solvent then but only on the surface the bills for the grey invasion were not all counted up and the treasury was very empty and so i i mean the treasury proposed personal income tax oh yes it very much eased things rawl looked at him calm assured these petitions show that personal income tax has caused wild inflation on every planet and has brought about economic stress the government takes the money of individuals and companies before it can be invested or enter commerce wages and prices have had to be doubled tripled quadrupled to compensate for this loss ofincome inflation and increased public debt has followed with flurry of ring twists and wrig gle chu said all the very best economists recommended it i am sure but this is state matter i am more concerned with any effort to abolish personal credit files and ratings you see bank back in the hall loyal officer was on his feet as chairman of the loyal offi cers economic committee i wish to re mind you that banks were perfectly capable of handling their loans and affairs and pros pered well before this enforced individual credit file system was instituted your business is with your customers and pends on your judgment not upon somespider web espionage system that pries into the lives of every citizens finances well said chu well yes i dare say you have point i er hasten to as sure you that banks are not an official part of the government and er possibly have right invading privacy but he had his own point to make and he firmed up andshot it at them but when the government needs money it always has to come to the bank and with this petty triumph he dived back through the curtains xenu furiously banged on the gong to still the laughter i suggest said xenu this congress get about its proper business the executive orders have been passed they are in effect they were undertaken under the authority of the emergency powers granted to the ex ecutive in its last session more police bet ter means of identification and more tax money are vital to suppress this growing revolt these crime waves this unruly population must be gotten under control he smashed his clenched fist down on the desk he recovered himself bit he was sure of his ground he knew he was right for one of his virtues was that he always knew he was right matter what he did they are legal orders personal income tax was necessary to replenish the treas ury identity cards and passports were vital to check crime they exist as orders they are legal and in force under the emergency powers rawl smiled tolerantly not so hur ried your excellency the law of the gal axy is formed by this congress the situa tion is very plain this evidence spread be fore says very eloquently that inflation and crime have followed those orders he turned his back on the rostrum and addressed the hall the flaw in all those enormous personal files being gathered isrevolt in the stars 15 that they are obtained by newly active cret police the credit and identity files of individuals are stuffed with false reports lies that are never questioned when the file of an individual has been so corrupted he can longer obtain work he is ruined person with false file has choice but to turn outlaw and criminal as you well know the criminal ranks hideouts and lairs are swelling out of control and directly as result of these measures the criminal does not have to show an identity card to the person he robs or kills only decent citizens are being regulated and as to inflation other wiser meth ods and economies can be found to handle it mutter of agreement and applause came from the hall the way to handle possible revolt he continued is not more oppression more police revolts start with oppression and because of repression the government frantically adds more repression and gets more revolt and so it goes on until either the state or the people die history has shown that the way to handle threatened revolt is to remove utterly fully and com pletely all possible reasons for revolt at once laws of government that do not stem from the desires and wishes of the people cannot be enforced and must not exist rawl took long breath it was now or never i therefore move that the emergency powers of the executive be cancelled and all executive orders be declared null and void the shock wave of ayes and cheers hit xenu like blow and as the bedlam tinued he sank from bitterness into sup pressed rage the crowd had been standing for hours on the outside steps of the congress hall waiting waiting suddenly the big pa horns blared the motion has passedfor an instant the crowd was still then they exploded into deafening roar of cheers some leaped in the air others danced an old lady just continued to stare at the pa horns and then sank down against the wall and began to cry tears of relief for it meant her two grandsons imprisoned for not paying accurate tax would be freed the waves of cheering and dancing feet churned about her the factory cafeteria where workers had been eating their evening meal was suddenly struck to silence by the pa the lunchroom exploded into frenzy of cheering plates food and all sailed into the air they jumped on tables and began to dance and shout foreman raced up the curving stairs to the time keeper room and jabbed frantic ally at

flashily dressed young man tried without much success to keep her from being knocked off her feet lady min shouted reporter as the supreme rulers mistress would you say xenu was pleased ap tried to field the question lady min is the greatest actress in the galaxy she does not meddle in politics gentlemen would you please another newsman shouted is it true rawl accused xenu of trying to stir the planets to revolt and another lady min would you say the women will be pleased and yet another did xenu say he was planning vacation on the summer sat ellite lady min had edged backward and backward trying to keep herself all in one piece her red evening gown was pulled askew on one shoulder her red spar klestudded shoes had been stepped on the jeweled flower in her hair had been pulled back of one ear the din was hard on her ears ap she shouted stars and spotlights handle them ap groaned in ten years i never had to handle wild animal act suddenly he saw that she had her back to an executive office door and her hand was already turn ing the latch to open it behind her where are you going lady min slid through the door and be fore any pressure could be put on it banged it shut ap promptly stepped in front of it and held up one hand while he fished in his bigchecked jacket for sheaf of releases fanfare of hands began to grab at them lady min sagged back against the door from the other side still came the mutter of the commotion in the hall she was limprevolt in the stars 17 what had she gotten herself into the commands of the supreme ruler in the past few years had become absolute three weeks ago he had simply sent an order to the theater that she was appointed his tress and why he hated women appar ently couldnt stand to touch one had she said there was telling what would happen to her the government lately had way of ruining anyone who said so even though ap beat his brains trying to find way around it here she was she looked about her this was one of xenus executive offices it was splendidly ornate in red velvet and gold it had bar black table in the room center with some sort of computer panel in its top and couch that faced the windows its back to the room it was the couch that caught her weary eye and she moved toward it one of her glittering red leather shoes came off its strap broken in the inter views but she let it lie and limped on across the room exhausted she dropped down on the couch the back blocked her view of the room the wide windows gazed out on the evening city she started to light cigarette and then let it fall back in the tray she put finger under the gold band at her throat and loosened it her eyes lingered on bracelet that bore the enameled picture of the preme ruler and then tore it off her wrist and dropped it on the floor she stared at the ceiling and let out long sigh what had she gotten herself into in her many years on the stage beginning when she was five she had been in some commo tions some remarkable ones but seldom anything even approaching this the play had closed mainly because she had had to leave the cast but partly because of public disturbance the broadcast series she was going to do had been suspended due to her being ordered to the palace and xenu hadin the underworld if not amongst the popu lation very unsavory reputation vague whispered about never specified what crazy bent had caused him to suddenly or der someone to become his mistress ah well tomorrow would tell evening was gradually turning into night she turned on her side and stared out at the stars dimmed by the celebrations and lights of the city farfrom guessing that there lay her immediate destiny the latch of the door to xenus quar ters rattled and the door swung open much in the way one would shoo chicken xenu pushed chu before him xenu shoved the door shut with his cane and snapped on the lights by jabbing it at the switch he looked at the bar the ta ble the hall door the back of the couch was toward him satisfied he limped to the table and lowered himself into the chair be fore the computer chu was in an uproar he was twisting so hard at his rings that he appeared to be taking his fingers off its ruin said chu its ruin i tell you ruin without personal credit files or identity papers we will never be able to locate debtors and persuade them into paying xenu showed slightest sympathy crush them into paying blackmail them into paying you mean chu agitatedly gestured at chair for permission to sit and then wriggled into it you promised i promise nothing said xenu sharply then he relaxed i brought you here my piggy little friend to give orders not to make promises with sly lift of his eyebrows chu said remember it was my ideas and sug gestions that got all the money into the treasury yes and now it will have to be paidrevolt in the stars 18 back and exactly how we make up the lit tle commissions that were spread around amongst us is problem and dont forget that it was your idea because it was bad one chu began to sweat bit in alarm one could never tell about xenu but xenu was not there to engage in idle conversation we have business to do the congress has put over and the whole executive branch guard committee on finance without their authorization the government cannot spend single credit this was their method of paralyzing anysecret action i might take they could not remove as every action i took was com pletely legal under the emergency powers but there is an election next year chu flinchedprecisely we will all be retired to the scrapheap and dont think that because you are banker you will be overlooked it is not beyond possibility that under new supreme ruler they will look into some of your loans and connections they might even discover how you use billions of pub lic funds to improve the surroundings of your private holdings they might even find how much public money you had us spend to completely rehabilitate asteroids so that you could put resort hotels on them and pocket said chu nervously you dont have to push into despair with it my doctor good said xenu then we under stand one another he promptly began to punch buttons on the table computer and view screen it flared green and the green light shining up ward glowed on their faces xenu muttered as he pushed buttons about two billion for renegades another four billion to secretly rehire the secret po liceapprehension began to mount in chu as he watched the dancing figures the minimum amount said xenu looking at chu is one trillion galactic credits shock made chu twist ring so deeply it cut him in private funds said xenu traceable chu did not speak he was incapable of it for the moment with long expert finger xenu began to punch buttons again and the figures again started to race across the computer in creasing the amount said chu he gathered his wits and gradually took on sly calculating attitude and my credit systems youll get them back said xenuand the use of public treasury to im prove my private holdings of course said xenuwith well being slowly seeping through him chu said trillion galactic credits untraceable funds and accounts he got up and minced to the door he looked back at xenu and humming to himself opened the door chi came through it very gloomy listless chi he closed the door after chu and wandered over to the middle of the room xenu pried himself erect with his cane and limped to the bar he was smiling more cheerful than he had been for days he took down bottle and began to prepare drinks chi gloomily followed him to the bar he let out deep sigh we are crashed xenu uttered short vicious laugh and continued to pour drinks not so my friend the game has not ended it has only now begun the handkerchief chi was using to mop his face halted at the side of his jutting jawrevolt in the stars 19 he was not quite bright enough to take this in he looked stunned but its only matter of time until they depose you certainly within the yearand my files theyve ordered to stroy my files and erase my computers xenu pushed drink toward him and spoke casually there are other files you can destroy and plenty of useless comput ers you can erase chi did it ever occur to you that you now have file on every criminal renegade and psychopath in this entire galaxy he sipped his drink lov ingly and have you ever thought at one time or another what splendid secret force they would make uncertainly chi took hold of the drink the concept finally got through to him he raised his eyebrows and started to lift the glass in toast but horrible thought oc curred to him but this will take money and all fi nances are cut off have you ever asked renegade how much he indeed i have said xenu but target we will have more than adequate funds private secret the illustrious minister of police stirred it around in his mind and then began to get the idea xenu put down his glass all business and so we reoccupy the bases destroyed and abandoned after the grey invasion we recruit every renegade we can lay our hands on we train and equip and on one certain day few months hence we will chi hastily got out pad and pencil and eagerly started to write these orders down xenu knocked the pad up he began to move back to the black table leaving his drink behind him notes this is totally secret you will even have to develop your own codes and transmissions you can trust only those on whom you have definite blackmail he sat down in his chair this will take very careful planning simultaneous strike coordinated on all planets under xenus finger the green com puter face lighted up there will be loyal officers left to object and especiallyno galactic commander rawl especially norawl this pleased him and he stabbed the buttons viciously they wanted re volt well give them revolt did you know chi that all revolts start from the top its an historical fact chi grabbed his arm xenu looked up in some annoyance and then followed the line of chis glare on the floor midway between the couch and the sofa lay glittering red shoe chis hand darted to the hidden blaster under his coat xenu restrained him and silently began to rise from his chair he walked cat footedly over to the back of the couch he looked down on lady min her eyes were closed as though asleep but her breast was heaving bit rapidly he reached down and suddenly grabbed her hair with savage wrench he yanked her to her feet she backed up toward the window ive been asleep he curled his lip and by that you confess you heard every word she got her hair loose and tried to run she stumbled and crumpled into heap xenu leaped after her he yanked her to her feet and i suppose your first thought is to contact rawl you corrupted bitch you filthy whore he shook her violently this is what i get for taking you in his voice rose to scream you were supposed to bring popularity terror was giving away to anger in lady min she gave him level lookrevolt in the stars 20 popularity is earned not bought the cane came up and struck hershe went sprawling into the corner back of the hallway door knocked out the blaster was in chis hand he made gesture to xenu to get him out of his line of fire please move bit your excellency so i can get clear shot xenu took his eyes off the crumpled figure slowly he was gathering his wits taking competent estimate of the situa tion mo we dont want another scandal the pigs of this galaxy have been fed enough he hobbled over to the table motioning to chi to put away his gun call doctor stug robotize her said chixenu nodded several times deper sonalize her with neurosurgery the thought pleased him drag her to her roomput her under guard he laughed she might even be some fun chapter five lady mins bedroom was very ornate affair it looked out across the sprawling nightlit city mirrors that could be adjustedto different angles reached from ceiling to floor all about the walls one mirrored door led into the hallway another into large bathroom huge boudoir table ornate with gold frames stood beside the bed full communications panel and screen glit tered in the wall lady min lay sprawled upon the bed where they had thrown her she started to rise and winced she felt gingerly at her head where the cane had struck her panic was rising in her but she steadied it down this was time to go to pieces she had illusions whatsoever about the trouble she was in or her possible fate the rumors in the underworld aboutxenu could not be without foundation unsteadily she removed her ruined gown and walked over to the wash basin at the boudoir table she took wet towel and began to sponge the bruised area above her ear the sharp knock at the door was fol lowed at once by key grinding harshly in the lock doctor stug opened the doorin the hall behind him nurse wheel table and guard were waiting stug closed the door and advanced into the room he was tall man dressed in black civilian clothes his pointed beard and ribboned eye glasses gave him veneer of professionalism as xenus private psy chiatrist he had had great deal of practice in deception his left hand was held behind his back i just came to see if you were all right said doctor stug lady min laid down the towel and looked alertly at him the tilted mirror beside the door clearly showed his back it disclosed as well the narcotic pistol he was hiding pistol good for hundred shots anythingup to ten feet which guaran teed day or more of unconsciousness these petty lovers quarrels said doctor stug tch tch i have known xenu for long long time and he may get angry but he quickly forgives quickly for gives i wouldnt doubt that it will be all made up by bed time he began to move forward slowly eas ily why you seem to have bruise on your cheek well well we can do some thing about that at least lady min looked at him and then pointed to her cheek she winced and began to walk toward him unsteadily it is bitrevolt in the stars 21 swollen but really i feel very faint she came close to him presenting her cheek can you see if anything is broken she stumbled and her left hand flew up as to balance herself instinctively stug reached for her with his free hand lady mins right lashed around to his back she jerked the hidden gun outward so that it pointed at his side her thumb depressed his finger on the trigger tiny white puff hammered through the cloth of his coat stugs eyes flew wide dazed his mouth opened and he slowly slumped for ward his head hit the rug lady min knelt over him and disen gaged the narcotic pistol she fumbled with the slide and then got it cocked again softly she said youre not so differ ent from any stagedoor jackass doctor stug she checked the slide pulled his coat collar open and pressed the muzzle against his bare neck have good days sleep brain sur geon the muzzle jumped and puff of white smoke eddied up from it she tossed an apprehensive look at the door she knew there were guards there not only the one who would come with doctor stug but also door guards xenu would not neglect that she sped to her closet and yanked out large flowing night robe she threw it over stug and quickly adjusted it to cover all of him and his shoes moving fast she went to the communi cations console she knelt before it and hastily pushed buttons its screen blurred and flashed urgency and some panic was catching up with her long way away in the city ap wasflopped over bar in honkytonk grip ping drink listening languidly to girl who sang soothingly in front of the band ragged buzz came from his pocket and with bored sigh he took out flat small com munications unit with tiny view screen his calm vanished when he saw dishev eled lady min appear on it her voice was sharp and tinny through the tiny receiver ap where is rawl ap blinked and got his mind into focus what spectacular question he left for planet earth about sunset the congress is over you youve got to contact himaps hand on the receiver began to shake we got banner headline trouble i can tell hell take days in flight thats out look ap get out to the spaceport fast and get my spaceyacht ready for instant take off quick quick the honkytonk music increased in volume but lady min they just changed your pilot there was sharp click as the commu nications receiver went off ap steadied himself against the bar hot smoke she rang off well here goes tomorrows headlines maybe he let out shivering sigh future zero he jammed his communicator into his pocket it seemed to him that the music was actually shriek he collected himself threw one credit note on the bar and tottered out toward the door in the bedroom lady min rose from the console she stared at stug on the floor and quieted her rapid breathing she rushed to the bathroom and turned on its light she opened faucet until the water roared she left the bathroom door crack open and made sure lights could be seen from theroomrevolt in the stars 22 narcotic pistol in hand she sped over beside the main entrance door positioning herself so that when it opened she would bebehind it she was breathing rapidly and carefully steadied herself down she pulled back the slide on the narcotic gun and hefted it she took deep breath slowly she unlatched the door and let it drift open couple of inches she raised her chin and in not too good imitation of stugs voice called nurse with clatter and bang the door was shoved open from the outside by the wheeled stretcher pushed by the nurse and flanked by the guard they saw the covered body on the floor and pushed the stretcher on into the room the guard dressed in the greygreen of the secret police gripped his blast rifle at ready and looked about the nurses head was covered with white scarf her shirt was bluestriped and whitecuffed and she wore voluminous white skirt she looked at the body on the floor and then at the partly opened bath room door noted the running water and smirked have some fun for yourself first doc she said with her palm lady min swung the hall door shut at the sound of the latch the nurse started to turn with one step forward lady min pressed the muzzle of the narcotic gun against her neck and fired the secret police guard whirled and started to raise his blast rifle to firing posi tion he opened his mouth to shout lady min worked the slide of the pis tol and jammed the narcotic gun in the direc tion of his open mouth she pulled the trigger and white puff of smoke eddied around his suddenly slackjaws as he crumpled she grabbed the blast rifle to keep it from clattering on the floor and eased it to the carpet she silently slid home the bolt on the bedroom door she sagged against the wall gasping with relief stars and spot lights she breathed she realized she wasnt out of there yet and it would only be matter of min utes before the guards outside the door would begin to wonder what was going on she went to the peephole port in the door uncovered it and looked at its lens there were two guards in the hall one was standing indolently beside the door the other was sitting in chair across the hall his blast rifle held between his knees while he fished in his pockets for lighter an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips the rest of the hall was empty lady min closed the view port she took the guard by the shoulders and with considerable effort dragged him into the bathroom she went back and knelt besides the nurse laying the narcotic gun on the floor she urgently began to strip the nurse of her clothes first the scarf then the skirt then the shoes and finally the blouse dear god it was lucky the nurse was trifle big ger than she was working fast and frantically she shortly had the now naked nurse dumped in the bath tub stug with exertion that was most too much for her laid out on the stretcher and the blast rifle under him dear god it was also lucky that he wasnt too big man she pulled the cover sheet over his form obscuring him utterly she climbed into the nurses clothes and then with two darting trips to look at the nurses face she converted her own nose mouth and hair line to similarity she adjusted the nurses scarf and looked at herself in the m irror she inrevolt in the stars 23 spected herself carefully and then nodded she opened drawer in the boudoir and grabbed handful of rings and her wallet and stuffed them inside her shirt bosom she picked up the narcotic pistol and went into the bathroom working the slide rapidly she pumped an additional shot into the guard and another into the nurse she came back to the stretcher picked nightgown off the floor and threw it care lessly across the stretchers foot she looked around the room closed the bathroom door locked it and sailed the key under the bed silently she unbolted the main entrance door she took one final look around the room drew long breath to steady herself and then with one hand on the bottom rail of the wheelstretcher she swung the door open with hard yank she sent the stretcher sailing out into the hall stepped after it and slammed the door the guards stiffened the one nearest it looked at the closed door and then at lady min wheres the other two lady min looked at him sneeringly she had heard the nurse speak and hoped her voice now sounded like it the fun they had made little mess theyre clean ing it up so old xenu wont notice phagh doctors the guards leered and looked at the door lady min jabbed her finger authorita tively at one of the guards call an ambu lance to the south door she glared authori tatively at the other one give hand with this stretcher chapter six standing beside the spaceyacht his ears assailed with the whine of ships and rattling clatter of the hangar ap was gradually losing seven years of his growth the sweat ran damply down one side of his forehead and he dabbed it off with gaudy handker chief the spaceyacht designing was black with white diagonal stripe and while it might have very nice appointments it left lot to be desired for long voyages and just now it was only about an eighth full of fuel ap stared out across the expanse of space port toward the administration tower he didnt know what he was watching or waiting for and he expected the area to erupt with guards any instant the pilot was lounging under the stub wing of the craft one foot indolently resting on the sloped landing ramp which extended from the side of the fuselage he was new pilot he had just been assigned some of his time in the last twentyfour hours had been spent in wondering what happened to the man he replaced what he had done to throw him out of

well its safest to have full fuel tanks go ahead fill her whythey may want to take grand tour sightseeing amongst the satellites look youre just new here when you serve at this stellar level of command chain take it from ap be prepared for anything doubtfully the pilot moved over to the head of the ship and waved lazy hand at passing fuel and air truck ap went on staring toward the admini stration building chi prowled along the palace hall one had to keep ones eye on everything these days you couldnt trust anybody to dorevolt in the stars 24 anything also they didnt keep him in formed the way they should only few minutes ago he had heard that lady min had been taken away by ambulance which was peculiar as there was complete oper ating room right here in the palace specially installed by xenu for exactly such emergen cies he looked at the guard outside lady mins door why are you still on guard here havent they gone the guard started and straightened up stiffly it made one nervous just to see chi much less to be talked to by him yuh yuh they took her out but the brain banger and one of my guys are still in there straightening up chi didnt like it he stood for mo ment and then suspiciously slid the door open there was nobody in there he in stantly drew his gun and stepped sidewise through the door catfooted he approached the bath room door flipped the knob found it locked he stepped back and crashed the flat of his foot against the door just beside the knob it flew openthe guard lay sprawled on the floorthe nurse lay naked in the tubthe guard stood jaw open looking in and then something like terror came into his eyes as he shifted them to chi he had very good idea what would happen to him now chi thrust the guard violently aside and rushed out into the hall shouting ap heard the siren before he saw the ambulance and for sweating instant was certain that it must be police car the white vehicle shot across the field dived into the hangar and siren dying spun about and pointed its nose toward the han gar door with squeal it backed to the rampon the run the driver and attendant raced back to the rear ambulance doors and flung them open ap was hastily trying to put the pieces of this together he saw nurse step out and if she hadnt moved her hand toward him briefly only in way lady min would do he wouldnt have known who it was the driver and attendant rolled the stretcher toward the bottom of the ramp and would have rolled it straight on up into the ship had it not been for the pilot barring the way the pilot frowned what the rockets is this he came on down the ramp to the bottom and reached for the cover at the top of the stretcher lady min chopped at his hand why dont you call xenu and find out he frowned and again reached for the corner of the sheet this time lady min used the side edge of her hand on his wrist i know all about little boys who cant keep their hands off unconscious girls you pervert ap had it now he rushed forward come on come on theres little time to lose and he gave the stretcher perilous push up the ramp if he hadnt jumped aside the pilot would have been knocked down the driver and attendant pushed with will and with roar of wheels the stretcher flew on up the ramp and into the fuselage of the spaceyacht sullenly the pi lot followed it ap came to the spaceyacht door as the driver and attendant trotted back down the ramp thank you fellows ap called afterthem greatest drive in history pretty near xenu wont forget this the ambulance men waved back to him climbed into their vehicle and shot off the pilot pulled the ramp closed andrevolt in the stars 25 walked doubtfully to the pilot seat his eyes wide with unanswered ques tions ap looked at lady min she shook her head at him and pushed the stretcher down the aisle of the ship toward cabin at the tail languidly the pilot was obtaining his clearance from the tower he checked over the instrument panel and began to start the motors take off yelled ap get this thing spaceborne the ship lurched and began to roll forward slowly lady min got the stretcher fully inside the rear cabin and began to lash it to cleats in the wall ap banged the cabin door shut and lifted the sheet at the head of the stretcher he gulpedstug he stared at lady min why him this is stug xenus chief brain banger can this rust can get to earthearth thats days away

before they get out of range bank robbers the officer made up his mind and gestured at his sergeant stop that ship the four muzzles of the battery swept down into firing position long streaks of red flame sped from them in staccato roar inside the ship ap struggled forward up the aisle against the heavy acceleration he tapped the pilot on the shoulder if youll just set course he gaped as ribbons of flame shot by in front of the wind screen the pilot whipped his head around to the side window and looked back at the rapidly receding field the red boom of gun fire flashed in his eyes his face went grey without second thought the pilot turned back to the control panel his glance centered on pilot eject his hand stabbed hysterically at it the pilot seat and the panel beside it tilted violently over the white smoke of the ejection explo sion puffed around the pilot in long graceful arch the pilot sailed out into the atmosphere and began to tum ble ap screamed come back herethe

aisle loose objects thudded and banged about the ship the passing hurricane velocity air made the small holes in the fuselage whistle and scream like maniacs lady min looked at the holes she re alized that when they hit space they would lose all their air she braced herself and pried open locker she brought out roll of tape and dragged herself to the side of the ship stripping off chunks of the adhesive withher teeth she began to patch the holes the ship steadied out continued its vertical headlong course for who knows where chapter seven the ship rocked gently as its autopilot corrected against gravitic pulls the aisle between the two couches was littered with empty food cans which clinked together as the ship moved crumpled wads of note paper littered the floor between the two couches ap took one last look at the navigation manual and resumed staring at the ceiling dropping the manual into the litter of the floor guy that wrote that navigation manual ought to get top

the satellite where large hangar doors were sliding open two pilots in the hangar watched its approach one of them took closer look at it and then slid his blast pistol into its hol ster and buckled the flap dismissing the situation ah its just some fool spaceyacht that lost its way the other dropped his chin on his speaker button inside his space helmet dull dull dull excitement at all since the congress crime doesnt pay anymore they turned and sauntered through the airlock door and shut it behind them the spaceyacht came to rest on the hangar floor the big red lights which said air began to flash the hangar doors ground down and sealed themselves with grating clank the hangar warning light went green and flashed safe atmosphere the landing ramp from the yacht fell into posi tion with crash cleaning man and cleaning woman old and not much surprised at anything gathered their mops and buckets together and shuffled toward the ramp an officer in blue and whitefatigue uniform lounged up against the craft lady min and ap highly excited and urgent scrambled out of the ship and ran down the ramp the officer smiled toler antly thumbs hooked in his belt cap on theback of his head he negligently waved his hand to indicate the direction they should take and leading off escorted ap and lady min into the now open airlock which led deeper into asteroid interceptor base 62 the cleaning couple watched them go and then shuffled up the ramp with their mops and bucket they paused at the port and gazed atthe littered wreck well well looks like they had quite party said the old woman she chuckled toherself the cleaning man walked through the litter kicking at it and approached the cabin doors at the rear of the ship he tried to open door and found it locked he sighed reached to the key ring in his belt laboriously sorted out master keyand finally got it unlocked just as he was about to touch the knob it was twisted from within the door was yanked inwarddoctor stug disheveled savage his professional calm left far behind him loomed in the doorway he glared around when he saw the cleaning man and woman were the only occupants he quickly read justed his expression ah thank you my good man stugs eyes lighted on the communica tions console in the pilot compartment and he hastened up the aisle where are we he said to the cleaning woman as he passed is this an interceptor station the old woman chuckled these people who used yachts certainly were something to laugh about interceptor station 62 close as youll ever get to it laughing to herself she got busy with her broom sweeping the litter together doctor stug tensely and expertly punched series of buttons on the commu nication console and then slid into the chair before it he adjusted the hypersound dial for distance and then triggered the two but tons which turned on scrambler the screen lighted up was jagged for moment its lines snapping and smashing into each other it cleared and picture of chi came on chi glared at his own screen before him and then recognized who it was he snarledrevolt in the stars 28 impatiently stug where the crap have you been for month stug pulled the mike toward him looking deadly time for tales the lost ones are at interceptor space station 62 just arrived shock spread over the face of chi thats commanded by loyal officer he paused his eyes darting about then he looked back at his own viewscreen and cunning look which he thought was persua sive came over his face stug we have ways counted on you youre counting on now to the tune of hundred thousand credits right righti suggest you send hyperspace inter ceptor here at once said stug manned with couple of reliable men of course i dont like asteroids all right said chi he added fero ciously they must not talk stug smiled they wont talk he said smoothly and consolingly the white doves imported to decorate the chambered gardens of the otherwise bleak asteroid and also to fall dead if air pollution rose dangerously flitted about from perch to perch the whir of their wings mingling with the artificial waterfall it was beautiful garden but in the opinion of lady min and ap was place to spend two days of idle waiting they sat on seat beside heavily grilled door very strong in the black rock true they had been able to clean them selves up even though changes of clothes had been offered them but two days of waiting despite the urgent notes they had sent the base com mander was creating mystery that pressed their spirits the door opened and whitecoated servant entered carrying tray he walked over to them and set his burden downlady min caught at his sleeve as he turned to leave wait listen said ap weve been waiting two days to see the base commander he cant be that busy the servant shrugged and went out closing and barring the door behind him i guess you get that way on an aster oid base said ap lady min stared at the barred door ap something must be wrong i feel it why should loyal officer keep us wait ing i sent him messages that you were the greatest actress in the universe and had vital data he looked defensive maybe im flopping as press agent probably they sank back hopelessly ignoring the luncheon tray some hours later the bolts grated and the door opened an officer uniformed in blue and white entered followed closely by uniformed guard who held his blast rifle at ready coolly the officer said the base commander will see you now ap looked at the guard the blast rifle held at ready its safety lock off future zero he whispered to himself the officer escorted them through the long tunnels and ramps which led up through the light gravity of the asteroid the base commanders office was spacious even for an asteroid base behind the desk was large illuminated chart of the home planet system with small patrol craft on pins the kidneyshaped desk was long but very narrow the base commander wasyoung guileless with the optimism of youth and bit bored he was uniformed in loyal officer khaki but his collar was open holstered blast pistol was belted about his waist but his hands folded behind his head as he leaned back in his chair showed that he considered the whole thing ratherrevolt in the stars 29 dull not even really amusing on his right sat doctor stug smiling smooth beside doctor stug and standing against the wall were two toughs in the greengrey and kepis of the secret police the corridor door burst in and lady min ap and their escort entered the scene was so different from any thing she had been anticipating that lady min stopped in shock ap tried to back hurriedly out of the doorway but was shoved forward by the guards rifle doctor stug smiled professionally and affably ah come in come in my dear dont be frightened these people wont hurt you he turned to the commander its certainly relief to know they can be taken back for the treatment they need poor things the base commander nodded absentlylady min advanced to the edge of the desk dont listen to him she jerked her head towards stug i am the lady min i must talk to you and quickly alone the base commander gazed at her lan guidly as i said poor girl said stug shes always had these paranoid hallucinations somebody after her messages of vast im portance i thought she had been cured and well there you are he began to rise so well put them back in the institu tion very sorry to have dont listen to him i am the lady min with bored smile the base com mander reached down to waste basket and pulled out newspaper spreading it on his desk he revealed front page picture of lady min the caption said lady min gives charity ball yesterday lady min was hostess to three thousand notables at ball for charity to stray children the photograph was very touched up press photo showing lady min with hugehead of hair and coronet the base commanders finger traced along the newspapers date then how is itlady min was on the capital planet threedays ago and you are here he tossed the newspaper aside and reclined back in his chair she doesnt even look like you lady min was getting furious with frustration thats wig you idiot and thats fake paper stug again started to rise well wed better be going she does bear some slight resemblance trades on it too both stug and the base commander were on their feet the base commander leaned forward with his knuckles on the desk well i suppose these things happen glad to be of assistance lady min put out her hand to stop him wait ill prove to you that im stage actress look what is that doing der your belt dear god let this thing work with her left hand she made pass over his belt buckle and then gracefully with her right hand appeared to pull dove out from be hind the belt buckle on the commanders stomach the dove began to fly away in mad flutter of wings her darting left hand flipped his holster open and then in fraction of second had transferred his blast pistol to her left thigh snapping her garter down on it and flipping her voluminous skirt over it all eyes were on the dove which pounded the air veered off from stug and finally came to rest on desk light stug rapidly interrupted anything the base commander was about to say yes she always amused other patients with that trick he gestured at the secret policeman who promptly took hold of lady min and ap and pushed them toward the doorrevolt in the stars 30 im certainly pleased with your coop eration commander said stug with your permission well be taking off now for home planet he shook the base com manders hand say by the way said the base commander i thought the secret central police had been disbanded oh those said stug i think theyre finding them other jobs as fast as they can poor devils soon theyll be out of work the economy being as it is well goodbye and thank you the base commander glanced at the dove and then back at stug you sure have some interesting patients well have safe trip few minutes later in the hangar the green sign safe atmosphere began to go on and off as the huge side ports exhausted and salvaged the hangar air the red sign air flashed on the hangar door began to grind open the police spaceship interior was grey green like any prison one secret policeman was at the controls while the other finished fastening the ramp lugs from inside stug shoved ap and lady min back down the aisle and slammed them into the two hard seats at the back of the ship par tial bulkheads were on either side of the seat and it was ordinarily enclosed with strong wire door shoulderheight thick straps were fixed to the seat back stug with gentle hands snapped the strap shut across aps chest and then turned to lady min she was shorter than the usual prisoner and the wide belt barely enclosed her shoulders stug tightened it with abrupt ferocity that will do until we get you trouble makers on an operating table said stug the ship surged forward with an as cending whine and zoomed out of the han gar into spacestug steadied himself and then reached for the cage door stepping outside the closure lady min looked up to her right into an area hidden from view from the forward part of the ship an expression of shocked horror and terror spread over her face she screamedmy god shrieked lady min time bomb the pilot sprang up from his controls and whirled to come back down the aisle the other guard froze in paranoid horror they very well knew their own service and they had slightest doubt that it was of ten in the state interest that prisoners notarrive alive time bomb screamed lady min they never intended us to reach there alive let out both guards were now rushing towards the back of the ship stug had ceased to close the cage door he threw it open fumbling with the lock and then thrust his head into the compart ment looking up toward the hidden spot lady min hitched the strap up to the level of her throat her hand darted to her skirt and yanked it up all in one motion she threw the safety catch of the blast pis tol and drew it from under her garter green violent flame hammered at stugs stomach pounding him back from the door with massive blow he went downthe nearest secret policeman skidded to halt he clawed at his holster lady min fired the shot took him on the left shoulder and spun him toplike his blast pistol flying up the aisle the second secret policeman reached frantically for the bulkhead gunrack and yanked down blast rifle he brought it to his shoulder aiminglady min firedrevolt in the stars 31 her shot slammed into the muzzle of the blast rifle fragments of the weapon disintegrated the guards head and shoulders in great gout of green flame smoke drifted and eddied along the floor and through the cabin of the police craft the three bodies lay inert pounded and charred out of recognition lady min stood up shakilytendrils of smoke spiraled up toward the air circulators and purifiers lady min gradually wound downap with considerable struggle got out of his strap and stood up steadying himself against the partial partition he coughed in the green fumes the ships motors continued in an ac celerating whine its nose bored relentlessly outward into the vast emptiness of outerspace ap sighed so now what do we do for navigation chapter eight rawl stood alone on the parade ground of galactic base earth the brisk wind from the deep blue sea snapped and rustled in the flags the paradeground was paved with white marble and surrounded by gilded and ornate balus trade in the far distance stood volcano the wind pushing its plume of smoke into horizontal banner ner the black mountain which contained the barracks vast hangars and work shops reared above the parade ground its face honeycombed with hangar doors from which could spring multitude of defense and attack ships as well as transports on the parade ground band brightly uniformed in blue and white played mili tary air the wind rippled rawls khaki helooked toward the two groups approaching him faint smile on his lips and trifle of unfriendliness in his eyes the first group was composed of the high ranking officers who had headed the earth secret police organization they were uniformed in greygreen with much gold braid zell head of the earth secret police advanced with outstretched hand well its farewell earth for us said zell as he shook hands rawls eyes were watchful so youre leaving us to return to the home planet departing today within the hour he looked around and sighed all in all we of the secret po lice have not been too unhappy here on earth he sighed and on arrival home well be disbanded fortunes of war said rawlthe secret police chief could not quite keep the viciousness out of his voice yes well that congress of yours finished us but its all for the best of course our eight regiments will be getting spaceborne right now so fortunes of war eh one by one the secret police executives shook rawls hand all in all rawl thought they were seedy lot for all their gold braid they bore the mark of their pro fession bit craven shiftyeyed and bauched rawl looked toward the second group these were civilians the heads of the per sonal tax collector units their chief shook his hand the tax clerks and staff all bid you farewell com mander rawl more personal tax hah hah rawl took his limp sweaty hand and shook it are all your clerks and investiga tors leaving as well yes weve pulled every one of them out of the two thousand cities of earth revolt in the stars 32 he gestured toward the looming base its back to home planet and unemployment for all of us the five civilian chiefs after him one by one shook rawls hand and followed the secret police executives toward the trances and ramps of the base but the tax chief could not resist final jibe he turned when some distance off watch your privacy doesnt get invaded rawl stood for some time watching them go his eyes narrow speculative the band ceased playing its drummer boys be gan to beat march and it moved off rawl walked over and leaned against the gilded balustrade his eyes still on the cliff face the transports began to eject from the hangars one by one then two by two then four by four at length rawl gestured toward communicator bring communications cart the cart rolled forward equipped with compact panels and view screen the communicator was pushing buttons on it bringing it to life as he wheeled it forward rawl picked up cubicle mike get solar system interceptor combined headquarters on uranus com mander mish the communicator reached across the cart pulled lever and hit red button while he waited rawl gazed at the panorama of departing ships their sound was punctuated with small explosions as they ejected from the hangars pulled up steeply and cracked the sound barrier the more distant ones flashed pinpoints of light as they cracked the light barrier after leaving atmosphere rawl gave his attention to the cart hello mish the view screen was trifle sunglared and the communicator adjusted its hood mishs face went clear he was smiling hiscollar was unbuttoned his cap was off and he was drinking from steaming cup he was very glad to hear from rawl hello rawl hows the good planet earth the secret police and income tax peo ple rawl said into the mike theyre leaving the planet about one hundred and fifty thousand of them well hip hurrah for them said mish sarcastically ill show you he turned the mike toward the cliff face mish stared intently at his own view screen thats sure lot of transport thats the point theyre taking every transport weve got but why didnt some of them stay here theyre being dis banded earths good planet ahrawl looked at the cliffs face again and the long extended parade of ships they took it too tame too cheerful in fact mish i wish to smoke i had some reliable intelli gence from home planet its too quiet im getting nothing from there and havent for couple of months you want to run patrolno that would tell us nothing what i want you to do is order every solar system station you have stock up on ammunition fuel food and spare parts got it good the day you can trust xenu will never dawn rawl hung the mike on the communications cart the wind whipped at the flags the long parade of departing ships made line across the sky that was black and ominous rawl didnt like it not one bit he set tled his cap against the tugging wind and continued to look at the sky chapter nine through the windscreen of the policerevolt in the stars 33 interceptor ship ap stared hopelessly at the onrushing planet thunder and lightning storm was raging in the lower atmosphere they were approaching it awfully fast i cant figure out what planet it is were long way from the solar system whatever star this planet belongs to its got atmosphere maybe even oxygen maybe the atmospheric flaps of the police ship were down bent and buckling the tips of the flaps were glowing incandescent the tips began to burn and the flicker ing light of the flame sputtered through the cockpit punctuated by the flashing of light ning in the storm they were now entering lady min was crouched down in her seat her head turned away from ap she was crying quietly to herself they were out of food out of water and their air tanks indicator was flashing danger red nothing about the secret police was right including their mucked up ships theres eject he stabbed again at the red emergency decelerate button he rocked the manual controls again they were limp the auto pilot had evi dently jammed in engaged buckle yourself in tighter on the bot tom side of this lightning storm is crash he looked sideways and saw that lady min was crumpled up in despair he reached over and tightened her straps the piercing shriek of the air rushing by made his nerves feel as though they were tearing apart belatedly deceleration cut in the storm was all about them the lightning cut ting jagged blades of blue and yellow flame from their burning wing tips danced inreflection across the windscreen the air appeared to be solid water as they struck into the torrents under theclouds ahead of them ap could see an ex panse of watersaturated jungle huge tree was rushing up at themit struck in an explosion of leaves and limbs the striking ship made an enormous geyser of mud he had recollection of how he got out of the ship short time later he came to himself crouching beside jungle path that was running torrents of water lady min was on the ground where he had placed her the drenching iciness of the rain brought him out of it he had idea what soever how he had gotten her out of the ship he bent over her felt for her pulse and looked in growing panic at her bloodless lips and white face searing flash of red flame was fol lowed with hammer blow of concussion asthe police ship exploded some distance from them he looked dazedly about him jungle jungle jungle jungle and rain he stared at the torrent of water going by them and realized at length that it was cart track turned into creek by the storm thunder rumbled the distance he could see grew slightly greater as the torrent lessened but still there was nothing but jungle jun gle jungle he gently picked up lady min and started down the cart track expecting at any instant to be pounced upon by wild beasts or snakes he walked along river bank his shoes collecting great globs of mud he found an other track broader one and trudged down it the thunder muttered in the far dis tance soaked exhausted and stumbling he did not see the wall until he collided with itrevolt in the stars 34 directly he backed up and stared at it yes it was wall greengrown and slimy but made out of rocks it was very high so high he could not see the top of it it reached from his left and from his right beyond any visibility then he saw that the cart track had ended at small square door itself almost obscured with vines he staggered toward it and fumbled for its latch future zero he sighed and pushed the door inward it was room of rough stone littered with odds and ends of metal there was huge block of stone which served as work bench or desk and sitting at it was hulking man in filthy undershirt the man did not look up ap swept some pieces of metal out of his way and placed lady min gently in the corner he shut the outside door the man still had not looked up but continued to work on the bent barrel of blast rifle which lay in pieces on the table before him are you the guys that crashed out there while ago he pushed the gun back in disgust stretched and yawned ap crossed over to the table might as well try what place is this what planet the man finished his yawn and rubbed his arms before looking up this planet this is the crummiest louseforgotten steambeamed ball of mud he swept lazy arm welcome to altec pearl of the southern galaxy welcome to stip gun running capital of the confederation haven of the suddenly he got angry halfrising from his seathe shook grimy grease smeared finger at ap you know what happened when that congress ripped up them oppress orders this place got to be condemned ripblasted graveyard thatswhat to aps relief the other mans anger faded the man sat back in his chair with deep sigh despair written on his face crime means guns explosives were broke finished some of the best outlaws in the galaxy quit us and went back to honest work he shook his head sorrowfully rallying he banged fist on the table sending gun parts scattering and aps alarm level up to high pitch bird dung he snorted the man flung an angry glare at ap and went back to fiddling with his gun well what the blast do you care ap shuffled his feet uncomfortably if only he were back home safe man looked nasty whos in charge here i am he muttered still working on his gun but in charge of what fourteen thousand brokendown crooks and ten bustedup ships he stabbed viciously at the gun then swung his arm in wide arc you see be fore you the great outlaw leader sna lord of stip but dont he added red eyes suspicious and tool jabbed toward ap for emphasis ask for job were so dead we stink losing interest sna returned to his gun get out of here go on into town he waved the tool over his shoulder to indicate back door boring boring boring nothing ever happened anymore and who gives damn anyway giving up ap turned back to lady min better check the town out if there even is town maybe kneeling down ap anxiously checked lady mins pulse its unsteady beatalarmed him as did the dead white of her face he looked back over his shoulder at sna and almost asked where doctor could be found but decided against it the man was ignoring him so pointedly he probablyrevolt in the stars 35 wouldnt have answered anyway he eased lady min into his arms and stood up carefully picking his way across the smoky room he reached the door and went through it shutting it sharply behind him outside the rain had stopped but the main street of stip before him was nar row curving river of mud ap grimaced in dismay hed had enough of mud he looked around to get his bearings the buildings were decayed obviously having passed their prime long long time ago crooked signs poked out from dilapidated shops couple of drunks were lying lost in stu porous slumber on flat stone slab that fronted sleazy bar wolflike and heavily fanged dog was walking up the street to ward ap it stopped to sniff drunk then moved on ap shuddered friendly place but where to nowhe studied the various signs and was thankful to see one that announced dr ax and next to it drug empo rium gently tightening his arms around lady min he made for the doctors house the door was partially open nearly falling off its hinges ap knocked and set tled himself against the casing to wait in side some bedsprings creaked shuffling footsteps approached bringing gaunt grizzled man with them go way grumbled dr ax as he successfully tried to close the door paus ing he peered at his callers you got money ap nodded and fished in his pocket the doctor peered more closely at lady min fine gal could do with more flesh on her bones looks pale though catching sight of bill in aps hands dr ax aban doned his trail of thought and seized the money ten galactic credits he jumped upand down hardly able to contain his excitement dregomine he proclaimed breath lessly is vitally necessary he shoved thebill somewhere in his jacket and pushed past ap heading for the drug emporium take her to the grand hotel he called back over his shoulder ill be right there ap glanced down the street to where it turned some hotel its sign had fallen off to lie in the debris beside some filthy steps wearily ap trudged toward it at least it would be warmer inside hopefully the lobby had once been fancy place now it sagged sadly in advanced disarray man lounged on divan busying himself with bottle not looking over as ap tered you got roomthe man just stared at the ceiling do i have room he laughed derisively when those income tax laws were in effectyou couldnt get room two hundred mil lionaires in this town to escape tax wine women money everywhere then they cancel the law the millionaires all go back home they dont need tax haven any more he shook his head and took gulp from the bottle annoyed ap repeated his question do you have room eyes still on the ceiling the man waved the bottle take any you can find want to buy hotel ap grunted and gazed around the lobby place sure was rundown he ob served even the elevators were out of order casting final glare at the hotel proprietor he proceeded up the stairs picking random door ap entered room despite the smothering dust it still clung to an air of cheaply imitated luxury twisted drapes flanked window that looked out over cloudy skies rooftops and stone battlements an unmade bed leanedrevolt in the stars 36 against peeling wall ap straightened out the covers laid the still unconscious lady min down on the bed and began to loosen her soaked icecold clothes dr ax having tracked aps muddy footprints waltzed into the room and threw his tattered bag down on the bedside table humming to himself the doctor pro duced package from somewhere on his person and ripped it open to reveal sy ringe filled with clear fluid he rolled up his sleeve and plunged the needle into his arm ap raised an eyebrow as the doctor pushed down the plunger and drew the nee dle out with convulsive shudder smiling brightly the doctor tossed the syringe aside now that the preliminaries are attended to lets have look at the littlelady after long examination of lady min accompanied by much bandaging and tune less whistling dr ax signaled for ap to follow him out of the room in the hallway ap closed the door be hind them patiently watching the doctor set his bag to rights shes got concussion three broken ribs and torn ligament in her arm and that will be another ten credits the doctor an nounced all in the same tone of voice ap glanced back at the door and fished bill out jerking it back teasingly as the doctor tried to snatch it and how long will she be laid up two or three months dr ap re plied attempting to grab the bill and if you give her your very best medical attention two months and if you had regular supply of your dregomine leaping high the doctor grabbed the note six weeks holding it lovingly hefairly drooled over the bill six weeks he whispered again if these hold out he added shadow of doubt crossing his wizened face ap pulled out another ten credit bill five weeks he said holding on tightly as the doctor tugged frantically at the bill five weeks echoed ax with vigorous nod the note released dr ax scuttled offreentering the room ap crossed over to the window and leaned on the sill weeks five of em and in the middle of nowhere that man sna was right this is steambeamed ball of oh damn chapter ten the music was awful broken for long time the juke box skipped and fumbled its way through the musical phrases one listened anyway early yet the hotels barroomcum nightclub had few occupants some bunged up oneeyed armed or legged outlaws lounged around the bartender leaned on hiscounter chin propped in hand black outfitted pilot sat alone in an alcove list lessly fingering handful of darts staring blankly at the wall before him the pilot spun the occasional dart at it bringing down flakes of plaster and insects near the mezzanine stairs group sat playing dice the bulk of the square chips spilled over beside ap the other players were having less luck their own meager piles of chips proved it greedily eyeing the pot they tensely waited for ap to throw disinterestedly rattling three of the eightsided dice ap had his mind else where worried frown marked his brow ashe turned to the doctor doc you said five weeks dr ax shrugged you got day left revolt in the stars 37 his frown more pronounced ap threw the dice reached out and pulled in the pot i think i had better go up and see if shes conscious yet the hotel proprietor halfrose in pro test as ap began to push his chair back hey you cant quit winner like that sna laughed hes going to wind up the richest man in stip he turned his leering face to ap want to buy gun running base suddenly reaching out and grabbing aps sleeve dr axs face was split in wide grin as he pointed to the mezzanine stairs following the doctors direction ap saw lady min there thin face pale against her gauzy red dress she steadied herself against the bannister as she carefully negoti ated the steps downwards little trium phant over her accomplishment she smiled shyly at ap and the others ap let out long breath of relief starting to rise again he stopped to look at his chips to the doctors shocked sur priseap shoved them at him then he upped and raced for the stairs ecstatic ap reached lady mins side he couldnt talk was afraid to touch her not knowing what else to do he whooped in delight and hugged the bannister the late afternoon crowds had drifted in brokendown outlaws smoked drank and argued among themselves the bartender was kept busy sloshing gutrotting liquor into everemptying glasses the dog ap hadseen weeks ago was there too lying beside the door just off the dance floor ap was ham mering out tune that had been popular in procongress days on beatup electric piano looking fully recovered and stunning in golden gown lady min was seated on thepiano mike in hand the song was one of longing to go places far away singing it with feeling lady min directed frequent meaningful glances across the room to where the pilot sat in his alcove but pilot tring ignored the song keeping his rapt attention on the roach covered wall before him he flipped dart skewered right through the middle cock roach scrambled its feet helplessly then expired as silently as it had lived smiling to himself tring settled back leisurely and raised glass to his lips burst of applause followed the songs conclusion lady min gracefully slid off the piano and bowed to her audience keeping her demeanor professionally charming she vented some of her pique in an aside to ap i dont believe hes hu man ap pokerfaced hardly moved his lips as he replied human or not hes the only pilot here that has spaceship that can get us to earth if its still there blowing last kiss to the cheering men lady min set down the mike and weaved her way through the overturned chairs to the end alcove paying attention whatsoever to the approaching vision the pilot just flipped dart as lady min perched provocatively onhis table she leaned over and spoke softly to him changed your mind about the char ter tring still didnt look up politics i hate he stated flipping dart galactic confederation i hate fliphe paused to consider moving target on the wall women i hate he added flinging the dart nonchalantly lady min pulled joined string of glittering jewels from her bosom to dangle them in the pilots face jewels she said soothingly are currevolt in the stars 38 rency in any galaxy response she sighed in discourage ment and put the jewels away getting to her feet she began to move back to the pi ano when the door across the room was burst violently open sna entered knocking the yelping dog flying strip of paper waving in his trem bling hand hey hey listen he shouted weve been saved the room went very still only the dog barking in outrage made any move ment overcome with jubilation sna barrelled forward to stand imposingly in the center ofthe dance floor i got special secret mes sage from the minister of police we been recruited every ablebodied man on this base has been made special agent and every ship we got has been put into federation service the hush in the room ceased abruptly outlaws leapt to their feet and surged for ward calling to friends and foe alike ex changing heated opinions and speculations few people however were not pleased one being tring who stood up wideeyed tense clenching his fists in an ger and trepidation he hissed furiously thats just one ship mine meanwhile lady min threw an ago nized glance at ap racking her brains she signalled her hastily construed plans to him he rolled his eyes future zero turning he moved to unobtrusively follow sna as the man ploughed through the surging throng toward the pilots alcove there you are pilot tring sna boomed all bonhomie just the man i wanted to see tring stared at sna hands fiddling nervously with his holster flap ripblasted phony whod he think he was not going to fork over my ship way you whatheres the message just came in sna brandished the paper under the pilots nose the whole blasted base every out law recruited in the service of the ministry of police high ranks high pay and every ship taken into service the pilot convulsively clutched the ta ble theres just one ship here mine unnoticed by either man ap slipped behind the pilot as trings voice rose to scream i wouldnt work for the condemned blasted confederation for anything unperturbed for he had an over whelming faith in his ability to get what he wanted sna laid pacifying hand on trings arm ah now now now not for thousand credits week easing pistol from under his jacket ap pressed it lightly into the pilots back tring kept his eyes riveted on sna who unaware continued his persuasions this is your chance this is all our chances why man theyll make you general or something by now ar had picked up the pilots jacket and was draping it over his arm and gun sna shook the paper vigorously all charges forgotten look look at the mes sage still tring had made move ap having completed the masking of the gun glanced up at the mezzanine where lady min stood she nodded at him wad of coats over her arm and two grip cases in herhand ap turned back to face sna and spoke convincingly in the pilots ear pilot tring it sounds pretty unreasonable i know but look tring this is your chance the pilot made reply just slitted his eyes as the gun jabbed him slightly in the back tring continued ap as an oldrevolt in the stars 39 friend please tell sna youll do him this favor swallowing spasmodically the pilot managed to choke out an all right in fact ap jabbed the gun again ill help pilot tring get his ship ready youll need it for transport lets go beaming overjoyed sna stepped back to let them pass steering the pilot over to the exit p began trembling with relief stage one of the escape plan done maybe fortunately the spaceport was serted lady min was standing anxiously in the boarding door of trings craft the coats and cases lay in heap beside her she chewed fingernail dear god let them come hearing running footsteps she looked down to see the pilot and ap running across the landing field she beckoned ur gently to them as they raced up the stairs tothe flight platform and stepped back as the two men crowded through the door tring hurried up the aisle and scram bled into the pilots seat hands reaching for the controls ap came to stand behind him gun now held openly through the windshield the blue of the late afternoon sky was pierced by the occa sional spire the tangible silence was bro ken only by the whine of the ships starting motors with lurch they took off the accel eration pressing the ships passengers down and back forcing ap to grab the copilots seat in order to keep his gun trained on the pilot suddenly the pilot began to laugh loud extravagant the sound mingled with the rising shriek of engines banking the ship again tring tried to still his laughter without looking back hefinally managed to speak you can put that gun away you didnt even need it you did huge favor getting out of there they would have killed for my ship startled lady min and ap stared at the pilot roundeyed in amazement then they too burst into laughter ap looked at his gun and put it away reaching over he clapped the pilot on the back guy must be all right take us to earth maybe chapter eleven surrounded by huge trees xenus cret base on home planet was dominated by single domed building low and ominous military drums beat deadly rhythm rank upon rank of grey green uniformed secret police fully armed lined the parade ground in military forma tions over by the operations

surethis base is still secret and secure chi mopped his brow with soaked handkerchief fool idea this inspection too hot for it damned question anyway xenu already knew his orders on security had been carried out to the letter weve shot anyone who comes close to it xenu nodded then were almost ready indeed we are chi agreed noting thankfully that xenu was starting to head for the operations building stopping before the band of renegadesrevolt in the stars 40 xenu banged his cane to catch the regard of one of the two slouching chiefs of the renegades and those men the renegade chief smiled evilly dis playing broken row of yellow teeth those are my finest renegades sir the finest and best criminals in the galaxy fit for deviltry and thousands more ready on every planet again xenu nodded and moved onhalting abruptly xenu turned back to the renegade chief get them in white coveralls they look like something from sewer obeying xenus next signal to follow him the chief sauntered along behind the rest of the party he scowled at xenus retreating back scowled at his deputy chief beside him steambeamed maniac must have loose screw in his finicky head lilywhite coveralls nuts ignoring the outbreak of ragged cheering among the renegade mob xenu led the way up the stairs and through the arched doors of the operations building the actual operations office was cated in the dome of the building the sloped walls painted with stars and plan ets served as an operations map and were studded with abundant miniature space ships and flags crouching below huge table was flanked on one side with three large rollers on the other side by rack stacked high with papers xenu entered the room banging the door wide as he came and limped across to the table the two secret police clerks standing rigidly to attention were waved brusquely aside putting his cane down xenu picked up hooked stick and turned to face his offi cers slapslapping the hook in his palm heregarded his officers for moment blackguards the lot of them but theyhad their uses oh yes they had their uses the men returned xenus regard alert and expectant though the animosity was mutual finally xenu began his address this is your last and final briefing listen care fully he reached out with his stick and hooked it into the ring of the lowermost roller this is phase one of the galactic wide action with savage yank he pulled out chart from the roller that spread itself out flat on the table he rapped the stick on the first pile of papers on the rack and those are the tailed orders ready to issue the objective of phase one xenu continued his voice losing all trace of its surface urbanity is the slaughter of every loyal officer in the galaxy grim and silent his men noddedreaching forward xenu engaged the second roller with his hooked stick phase two the destruction of the main galactic defense base on every planet brutally he yanked out the second chart so that it covered the first he rapped the second stack of papers and the tailed orders with nasty irritating screech the third chart was unfurledxenu struck the last stack of papers phase three the re moval of all minority and unwanted popula tions in the galaxy to the planet earth and their extermination slow smile crossed his face i think you will find this solves all problems of overpopulation crime and finance in the galaxy as well as preventing our being posed before minister chi issues the tailed orders are there any comments the momentary silence was broken by sardonic renegade chief youre the paymaster he sneered running hand through his hairrevolt in the stars 41 xenu glared the other down and you youre prime bastard indicating for chi totake over xenu retrieved his cane and stalked from the room favoring his bad leg on the parade ground the miscellane ous groups were breaking up regiments of secret police and bands of renegades marched purposefully towards assigned destinations drums quickening in pace the military ensemble also took their leave soon only the litter remained to bear the wind and the scattered guards company chi was standing on the roof silhouet ted against the stars his left hand held radio transmitter in his right the dial of stopwatch was il luminated by an electric lantern in his mind he reviewed the injunctions that xenu had given him concerning phase one missed anything didnt seem that way but still he glanced down at the stopwatch with maddening slowness the secondhand approached the appointed hour too late anyhow he clicked the stem of the timepiece and spoke into the radio phase one paring his nails with deeply notched knife one of the renegade chiefs sat in his dark unkempt office speaker near his head crackled to life phase one the chief lifted his chin to nearby flunky the aide disentangled himself from his chair and began to shuffle out the room vexed at the mans dawdling the chief threw his knife between the others feet get

xenus image briefly wave of acute dislike for the man passing through him there are lot of communica tion channels that dont seem to be working busy thought you might know xenu raised his eyebrows in innocent surprise is that so impatiently indicating an affirmative rawl raised his voice in vexation at the others playacting i wanted to be sure this wasnt another grey invasion ive heard nothing

but what faces echoing rawls apprehension two orderlies and communicator were standing nearby rawl swung round and spoke to the communicator maneuvers have you got any answer yet to why earth ships were not invited to take part the man shook his head perplexed hadnt been able to raise the damned shipslet alone get an answer rawl pointed at one of the orderlies pass the order to get my ship ready for immediate blastoff im going to do flyby and look this over the orderly up and raced off rawl glanced back up at the ceiling cant figure this out he frowned pounding an agitated fist into his palm

urgent the orderly was puzzled he didnt know who or what this lady was but some of her agitation had been communicated to him decisively he waved an arm for them to follow and raced out the room rawl slid into his interceptors pilot seat and strapped himself in the ships motors roared as he touched the starter eyes and hands roaming across the trol panel rawl readied the ship for take off while

hangar door was now opened all the way rawl pulled back on lever and the interceptor lurched forward to soar gracefully up into the cerulean heavens the bomb hit the base with an incan descent atomic

appointed government agents gmen with full official powers so saying he grinned like wolf albeit with trace of bulldog the renegade chief replied with wolfish grin of his own he knew opportu nity when he saw it xenu stamped his good foot for atten tion getting it he continued speaking the selection of these minorities is already determined however certain scientific judgement is required concerning others forthis reason we have appointed you the topleaders of the psychiatric profession the bearded men the psychiatrists in the group leaned forward expectantly hanging on xenus every word to handle the ultimate fate of norities and to decide who should be exter minated xenu paused theatrically then added magnanimity i know you will do so in fully scientific and dedicated man ner gravely

his hands of their binding and the little girl was down on her knees rocking her doll bruised and dirty tears coursed silently down her face she looked upward at the sky saw nothing there hugging her doll closer she began to whimper not understanding where she was or why the chief lightly held the electronic box its red lights glowed softly hypnoti cally face expressionless he moved his right hand

engulfed once thriving seaport leaving only few of the taller building tops showing over the swirling waters second wave formed preparing to finish what the first had left undone areas of rioting vegetation and forest became barren plains inhabited only now by the screaming winds the fair jewel earth had been brutally murdered casually the chief still held the elec tronic box his craft rocked little as if echoing the passing violence below through the windshield he looked down at earth its cloud formations now reddish uneven swirl also observing this view by way of dozen screens propped up around his of fice was xenu he tapped his fingers in time with the soft gentle symphony his office stereo was playing and took delighted sip of his longrevolt in the stars 54 cool drink it was overthe

chu the people are bottomless pit for taxes it can go on forever bot tomless pit sniffing superiorly he favored the banker with an arch look providing of course you back it up with heavily manned police force with secret police and treasury police and of course psychia trists to take care of any people who ob ject chuckling he gave chu reassuring pat on his chubby back police states never gobroke the populace maybe but not us not us slightly mollified but not convinced the banker giggled in reply across the hall an orderly placed sil ver tray on table occupied by xenu and some of his

our men in charge of the government on every planet planetary armies still obedient to us large bases left to bother us his hand slipped spilling quantity of li queur and congress to bother us they raised their crystal goblets aqua vitae twinkling in toast at that moment tiny shrill sound be came audible above the music and social buzzing like diving plane the noise swelled trifle curious but not too concerned chi and his piggy friend ceased their talk and looked upward listening renegade men in the hall also looked up listening as alert professionals vigilant at all times they grew perturbed at the ris ing whine zel lowered his goblet uncertainly and stared at the ceiling xenu started too his glass dribbling as it tilted unnoticed in his rigid hand rising to an almost unbearable pitch the sound reverberated across the room then with thunderous crash spearlike object burst through the ceiling to bury its arrowhead into the wooden floor the note of the bombers engines changed abruptly as it revved and pulled out of its dive the canister poised erect there on the dance floor began to vibrate but few if any of the crowd noticed this galvanized into action the instant the cylrevolt in the stars 55 inder had hit the floor they were already surging men yelling women screaming from the confines of the room each intent on being the first out more courageous renegade raced across to the object grasping it he yanked it loose its not bomb he shouted ex amining it the force field above the palace would have detonated it if it was its message tube he removed the screwcap top and brought out scroll and piece of paper taking the scroll first he read it out to the small group who had gathered around curi ous proclamation the congress of the loyal officers of the people hereby poses xenu as supreme ruler what thebloody blastick is this the renegade glanced briefly up at xenu whos face was going ominously black then continued to read the scroll and orders him to sur render for mass murder what the its signed by mish and rawl fingers fumbling he grasped the second sheet of paper voice growing hoarse he read that too aloud xenu copies of this proclamation are being dropped on streets of every planet i advise you to surrender peacefully hey whats this nut rawl think hes doing horrified the renegade gaped around wildly as if expecting rawl to leap out from somewhere and shoot him down hes dead every loyal officer is dead the assembly began to mutter xenu stalked over to chi in cold fury grabbing the latters coat lapels he yanked them hard and spat into his face how many inter ceptor bases did you leave untouched he yanked again chi nearly choking his body turned into lump of quivering jelly could only stammer oonly only mish th therewas sh ship seen leaving the earth bbase as it bl blew up he made frantic attempt to lose xenus hands oonly those releasing his minister xenu burst into laughter still laughing he turned to face the startled crowd and held his hands up in calming reassuring gesture purest bluff he announced two men against millions of secret police against seventyfive totally secured planets against all our planes and armies taking the papers from the limp grip of the renegade he laughed again then began torip the papers to shreds w ell good luck to them he finished sarcastically dropping the strips to the floor with exaggerated tempt his audience let out sigh of relief then they also broke into laughter chapter sixteen very alone very small against the vast reaches of the galaxy single interceptor hung suspended in its fuselage four people were in various stages of getting into space garments oxygen masks and parachutes were to hand ready to be donned rawl paused and looked up you dont have to do this lady min youve

waving an arm for the rest to follow rawl sealed the door behind them and glanced at the safety board the red light had turned green he opened the outer door and spun off into space ap was the last to

draw it green ribbon of flame cut into him he staggered eyes wide and crumpled to the floor rawl propped his rifle up against the wall and eyes rapidly studying the console began removing his space suit behind him mish had stopped in the doorway rifle held ready standing sentinel over the staircase breathless from the run lady min and ap brushed past mish and entered the room typically female lady min produced compact mirror and fluffed out her hair critically appraising her reflection she got out her lipstick having seen the dead secret policeman ap was in mood for seeing to his own appearance he eyed the body queasily anddecided to put it out of sight and mind holding his heaving stomach in check he picked up the dead mans feet and dragged him off into corner meanwhile rawl had

friends and family to come over to the screen clustered around the set they listened avidly to their long term hero many of your own people were re cently rounded up they were transported to earth and murdered there by atomic fire you have been told that recent measures were taken to combat crime wave that crime wave was xenu flanked by his staff officers hastily summoned and still buttoning on their blue and white jackets the commanding general of the cronjin planetary army stood tensely watching his office tv set rawls words were filling the room in addition to the entire population of planet earth xenu also rounded up and had murdered the entire ninth army because it sought to carry out the lawful orders of congress and resisted the formation of police state the commanding generals face hard ened as he nodded grimly he knew it so thats why they dont answer up he muttered to himself he turned and shouted orderly an orderly came running up the staff officers began pulling transceivers from their belts and leapt into action as their commanding general issued stream of decisive orders on sidewalk crowd had gathered staring up at public address system speaker they were intent on what rawl was saying your own bomber base did not blow up because of terrorists as you were toldxenu blew it up and every other ga lactic base in an effort to destroy the power of the loyal

call on you to rise smash the cret police and restore lawful government to this planet at rawls last words the crowd surged forward snarling one of them ordinarily peaceful citizen but now ferocious mob leader inflamed by what he had heard leaped up onto balustrade and began shouting directions listening to the wailing sirens mish braced himself against the door fleet of secret police cars were coming hurtling across the airfield rawl glanced out the window curtly signalling ap over to him he spoke again into the mike you can and must win shoving the mike into aps resistive hands rawl grabbed his rifle dashed through the door and along the outside plat form he dropped down to use the parapet for cover and raised his gun over the edge shivering uncontrollably ap tried to gather his

and turned sickly pale he could count two five ten trucks and all unloading cret police future zero flatbed truck with mounted artil lery piece joined the crowd its gun crew started training the gun on the dome of the center the secret police general elbowed his way through his rushing men and jumpedup onto the flatbed he was shouting motioning for the men to desist dont destroy the communications cen ter well need it in few minutes to tell thepopulation they are dead and we are in trol he sprang off the truck and ran to di rect small arms attack at his command lines of secret policemen threw themselves down and commenced discharging arcs of flame towards the center lying prone over the doorsill enemy fire chewing the frame above him mish re turned his own staccato shots of fire ducked down lady min crawled over to where ap valiantly continued his addressto the populace this field he was say ing is swarming with secret police he closed his eyes and muttered short prayer right now were going to find out if the people of cronjin are friends of murderers and oppressors as he spoke two vanloads of renegade forces arrived by far more deadly than the secret police scrambling out the renegades hit the ground at dead runs and made for thestaircase leading to the control room noticing lady mins frantic gestures he gave in to her plea and so i give you lady min eyewitness to the planning of xenu and destruction of earth and he thankfully handed her the mike the first of the renegades were pound ing up the stairs mish ready for it let them come to within few feet of him be fore cutting loose with his blast gun the leading renegades fell back smashing into the ones behind creating confused tangle of falling and thrashing men lady min glanced back at the door spotlights composing herself she turned back to the mike people of cronjin this may be your last chance to attain freedom she began close to tears dear god where were the people of cronjinrevolt in the stars 59 rawl cursed as his gun clicked emptily he thrust the last charge he had into the breech and resumed firing if the cavalry dont come soon they wouldnt stand chance not damned chance he should never have let lady min come either grit ting his teeth he smashed down another renegade with sharp burst of flare by the flatbed the determined secret police general looked on through slitted eyes hearing throbbing from behind he whirled around seeing nothing he hit switch on the trucks side and spotlight stabbed out into the dark the general froze in shock as the light revealed four blue and white army tanks rumbling towards him gun snouts depress ing into firing positions as they came fanned out behind the tanks flock of carrier trucks were pulling up soldiers pouring over their sides ragged battle cry reached the gen erals ears remember the ninth army remember the ninth army stationed in tank turret the com manding general of the cronjin planetary army glared at the secret police maneuvers ahead his face set into harsh lines his voice severe he snapped an order into radio unit fire low so as not to hit the communications center attack at once together the tanks fired huge sprays of bluewhite flame secret police car hit leaped into the air group of trucks vanished as such be coming blazing pyres instead the flatbed truck burst asunder as yet unaware of the ravages behind them the front lines of secret policemen still exchanged shot with the center then few seemed to sense that all was not well as they rose to turn back wave of sol diers hit them screaming remember the ninth army hearing the stepped up turmoil outside lady min risked peek over the win dowsill seeing the change of circumstances she jumped to her feet face radiant thank the stars victory she cried people of cronjin you are free free free rawl and mish grinned at each other dangling their rifles they went to stand by the shredded door to greet the approaching army general and his officers catching sight of rawl the army gen eral rushed forward and firmly shook his hand so i finally get to meet the famous rawl mish gestured shall we go inside they did so ap clearing some battered chairs out of their way lady min had stopped speaking and held the mike toward the conferring group volume up sudden commotion at the door made them turn group of officers with shackled civilian in their midst crowded in one of the officers gently pushed the civilian forward look what we have here the man was middleaged he held his head up proudly as another officer tried out various keys on his shackled wrists the officer who had spoken explained further noting rawl s raised eyebrow we got himout of the police barracks dungeon the civil governor of cronjin one of his hands successfully shackled the governor extended it to rawl shaking his hand rawl studied the man liking what he saw can i count on you and the general here to get this planet mopped up and in order the

smashed and the mutineers revelled in each vic tory spurred on to greater acts of rebellion by each success chapter eighteen chart was spread across an aisle table in rawls interceptor consulting it was rawl himself mish lady min and ap rawl slapped down his pencil and stretched his cramped limbs sooner or later they will get their wits working and start to use the home planet bombers to retaliate intent on oiling his pistol mish nodded absently hed discussed this with rawl last night ap darted his gaze from rawl to mish then back to rawl again bombers what this meant he didnt know but it must be bad newsrevolt in the stars 61 i propose to attack that base rawl tapped an area of home planet on the chartand then move right on in on the home planet without waiting for other planets theyre doing all right mish nodded again looks safestap gasped had he heard that right safest rawl smiled this is an outer space atomic interceptor he explained patiently made to combat enemy space battleships using it in an atmosphere makes it dead easy against planetary ships i doubt if there are any renegades that can even fly one ap was unconvinced like tiger fighting puppy huh rawl laughed you can man the tail gun clutching at the table ap moaned do you have any heart medicine aboard young girl was being shoved around like rag doll the renegades seated in circle laughed at her terror pushing her from one to the next of them with her clothes tearing further at each jolt in the background the home planet bomber bases fleet of ships sat idle and poorly cared for for sure the renegades who manned the base had better things to do like what they were doing now one of the renegades loosened up his collar i didnt think it would be so much fun to be an agent of the confederate bu reau of investigation another man gave leer and turned to the girl come on sweetheart lets investi gate further the girl was tossed at him he caught her and ripped garment further she fell to his feet inert eyes wide open he shook her little movement hell shes dead renegade to his left reached out good hand her over thats the way i likeem one of the group had grown bored he got to his feet and yawned i better get squadron airborne to relieve the home planet patrol he began to slouch off the renegade holding the girl pitched her into the arms of the renegade to his left and called out after the departing man yeah you do that and he returned his attention to the sport up in patrol the renegade copilot punched transmit button when are you dog lovers coming up to relieve us the radio uttered an uncouthness in re ply starting to put the mike back on its hook blip on the radar caught the co pilots eye he cast searching glance out through the windscreen and yelped in fright he frantically shook the dozing pilots arm and pointed outside bringing the mike back to his mouth with his other hand his voice cracked as he practically squeaked aloyal officer interceptor rawl threw his interceptor into dive between his craft and the base below six renegade patrol ships were flying in sloppy formation back in the tail ap sat in the gunner seat wrestling the gun with clumsy hands looking out through his viewport he flinched six interceptors alarm sirens sounded at ground level aroused from their various and nefarious activities renegades scrambled toward their stations holding the dive rawl signalled mish to hold fire as the latter readied firing trol mish shot grin back and nodded ap checked the port again six more taking off he began muttering prayer hoping that somewhere some kind god would listen and transport him instantly torevolt in the stars 62 some other place anywhere but here firing tracer shot the patrol rose to meet rawls ship flashing downwards to pass right through the enemy formation mish closed the firing control just as his own ship passed the first of the renegade intercep tors leaving behind pattern of black balls strewn between the patrol ships then the black balls exploded knock ing four of the renegade craft from the skies ap at his tail gun was intent on mop ping up the remaining two firing wildly he managed to score direct hit on one of them belching greasy black smoke it fell letting loose whoop of delight p turned his blazing gun prayers forgotten on the last ship as it pivoted around and began to fire at him curtain of swirling red engulfed aps turret in the cockpit rawl swore and jerked at the controls to steady his inter ceptor but the hit was only glancing not much damage done ap trifle singed yelled triumphantly as his next shot caught his opponent right on the nose rawl held the dive mish pointed down at six more ships shooting vertically up to wards them second squadron being twice the speed as well as twice the size of the renegade craft rawl s ship had flashed by them before they could even change course to fire on him nearly grazing the ground rawl pulled out of the dive and took the interceptor engines shrieking up and under the patrol shooting right through the squadron mish again closed the firing switch and the six ships were blasted to fragments rawl yanked at the controls and dove downwards again for the base itself in the tail ap was raring to go ready to roll hunting for something to fire at he found nothing and slumped back in disappointment an antispacecraft gunner crew concen trated ribbons of shot at the plummeting interceptor use the ship just kept diving toward them they ceased fire and ducked futilely for cover mish once more had his hand on the firing control waiting for the word now yelled rawl and mish snapped his thumb down rawl banked his ship and sped for safety as the base went up in cloud of atomic particles flying lefthanded rawl cruised his in terceptor above home planet he held mike in his other hand and frowned slightly as he spoke calling commanding general arn commanding planetary army home planet calling commanding general arn commanding planetary army home planet voice spluttered in over the receiver ill get him ill get him having answered the call communica tions clerk signalled urgently to the com manding general across the room he ducked down to avoid red slash of fire that laced above him many others in the room did the same for the planetary army was engaged in pitched battle soldiers in the blue and white uni forms were at the windows firing intermit tently at the enemy outside line of wounded lay against the far wall growing longer by the minute general arn dignified greyheaded man answered the clerk s summons cap off and collar open he ran keeping his head down over to the radio the clerk handed arn the mike shaking his head incredulously it sounds like rawl the clerk hit video button and the general stared jaw agape at the screen rawlrevolt in the stars 63 he drew breath of relief then spoke very seriously dont try to come in here were pinned down they seized our tanks secret police and renegades are out there in thousands all around our base are you at central base threethe general looked little suspicious the guy would have to be crazy to come in here with reservation he answered yes rawl gave short laugh keep the heads of your men down when you hear ship rawl the general began to be si lenced by the audible click as rawl cut the circuit looking around him in some amaze ment he spoke to one in particular hes coming in here then hastily but toning his collar and jamming his cap on his head he turned and shouted to his men in crease your fire high above central base three rawl and mish surveyed the scene below the base was fortresslike building surrounded on three sides by open parade ground and backed on the fourth by winding river some twenty tanks were ranged around the building spouting gushes of flame masses of secret police in battle formations were keeping up continuous fire at the building where army soldiers at the windows only shot back sporadically rawl pulled lever and his ship swooped downward use fire he told mish dont hit the building mish grinned back at rawl and gave him an ok sign zel bit removed from his men was seated in camp chair observing the battle in satisfaction just few more hours and hed probably get medal or something deserved it too one would ever know that this really wasnt his plan but what the hell he was the senior officer hereanyway the note of an alien engine intruded upon his ruminations he looked up sternated and dumbfounded to see diving interceptor jumping up he ran for the cover of some nearby trees as the ships shadow raced over the tanks and men on the parade grounds mish jerked on the firing control letting loose blanket of raging flame army soldiers crowded wounded and all to the windows cheering as the tanks blew up one by one those still alive in the ranks of secret police nearest the army building had about faced to stare awestruck at the burning wreckage they didnt see as the soldiers leapt over their window embrasures to charge headlong at them then hearing the battle cry remember the ninth army the secret police whirled around to be knocked flat by the wave of blue and white uniformed men remember the ninth armyin the interceptor lady min and ap had come to stand behind the pilot seats in the cockpit looking eagerly through the windshield ap clutched mishs arm and howled in delight weve won laughing mish disengaged aps hands and reached across to lightly punch rawls shoulder hey pardner weve done it again seeking an avenue of release for his high spirits ap grabbed lady min and waltzed her down the fuselage to her own and the others amusement but below zel was making good his escape he clambered into an armored car and kicked it into gear hatless and scorched he careened off madly intent only on getting awayrevolt in the stars 64 chapter nineteen the heads of state were holed up in the palace renegade troops scattered strategi cally around the walls kept up barrage of small arms fire out in the street crowd of affronted civilians were held back by barricades and panes of antishot glass in the square facing the palace were several armored vehicles and blue andwhite tank next to the tank general arn mish and rawl were conferring theyre in there all right observed arn the lot of them like rats in hole mish slammed fist against the tanks side blast he spoke gruffly in his frustra tion you cant bomb the place its force screen detonates anything you drop on them rawl leaned back on the tank and shook his head weve got to take them alive he beckoned to civilian police captain who held loudhailer stooping low to avoid ricocheting shot the captain ran over to the tank trailing the hailers cord behind him rawl jabbed thumb over his shoulder isnt there any way we can get them out ofthere the captain shrugged we could storm the place cost an awful lot of men call them again sighed rawl we want to take them alive man in the forefront of the watching crowds turned to his neighbor marveling at what he had just heard rawl just said they want to take them alive pleased with the idea his eyes lit up fanatically cupping his hands to his mouth he shouted to rawl take them alive those around the man stared at him astonished then they too took up the cry take them alive the din grew as more and more joined inthe captain glanced back at the people behind the barricades small smile crossing his face turning again to confront the pal ace he switched on the hailer you are called upon to surrender peacefully all renegades in the palace will be granted am nesty and transported out of the galaxy all officials will be arraigned for trial come out without weapons and your hands above your head in window renegade was turning the captains words over in his mind he listened for moment to the mobs chant ing take them alive sighing he worked the slide of his rifle and pulled the trigger it gave an empty click he regarded the street again then withdrew from the window in defeat one of the palace doors opened crack several blast rifles slithered out to clatter down the broad front steps the door opened wider and ragged bunch of pow derburned renegades straggled out hands held high an officer signalled to his blue and white uniformed men hold your fire the men who had capitulated were frisked and loaded into an opensided truck suddenly burst of fire from the pal ace knocked three of the renegades down civilian police officer dropped to his knees and raised his rifle to shoot back holding his smoking rifle the secret police executive tarried second too long at the window before drawing back the moniac snarl on his face changed to one of agony as the shot from below caught him in the abdomen loosing an involuntary burst from his gun he pitched forward and fell to the pavement below viewing this exchange rawls frown deepened he looked over at arn still lotof fanatics in there arn scowling at the palace nodded ab sentlyrevolt in the stars 65 rawl drew his pistol and checked its load jerking his head towards mish he moved off in the direction of the palace come on mish aroused from his meditations arn made grab at rawl in alarm but they were off crouching low creeping alongside of them was driverless armored car pushed by couple of civilian police to protect them from fire splatter of red glanced off the top of the car without doing harm deciding the least he could do was keep the enemy busy arn shouted to his men all troops rapid fire at palace windows pulled up in front of the buildings arched portals rawl and mish knelt in back of the cars fenders keeping his eyes on mishs face rawl drew coin from his pocket and flipped it heads chose mishrawl didnt even look at the coin or show it to mish i lost he stated cutting short mishs protests by sprinting off to wards the palace steps red streaks of flame ripped at the cement around him but still he ran on mish swore seeing someone about to shoot at rawl from window he rapidly aimed and fired the mans gun hit ex ploded in his hands mish turned anxiously back to watch rawl dart through the palace doors hell he wasnt going to let rawl go in there alone he upped and dashed off to catch up with rawl inside rawl paused to spray the hall with shot spotting shadowy figure on balcony he brought his gun to bear and fired he started as someone raced past him and made for the stairs seeing it was mish he smiled not surprised staying below to cover him rawl waited until mish had reached the head of the staircase beforedashing up them himself their backs to the hallway on the left of the bannister neither saw an office door surreptitiously open nor did they see greygreen uniformed man sneak out and take aim the shot caught mish on the side of his head

rawl was still in shock from the loss of mish his reflexes were lightning quick instinctively almost he blasted the man with the rifle down and turned his blazing gun on the other two men and he kept on firing long after the secret police men were dead he checked himself the fury clearing from his mind stepping out into the hall way he looked down over the bannister at the crumpled form lying at

floor rawl tossed the pistol to the far end of the room his attempted suicide foiled and all weapons removed from his vicinity xenu flopped down in despair whoresons he was lost lost lost casting withering glance at xenu rawl moved over to the window and shat tered the glass with his pistol butt reversing his gun so as to keep his prisoners covered rawl leaned out the window and waved his cap

listening to him the end of planet earth future zero off to one side lady min and rawl had their heads together talking quietly lady min looked up at rawl trifle uncertainly i never was his mistress

kept them under my pillow when iwas teenager silly huh rawls eyes flew wide open you kept clips of it was his turn to look embarrassed i used to keep photos of you in my wallet they looked at each

follow will know how your planet was murdered and why he swept his arm to indicate the devas tated terrain this desolation was the result of forming police state when populations are restless unwise governments seek to oppress and the more they oppress the closer they bring revolution foolish gov ernments seek to prevent revolution with more oppression and they die but part of the fault for this must be shared by the congress congress let an executive branch grow bigger and bigger andrevolt in the stars 70 let it act to antagonize and alienate the peo ple to that degree congress betrayed the people who elected and trusted them he looked down and raised hand to tick off finger as he made each point be fore the other planets are also destroyed congress has got to reform the school sys tem so they stop teaching kids they are animals then it has to get the police to re alize they are responsible for public safety not just nabbing people they dont like congress will have to pass bill abolishing the whole evil fraud of psychiatry gress has to eradicate the executive branch as it is and organize one with far less power rawl gazed intensely into the camera lens as if willing result
