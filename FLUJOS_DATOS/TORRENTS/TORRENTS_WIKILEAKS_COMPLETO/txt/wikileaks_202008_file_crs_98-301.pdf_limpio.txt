list of holidays to be ob served in the district of columbia the principal intent of that resolution was to make february 22 bank holiday5 although there is indic ation in the authorizing statutes of 1870 and 1879 or in the acco mpanying floor debates that any federal employees were to be paid fo r such holidays an analysis of holiday legislation subsequently signed by presiden t rutherford b hayes in april 1880 seems to support such conclusion thi s legislation was prompted by grievance filed by group of employees who had been denied holiday pay for the previous ne w years day while other federal workers had been paid for the day the house committee which favorably reported the bil l stressed that while there we re existing laws requiring such payment this group of employees in the committees opinion should be placed upon an equality in thi s regard with those of other government departments the committee went on t point out that on the question of legal holidays the revised statutes of the united states were silent but those relating to the district of columbia were very precise on the issue the implication was that the other federal employees in the district d already been paid for the holiday6 such reasoning is substantiated by an opinion issued by acting attorne general james c mcreynolds in august 1903 mcreynolds indicated that fo r many years prior to 1870 it was customary to close the executive departments of the government at washington on five holidaysnew years day georg washingtons birthday independence day thanksgiving day and christma s daythat had

days were declared public holidays only by law s applicable to the district as consequence mcreynolds concluded that congress intended with the 1870 and 1879 statute to designate all days made holidays by any law in effect within the dist rict of columbia to be such for employees of the federal government as well this was done even t hough congress as late as the turn of the8 century had yet to enact legislation absolutely requiring that the executiv department s of the government to be closed and the clerks and other employee s therein to be released from work on such days 9 in 1885 congress approved additional legislation making the five holidays thus far approved also applicable to per diem employees of the government on duty t washington or elsewhere in the united states this act apparently for the firs t10 time extended at least limited holiday benefits to federal employees beyond th shores of the potomac river enactment of the monday holiday law in 1968 shifted the commemoratio n11 of washingtons birthday from february 22 to the third monday in february contrary to popular belief neither the monday holiday law nor any subsequen t action by congress or the preside nt mandated that the name of the holiday observed by federal employees in february be changed from washingtons birthday t presidents day decoration daymemorial day decoration day now memorial day was added to the list of holidays to b observed in the district and in turn by federal employees in 1888 the join t12 resolutio n was probably adopted primarily because sizable number of federa l employees were members of the grand army of the republic an organization f union civil war veterans who desired to participate in memorial day ceremonie s honoring those who had died in the conflict

favorably legislation for labor da to become federal holiday in 1894 the use of national holidays the committ ee reasoned is to emphasize some great event or principle in the minds of the people by giving them day of rest and recreation day of enjoyment i n commemoration of it by honoring labor with holiday the committee suggested the na tion will assure that the nobility of labor be maintained so long as the laboring man can feel that he holds an honorable as well as usefu l place in the body politic so long will he be loyal and faithful citizen16 with time the committee felt the celebration of labor day as national holiday on the first monday in september would naturally lead to an honorable emulatio n among the different crafts beneficial to them and to the whole public it would also tend to increase the feeling of common brotherhood among men in all crafts an d callings and at the same time kindle an honorable desire in each craft to surpass the rest reasonable amount of rest and recreation makes workman more useful as craftsman providing further support for its position the committee pointed out that 23 states had already recognized labor day as legal holiday17
