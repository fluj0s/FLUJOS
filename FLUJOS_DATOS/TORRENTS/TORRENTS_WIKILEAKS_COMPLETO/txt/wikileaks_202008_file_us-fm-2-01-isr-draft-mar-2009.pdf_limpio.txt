for army intelligence surveillance and reconnai ssance isr synchronization doctrine and supersedes fmi 201 published in 2008 it s scope is isr synchronization and intelligence support to isr integration and isr during the planning and operations processes readers must understand fm 355 when published which describes the ove rarching doctrinal concepts for isr as well as this fm to grasp the true importance of combined arms isr operations the armys warfighting doctrine organizations training and operations continue to change in order to match the dangers and challenges of todays operational nvironment therefore fm 201 updates army isr synchronization doctrine to conform to the most current operational and intelligence doctrine this fm complies with doctrine set forth in fm 20 30 50 60 and fm 51 when published while applicable to all army leaders the primary audience for fm 201 is the intelligence and operations staff officers who must work together to develop the isr plan and commanders who must understand the importance of isr synchronization as part of isr planning and the operations process this fm outlines intelligence res ponsibilities during planni ng and ongoing operations propagation of isr information and intelligence assessi ng and updating isr operations ther are four chapters and four appendixes the introduction summarizes doctrinal changes that have occurred since the release of fmi 2 01 lays out the doctrinal framework and expands upon the manuals purpose chapter 1 explains how isr synchronization supports the full spectrum of operations its role in the operations process and how it relates to the intelligence warfighting function chapter 2 summarizes and defines key isr synchronization terms and concepts within combined arms and intelligence doctrine and directly links them to battle command chapter 3 describes intelligence support and is r planning during the m ilitary decisionmaking process mdmp chapter 4 details the isr synchronization process after the completion of planning when operations are underway appendix explains the requirements development process from the initial information requirements through prioritization process to the formulation of specific information requirements sirs to the development of isr tasks that are used to direct isr operations appendix b describes isr synchronization traini ng and resources available at the us army intelligence center appendix c discusses joint national and multinational isr planning considerations appendix d describes dcgsa enab led isr planning and operations fm 201 provides isr synchronization guidance for army commanders staffs and trainers at all echelons from company to army service component command ascc this fm forms the foundation for established curriculum within the armys educational system on isr synchronization the information presented is descriptive not prescriptive or restrictive fm 201 provides details on the six continuing activities of isr synchronization one of the m ost important staff activities performed to aid the commander with vi sualization and battle comma nd although the discussion and descriptions in this manual may seem linear isr sy nchronization is dynamic continuous and interactive staff process requiring constant coordination between the intelligence and operations officers depending on

states arngus and the united states army reserve usar joint doctrine applie s to joint organizations army headquarters that operate as joint headquarters must use joint isr doctrine the term intelligence officer refers to the actual g2 s2 or other top isr positions within units and organizations the term operations officer refers to the g3 s3 or other top operations positions within units and organizations the term g2s2 or g3s3 refers generically to all members of the intelligence or operations staff sections introduction it is imperative that commanders understand the operati onal environment prior to taking effective action the intelligence warfighting function provides the relate d tasks and systems that facilitate understanding of the enemy terrain and weather and civil considerations which includes areas structures capabilities organizations people and events continuous and ggressive isr operations are the primary means of gaining knowledge of the operation environment isr supports the full spectrum of operations through five tasks perform isr synchronization perform isr integration conduct reconnaissance conduct surveillance conduct related missions and operations as critical combined arms operation isr provide s answers to commanders and staffs information requirements and contributes significantly to the comma nders situational understanding it is crucial that all commanders and staff sections participate in is r planning from the identification of information requirements through the collection and reporting of information to answer the commanders critical information requirements ccirs to the assessmen t of isr operations and updating of isr plans it is also crucial that commanders and staffs unde rstand that isr is not synonymous with intelligence which is one supporting effort to isr requiring total st aff involvement and careful planning to answer the commanders critical informa tion requirements ccir how the army performs isr is continuously changing the armys evolving force structure newly developed systems and increased reliance upon joint nd national sensors necessitates the weaving of isr doctrine into every aspect of combined arms doctrine it must also be current relevant and usable at all echelons as the result of force structure developments brigade combat teams bcts have larger intelligence staff and more collection systems as well as more r obust surveillance and rec onnaissance capabilities the army brigade combat team bct is now the lowest echelon that conducts longterm analysis functions and often receives representatives of national agencies at corps and ascc intelligence staffs rely more heavily on joint national and multinational isr resources and information requirements cover operational and strategic matters the army division possessing organic intelligence collection assets however it can be augmented by battlefield surveillance brigade bfsb or task organized with assets provided by combatant command therefore it must leverage joint and national collect ors in support of its own information requirements as well as those of its subordinate echelons the isr synchronization process laid out in fmi 201 carries over to this fm however the approach taken in this fm will directly connect isr synchroni zation to staff functions the planning and operations processes and it includes significan t additions and modifications from recent updates to combined arms and intelligence doctrine the table below shows the new or changed material in fm 201 compared to fmi 201 some of the terms used this manual require clarifi cation because misusage is common for example an isr asset is subordinate to the requesting unit or ech elon while an isr resource is not in other words higher

intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance synchronization and full spectrum operations army operations occur within complex framework of environmental factors that shape their nature and affect their out comes the commander uses isr operations and intelligence to understand that complex framework of environmental factors this chapter describes the operational envir onment the operational concept and the full spectrum of operations and the intelligence warfighting function the operational environment 11 the operational environment is composite of the conditions circumstances and influences that affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander jp 30 while they include all enemy adversary friendly and neutral systems across the spectrum of conflict they also include an understanding of the environment the state of governance technology local resources and the culture of the local population fm 30 12 todays operational environments are complex and require continuous learning and adaptation the operational environment is different for each campaign or major opera tion the operational environment evolves as the campaign or operations progress the changes in operation iraqi freedom from 2003 to the present provide good example of the environment evolving over time 13 observations from senior army leaders during op eration desert storm operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom rega rding intelligence operations show th at military intelligence analysts at the tactical level were not familiar with the operational environment at the outset of these conflicts those observations further suggest that it took analysts significant amount of time to gain enough of an understanding to assist the staff in improving its situa tional awareness this shortfall negatively affected the commanders ability to gain situational understanding 14 successful mission accomplishment requires understa nding of the operational environment isr operations are one of the best means for the comma nder to achieve that understanding but understanding truly begins well before the execution of operations intelligence officers assist the commander in achieving full understanding prior to operations by re maining connected to the global information grid gig throughout the army force generation arforgen cycle instability and persistent conflict 15 complex local regional and global changes shape todays operational environments leading to both opportunities and risks for our country the risk component of these changes manifests in certain trends that drive instability and persistent conflict some of those trends are globalization technology demographic changes urbanization resource demand publication date initial

implementation or operational use for official use only climate change and natural disasters proliferation of weapons of mass destructions and effects failed or failing states 16 properly synchronized and integrated isr operations help reduce risk and uncertainty for the commander for further discussion on these trends see fm 30 the threat 17 fm 30 defines threats as nati onstates organizations people groups conditions or natural phenomena able to damage or destroy life vital resources or institutions there are four major threat categories the intelligence officer must assi st the commander and st aff in understanding traditional threats posed by states employi ng recognized military capabilities and forces in understood forms of military competition and conflict irregular threats from those employing unconventional asymmetric methods and means to counter traditional us advantages catastrophic threats involving the acquisition possession nd use of nuclear biological chemical and radiological weapons also called weapons of mass destruction and effects disruptive threats from enemies who develop and use new technologies to reduce us advantages in key operational domains 18 these threats increase the possibility of state failures humanita rian disasters and ungoverned areas becoming enemy safe havens the rise of transnati onal terrorist networks religious radicalism ethnic genocide sectarian violence and large criminal netw orks coupled with failing na tionstates create perils for united states and its national interests 19 by combining traditional disruptiv catastrophic and irregular capab ilities adversaries will seek to create advantageous conditions by quickly changing the nature of the conflict and moving to employ capabilities for which the united states is least prepared threats use the environment to their advantage and they rapidly adapt to changes in the environment extremist organizations will seek to take on state like qualities using the media and t echnology and their position within states political military and social infrastructures to their advantage 110 isr operations and intelligence in addition to experience and applied judgment are the best tools commander has available to gain situational understandi ng of the threat and the operational environment see fm 30 for further discussion on the changing nature of the threat operational variables 111 commanders and staffs use operational variables to understand and analyze the characteristics of the operational environment the operational variables are directly relevant to campaign planning however they may be too broad for tactical planning planners at the tactical level should carefully consider whether pmesiipt is valuable in their particular case 112 military planners describe the operational environment in terms of the operation variables joint military planners use six interrelated variables political military economic social information infrastructure pmesii army doctrin adds two additional variables physical environment and time pmesiipt operational variables scribe not only the military aspect s of an operational environment but also human aspects such as the population and its influences on the operational environment before the receipt of the mission the operational variable s help the commander understand the problem and lead the unit through its training planning and preparations 113 prior to receipt of mission commanders and st affs generate intelligence knowledge to answer information gaps in the operationa l

analyze the operational environment the mission va riables are mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support available time available and ci vil considerations metttc the mission variables help the commander understand the nature of the mission design the operation and visualize the end state the mission variables are the major variab considered during mission analysis 115 civil

three mission variables enemy terrain and weather and civil considerati ons isr synchronization supports the commanders needs through the isr synchronization tools used to manage assets collecti ng against intelligence requirements isr operations allow units to pr oduce intelligence about the enemy and the operational environment necessary to make decisions intelligence derived from isr assets

receipt of the mission in order to begin gathering data to answer information and intelligence gaps on the operational environment timely and accurate intelligence enc ourages audacity and can facilitate actions that may negate enemy tactics and materiel the operational concept 118 the armys operational concept describes the fu ll spectrum of operations where army forces combine offensive defensive and stability or civ il support operations simultaneously as part of an interdependent joint force to sei ze retain and exploit the initiativ accepting prudent risk to create opportunities to achieve decisive results they employ synchronized acti onlethal and nonlethal proportional to the mission and informed by thor ough understanding of all variables of the operational environment mission command that conveys intent and appreciation of all aspects of the situation guides the adaptive use of army forces for more detail see fm 30 chapter 1 the spectrum of conflict 119 the general nature of military operations can be described as point ong an ascending scale of violence ranging from stable peace to general war calle d the spectrum of conflict total war and perfect peace are rare and cannot coexist between these ex tremes are variations of conflict involving the application of military force needed to restore order or overturn the existing order within society or the struggle between two societies conflict intensity varies over time and among locations therefore it is difficult to describe an opera tions character because it is likely to evolve over time operational themes 120 the armys operational concept uses operational them to describe the ch aracter of the dominant major operation the operational themes group ty pes of military operations according to common characteristics and establish the taxonomy for understanding the many kinds of joint operations and the relationships among them 121 the armys uses the following operational th emes to characterize its major operations peacetime military engagement limited intervention peace operations irregular warfare major combat operations 122 operational themes have implications for tasko rganization resource allocation protection and tactical task assignment therefore the operationa l theme influences the co mmanders decisions with regard to isr operations intelligence officers must guide the commander through the planning process on the unique isr considerations for each major opera tional theme several examples in the following paragraphs will guide the intelligence officer when preparing an isr strategy and intelligence architectures for each type of operation figur 11 depicts the spectrum of conflict and operational themes figure 11 the spectrum of conflict and

engagement 123 peacetime military engagement comprises all milita ry activities involving othe r nations intended to shape the security environment in peacetime examples include multinati onal training exercises security assistance joint combined exchange training r ecovery operations arms control and counterdrug operations 124 combat is not likely during these operations but rrorist attacks against army forces are always possible nonetheless commanders will require inte lligence support for force pr otection pla nning and for operations security concerns us national and theat er intelligence agencies will provide the primary isr support to units these missions army units may r eceive also limited support from host nation agencies intelligence officers should consider both sources of information when developing intelligence plans during peacetime military engagements legal constraints or political concerns may limit isr options limited intervention 125 commanders use limited interventions to achieve cl early defined and limited scope end state joint task forces normally conduct limited interventions examples of limited interventions the brigade may participate in are noncombatant evacuation raids show of force foreign humanitarian assistance consequence management sanction enforcement and elimination of weapons of mass destruction 126 like peacetime military engagement combat is not likely during limited interventions however the threat of terrorist attacks is possible as are ttacks from the general population the commander will be primarily concerned with targeting operations force protection and operations security 127 the threat usually consists of terrorist guerilla paramilitary political or religious groups opposing an established government supported by the us gove rnment these groups may not well defined at the tactical level and are probably unlocated national theater and host nation agencies will generally not provide all of the information the commander require s instead those agencies generally provide enough information initially to focus tactical isr operations during limited interventions legal constraints or political concerns may limit isr options peace operations 128 peace operation is broad term that encompasses multiagency and multinational crisis response and limited contingency operations the primary purpose of peace operations is to create safe and secure environment deter adversaries from overt actions against each other nd provide time for civilian agencies to generate selfsustaining peace peace operations include peacekeeping p eace building peacemaking peace enforcement and c onflict prevention 129 peace operations normally occur in complex environm ents characterized by asymmetric threats failing government little or rule of law terrorism hum an rights abuses collapse of civil infrastructure and the presence of dislocated civilia ns attacks by insurgent and terrori st groups are likely and us forces may conduct limited offensive operations agai nst these groups during peace operations 130 enemy forces will try to mitigate the us isr capabilities by adopting tactics techniques and procedures ttp that reduce vulnerability to observation and collection systems when developing isr plans at every echelon in telligence officers must consider the emys ability to develop low technology lowcost counterisr solutions in cluding deception technique s designed to spoof collection systems 131 peace operations often occur under the mandate of in ternational organizations such as the united nations they are also likely to be multinational operations involving forces from many nations see appendix c for multinational isr considerations chapter 1 16 fm 201 publication date initial draft initial draft draft doctrine not for implementation or operational use for official use only irregular warfare 132 irregular warfare is violent st ruggle among state and nonstate actor s for legitimacy and influence over population it differs from c onventional operations in two aspect s first it is warfare among and within the people secondly it emphasizes an indirect approach by avoiding direct military confrontation instead it combines irregular forces and indirect unconventional methods to exhaust the opponent to counter irregular warfare the army employs its forces in foreign internal defense support to insurgency counterinsurgency combating terrorism and unc onventional warfare types of operations 133 traditionally special operations forces conduct thes types of operations conventional forces may be involved either in support of special operations forces or they may be involved in separate operations in the same area of operations during operation endur ing freedom oef special operations forces and conventional forces work together on different pr oblem sets in the same type of operation 134 just as in limited interventions and peace operati ons us forces generally oppose an undefined and unlocated enemy that operates within complex terrain the tactics and operational art employed by these forces will vary from conflict to conflict as will the structure of the threats themselves 135 in irregular warfare operations th traditional mix of isr assets us ed in conventional operations may not satisfy the commanders inform ation requirements irre gular warfare operations sometimes require unconventional thinking in terms of isr planning major combat operations 136 major combat operations occur in circumstances usually characteri zed by general war and combat between large formations during major combat operations army forces are normally involved in offensive or defensive operations as part of larg er joint force isr operations during major combat operations will be very complex and fastpaced requiring constant coordination and synchronization full spectrum operations 137 full spectrum operations require continuous simultaneous combinations of offensive defensive and stability or civil support tasks m odern conflict involves more than combat between opposing nations current and future conflicts are likely to be conducted among the people instead of around the people therefore operations will likely cons ist of complicated mixture of thal and nonlethal actions designed to change political military econom ic social and other conditions within an area of operations 138 while defeating the enemy the army may simu ltaneously be conducting stability operations and could be engaged in civil support tasks for homeland s ecurity purposes this was the case in late 2001 with offensive and stability operations in afghanistan happening concurrently with infrastructure security missions in the us 139 army intelligence provides timely relevant accu rate and synchronized intelligence support to tactical and operational commanders during the full spectrum of operations isr operations facilitate the commanders understanding of the mission variables of enemy terrain and weather and civil considerations this understanding allows the commande r to conduct operations at time and place of our choosing rather than reacting to enemy operations when the enemy is not foe but rather the factors influencing instability or natural disaster isr operations are still able to aid the commander in understanding the operational environment in order to make prudent decisions about the application of military resources 140 all intelligence operations must be executed within the scope and parameters of applicable laws policies and regulations to ensure compliance with these directives intelligence and operations officers must give them detailed consideration during isr planning 141 full details on the full spectrum of operations appear in fm 30 and fm 390 describes the tactics used in these operations intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance synchronization nd full spectrum operations publication date initial draft fm 201 17 initial draft draft doctrine not for implementation or operational use for official use only offensive operations 142 offensive operations are combat operations conducted to defeat and destroy enemy forces and seize terrain resources and population centers fm 30 offe nsive operations at all levels require effective intelligence to help the commander void the enemys main strength nd to deceive and surprise the enemy during offensive operations intelligence must provide the commander with an intelligence running estimate in timely manner for the commander to ffect the enemy significan tly the intelligence running estimate ensures commanders have the intelligence they n eed to conduct offensive operations with minimum risk of surprise 143 the primary purpose of isr during offensive operations is to locate identify and track the enemy intelligence derived from isr operations then creat an opportunity for the commander to allocate sufficient combat power at the point of the enemys greatest vulnerability intelligence also identifies where and when the commander can most decisively defeat th enemys counterattack or exploit additional enemy vulnerabilities 144 intelligence officers must understand the tenets of offensive operations and the tactics performed during offensive operations in order to synchronize isr operations to complement maneuver operations isr synchronization is especially important during offensive operations because sequencing and timing of movement and maneuver events can change quickly airborne isr assets are well suited to offensive operations because they can rapidly respond to friendly forces location changes centrali zed planning and execution of isr operations may provide the control necessary to keep collection synchronized with maneuver defensive operations 145 defensive operations are combat operations conducted to defeat an enemy attack gain time economize forces and develop conditi ons favorable for offensive or stability operations fm 30 the immediate purpose of defensive operations is to def eat an enemy attack commanders defend to buy time hold key terrain hold the enemy in one place while att acking in another or destroy enemy combat power while reinforcing friendly forces 146 isr operations and intelligence analysis should dete rmine the enemys strength coas and location of enemy followon forces defending commanders can then decide where to arrange their forces in an economyofforce role to defend and shape the battle field intelligence support and isr provide time for commanders to commit the striking force precisely 147 isr operations and the intelligence effort in defensive operations identifies locates and tracks the enemys main attack and provides the commander time to allocate sufficient comb at power to strengthen the defense at the point of the enemys main effort intelligence should also id entify where and when the commander can most decisively counter attack the enemys main effort or exploit enemy vulnerabilities 148 intelligence officers must understand the tenets of defensive operations and the tactics performed during defensive operations in order to synchroni ze isr operations to complement maneuver ground based isr assets can play key role in defensive operations however the intelligence officer must consider the risk to the asset when considering its isr task and positioning stability operations 149 stability operations encompass various military missions ta sks and activities conducted outside the us in coordination with other instruments of national power to maintain or reestablish safe and secure environment provide essential governmental servi ces emergency infrastructure reconstruction and humanitarian relief jp 30 current army thinking considers the tasks required for stability operations equally as important as the full combat with the enemy 150 information is currency during stability operations commanders require the appropriate intelligence and ipb products in order to determine how best to influence the environment and enhance regional chapter 1 18 fm 201 publication date initial draft initial draft draft doctrine not for implementation or operational use for official use only stability the identification and analysis of the thr eat terrain weather and civil considerations are important in conducting stability opera tions lack of knowledge concer ning insurgent activities issues creating tension between factions local politics customs and culture could lead to us actions that potentially offend or create mistrust among popular leaders or the population 151 the operational environment is frequently more complex during stability operations and as result isr operations are often equally as complex commande rs must be closely involved in and knowledgeable of isr during stability operations for example commanders may have to deal with multiple lines of operations within one major campaign each one w ith competing requirements for isr operations the commander must decide how to prioritize his isr operati ons when there are more requirements than he has collection capabilities in addition legal or political considerations may constrain the commanders isr operations 152 during stability operations isr operations controlled at higher echelons are much more difficult to synchronize with the other aspects of the lower echelons operations in operation iraqi freedom oif centralized planning and decentrali zed execution of isr seems to be successful strategy by giving control to the supported ground tactical commander all enablers and maneuver elements are synchronized with the organic isr assets and allocated isr res ources from higher echelons in addition pushing the isr assets down to the lowest level possible flattens the architecture so those commanders can pull data directly from the asset and not have to wait for higher echelons to push the data down for more information on intelligence support to stability operati ons see fm 2911 when published company intelligence support team 153 many commanders have found it useful to desi gnate company intelligence support team during stability operations when properly resourced it can increase the company commanders situational understanding and provide bottomup intelligence to ba ttalion

continuously assessing the operation the commander drives the operational process fm 30 isr synchronization is one of five integrating processes that occur during all operations process activities figure 12 illustrates the operations process figure 12 the operations process 161 plan is design for future or anticipated operation fm 50 plan is continuous evolving framework of anticipated actions which guides subordinates through each phase of the operation planning begins at receipt of mission th commander and staff translate the commanders visualization into specific course of action for execution using the operati ons process planning does not end when the plan is published as operations plans opl an operations orders opord or fragmentary orders frago planning continues throughout the operation to anticip ate and prepare for changes in the situation 162 one of the most important aspects of isr synchronization planning is the intelligence and opeations officers make sure the isr plan nests within the overall plan to ensure isr operations provide timely critical information that answer the ccir and tie directly to decision points the best way for this to happen is for the intelligence officer and staff to be i nvolved in every step of the decision making process 163 prepare consists of activities performed by units to improve their ability to execute an operation

expresses assessment criteria in terms of measures of effectiveness moes or measures of performance mops 166 assessment is continuous throughout planning preparation and execution however the focus of assessment differs for each of these activities isr operati ons are typically used to gather the measurements used to assess the efficacy of current operations intelligence warfighting function 167 the intelligence warfighting function consists of the related tasks and systems that facilitate understanding of the threat terrain nd weather and civil considerati ons fm 20 the four intelligence warfighting function tasks are support to force generation support to situational understanding perform isr support to targeting and information superiority 168 the intelligence warfighting function is flexible and adjustable architecture of procedures personnel organizations and equipment enabled by the dcgsa network providing commanders with relevant information and products relating to the ao the intellig ence warfighting function not only includes soldiers assets systems units and sensors within the military intelligence branch but also includes those resources from the ot her warfighting functions if they conduct intelligence surveillance or reconnaissance missions every soldier as part of small unit is potential information collector and an essential component to help answer information requirements 169 the intelligence warfighting function is tinuous process and relies upon inputs from and collaboration with the other warfighting functions the collection and reporting of information analysis and dissemination of intelligence must routinely occur across the ao across all staff sections and across the armys branches components and warfighting functions 170 the collective task perform isr supports the other three intelligence tasks listed above well as collective tasks across many other warfighting functions by collecting the information necessary to

below can occur at any time thr oughout the intelligence process commander s input 191 input is commanders responsibility and is provided at the commanders disc retion it provides the primary mechanism for the commande r to focus the intelligence warfi ghting function and through the planning process and assessment functions the intelligence officer is obliged to consult the commander for input the commanders input directly influences the units isr effort 192 each commander determines which intelligence products are developed as well as the format of the products the commanders input for isr operations is scribed further in chapter 2 under the role of the commander assessment of isr operations and dissemina tion of isr information are also important and those two concepts are discussed in chapter 4 analyze 193 analysis is the process by which collected information is evaluated and integrated with existing information to produce intelligence that describes the currentand attempts to predict the futureimpact of the threat and environment on operations fm 2334 the intelligence staff analyzes intelligence and information about the threats capabilities friendly vul

describes the dissemination of isr data as part of the propagate intelligence function intelligence reach 1100 intelligence reach is process by which military forces proactively and rapidly access information from receive support from and conduct direct collabora tion and information shari ng with other units and agencies both deployed in theater and outside the theater unconstrained by geographic proximity echelon or command tc 2335 intelligence r each allows intelligence an alysts to retrieve existing information intelligence products and data that can support answ ering the ccirs

information obtained through isr operations for use in the units in telligence products or analysis 1101 intelligence reach is distinguishab from the normal process of pr oviding combat information and intelligence up and down the chain of command because it involves unit obtaining the information or intelligence directly from the s ource without necessarily using the formal rfi process 1102 intelligence reach does not re place the traditional echeloned rfi system the purpose of intelligence reach is to obtai n information proactively or intelligence to prepare for mission without tying up intelligence personnel at various echelons or having to wait for the traditional rf i process to deliver an answer instead it enhances units ability to obtain intelligence data that is already collected and intelligence products containing analy zed information the intelligence staff synchronizes the requirements rfis and intelligence reach from external elements in to the units isr plan 1103 intelligence reach may be the only way to satisfy an intelligence requirement in the same manner that your unit may require combat information or intelligence from external sources to independently confirm or deny assessments or enemy courses of ac tion other organizations may depend upon your unit to provide them with information or intelligence that only your unit can provide 1104 units can access the information and intelligence holdings of othe r organizations normally via classified networks unclassified government networks and the intern et access to other units common databases usually requires prior permission it is important that intelligence officers determine where they may need permissions and obtain them as early as po ssible before ad hoc requirements become urgent 1105 when access through intelligence reach is not possible then inte lligence personnel must initiate formal rfi to the appropriate echelon who will either answer it or formally pass that request to the next echelon to obtain an answer when the information or data required does not exist and the command or its subordinate units do not possess the means to collect it through isr operations the intelligence officer then submits request for collection or support to another echelon where the capability exists 1106 units should not solely depend on intelligence reach to satisfy

preparation of the battlefield ipb prepared by the intelligence section during the mdmp the isr collection and intelligence analytical efforts are complimentary and should be car efully synchronized and integrated to afford the commander the best possible intelligence support for his information needs the planning process 32 planning is inherent to command planning is the process by which commanders and the staff if available translate the commanders visualization in to specific course of action for preparation and execution focusing on the expected results fm 30 it involves understanding the situation envisioning desired future and rranging configuration of pot ential actions in time space and purpose to realize an end state 33 plan is design for future operations pl an should guide subordinates through execution commanders issue plans to communicate visualization of an operation to state their intent to articulate decisions and to describe the end state that leads to shared vision throughout the command 34 planning does not stop with an order during the preparation and execution phases of the operations process plans are continuously refined based on the assessed progress of the operation and new information as it emerges planning is conducted fo r both short and longrange time horizons the isr synchronization involves both shortrange planning for certain assets like uas and longer term planning for assets such as humint units 35 planning orients the commander and staff on available options and familiarizes the commander with the conditions surrounding the operation planning and plans help build situational understanding and reduces uncertainty prioritize effort direct coordinate and synchronize action anticipate events and adapt to

officer must consider the following concerns in order to reach the optimal soluti on for synchronization anticipate the intelligence officer must recognize wh and where to shift collection or identify new intelligence requirements the intent of this principle is to identify new or adjust an existing requirement and present it to the commander before the commander or other staff members identify the need by participating in the decisionmaking planning and operations processes intelligence officers can best anticipate requirements coordinate the intelligence staff must coordinate and collaborate with all staff sections and with both higher headquarters s ubordinate and adjacent units in order for isr operations to be synchronized continuously the intelligence staff must be engaged in the units planning and orders production activities to ensure early id entification of intelligence requirements the intelligence staff must also be integrated into the combat information reporting and battle tracking of current operations to anticipate the need for dynamic or adhoc isr taskings early and continuous consideration of isr planning factors enhances th units ability to direct isr assets in timely manner in support of devel oping situations ensures thorough planning and increases flexibility in selecting and retasking assets prioritize the priority for isr operations begins with the ccir then intelligence officers prioritize each validated intelligence requirement based upon its importance in supporting the commanders intent and decisions as well as the current situation so that lowdensityhigh demand isr assets and resources are directed against the most critical requirements balance balance involves using combination of redundancy mix and cueing of variety of isr capabilities to complement each other redundancy is using several sametype isr assets to cover the same nai mix means planning for complementary coverage by combination of assets from multiple units and intelligence disciplines designed to increase the probability of collection success and reduce the chances of ccessful threat deception cueing involves the use of one or more sensor to provide data that result in another system to conducting collection balance also means that the intelligence staff shoul d resist favoring or becoming too reliant on one particular unit discipline or system balance is simply achieving maximum efficiency using an appropriate mix of disciplines isr assets and resources to satisfy as many competing intelligence requirements as possible control units should first use organic and allocated isr assets to ensure timely and effective collection as well as overall synchronization these assets are more responsive to the commanders needs and can be balanced with ot her resources isr assets belonging other units agencies or organizations may have limited av ailability and are likely to receive differing priorities from their respective commanders information gathered by other isr resources is harder to verify and correlate with information collected by organic assets reach units can use intelligence reach and rfis to answer initial information requirements without having to use precious isr assets intellig ence which is confirmed by more than one intelligence discipline is generally preferred over singlesource reporting therefore unit should not depend solely on intelligence reach to satisfy pir essential steps for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance planning intelligence survey 311 the intelligence survey provides the intelligence officer with an initial assessment for recommending intelligence asset apportionmen t within the ao and how best to use th units intelligence assets within the ao the survey is developed over time from initia l planning through mission execution and is updated chapter 3 34 fm 201 publication date initial draft initial draft draft doctrine not for implementation or operational use for official use only continuously it takes into account t echnical and tactical c onsiderations across all intelligence disciplines for example one portion of the ao may be unsuited for unit sigint asset collection due to terrain or lack of threat transmitters but it may be well suited for humint collection teams hcts the intelligence officer may recommend to the commander that unit sigint collection assets not be deployed to that area but that additional hcts would be valuable source of intelligence collection in that same area 312 the intelligence survey consists of four steps developing comprehensive baseline database for the ao determining key intelligence gaps developing an understanding of the information and intelligence that can be collected with unit intelligence assets and when appropriate isr assets in the ao and how and where it may best be collected determining method of understanding when changes to the baseline occur that are of intelligence interest 313 using the intelligence survey intelligence officers determine what their communications needs for deployed intelligence operations the survey is the basis for determining what additional or specialized intelligence assets the unit may require for missi on accomplishment based on the assessment in the survey intelligence officers submit re quests for support to obtain additi onal isr asset support or requests for forces rff to obtain additional isr assets resources units or soldiers 314 the intelligence survey is the first tool used by the in telligence officer while conducting isr synchronization during the mdmp process requirements management 315 based on the initial assessment of intelligence gaps made in the intelligence survey the commander and staff begin consider ing requirements for intelligence reach requests for information and isr operations 316 information requirements are all information elements the commander and staff require to conduct operations successfully that is all

priority for intelligence support that the commander and sta ff need to understand the adversary or the operational environment jp 20 these are intelligence requirements for which commander has an anticipated and stated priority during the task of planning and decisionmaking 317 using the commanders stated requi rements upon receipt of mission the intelligence staff develops and recommends pirs to the commander the commander approves pirs which form the basis for planning and executing intelligencedrive operations the staff also develops the ffirs which provide the information that the commander and staff need about the forces available for the operation 318 the goal of isr operations is to satisfy the ccirs isr assets are tasked to collect against these requirements the result of which is the production of intelligence essential to the commanders situational understanding and decisionmaking 319 although essential elements of friendly information eefis are not part of the ccir they may be priority if the commander deems them to be eefis ar the critical aspects of friendly operation that if known by the threat would subsequen tly compromise lead to failure or limit success of the operation and therefore must be protected from threat detection fm 30 during staff planning and wargaming it is important that the commander and staff look at friendly forces through the eyes of the threat force conducting operations in such way as to set predictable patterns not adhering to strict opsec measures and considering the threat on purely conventional linear terms are examples of situations in which the threat force can easily exploit weaknesses 320 detailed discussion on developing requi rements can be found in appendix requests for information rfi 321 request for information rfi is any specific timesensitive ad hoc requirement for intelligence information or products to support an ongoing crisis or operation not necessar ily related to standing requirements or

constraints that must be considered by the intelligence officer 350 in some cases the commander may impose constraint s on the use of certain systems or assets in addition the intelligence officer must consider the systemspecific constraints such as operating weather and crew rest or maintenance cycle limitations step 6 identify critical facts and assumptions 351 during this step the intelligence officer must identify critical facts and assumptions pertinent to isr planning which will be used later in coa development for example critical fact might be that imagery requests may take 72 to 96 hours to fulfill or th human intelligence humint effort requires significant amount of time before good source network is fully developed 352 critical assumptions for planning isr include the av ailability and responsiveness of organic assets and isr resources from higher echelons for example the intelligence officer might use certain percentage representing hours of uas support ava ilable on daily basis weather and maintenance permitting step7 perform risk assessment 353 when performing risk assessment the intelligence officer must consider the assets effectiveness versus the force protection or security risk to the asset for example placing sensor forward enough on the battlefield that it will be able to return valuable data and information may put the asset at high risk of being compromised captured or destroyed the calculus of payoff versus loss will always be determined by metttc and the commanders decision 354 in some cases friendly forces may reveal collection capability by taking certain actions if it is important to keep collection capab ility concealed then inte lligence officers gives caref ul consideration to every lethal or nonlethal action being contemplated based on inte lligence derived from that capability step 8 determine initial commanders critic information requirements and essential elements of friendly information 355 this is the second most important prerequisite for isr planning during mdmp the staff refines the list of information requirements that are derived from the initial analysis of information available and from intelligence gaps identified during ipb this list is based upon higher headquarters tasks commanders guidance staff assessments and subordinate and adjacent unit rfis 356 the staff then nominates these requirements to the commander to be ccir and eefi the commander alone decides what information is critical based on his experience the mission the higher commanders intent and input from the staff 357 ccir are the primary focus for isr operations developing requirements includes the following steps anticipate analyze devel op indicators and develop sirs appendix provides detailed discussion on the development of requirements for isr collection step 9 determine the initial intelligen ce surveillance and reconnaissance plan 358 isr assets are tasked by the operations officer and resources requested by the intelligence officer as soon as possible in the mission analysis step of the mdmp this is especially true for organic reconnaissance and surveillance units who need time to plan and prepare their operations 359 the operations officer is responsible for the isr plan however the intellig ence officer and g2s2 staff must create the isr synchronization tools first during

intelligence surveillan ce and reconnaissance synchronization tools 360 at this point in the mdmp the in itial isr plan has to be generic because friendly courses of action have not been developed the basis for the plan is the commanders initial isr guidance the primary information gaps identified by the staff during mission analysis and the enemy sitemp developed during ipb 361 the operations officer issues the initial isr plan as warno or fragmentary order frago later as the plan is refined and finalized it should be issued as annex l to the opord 362 in order to create the initial isr plan the intelligence officer operations officer and staff must go through several important activities several steps nd considerations to achie ve fully synchronized efficient and effective plan portion of the isr sy nchronization process is described below as it would occur during the mdmp but it is also applicable to rdsp and updating isr operations during the execution and assessment phases of the operations process evaluate resources 363 the intelligence officer and staff take the prioritized initial requirements and begin to match them with suitable isr assets using the following criteria availability the intelligence officer must know the collectors and pro cessors available to them at their own echelon at echelons above and below as well as how to access those isr assets and resources theater and joint echelons will pportion isr resources to subordinate echelons corps and divisions will allocate support from th apportioned amount they receive to bcts and below the intelligence officer must understand th system of apportionment and allocation to determine what is available and what can be requested by analyzing the higher headquarters order and reviewing the various scheduling or tracking mechanisms note human intelligence humint co llectors some of the best nsors for counterinsurgency and stability operations when they are properly focused by detailed

capabilities of such assets as the chemical company scout platoon engineer company transportation section and others capability includes such things as range what is the assets ability to move nd maneuver to include travel and support times if the best asset is uas what are its transit and dwell times day and night effectiveness consider factors such as available optics and thermal crossover technical characteristics can the system see through fog or smoke can it continue despite hostile electronic warfare each asset has time factors for task accomplishment that must be taken into account reporting timeliness geolocation accuracy durability can the aircraft launch in high winds or limited visibility can the prime mover cross restricted terrain examples assigning scout platoon to conduct z one reconnaissance is certainly within the capability of that platoon however zone reconnaissance is timeintensive mission leaving this isr asset tied up for significant amounts of time to conduct this mission another example is transit time for uas when planning isr synchronization the intelligence officer must consider the it takes uas to travel to and from its launch and recovery site or base of employment to the intended surveillance target in both examples assigning one mission to an asset or unit must be balanced against other requirements because they will not be available for other missions for period of time that might prove critical sustainability each collection asset has unique sustainment requirements therefore the intelligence officer must consid er the collection assets sust ainability for longer duration operations the longer the collec tion period on the isr synchronization matrix the harder it will be to find assets for continuous activity weat her can significantly impact sustainability of certain isr assets redundancy discussed later in this chapter is one solution to the sustainability problem vulnerability the intelligence officer must evaluate the collectors vulnerability to threat forces not only in the target area but also along the entire route of travel for example helicopters capabilities make it suitable as an isr asset however its vulnerabilities make it potentially an hvt for the enemy therefore it is important to evaluate the threats ability to locate identify and destroy our isr assets performance history

providing targeting accuracy such as advanced synthetic aperture radar system asars joint surveillance target attack radar system jtars or uass if experience shows that asar s is often unavailable because of local weather patterns an experienced intelligence officer considers this in evaluating the systems performance history perhaps leading to the selec tion of an alternate system 365 isr

examples of these units include combat engineers infantry battalions military police combat mp logistical convoys during the course of their normal movements additional capabilities those units that are not tasked with surveillance andor reconnaissance mission but can observe and report information incidental to their normal missions ccirs and unit sops dictate the reporting activities of these units their reports provide valuable information about the threat nd environment that assists the intelligence staff in building an accurate picture of the threat and alerting the command to unpredicted potentially dangerous threat activity examples of these units and operations include unit leaders meeting with host nation leaders information engagements ca teams reporting the location

etiov is tool used by the intelligence and operations officers to achieve synchronization and integration of isr activities into the overall plan etiov is particularly useful during wargaming to determine when isr assets units and soldiers shoul d be moved on the battlefiel d and retask as mission priorities change etiov will not appear on the final isr plan as it would confuse units assets and soldiers tasked with isr missions figure 34 provides examples of the evolution of an isr timeline for single asset or resource figure 34 working timeline for single isr asset or resource 370 the operations and intelligence staffs should resist favoring or beco ming too reliant on particular unit discipline or system when recommending to the g3s3 how to employ isr assets balance is planning redundancy when required eliminating redundancy when not desired and ensuring an appropriate mix of isr assets or types additionally the ability to cue isr and maneuver assets allows the operations officer flexibility and capability to collect information and to see the ao more clearly isr capabilities complement each other the isr synchronizati on matrix is useful in determining or evaluating balance redundancy planning as part of collection strategy development involves the use of several same type assets to cover the same nai use redundant tasking when the probability of success by any one system is low for example if you focus several sigint collectors on designated emitter at different times the probability of intercept improves even if the emitter operates intermittently the chance of accurate geolocation is also improved using redundancy mix means planning for complementary coverage by combination of assets from multiple units and intelligence disciplines sensor mix increases the probability of collection reduces the risk of successful threat decepti on facilitates cueing and provide s more complete reporting for 314 fm 201 publication date initial draft initial

maximizes the efficient use of finite isr ssets in support of multiple often competing intelligence collection priorities 371 figure 35 illustrates how redundancy mix and cueing work together as part of an isr collection combining several working timelines for single nai in conventional combat operation stability operations and other types of operations may or ma not require the same redundancy mix and cueing figure 35 example of redundancy cueing and mix for single nai 372 if jstars reports the absence of activity the intelligence officer might recommend to the operations officer redirecting the uas to another ssion or use it to confirm the absence of activity depending on the relative priority of requirements and the criticality of the decision point associated with this nai if jstars reports significant activity earlier than anticipated the uas launch sequence and deployment of other collectors can be accelerated to collect data and information relevant to the commanders decision the results of this effort illustrated in figure 35 might be that the decision point moves to the left on the timeline if enem activity dictates an earlier decision 373 cueing can also occur dynamically outside the isr plan as one system or echelon tips the other off to an unexpected collection opportun ity higher headquarters adjacent or multinational isr assets also cue assets throughout all of the warfighting functions displaying all the potential asset information in an initial isr matrix allows intelligence officers to ensure visually all assets and all nais are covered

dissemination of combat or targeting information to the original requestor sometimes direct dissemination will not be possible due to communications systems or classification considerations 379 tailor the isr task to the selected collection syst em or organization for example some imaging systems require basic encyclopedia number rather than geographic or universal transverse mercator coordinate for target location most air force airborne collection platforms recognize geographic coordinates only humint collectors need to have specific timeliness reporting and dissemination guidance if the isr tasks are specific enough they can roll over into the actual tasking or request mechanism or format 380 submitting an rfi to the next higher or lateral echelon is the normal procedure for obtaining intelligence information not available with organic isr assets users enter rfis into an rfi management system where every other user of that system can s ee it hence analysts several echelons above the actual requester become aware of the request and may be able to answer it 381 when the unit is unable to satisfy collection requirement through its own assets the intelligence staff composes and submits an rfi to the next higher echelon or lateral units for integration within its own isr plan at each echelon the requirement is validat ed and determination made as to whether or not that echelon can satisfy the requirement if that echelon cannot satisfy the requirement it is passed to the next higher echelon note this process continues until the requirement is satisfied the intelligence is longer needed or it is determined that the requirement cannot be satisfied 382 throughout the rfi process units must apprise the submitting organization on th status of their rfi as either accepted for action passed to another organization for action returned w ithout action invalid or infeasible request or closed satisfied the in telligence staff must track all production

means of transmitting that information for an alysis for example information regarding tai should go to the intelligence operations information engagement fires and other sections to determine if the information meets targeting requirements the commanders guidance should provide each staff officer with priorities for reportable information the executive officer or chief of staff serves as the sounding board for other information reported to the commander 435 the isr plan and unit sop should detail the procedur to properly disseminate relevant information using all appropriate means including email web postings fm radio and instant messenger these documents should also detail who needs to do what leve l of analysis before passing the refined information to higher headquarters they should also address how to provide report information to the commander and staff that needs the information without the report externals this is often referred to as tearline reporting the goal is to quickly analyze and satisfy ccirs t hus enabling the commander to make informed timely decisions determine perishability 436 when dealing with timesensitive in formation the intelligence officer ensures the requestor receives the best available information and intelligence befo re the ltiov intelligence officers must continuously coordinate with the entire staff to determine what information will bypass the normal intelligence processing functions and be sent directly to the commander based on the importance and perishability of the information and proximity to ltiov 437 determining the time sensitivity of each report allows you to make decisions bout the best means of dissemination missioncritical information may re quire pointtopoint dissemination depending on the overall execution

ipline collection processing and production are examples of technical channels 441 informal channels of collaboration and disseminati on develop whenever analysts from different units or echelons talk directly via formal means like telephone or email or through chat room conversations intelligence officers must be sure that unit sops address the procedures for formalizing information dissemination that takes place when analysts collaborate by any means to ensure the information is added to the proper product report or database 442 intelligence officers must ensure the staff has clear dissemination guidelines dissemination must be more focused during stability operati ons when air ground and sea assets may be limited aos may be noncontiguous and lines of communications extended 443 during planning the intelligence sta ff coordinates with the rest of the staff subordinate commands and the next higher echelon intelligence officer to sure specific assets pers onnel communications and support equipment and procedures are available for disseminating intelligen ce and intelligence products throughout the unit intelligence offi cers must be involved during ope rational planning in order to understand which intelligence products ar needed what is the required tim eliness where is the decision maker consumer and what logi stical and communications assets available to support intelligence dissemination determine quantity 444 the intelligence officer m ust know how much information is enough in formation this is simple task because the volume and velocity of information continues to increase with every new technological innovation the flow of data and information from multiple sensors collectors and units can easily overwhelm the analytical capabilities of unit close coordination between the analytical and isr operations planners will help guide the intelligence officer to meter the flow of information 445 intelligence officers must provide the precise amount of information to commanders and staffs to support their decision making wh ile avoiding overwhelming them with unnecessary detail or compromising security techniques means and sources for example it may not be important to provide the entire text of report to commanders if all required is threat force location and direction of movement 446 planning factors such as etiov can also help limit the amount of information sent by sensors and collectors using the enemy sitemp and eventemp from ipb the intelligence officer can determine when to begin collection operations on timeline or geographical basis in the case of steady state operations such as the stability operations in iraq and afghanistan the intelligence officer and g2s2 staff must determine what reporting is relevant or not before devoting significant effort to analyzing that data or information 447 intelligence officers must also ensure only users who have the proper need to know receive sensitive compartmented information as opposed

dissemination of information and intelligence to the right commander or staff element is vital to successful isr operations determine dissemination methods 450 the key to dissemination is providing the precise amount of information in the appropriate format to the commander or requestor in sufficient time to affect decision or assessment the networked environment of the dcgsa enterprise will facilitate dissemination and improve the commanders situational understanding 451 implied in this task is the need to mitigate risk by implementi ng by redundant means or pathways when necessary to ensure delivery of information to the commander providing too much too little or incorrectly formatted information to the commander may hinder situational understanding the intelligence officer ensures commanders and staff receive combat information and intelligence products later than the ltiov in format that best supports the commanders decisionmaking 452 dissemination is delivered as voice text graphic or digital media posting information on webpage is not considered dissemination until the in telligence office ensures th commander subordinate commanders and staff actually receive the product timeliness and capability are one of the determinants the method of dissemination arrange for direct dissemination pointtopoint dissemination 453 getting the required intelligence to the requester as soon as possible is essential to successful isr operations in pointto point dissemination informa tion goes to specific user or users because it is mission critical time sensitive and directly supports the commanders decision making it then passes sequentially from one user to the next pointtopoint dissemination has two advantages first information can be tailored to the needs of each recipient second information s builtin control mechanisms that broadcast dissemination lacks 454 whenever possible write into the isr task the requirement for pointtopoint dissemination of intelligence to the original requester if the asset reports directly to the requesting unit the intelligence staff must ensure they receive copy of the report information copies of reports alread provided directly to the original requester is one technique 455 another effective technique is not only to transmit directly as stated but also to transmit simultaneously to the intelligence staff the desired dissemination method is written into the specific isr task order or rfi include the required coordinati ng information such as call signs frequencies and routing addresses 456 pointtopoint dissemination is for items required by higher headquarters or subordinates that are of an immediate and specific nature it is particularly important for intelligence th at supports early warning and perishability whenever possible arrange for pointtopoint dissemination of targeting intelligence to the targeting cells especially when the intelligence source prompts an operation 457 even with direct dissemination intelligence officers must arrange system that allows for tracking the status of each request sometimes direct dissemination is impossible due to communications system limitations or the classification level of the intelligence intelligence officers must plan and arrange for dissemination that is as direct as possible since information already disseminated directly to

ally specified by sops as minimum intelligence officers should plan for primary and alternate met hods of dissemination redundant means and pathways for intelligence or reporting that supports ccirs and decisionmaking the orga nizational communications architecture provides basis from which to determin appropriate dissemination channels and methods the intelligence officer must work with operations and signal staff to determine the available dissemination methods as with the status of isr assets intelligence officers must continuously monitor the status of the dissemination means if information and intelligence are not provided to those who need it when they need it and in the form they need it it may not be useful to the current or future operations identify dissemination media 459 dissemination media includes radios telephone systems and computer systems web pages are an excellent method of sharing large quan tities of information and intelligence note simply posting

dissemination needs the intelligence offi cer must choose the correct disseminati on media to ensure timely delivery 461 voice is most useful in situations where speed in the transmission of small amount of information is critical it obtains instant feedback and acknowle dgement allowing for resolution of misunderstandings or ambiguity on the other hand when passing large amounts of information voice systems are slow and prone to error 462 graphics and text dissemination is ideal for lengt hy messages but can sometimes make information too subtle ambiguous and confusing when there is an option use the graphic solution for information on disposition composition and strength use text for the other threat characteristics the optimal mix is to send the graphics or text immediately with notice that voice conference will follow this allows for verification of receipt and gives an opportunity for recipients to re solve any questions or ambiguities the distribution list determines whether you use broadcas t limited broadcast or pointtopoint techniques 463 for voice communications use radio net call or conference call to transmit broadcast or limited broadcast items pointtopoint communication is best for single distribution items intelligence officers ensure the use of proper radio procedures when us ing this means of communication and dissemination 464 in terms of time required messenger with hardcopy is least desirable however if the messenger is well briefed this technique can be effective in terms of user understanding 465 when disseminating information the intelligence officers must ensure the staff uses the precedence coding system flash priority be careful not to deflate the value of the highest precedence codes is proficient in terms of operating automated systems and familiarity with message formats answers questions about accuracy source and completeness that arise during dissemination pushes items of essential information to all appropriate commanders and staff sections and makes them aware of what else is availabl informing them of other information and intelligence available allows th em to access additional informa tion from the

sent the information this problem arises due to reasons such as missed broadcasts inco rrect call signs or incorrect routing instant messaging and chat rooms are challenging problem for signal officers who must try to determine the best method for recording the delivery of information by those means 467 audit trails further optimize dissemination by ensuring that all appropriate commanders and staff sections receive each report only once users receiving the same report multiple times might interpret them as false confirmation an audit trail is one means to avoid false confirmation by ensuring that the reports received were actually different nd complementary rather than th same information from the same source 468 common technique is to provide columns on the is r plan to record messages received that satisfy an isr task and where messages were sent this technique enables the intelligence officer to record directly onto the isr plan disadvantage to this technique is that it is difficult to track messages chronologically for example give all the messages that came in yesterday morning 469 another technique is to develop matrix separate from the isr plan with time received and sent to on one axis and isr tasks on the other axis anot her technique is to annotate the dissemination list directly into the remarks section of each message 470 collection and dissemination journal is simple t echnique to track who has seen what messages disadvantage of this technique is that without automation it is difficult to link journal entries to the requirements numbering system efficiently 471 this is an area where automation is especially useful relational databases and automated journals allow complete and thorough crossi ndexing solving many of the pr oblems intelligence officers usually experience in relating requirements to reports and tracking dissemination database management 472 given the am ount of information that is likely to be available as result of intelligence collection reporting processing and production database management will be critical component in making the data accessible for analytical purposes while database management is not strictly or solely an intelligence function intelligence personnel will be required to pe rform database management functions for the unit intelligence databases 473 database management includes the

help prevent storing of duplicate data which uses up valuable storage space and mixing of information that must be stored at different classification levels and with different security or access requirements 475 intelligence personnel often develop their own pers onal databases that are userfriendly to that particular individual because they developed the data entry standard s and framework of the database themselves while useful to that particular intelligence soldier this technique is not helpful to other intelligence personnel trying to access the same info rmation for the same or

completely illogical to another individual thus re trieving data from database with data entry standards becomes haphazard units mu st therefore set specific data entr standards for their databases these specific formats ensure data can be easily retr ieved from the database through equally standardized query criteria and that the types of information fields entered into the database are consistent 477 at minimum data entry standards should include specific formats and standardized naming conventions and fields based on the category of information being entered into the database standard naming conventions include determining standard nomenclature or equipment data entry examples 448 primary database field with mixture of ied nomenclatures such as vbied 449 rcied and efp would turn simple query of the database for ieds into 450 complex search for all of the possible variants of ieds 451 452 standardizing data entry on an improvised expl osive device with primary field of 453 ied and secondary field to specify the type of ied such as vbied rcied or 454 efp may allow the analyst to conduct mo re organized search for information and 455 intelligence 456 457 458 459

intelligence officers shoul d specify the types of in formation required when entering reports of captured enemy equipment into the database this may include the type of equipment such as truck tank or small arms and complete description of the equipment such as equipment is operational or nonoperational serial number or vehicle identification number or other unique identifiers that may determine the origin and manufacturer of the equipment 479 not all of the required information will be available for each data entry however in many cases it is equally important to an analyst using the information to know that specific type of information for that data entry is unavailable or was not collected and not that the person entering the data simply failed to input that particular information 480 another example is setting standards for storage of photographs information such as the source and classification of the photograph should normally be included in the database along with the photograph itself security protocols 481 automation personnel must be aware of the security requirements for their networks systems and databases protocols must be established to ensu re only authorized personnel can access the network system or database additionally appropriate protocol s must be developed in order to prevent the export or import of data to unauthorized networks system s or databases based on accesses or classification levels 482 protocols include establishing set of rules so that network system and database users are aware of their individual require ments when

need different computer systems in order to access all the necessary data sources required for the mission database normalization 485 database norm alization helps to eliminate redunda ncy storing the

of limited storage space speeds up database queries and prevents confusion over duplicate data entries import and export standards 486 units often transfer data between systems and ot her units standardization of import and export protocols will ensure transferred databases are acce ssible immediately upon transf er databases and files that are created with different sta ndards may not be accessible or usable to the system receiving the data the dcgsa enterprise open architecture should aid in the import and export of databases see appendix c for more information on dcgsa overview update and backup procedures 487 units must establish plan for updating the software on their networks and systems to ensure that the latest changes to fix glitches or security holes in the software are repaired likewise units must establish procedure for conducting backups of the data on their networks and systems to prevent an irrecoverable loss in the event of rdware or software failure system of archiving data must also be established assessing isr operations 488 assessment is the continuous monitoring and evaluation of the current situation particularly the enemy and progress of an operation fm 30 ssessing isr operations enables the operations and intelligence officers to monitor and evaluate the current situation and progress of the operation the desired result is to ensure all isr tasks are completely satisfied in timely manner keeping the intelligence system synchronized and that intelligence officer s know the status of each requirement 489 assessing isr operations starts with monitoring and evaluating the reporting by isr assets as they execute their missions reporting is the act of passing information from isr asset to processor or operations center and into the intelligence process combat information is quickly reported to the commander or other decision maker for immediate action as well as reported into the intelligence process where it is analyzed against other intelligence and then disseminated 490 intelligence officers track reporting to determine how well the isr effort is satisfying the ccir the desired result is relevant information is delivered to the commander before the ltiov intelligence officers isr elements and staff each ensure is r assets are not performing tasks for intelligence requirements that have already been satisfied the

intelligence requirements as well as adjustments to the timelines the staff usually initiates abbreviated versions of the ip b and decisionmaking processes to accommodate the changes in their assumptions be prepared to update isr planning as result 495 not all intelligence will fl ow through the intelligence cell some collectors w ill report directly to users such as the targeting cell monitoring synchronization and evaluating reporting requires intelligence officers to establish some system to evaluate all reports including those that go directly from the collector to the user 496 intelligence officers set up system that allows the intelligence section to monitor synchronization and evaluate how well the intelligence system is meeting requirement s without unduly delaying intelligence dissemination correlate reports to requirements 497 the intelligence staff tracks which specific isr task originates from which intelligence requirement to ensure the collected information was provided to the original requester and to all who need the information for efficiency and tim eliness the intelligence staff also ensures produc tion tasks are linked to validated intelligence requirements this also allows intelligence officers to determine which isr tasks have been satisfied and which require more collection 498 intelligence officers must address potential challenges for example large volumes of information th at could inundate the intelligence section the intelligence staff may have trouble finding the time to correlate each report many reports will only partially satisfy number of isr tasks while other reports may have nothing to do with the tasked isr task collectors may report information without referring to the original isr task that drove their collection some collectors may assign their own internal numbering system which intelligence officers might confuse with the isr task and requirements numbering system circular reporting and socalled spam or unnecessa ry message traffic can cause great deal of consternation and wastes valuable time 499 units should have tracking system in place as pa rt of their operational so p that

4100 correlating intelligence reporting to the original requirement and evaluating reports are keys to effective requirements management this quality control effort helps the g2s2 staff ensure timely satisfaction of intelligence requirements requirements management includes dissemination of reporting and related information to original requesters and othe r users all of these functions require recording system that allows intelligence fficers to track the progress of each requirement and crossreference incoming reports to outstanding requirements 4101 isr assets must ensure they follow the sop and tag all of their reports with the numbers of the isr tasks they satisfy at the same time the sop must ensure isr assets understand and have means of reporting important but unanticipated information intelligence officers must develop templates that will enable you to quickly match incoming reports to outstanding isr tasks match the locations on the report to the event template the report locations will naturally appear in or near the nais for the concerned isr task develop keyword keyname and keyindicator lists that quickly index key elements of report to the appropriate isr task for example all repor ts about the city of baghdad refer to isr task 7y4 or 5a2 screen reports 4102 after reports have been correlated and tagged to the appropriate isr task determine whether the isr task has been satisfied screen each report for the following criteria relevance does the information actually address the tasked isr task if not can you use this information to satisfy other requirements completeness is essential information missing refer to the original isr task timeliness has the collector reported by the ltiov established in the original isr task opportunities for cueing can this system or another system take advantage of the new information to increase the eff ectiveness and efficiency of th overall isr effort if the report suggests an opportunity to cue other assets take immediate action to do so and record any new requirements into the isr plan and audit trail 4103 if the report satisfies the isr task make the appropriate entry in the tracking log or register of intelligence requirements and disseminate the final intelligence to the requestor coordinate with the requestor to ensure the requestor also considers the requirement satisfied 4104 if the report only partially satisfies the isr task annotate in the audit trail or registers what has been accomplished and what remains to be done 4105 isr assets should avoid submitti ng reports that simply state nothing significant to report sometimes these reports intend to convey that collection occurred and that activity satisfying the isr task was observed this may be significant indicator in itself on the other hand nothing significant to report may have different connotati on particularly to intelligence offi cers and is by means reliable indicator of the absence of activity provide feedback 4106 the intelligence staff should provide feedback to all isr collection assets on their m ission effectiveness and to analytic sections on their pr oduction this is normally provided through the command and control element of that unit feedback reinforces whether collection or production is satisfying the original task or request and provides guidance if it does not feedback is essential to maintaining isr effectiveness and to alert leaders to ficiencies that must be corrected 4107 as the operation continues the intelligence secti on tracks the status of each isr task

friendly force aircraft crash or shoot down or loss of uas asset to enemy fire mechanical failure or loss of signal not only disrupt the collection operation but may require adhoc tasking of additional assets to try to locate the aircraft the best method of preparing for ad hoc tasking is to prepare battle drills in the command post sop 4120 these drills can be developed by asking what if and then walking step by step through the logical procedures that should follow obviously there are many variables that cannot be anticipated in advance but the g2s2 and g3s3 staff can be better prepared by developing drills which cover the most common occurrences expected to require isr retasking of isr assets 4121 for example troopsincontact report from patrol aircraft or convoy is frequently followed by request for isr support either from the unit itself or the commander who wants to see for himself what is happening on the ground the command post battle drill fo r troops in contact shoul d include isr actions steps so that assets can be redirected 4122 as the need for changes arise intelligence officers must coordinate with the appropriate sections to update products

eliminate it from the isr synchronization matrix and the isr plan and update any other logs and records develop and add new requirements 4128 as the operation unfolds and the threat situation develops commanders will generate new requirements this prompts intelligence officers to begin updating the isr synchr onization tools as new requirements are developed they are prioritized against the remaining requirements some of the previous requirements may still be valid consolidate the new requirements with the existing requirements reprioritize the requirements evaluate resources based upon

staff participation and synergy to properly focus isr assets on the ccirs successful isr planning ties the isr synchronization and integration activities into the entire staff planning and operations

jointnational all enhanced by the netcentric dcgsa enterprise 4147 in recent oif counterinsurgency operations ssons learned suggest that the requirements development process must be closely tied to the ssessment process for measures of effectiveness and measures of performance for more discussion on effectsbased planning see fm 50 appendix developing requirements for isr planning the methodology used for developing requi rements for isr operations is probably the most important aspect of isr planning if isr assets units and soldiers do not understand when where and what they are s upposed to collect then it is likely that the information gathered will not answer the ccir this appendix describes the process of developing requirements which ultimately become isr tasks for collection by all the assets units and soldiers under the commanders control general a1 requirements are developed in predeployment prior to mission and during ongoing operations because isr synchronization activities are continuous and not sequential these steps are not discrete and may often overlap an important element of deve loping requirements during ongoing operations is constant collaboration between analytical personnel and isr planners to redefine information requirements and focus the isr effort as the situation develops a2 developing requireme nts begins as early as possible in so cases before receipt of the mission when only partial information about the general location or category of mission is known requirements development continues as the intelligence staff collects initial baseline information and intelligence from existing sources databases and through intelligence r each in order to develop preliminary intelligence and the initial staff estimate in preparation for the mdmp a3 the intelligence staff continues to develop and re fine requirements as the commander receives the mission and presents initial guidance to the staff the commanders guidance includes the critical information for the aoi expressed in later steps of the mdmp as the ccir which the commander must know to successfully plan prepar execute and assess operations a4 the commander decides what information is critical based on experience the mission input from the staff the higher commanders intent and the staffs estimate of the situation critical information requirements are based on events or activities that are linked directly to the current and future situation ccirs consist of priority intelligence requirements pirs and friendly fore information requirements ffirs which assist the commander in controlling the flow of critical information intelligence officers review the commanders requirements and develop intelligence requirements intelligence officers validate and recommend pirs to the commander manage th commanders pirs and request information from higher or lateral organizations a5 during staff planning and wargaming it is importa nt that the commander and staff look at friendly forces through the eyes of the threat force conducting operations in such way as to set predictable patterns not adhering to strict opsec measures and considering the threat on purely conventional linear terms are examples of situations in which the th reat force can easily exploit weaknesses commander may task the intelligence staff to determine if an eefi has been detected by the enemy figure a1 depicts the relationship of information requirements including ccirs pirs and ffirs and eefis publication date initial draft fm 201 a1 initial draft draft doctrine not for

developed throughout the full spectrum of operations and at all stages or phases of operational planning preparations and execution as ongoing operations produce information which is analyzed into intelligence new information requirements will be developed to drive new operations or branches and sequels of current operations for example inte lligence derived from site exploitation conducted on todays objective could drive an operation tomorrow a7 the intelligence staff generates information requirements during the mission analysis portion of the mdmp stated either as an ir or as an assu mption concerning the metttc mission variables the intelligence staff also consolidates and manages information requirements from other staff sections the commander may express information requirements early in the mdmp and may identify them specifically as pirs the intelligence staff refines information requirements during coa development and coa analysis wargaming figure a2

priority intelligence requirements a8 pirs should be developed for each fri endly coa just as there are standard situation templates or friendly coas that will serve in all situations there is standard set of pirs wellwritten pirs meet the following criteria they provide intelligence required to support single planning task d ecision or action they ask only one question they focus on specific f act event or activity they can be satisfied using available assets or capabilities example poor pir will the threat attack if so wher when and in what strength a9 the example above actually contains four significantly di fferent questions will the threat attack where will the threat attack when will the threat attack in what strength will the threat attack which of these four questions is the priority unless given more guidance isr assets must decide for themselves which part of this pir to collect against a10 it assumes the intelligence staff know s absolutely nothing about the thr eat situation actually they probably know more about the situation than the threat might attack sometime somewhere and in some strength using the ipb process they can provide more focused pir than this a11 finally when wargaming potential friendly and enemy coas the staff should find some aspects of this pir to be irrelevant to the friendly coa for example the defense may be fully capable of repelling the threat regardless of when they actually attack perhaps the focus needs only to be on where they will attack supporting decision on employment of the friendly reserve examples of good pirs what are the religious leaders of nei ghborhood x saying about friendly forces how does terror cell receive payments from terror financier z a12 each of these examples asks one question and focu ses on specific fact even t or activity pirs can be used by the commander and staff to determine threat capabilities objectives intent or to support confirm or deny decision or hypothesis on probable enemy coas a13 commanders and staffs may be concerned that making new intelligence requirements and pirs will overloaded the collection system greater number of pirs and information requirements which are clear and specific are more likely to be satisfied the more specific focus makes it easier to develop sirs isr tasks and rfis to support them the number of isr ta sks and rfis will remain more or less constant the poorly written pir that asks four questions will need bout as many isr tasks and rfis as four specific wellwritten pirs a14 as discussed earlier the commanders decision making drives pir development during mission analysis and wargaming coa analysis indicators can also drive pirs and intelligence requirements development especially in stability operations where confirmed

develops named areas of interest nais and targeted areas of interest tais the sta ff can also develop an hvt list that could include not only geographic nais or tais but also organizations networks and individuals who are identified as key or critical elemen ts of the operational environment there is limit to how creative or flexible the intelligen ce staff can be in developing and focusing requirements for targeting in support of the commanders objectives and intent for example requi rements may not be focused on certain geographic area but instead on network or person named area of interest a19 named area of interest is the geographical area where information that will satisfy sir can be collected fm 390 nais are usually selected to capture indications of enemy coas but also may be related to battlefield and environmental conditions a20 commanders tailor the shape of the nai symbol to the actual area they want observed rather than using prescribed shape it is possible to redesignate an nai as tai on confirmation of enemy activity within the area allowing commanders to mass the effects of their combat power on that area see fm 390 for more information on nais targeted area of interest a21 targeted area of interest is the geographi cal area or point along mobility corridor where successful interdiction will cause the enemy to abandon particular coa or require him to use specialized engineer support to continue it is where the enemy can be acquired and engaged by friendly forces fm 3 90 commanders designate tais where they believe their units can best attack highpayoff targets a22 the unit staff develops tais during the targeting process based on the currently available products resulting from the ipb process these tais are furthe r refined during wargaming and finally approved by the commander during coa approval the shape of tai reflects the type of target and the weapon system intended to engage that target they are normally cued by surveillance assets which include unmanned aircraft systems uass combat observati on and lasing teams longrange surveillance units fixedwing reconnaissance aircraft using variety of sensors and

develop indicators and develop sirs anticipate a26 intelligence officers and g2s2 staff identify new or refine existing requirements and present them to commanders for approval they must recognize when and where to recommend to operations officers to shift collection anticipating and developing new requi rements is based on solid situational awareness thorough review of ipb products and existing intelligen ce holdings and an understanding of the concept of the operation to include branches sequels and th need to transition into followon operations a27 the ability to anticipate requirements will give intelligence officers additional time to plan for the use of isr assets available to them anticipating upcoming requirements also allows intelligence officers to communicate with higher headquarters and plan for future submissions of rfis the more time intelligence officers can give the units that control the army theater and national level systems the more likely it will be to obtain the required support for specified timeframe good example is forecasting the additional isr support needed during critical events such as nationa l elections if intelligence officers know that national elections will occur in 6 months they can develop additional requirements and request asset support from higher headquarters in advance analyze a28 requirements are analyzed to ensure the most eff ective use of isr assets analyze each requirement to determine how best to satisfy it sometimes this doe s not require tasking unit organization or sensor for collection often newly recei ved requirement can be satisfied by intelligence reach or by submitting an rfi this includes separating recording valida ting consolidating and prioritizing each recommended requirement separate a29 intelligence officers categorize in telligence gaps by those that can be answered through intelligence reach although usually not as responsive as units own ssets intelligence reach may be the only way to satisfy an intelligence requirement if at all possible one should not depend solely on intelligence reach to answer pir rfi for collection submit rfis for collection to higher and lateral echelons developing requirements for isr planning publication date initial draft fm 201 a7 initial draft draft doctrine not for implementation or operational use for official use only other collection recommendations record a30 intelligence officers receive requireme nts in the form of isr tasks and rfis as well as requirements produced from mission analysis coa analysis wargaming and current operations record requirements from higher adjacent and subordinate units ong with the requirements produced during mission planning this record tracks each requirement from its receipt to its eventual satisfaction merger or elimination recording can be done using spreadsheet database or other mechanism prescribed by unit sops validate a31 validate each requirement by considering its necessity feasibility and completeness necessity is this requirement really necessary or valid if so has it already been satisfied check databases to see if someone has alread collected the inform ation or produced the intelligence if product alr eady exists that satisfies the requi rement refer the requester to the agency that produced it if the requester does not have access to that agencys database then obtain and provide the product to the requestor refer requests for production to the appropriate agency in some cases the intelligence already exists but not in the format the requestor desires one example of this is unit that wants demographics map put together from data that already exists feasibility does the unit have the assets with the capabilities to execute the mission in time and with the detail required to support decision if not can the unit submit an rfi to the echelon that does own the isr capability with reasonable expectation of getting response in time completeness all requirements should specify who needs the results when time that the indicator is expected to occur and the latest time the commander needs to know ltiov what activity or indicator where geolocation nai or tai why justification other specific instructions or information consolidate a32 requirements received as isr tasks and rfis are often similar to those generated during mission planning consolidation involves identifying identical and similar requirements and forming them into single requirement successful consolidation results in smaller number of requirements to track and an identification of which subordinate elements may or may not be capable of collecting on requirement a33 simplify the collection effort by merging simila r requirements normally replace the more poorly written requirement with the wording of the better justified or more specific requirement however exercise caution when merging requirements the intent of either of the original requirements is not lost the accountability of merged requirements is ma intained through accurate recordkeeping dissemination is made to every requesting hea dquarters when requirement is satisfied or eliminated prioritize a34 prioritize each intelligence requirement based on its importance in supporting the commanders intent and decisions prioritization based on the co mmanders guidance and the current situation ensures appendix a8 fm 201 publication date initial draft initial draft draft doctrine not for implementation or operational use for official use only lowdensityhighdemand isr assets and resources are directed against the most critical requirements effective prioritization requires monitoring of the operation to respond to changing situations a35 when prioritizing consider the importance of the requirement above the echelon that generated it subordinate commanders requirement may well be mo re important to the success of the commanders mission than all the other requirements a36 when prioritizing requirements intelligence offi cers should consider the ability to meet the requirement as well as justification specificity significance and time phasing of requirements over the course of the operation justification a37 requirements are justified by their linkage to decisions consider the following two requirements requirement 1 isr task from higher where does the terror cell obtain improvised explosive device ied components and precursor explosive materials requirement 2 rfi from subordinate is the threats reserve tank battalion assembled for counterattack in nai 5 or nai 6 triggers artillery strikes and d ecision to send attack helicopters to either tai 5 or tai 6 a38 in the above case prioritize requirement number 2 higher than number 1 even though the first is task from higher and the second is request from subordinate accept and plan collection to satisfy the senior commands specific order specified task however its priority is determined by the importance of the decision it supports specificity a39 requirements should be narrowed and refined to the most specific what when and where questions possible the why is the justification consider the following two requirements requirement 1 specific order from higher which mosques in fallujah have been broadcasting anticoalition messages during friday prayers requirement 2 specific request from subordinate when will terrorist return to his familys home in sadr city triggers re positioning of other isr assets to continue surveillance and possible raid to capture terrorist a40 requirement number 1 is so broad that collectors have authority to collect on just about anything these kinds of general unfocused questions usually generate general unfocused answers requirement number 2 is thoroughly considered focused question the requester knows exactly what is required and stands better chance of receiving the required an swer once again rank re quirement number 2 higher than number 1 significance a41 what is the relative significance of the activity to the commanders intent some activities within the ao are more critical to your commanders intent during wargaming commanders will give guidance on what is considered most important if not the commanders intent is reflected in the priorities assigned to each part of the operation use this as basis fo r establishing prioritized list from which to make recommendations to the commander for approval a42 after intelligence officers prioritize the list and make recommendations commanders designate some of the most important requirements as pirs and th erefore declare that the ffort to answer pirs is mission essential in other words failure to satisfy the pir endangers the commands mission accomplishment the pirs are then arranged in priority order for maximum effectiveness intelligence officers and commanders should refine the pirs to specific questions that are linked to operational decisions as discussed above developing requirements for isr planning publication date initial draft fm 201 a9 initial draft draft doctrine not for implementation or operational use for official use only time phasing a43 time phasing influences prioritization time phasing of intelligence requirements like synchronization is continuous process the operation may progress more or less quickly than anticipated during staff wargaming consequently the expected timelines based on the original staff wargaming may change as the operation unfolds monitor the conduct of the operation and stay alert for changes in the ltiov based on other shifts in the operational timelin the most important requirement may have an ltiov in later stage of an operation a44 normally each intelligence requirement has tim relative to point in the operation when satisfying it will be critically important after which the requirement may be overcome by events and it becomes longer significant or longe r necessary to collect consequen tly the relative priority of each requirement may change over time some pirs may re main the same for the duration of the operation or entire campaign while other pirs change during th operation from phase to phase or based on the sequence of events as they unfold a45 the g2s2 staff establishes ltiov based on the co mmanders input the priorities in each phase of the operation and by considering the time required to deliver the finished intelligence to the commander and staff they must be sure that they establish an ltiov which will allow delivery of the intelligence in time for the commander to make decision a46 once commanders approve pirs intelligence officers and staff begin the process of translating pirs and other intelligence requirements into indicators and sirs which result in isr tasks and rfis for collection indicators and sirs may be developed concurrently developing indicators a47 an indicator is an item of information that reflects the intention or capability of an adversary to adopt or reject coa jp 20 in army intelligence usage indicators are positiv or negative evidence of threat activity or any char acteristic of the ao which points toward threat vulnerabilities or the adoption or rejection by the threat of particular capability or which may influence the commanders selection of coa indicators may result from previous actions or from threat failure to take action indicators are the basis for situation development indicators are positive or negative evidence of threat other activity or characteristic of the ao that points toward capabilities vulnerabilities or intentions indicators show the adoption or rejection by the threat of particular coa that may influence the commanders selection of coa a48 indicators may also result from previous actions or fro m threat failure to take action taken together indicators may prove or disprove pir individual indicators usually do not stand alone analysts on the intelligence staff develop indicators integrating each indicator with othe r factors and indicators before patterns are detected and threat intentions are established a49 the event template and event matrix are tools to assist in visualizing indicator development refer to fm 2013 when published the event template depicts the nais where activity or lack of it will indicate which enemy coa the threat has adopted the combination of the nai indicators and time phase lines associated with each threat coa form the basi s of the event template a50 the event matrix complements the event template by describing indicators and activities expected to occur in each nai it normally crossre ferences each nai and indicator with the times they are expected to occur and the coas they will confirm or deny and its relationship to other events in the ao the primary use of the event matrix is to plan intelligence collection however it serves as an aid to situation development as well a51 the intelligence analyst uses indicators to correlate particular events or activities within the operational environment these may pertain to threat or civil activities indicators will identify probable enemy coas and determine what events or activities must occur for threat to follow particular coa the ability to read indicators inc luding recognition of threat decepti on indicators contributes to the appendix a10 fm 201 publication date initial draft initial draft draft doctrine not for implementation or operational use for official use only success of friendly operations the analyst integrates information from all sources to confirm indicators of threat activities as indicators are detected and confirmed pirs are satisfied specific information requirements sir a52 sirs facilitate tasking by matching requirements to assets the operations officer assigns tasks in time precedence based on the latest time informati on is of value ltiov and the capabilities and limitations of available isr assets the ltiov is the absolute latest time the information can be used by the commander in making the decision the pir supports fm 20 the ltiov can be linked to time an event or point in the battle or operation a53 sirs describe the information required and may include both the location where and the time during which the information can be collected generally each intelligence requirement generates set of sirs a54 ideally each intelligence requirement will contain ll the information the g2s2 needs to develop supporting sirs in such cases the intelligence requirement states wher and when to co llect intelligence officers need to refine what to coll ect into specific items of informati on if they receive requirements that do not contain the information needed to establish wher and when to collect they must coordinate with the originator to obtain that information the needed information should be contained in the ipb products that helped generate the requirement a55 when the intelligence staff matches indicators with the where when and what to collect transition to the creation of sirs occurs as intelligence officers develop sirs they should coordinate with operations officers to get an understanding of the specifi city required to support planning technique is to develop sir sets while the operations officers develop the collection stra tegy for each requirement and the general scheme of maneuver a56 sirs may be expressed as question or statement the first step is to make each indicator more specific by identifying the where to collect tying it to specific poi nt in the ao for example use specific nai to replace the general id ea of forward in the indicator f orward deployment of artillery and rewrite it as artillery deployed in nai 12 if the intelligence requirement is well written it will contain the level of detail necessary for the intelligence staff to do this a57 use similar technique to specify the when to collect if the intelligence requirement is well written it will contain the timelines needed to establish the when to collect if it does not coordinate with the intelligence s ection their situation templates depic ting the enemy coa under consideration and the graphics depicting the friendly scheme of mane uver should help provide the information needed to establish collection timelines for the nai in question a58 develop more detail in the observables by identifying the specific information or signatures that supports the indicator for example specific informa tion which supports the indi cator artillery deployed in nai 12 might include presence of artillery weapons presence of fire direction control equipment or vehicles presence of artillery associated communications equipment presence of artillery ammunition carriers a59 develop each indicator furt her by coordinating with the intellig ence section to id entify the specific types of equipment or ot her specifics associated with each developing sir a60 for example replace the generic artillery weapons with specifics such as m109 or m110 self propelled artillery systems if that is what should be present within the nai similarly replace artillery associated communications with the digital data signal if that is the type used by the threat force in question this helps commanders and operations officers to optimize their collection capabilities against the target in question developing requirements for isr planning publication date initial draft fm 201 a11 initial draft draft doctrine not for implementation or operational use for official use only a61 because each intelligence requirement will generate number of indicators that will in turn generate number of sirs finalize each sir by labeling it with an identifier that allo ws intelligence officers to trace it back to the or iginal intelligence requirement final sir might be written as are there digital data signals active in nai 12 between 041200 and 060200 march ltiov 060400 march a62 remember that indicators and sirs are analytical tools for the intelligence section intelligence officers ensure the analyst s the information that truly indicates threat actions and satisfies the original requirement developing isr tasks a63 developing requirements ends with sir development because the development of isr tasks must occur as the synchronization plan is being developed the intelligence officer must consider whether to task an asset or request support from higher resour ce or to request collection by joint or national systems appendix b intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance synchronization training and resources this appendix outlines the isr synchronization training available through us army sources and the isr synchronization inform ation resources available to soldiers general b1 isr synchronization duties at any echelon should not be handed to the least experienced staff member the intelligence officer must be involved and must

assist intelligence officers at lower echelons with their isr plans for example in typical joint task force jtf j 2 headquarters joint intelligence operations center jioc is created in the jioc the collection management cm and rfi sections will be most useful to army intelligence officers as they plan isr operations in some cases the collection management and dissemination sections are combined by the j2 into one section which is referred to as collection management and dissemination cmd c13 the joint force collection manager ensures all re quests for additional isr resources are based on validated needs as established by the commands formal intelligence requirements c14 subordinate army commanders submit their rfis through echelon channels and if they cannot be answered at the intermediate echelons they are passed to the jtf rfi section for research and response once an rfi is returned without answer subordinate commanders can submit request for collection or request for isr support to the jioc who will apportion asse ts and allocate resources in order of priority as defined by the jtf commander collection requirements which cannot be satisfied by assets controlled or apportioned by the jtf are translated into th national intelligence system for collection joint intelligence support element c15 the joint intelligence suppor t element jise is created at the

exist for defined period of time usi ng existing data new collection is required limited duration ins require collection and production over period of 090 days standing ins require sust ained collection over periods exceedi ng 90 days and up to two years c44 ins are further prioritized based on how quickly the sigint community must react to the request for collection routine ins require action in 30 or more days time sensitive ins require actions within 4 to 29 days after submission time critical ins must be acted upon within the first 3 days after submission c45 requests for national sigint collection must be s ponsored at the national level validated by the intelligence community and pr ioritized among all the othe r competing requirements multinational intelligence operations c46 there is single intelligence doctrine for multinational operations each coalition or alliance must develop its own unique procedures c47 in multinational operations the multinational force commander exercises command authority over military force composed of elements from two or more nations therefore in most multinational operations the jtf must share intelligence as necessary for mission acco mplishment with foreign military forces and coordinate the exchange of intelligence liaisons with those forces c48 command and control of isr resources may remain ssentially national or they may be integrated into combined command and contro l structure either way intellig ence remains national responsibility and most nations with significant presence in the combined force will establish national intelligence cell nic joint national and multinational intelligen ce surveillance and reconnaissance planning considerations publication date initial draft fm 201 c9 initial draft draft doctrine not for implementation or operational use for official use only c49 us units subordinated to nonus headquarters may require augmentation with linguists or bilingual liaison officers and series of front end terminals such as mobile integrat ed tactical terminal to ensure their continued connectivity with us theater and national collection systems connectivity to us networks is critical to success in coalition environment c50 intelligence officers should be aware of and remain sensitive to cultural andor religious differences among multinational members in some instances these may result in periods of increased vulnerability for the joint force or may require scheduli ng changes for meetings andor briefings alliances c51 army units frequently perform intelligence operations in multinational environment within the structure of an alliance or coaliti on which presents many additional challenges for intelligence personnel north atlantic treaty organization nato and the command in the republic of korea are examples of highly structured and enduring alliances intelligence architectur organizations and procedures are well defined in alliances therefore us army in telligence officers must learn to operate within the parameters of an alliance maintaining sops and sta ndards in accordance with thei r unit policies but also complying with the alliances standardized agreements c52 the advantage to an alliance is existing international standardization agreements for example north atlantic treaty organization sta ndardization agreements or stanags these arrangements establish rules and policies for conducting joint intelligence ope rations since each multinational operation has its unique aspects such standing agreements may have to be modified or amended based on the situation coalitions c53 other multinational military organizations such as the coalitions formed during the gulf war and the global war on terrorism gwot are temporary or ad hoc organizations formed for particular mission coalitions require great deal more adapta tion and improvisation in order to achieve success often times the coalition comes together on short notice basis and the arrangements for collaboration and intelligence sharing must be hammered out while the planning process is underway c54 in some stability and support operations the jtf might require the authority to go outside the usual military channels in order to provide informati on to nongovernmental organi zations ngo or other governments and agencies in order to achieve the co mmanders intent the jtf must tailor its intelligence policies and dissemination guidance to each multina tional operation because they are all unique intelligence collaboration c55 isr synchronization operations in combined nvironment can be confounded by language issues differing tasking and request channels and formats information classification and foreign disclosure concerns and national sensitivities troop contributing nations may have political or rules of engagement constraints which limit their ability to perform certain missions c56 collection managers must be familiar with multinational collection and communications systems and the tasking and request channels they require proven technique is the use of intelligence liaison personnel to formulate effective collection st rategy and facilitate rapid dissemination c57 the following are guidelines to assist subordinate joint force j2 and staff exact steps depend on the nature of the military operation establish liaison between joint and multinational force intelligence organizations develop procedures for review to expedite sanitization and sharing of usgenerated intelligence products with allies and multinational partners communicate friendly objectives intentions and plans to appropriate intelligence organizations appendix c c10 fm 201 publication date initial draft initial draft draft doctrine not for implementation or operational use for official use only ensure interoperability of command control and communication systems this is achieved by placing common coalition intelligence system such as centrixs in all the headquarters and subordinate units to facilitate communications similarities and differences c58 there will be differences in in telligence doctrine and procedures among multinational partners key to effective multinational intelligence is heavy coordination training and extensive liaison beginning with the highest levels of command to make the adjustments required to resolve these differences c59 major differences may include how intelligence is provided to the commander jointly or individual services or agencies procedures for sharing in formation among intelligence agencies and the degree of security afforded by different communications syst ems and procedures administrative differences that need to be addressed may include classificati on levels personnel security clearance standards requirements for access to sensitive intellig ence and translation requirements c60 typically there is disparity in the capabilities of us and multinational forces multinational forces may have greater intelligence resources within given region valuable and extensive humint and access to the population and open sources us forces ge nerally have to provide technical assistance in order to share information and intelligence foreign disclosure considerations c61 it is imperative that combined forces commanders establish syst em that optimizes each nations contributions and st rengths all units under the multinationa l headquarters are entitled to reliable intelligence us units subordinated to nonus h eadquarters may face unique problems in disseminating intelligence if direct channel is av ailable to the next higher us hea dquarters the tactical us unit may have better and more current intelligence than its cont rolling nonus headquarters in that instance liaison personnel have responsibility to disseminate intelligen ce both up and down while dhering to restrictions that deal with the release of intelligence to allied and multinational forces c62 in isr operations there are always constraints to fore ign disclosure due to the technical nature of the data imagery or intelligence product disseminated af ter isr operations practices such as write for release become very important in facilitate intelligence sharing whenever possible tear line reports and releasable imagery should be obt ained in order to share with coalition or alliance partners c63 likewise the other nations in the multinational h eadquarters must be encouraged to share their intelligence information for the benef it of everyone involved many nati ons have long tradition of stove piping intelligence and will find it difficult to learn different methods of dissemination systems compatibility c64 many instances in recent intelligence operations in oif and oef illu strate the fact that compatibility is always as issue to be considered in isr planni ng for example in oif th romanian intelligence group at multinational divisioncentral south operated shadow uas however their model was different than the shadow uas operated by the us army therefor when spare parts became problem for romanian forces rapid analysis was completed to determine if there were common parts between the two different models see figure c3 c65 connectivity is another isr related issue that must be considered in multinational environments even though many us airborne collection platforms use common data link can connect to several ground station systems such as one system remote video terminal osrvt and remote optical video enhanced receiver rover many fo reign airborne systems cannot nd must use their own unique ground station systems c66 coalitions may have multiple communications sy stems that do not connect each nation in coalition will bring its own internal systems but most nations rely on the united states to provide joint national and multinational intelligen ce surveillance and reconnaissance planning considerations common communications system the importance of placing american liaison officers at the coalition countries headquarters cannot be understated because of the system s compatibility issues that frequently arise figure c3 the romanian intelligence group uav in oif multinational isr synchronization c67 when multinational commander and staff consider their isr plan they must contemplate all of the unique and varied resources in the coalition units under their command this may require an exchange of information on performance characteristics capabilities limitations range dwell time sustainment requirements and data conversion capabilities c68 frequently coalition unit commanders who do not have robust isr capability will ask for us support policies and procedures for establishing re quirements requesting collection or support and transmitting the data or finished intelligence to the coalition partner have to be worked out by the higher headquarters j2g2s2 c69 to the extent that isr synchronization is process that contemplates all organic and nonorganic assets or resources available to the commander the coalition contribution is importa nt to understand so that it can be effectively and efficiently employed toward answering
