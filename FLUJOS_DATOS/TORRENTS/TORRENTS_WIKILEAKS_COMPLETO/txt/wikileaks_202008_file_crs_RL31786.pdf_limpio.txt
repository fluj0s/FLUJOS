covers the funding composition oversight and technical f easibility of tia programs the privacy implications are addre ssed in crs report rl31730 privacy total information awareness programs and related informa tion access collection and protection laws by gina marie stevens in press interview under secretar of defense for acquisition technology and logistics edward c pete aldridge stated that the total information awareness project is funded at 10 million in fy2003 and 20 million in fy2004 other reports indicated higher funding levels of ov er 100 m illion in fy2003 and over 200 million for the threeyear period fy2001 fy2003 different accounts of funding levels reflect the fact that darpa is funding both an integrative effort called the tia system as well as 16 individual rd efforts or tia programs that could be combined to create that system in fy2003 darpa is dedicating 10 million to integrate various r d efforts into prototype tia system and 1375 million for the various rd progra ms that could make up that system and that are managed by the information awareness office iao headed by poindexter funding for these pr ograms total 1375 million in fy2003 and 3170

programs are ongoing in response to concerns about programs congress included special oversight provisions known as the wyden amendment in the fy2003 consolidated appropriations resolution pl 1087 requiring that the secretary of defense the director of central intelligence and the attorney general submit detailed joint report on tia programs by may 20 2003 or face cutoff in funding senator

appropriate for darpa to develop tia technologies once comp leted dod did not anticipate using the technology because of the desire that th is kind of intrusive but perhaps essential capability be operated by civilian rather than military personnel9 instead he anticipated that the tia system would be transferred to civilian law enforcement agencies and be subject to the j udicial and

another new user would be president bushs proposed new rrorist threat integration center to be established may 1 2003 with the mission of integrating all of us government information and analysis about potential terrorist threats33 darpa envisions working with potential users in the design of its tools for deci sion makers practice that could be difficult with restric tions on transfer of tia components sharing information among several users makes it more difficult to protect both intelligence sources and the privacy of individuals for that reason darpa is sponsoring some research on developing fi re walls that would protect the sources of intelligence gatherers and prevent potential leakage among users the distributed type of system that darpa envisions coul d make those challenges greater early collaboration with potential users for wh ich darpa has been praised could also create problems with ensuring privacy nd preventing misuse of intelligence sources and data on

to establish citizen advisory board to privacy policy standards35 on february 7 2003 the department of defense established two boards to monitor tia programs36 made up of highlevel dod officials the internal tia oversight board is tasked with setting policies and procedures for use of tia tools within dod and establishing protocols fo r transferring tia capabilities outside of dod to ensure consistency with privacy ws and policies dod also established an outside advisory board including experts in privacy issues to advise the secretary of defense on policy and legal issues raised by using advanced technology to identify and predict terrorists threats37 in separate statements to reporters senator wyden and spokesman for the american civil li berties union each suggested that the new boards proposed by the pentagon did not eliminate the need for congressional oversight38 pl 1087 passed by both houses th following week requires that dod inform and get congressional authorization for any transfers between agencies or for deployment of any tia components u nder pl 1087 testing outside of dod may also be subject to rigorous oversight in its current research darpa has been careful to use dummy or fictitious data on individuals to test the effectiveness of various models for detecting potential terrorists or to use only data that is currently legally permissible for intelligence gathering purposes see discussion of ongoing darpa collaboration above if darpas technology efforts in data mining or model development are to be fully tested however real data with

some observers see great potentia l in darpas tia proposals to exploit wide range of data bases and develop models to identif terrorists other observers are skeptical even models with sophisticated algorithms could pick terrorists out from large data bases the proverb ial problem of finding n eedle in haystack darpas description suggests that the tia system will be developed using variety of data mining techniques coupled with models developed by anal ysts although there does not appear to be any simple definition da ta mining has been defined as exploiting variety of tools to extract predic tive information from large data bases39 several major technical problems are inherent in data mining and model development that would need to be solv ed to develop an effective tia system including identifying and getting access to appropriate data bases cleaning up dirty or inaccurate data in data bases integrating disparate data bases developing models or algorithms to identify likely terrorists misidentifying suspects because of large numbers of false leads and dealing with timing and cost dilemmas data base problems getting access cleaning up and integrating large data bases may pose significant challeng in developing tia system while darpa is currently looking at links be tween military intelligence data and other sources at its army testing site there could be complications in linking to other data bases and ensuring that only permissible data is included40 in addition any data base includes significant number of errors problem routinely discussed by data mining experts and it is not clear that there are adequate methods for catching errors linking large and disparate data ba ses is not only challenging task in itself but could compound the number of errors searching large data bases with large numbers of errors could both reduce the likelihood that terrorists would be iden tified and magnify the possibility that individuals who are not terrorists would be tagged erroneous da ta may be included either inadvertently by those entering the data or intentionally by identity threat where individuals deliberately impersonate others worrisome problems to technical and privacy experts alike the quality of the data could be diluted further if disparate data bases are linked developing ways to identify terrorists darpa plans to use both quantitative and qualitative data mining techniques to develop tools to identify terrorists data mining techniques are currently widely used for commercial purposes ranging from targeted marketing to detecting

statisticians develop test and retest algorithms or quantitative relationships in order to hone formulas and improve their accuracy in detecting patterns in the case of credit card fraud for example statistical algorithms or pattern identifying techniques can be refined with followup checks of billing records according to darpas descripti ons tia components would develop technologies using both statisticallybased algorithms to detect patterns in multiple data sources from wide range of sources financial telephoni c foreign messages intelligence traffic and models of terrorist behavior based on analysis of historical experiences and scenarios developed by analysts darpa anticipates that by speculating analysts will develop scenarios of particular terrorist attacks and then back into the types of activities that woul d be necessary to carry out those attacks some observers have suggested that it could be difficult to anticipate terrorist acts and our success in anticipating previous terrorist attacks has been limited with the enormous increases in the speed of proce ssing information and the proliferation of data mining techniques darpa sees ne w opportunities for exploiting variety of information sources using quantitative techniques like data mining technology experts and others however have questioned whether the problem of detecting potential terrorists is susceptible to the data mining techniques routinely done by commercial companies in light of the difficulty in predicting terrorist behavior the problem is made all the more difficult by the likelihood that the number of qaeda members in the us is small widelyquoted fbi estimate of 5000 was later dismissed as too high sm all number compared to the large number of transactions that are analyzed in commercial data mining applications41 in response darpa suggests that its research would not simply search data bases for potential terrorists but instead would develop templa tes based on studies of past attacks and captured terrorists doc uments that would be used to focus searches of databases more narrowly in addition the process would be iterative in other words analysts would use variet of techniques seque ntially to identify potential terrorists42 the problem of false leads key element in assessing the viability of the tia system is whether the technolog ies developed will be sufficiently accurate to limit the number of potential suspects and minimize the number of false leads so as to avoid misidentifying individuals as suspects43 if the number of potential suspects or false leads proves to be large the timeliness of warnings as well as the cost of conducting followup checks could also make tia system problematic some observers are also concerned that if dod or intelligence agencies identified significant numbers of false leads the pressures of time and urgency could lead to violations of the rights of individualshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31786crs15 44

contends that concer ns about false leads calle d false alarms or false positives by statisticians are exaggerated in credit card fraud for example false alarm or false positive would mistakenly identify transaction as fra udulent to avoid false alarms darpa argues that tia system would use multiple means to identify suspects ranging from models developed by red teams envisioning terrorist scenarios to patterns detected by linking intelligence data with commercially developed data minin g techniques using such tiered approach darpa contends that suspects would only be tagged after multiple checks some observers have questioned whet her these techniques could successfully cull the number of suspects but assuming that darpas approach could reduce the number capturing certain

2002 the researchers found that by combining several statistical tools they could catch about 50 of the actual fraudulent trans actions with false alarm rate of about 20 in other words while 50000 of the fraudulent cases were identified 50 of 100000 another 80000 cases were mistake nly tagged as fraudulent 20 of 400000 legitimate transactions at the same time investigators therefore would need to investigate 130000 cases to catch 50000 wr ongdoers or about 26 cases for every 1 wrongdoer in the case of credit card fra ud algorithms have been extensively refined using large amounts of real data and followup checks on leads are routine as anyone who has received phone call after making an unusually large charge knows even in the case of credit card fraud however the incidence of wrongdoers is likely to be below 20 the actual fraud ra is closelyguarded industry secret when the incidence of fraud is lower the chances of identifying wrongdoers decreases45 press reports last summer cited an fbi estimate of 5000 qaeda operatives in the us but that estimate was later dismissed by the government and experts suggested that hundreds rather th an thousands was the more likely number46 in light of the relatively small number of terrorists the likelihood of catching them even with targeted data base s could be far lower the chance as well as the cost to individuals of misidentifying susp ects could also be far greater an illustrative case using statistical algorithms to identify terrorists that would increase the chances that tia system would work could be based on the following assumptions the database woul d be limited to 1000000 transactions because darpa had successfully culled the number of suspects and there are 5000 terrorists in the data base an incidence rate of 12 the number of terrorists to be identif ied would then be 5000 12 of 1000000 at the same time assume optimistically that combination of data mining and modeling tools could identify 30 or 1500 of the 5000 terrorists but that the false alarm rate was 30 because the difficulty of identifying terrorists is greater than detecting credit card fraud in this case i nvestigators would need to check total of 300000 cases to catch the 1500 terrorists 30 of 5000 terrorists 30 of 995000 other suspects for every rrorist identified some 200 other suspects would have to be investigated some computer experts
