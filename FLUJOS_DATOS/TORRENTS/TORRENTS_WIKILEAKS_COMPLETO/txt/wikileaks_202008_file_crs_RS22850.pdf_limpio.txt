package which was signed into law as pl 110185 the most impor tant part of the proposal was the individual income tax rebate which accounted for around 117 billion of the packagess estimated cost in fy2008fy2009 the proposal also included two provisions for businesses that allowed speedup in depreciation which is expected to cost 51 billion in the first two fiscal years because these business provisions shifted deductions into the present from the future they eventually result in revenue gains and much smaller overall cost in the 10year budget horizon these costs are shown in table 1 g11g151g141g146g159g146g141g158g138g149g561g22g138g161g561g20g142g139g138g157g142g156g561 the centerpiece of the stimulus package is the tax rebate for individuals unlike the 2001 rebate the rebates have elements of refundability families with tax liability may also be eligible for rebate table 2 lists the specifics of the provision the rebate is technically credit for 2008 but payments would be mailed in 2008 based on 2007 returns if taxpayers qualify for higher credit based on their 2008 circumstances they could claim the excess on their 2008 returns essentially the rebate allows the larger

five elements of the rebate proposals that are outlined in table 2 the first is the basic nature of the rebate which is 10 of income up to maximum with minimum payment the second element is the refundability feature which extends benefits to lower income households without tax liability the third element is the treatment of highincome taxpayers whose payments are phased out the fourth element is the child rebate which in all plans is set at 300 per qualifying child and allowed if basic or refundable rebate is received the fifth element limits the scope of the rebates by denying them to illegal immigrants through requiring the taxpayer identification number to be social security number compared to the experience with rebate in 2001 the proposed rebates are more favorable to lower income individuals because of their ref undability provisions while the administration originally proposed package with refundabi lity the house allowed minimum payment for lowincome earners with at least 3000 of income the senate extended the rebate to lower income retirees social security railroad retirement and veterans disability and this extension was adopted both changes expanded the number of taxpayers affected without any refundability provisions 37 of 151 million returns or 56 mill ion would have been excluded because of low incomes or lack of tax liability adding lowinco earners as in the house bill excluded only 30 million because of low incomes that is made an additional 26 million eligible adding retirees meant only 10 million were excluded thus the refundability feature added 46 million taxpayers 26 million due to the earnings rule and 20 million due to the retirees rule the stimulus also excludes about 9 million because of high incomes 1 the original house bill was more progressive ie relatively more favorable to lower income households than nonrefundable rebate the final law is more progressive than the house bill 1 for more detailed analysis of the refundability provisions see crs report rl34341 tax rebate refundability effects and issues by jane g gravelle httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22850g22g138g161g561g18g155g152

in increasing spending there is some evidence that the 2001 rebate was spent2 in general economic analysis suggests that benefits that go more heavily to lowincome individuals are likely to be more effective at stimulating the economy in the short term per dollar of payment than those with smaller benefits because lower income households are more likely to spend the rebate and spending is necessary to produce stimulus the extension of rebates to those with social security payments could be quite complex administratively since it would require filing and processing up to an additional 18 million tax returns 3 the irs has announced simplified tax return filing for these households using the 1040a tax form

allowing 50 of investment with life of less than 20 years which applies mostly to equipment to be deducted when purchased the second addressed provision that allowed small businesses to deduct all equipment investment when purchased by increasing the ceiling on eligible equipment and phasing out the benefit more slowly these provisions are shown in table 3 t able 3 business t ax pr visions

depreciation provisions are the most costly of the business provisions amounting to an estimated 439 billion in fy2008 and 56 billion in fy2009 as with all of the provisions which largely involve timing revenue is gained in future years as regular depreciation deductions fall over 10 years the cost is 74 billion as shown in table 1 the small business expensing provision costs an estimated 09 billion in fy2008 and 06 billion in fy2009 with the 10year cost 01 billion because these benefits arise from timing neither the initial cost nor the 10year cost provide good reflection of the value to the firm for the benefit of bonus depreciation to the firm the discounted values using an 8 nominal interest rate would be about 18 billion based on empirical evidence it is unlikely that these provisions would provide significant short term stimulus investment incentives are attractive if they work because increasing investment 2 see crs report rs22790 tax cuts for shortrun economic

formation as do provisions stimulating consumption nevertheless most evidence does not suggest these provisions work very well to induce shortterm spending4 this lack of effectiveness may occur because of planning lags or because stimulus is generally provided during economic slowdowns when excess capacity may already exist of business tax provisions investment subsidies are more effective than rate cuts at providing shortterm stimulus but there is little evidence to support much stimulus effect temporary bonus depreciation is likely to be most effective in stimulating investment more effective than much costlier permanent investment incentive because it encourages the speedup of investment although there is some dispute most evidence on bonus depreciation enacted in 2002 nevertheless suggests that it had little effect in stimulating investment and that even if the effects were pronounced the benefit was too small to have an appreciable effect on the economy based on theoretical considerations the likelihood of the expensing provision having much of an incentive effect is even smaller firms may for example benefit from the small business expensing but it actually discourages investment in the expanded phase out range g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 jane g gravelle senior specialist in
