european software strategy report of an industry expert group mike sharpe 9th february 2009 mikemsconsultingcouk ii towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group 1 introduction software is everywhere today it is in the personal computers we use to write emails or make calculations it is in the mobile phones we use to call friends and business partners it is in the games consoles that our children play at home software is in the cars we drive in the ehealth applications used by our doctors and in the sophisticated systems professionals use to track criminals manage our transport networks and keep the lights on but because software is ubiquitous its significance to europe is not always easy to identify or appreciate yet the instrumental role of software in the digital economy should not be overlooked with market revenues of over 200 billion in europe and growth rates of between 6 and 8 software is the largest and the fastestgrowing segment of the information and communication technologies ict market furthermore software is embedded within the majority of products we use today and key enabler for innovation growth and employment in almost all sectors of the economy software has become the nerve centre of all modern economies in her speech at the truffle 100 event on 19 november 2007 commissioner viviane reding both recognised the importance of the software industry and indicated her willingness to discuss how to leverage its contribution to the lisbon strategy the thrust of her analysis was that europe is punching below its weight in software despite excellent skills and research european companies rarely become global leaders europe is major producer of inhouse and embedded software but remains large net importer of packaged software things are changing however with the shift towards new paradigms such as software as service saas and the future internet where europe could still take the lead she invited the industry to come forward with concrete ideas to help put together european software strategy to realise this potential this document represents the european software industrys response to that call it presents the collective views of leading industry experts software vendors smes business associations and analysts who have engaged in process of open discussion and exchange at the invitation of the european commission1 this group has collaborated in reviewing the status of the industry identifying the main issues facing it and formulating strategy for addressing them the group as whole met on two occasions during the period january april 2009 while individuals also participated in series of working groups physically and online group members are listed in annex 1 our main conclusion is that europe still has all to play for in the software market the innovation necessary to create economic growth drive societal change and address environmental challenges relies on ict at the heart of which is software the sector is undergoing massive change with developments such as saas and serviceoriented architectures soa revolutionising the way software is produced applied and consumed at the same time new paradigms are emerging around the future internet where software will be an essential pillar this is new world with new rules and europe must compete software should be key part of an information society strategy for europe posti2010 1 specifically these discussions have been led by dg information society media unit d3 software and services infrastructures and architectures and have also involved other commission services 1 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group why do we need european software strategy europe has made much progress in ict over the last decade and software has benefited from this in the internet and telecommunications fields deregulation and vigorous policy making have boosted the ict sector including software the ict task force was one of several initiatives taken under the european unions industrial policy which aims to help create more favourable environment for business in the eu and was designed to complement the commissions main ictrelated initiative i2010 the european software industry participated in this effort2 the eus most impressive effort in the field of software is the priority given to embedded software that has led to heavy investment in the industryled artemis initiative3 however this covers only discrete but very important subsector of the software industry see below europes packaged software sector also faces very specific challenges such as need for rare mix of skills atypical innovation and sales cycles and software piracy meanwhile it is clear that the future paradigms will be very different from the present with profound impacts on all of europes software industry this report highlights the issues and demonstrates why the eus demand side approach has to be complemented by softwarespecific supply side strategy to date an absence of policy in this area has made it difficult for the commission and policymakers to act yet industry needs clear policy framework within which to plan and operate the time has come to reboot the european software industry possibly list specific objectives around issues such as maximising the impact of software as an enabler of competitiveness in postindustrial society and economy try to redress the balance in importexport of software and related services mitigating europes dependence on noneuropean providers and technologies what is software the creation of software encompasses many different activities which together form the software value chain the main aspects include architecture consulting analysis concepts developing code ie programming testing implementation marketing and distribution maintenance eg software update management helpdesk and training education the software sector actually comprises several different types of companies independent software vendors isvs also referred to as packaged software companies these are producers and vendors of commercially available packaged software they offer packaged software through sale lease or rental or as service revenue typically includes fees for initial and continued righttouse software licenses 2 for ict task force see httpeceuropaeuenterpriseictpolicytaskforcereportsicttf_reportpdf 3 artemis is joint technology initiative launched by the eu to support research in embedded software systems and services see httpwwwartemis jueu 2 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group it services companies these are companies for whom major part of their business consists in developing custom software applications that are turnkey solutions for specific client this is very different business to packaged software although many small companies in europe sell both embedded systems software embedded software is computer software or firmware which plays an integral role in the electronics it is supplied with it is written for machines that are not first and foremost computers manufacturers in wide range of sectors include embedded software in their products key users include electronic components mechatronics consumer electronics automobile aerospace defence health network telecom equipment embedded software is very different to packaged and custom software specifically it has user interface with which to interact embedded software already accounts for significant part of development and production costs in these industries and will drive all major product innovations in the years ahead today european manufacturers have strong position in the field of embedded systems and software and major european initiatives such as artemis have been launched to support these activities for these reasons embedded software should not be priority under european software strategy and is not discussed further in this report our focus is on packaged software and related services and the role of software in the evolution of networks especially the future internet 2 software and services in europe sector overview 21 the european software market the european software industry is significant contributor to the european economy and key driver of innovation and change spending on software and related services is worth around 258 billion to the european economy or around 26 of gdp4 the software industry creates tax revenues is major source of highvalue jobs and has downstream multiplier effects throughout the economy the observation that much of europes poor growth performance compared to the us is due to lack of investment in ict has been widely made in summary ict accounted for as much as 04 percentage points of the 052 point difference between gdp per head growth rates in the us and the euro zone big three germany france italy in 1995 20025 the european ict rd expenditure per inhabitant is only about one third of the amount spent by the us or japan6 and the total and per capita ict rd investments are significantly larger in the us and in japan than in europe europe is unlikely to close this gap unless significant progress is made in areas such as skills innovation and competition 4 idc economic impact study 2007the economic impact of

software strategy report of an industry expert group it is not our purpose here to give detailed statistical picture of the european software market such analyses are readily available elsewhere few selective figures serve to illustrate the position however software is growing sector the software market is growing more rapidly than the ict sector as whole according to one analyst ref 4 between 2006 and 2011 in the eu software will grow at compound rate of 69 per annum versus 60 for the ict sector overall growth is particularly strong in central and eastern europe which has some of the fastest ict growth worldwide cagr of 205 between 2002 and 2006 and 141 predicted for 20062011 software creates value the annual revenue per employee in the software industry is over 100000 per employee which is among the highest rates in the whole economy7 software contributes to greater productivity use of software is one of the key drivers of productivity growth in almost all european economic sectors packaged software and related integration and consulting activities are key source for productivity improvements in service industries such as retailing transport and logistics and professional services embedded software defines the attributes and functionalities of products and services in sectors such as automotive aerospace medical equipment automation telecoms and consumer electronics software is major focus for research and innovation total investment in software rd from 2002 to 2015 for key sectors is forecast to grow by 128 to 133 billion which would almost double the growth rate for these sectors total rd 74 european packaged software companies in the truffle 100 have collective workforce of 175000 of which 38000 are employed in research and development software is source of highvalue jobs the benefits of software are felt most dramatically in terms of employment in 2007 the eu software industry employed 43 million people 55 of all ict jobs employment is forecast to grow at 50 per annum for the eu as whole and around 14 pa in central and eastern europe ntas quote 205000 only for employment in packaged software but this seems to weaken the case while official statistics and market studies focus primarily on proprietary software where data are easier to obtain open source software oss8 is now key feature of the european software

elsewhere europe is therefore net importer of packaged software although there are differences between countries overall reliable data is lacking pie chart to be added based on eito 2007 figures according to oecd figures in 2002 59 of the software produced in europe was developed internally by user organisations 24 was spent on packaged software and 16 on outside subcontractors10 22 the european software industry within packaged and custom software three major subsegments can be identified system infrastructure software proprietary as well as open operating system and system level software used across all types of hardware from mainframe to pc tools collaboration and content tools database engines business intelligence infrastructure development tools and integration platforms application software office automation business applications and other applications business applications are processoriented applications such as financials human resources management hrm customer relationship management crm supply chain management scm as well as industryspecific solutions such as billing telecom utilities core banking systems etc other application markets include graphical software embedded systems and other technical software games and leisure software is an important category of software application but is generally excluded from industry definitions because these are seen as pure b2c products and artistic creations rather than as packaged software which is mainly b2b europes software industry is fragmented and faces fierce competition out of the 100 largest

packaged software companies14 most of these had less than 15 employees and 1 million in revenues companies generally rely heavily on local ie nationalregional markets us companies are at an advantage here due to large home market and common language consolidation is moving up gear but the european industry is still highly fragmented in western europe the top 10 players account for 46 of the software market15 the top four consisting of the four biggest global players reach 37 the share of the top 10 has risen in recent years as consolidation has accelerated at the top of the market several top european software vendors have been acquired mostly by us companies finally apart from industrylevel aggregations we note that the quality of statistical information on the european software market and sector is poor and needs to be improved if available could add data on company formations entrepreneurial activity rd investment 3 business and technology trends 31 the changing software landscape the software market is facing period of unprecedented change new technologies and business models with mass appeal are being introduced to the market almost on daily basis software has reached critical mass and has become ubiquitous in many aspects of 21st century life as result the driving force of consumer demand will continue to push this sector to reach new horizons for some time to come new technologies also bring with them new ways of doing business which can occasionally make existing regulation or incentives obsolete key business and technological trends affecting the software market include proliferation of softwarebased devices and infrastructures the number and variety of computing communication and purposebuilt devices is growing and systems are becoming more complex users are looking for integrated solutions that include offline software services mobile devices or large servers with emphasis on sharing and reuse this creates opportunities to create new services that connect the various pieces of the ict infrastructure be it in 14 idc figures quoted by ntas 15 eito figures quoted by ntas 6 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group manufacturing process or consumer offering each combination creates unique offerings for the user rising market expectations as devices become ubiquitous and diverse perceptions are changing of what software should look like and how it should be applied there is growing awareness amongst users of what software is capable of and of how it needs to be aligned to business objectives at the same time new business models are having profound effect on the economics of software and service development the net result is that customers expect software to be high quality easy to use and affordable and at least part of the service to be free of charge increasing commoditisation of software software is increasingly independent of the hardware platform and can be composed as needed this together with rising market expectations has reinforced the trend towards specialisation amongst software producers it providers users with greater value for money and has enabled more competitors to enter the market software as source of systemic innovation software innovation is now systemically linked to innovation in other sectors the use of software in these other sectors is key to their competitiveness and major enabler of the postindustrial society and economy on the other hand innovators in software technologies are mainly driven by opportunities or needs in application domains innovation and application are thus two interdependent components in system which depend and feed on each other conventional linear models of innovation based on oneway flow of rd results towards new products processes and services are longer effective blurring of sector boundaries the boundaries of the software industry are increasingly difficult to discern on the one hand technology enables users to create their own content and increasingly services too and share it with others web 20 this opens up host of new opportunities and issues such as content ownership and rights and quality of usergenerated information traditional vendors also face competition from another direction companies from outside the sector eg banks that have developed their own software solutions and are seeking to capitalise on their investment 32 an industrial revolution in software these market and technological trends effectively amount to revolution for the european software industry wave of consolidation is sweeping the industry as companies seek to safeguard their position within maturing market new business models are emerging as companies try to gain competitive advantage and seek out new niches and innovations such as virtualisation and softwareoriented architectures soa enable software to be increasingly sold as service consolidation creates new opportunities as noted above the european software industry is highly fragmented and relies heavily on local markets while there has been some consolidation it has been slower than in other sectors the main driver here is the speed to scale acquiring another software producer can also be the best 7 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group way for company to expand beyond national borders to enlarge its customer base and to implement diversification strategies the degree of consolidation depends very much on the maturity of given market segment every year new technologies and innovative software are produced by young companies that are quickly able to become leaders in these new markets once the market has developed consolidation takes hold and very often they are acquired by one of the top software vendors usually from outside europe but in this fast evolving environment the top players of today will not necessarily be the top players of tomorrow europe therefore still has the opportunity to establish top positions the challenge essentially is how to improve interoperability for software users while guaranteeing more open market for software suppliers business modelseco systems sme policy standards and interoperability intellectual property protection and fiscal incentives for research are all important issues here which are addressed in detail in the following sections eulevel initiatives such as the european research area era the european technology platforms etps and the joint technology initiatives jtis are helping to integrate european efforts and reduce fragmentation at least within the research domain these could be means to encourage smes to work with regional centres and networks in addition the transition to the future internet is an opportunity to reinforce europewide approach see section 9 this might be better in the smes section business models are converging traditionally developers of packaged software create value in one of two ways licensing software the software company develops software program and sells copies of the program via its sales force distribution partners systems integrators stores andor the internet this business model leads software companies to grow as fast as possible speed to scale to be able to recover their initial fixed costs eg rd create facto standards and then increase profits by benefiting from economies of scale with both leadership position and with limited software development and reproduction costs subcontracting outsourcing specialised company develops or tests software programme or part of it as subcontractor by outsourcing aspects of the development process the software vendor tries to reduce its timetomarket andor be more cost efficient or more innovative over recent years other models have emerged primarily open source software oss the software company develops programmes and makes the source code public other companies or individuals can improve the software or adapt it to their needs companies are allowed to add value for their clients by offering implementation and maintenance services open source businesses thus generate revenue from services such as systems integration support tutorials and documentation generally through subscription models oss can also be sold as service by application service providers asps or as component of packaged software by isvs 8 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group software as service saas software company develops and owns software that is then delivered and managed remotely by itself or by an asp see further discussion below new business models based on open source saas and advertising based web applications are all in evidence indeed the traditional distinction between closedcommercialproprietary models and openfreenon commercial models longer applies models are converging as companies become increasingly active outside of their traditional parameters socalled commercial software providers are developing and offering open source programs and components while companies typically considered open source are offering commercial software for sale further the two are actively working together to produce software for example red hat the bestknown open source producer also ships some commercial software products that run on top of its open source platform ibm offers integrated open source and commercial solutions and even microsoft typically viewed as the archetypal commercial software vendor actually produces products along spectrum of software models software is becoming service softwareasaservice saas refers to model where functionality is delivered over the network and users pay for what they consume rather than per copy or by license the saas market is still embryonic according to idc global saas spending in 2007 amounted to 57m of which the european market accounts for around 10 but explosive growth is forecasted over 50 per year and it is expected to become mainstream within few years this is more than just an incremental development saas represents new paradigm for software provision it offers the potential for users to be able to build and evolve their systems more flexibly and for new suppliers to readily join pool of service suppliers and compete on an equal footing with installed suppliers such trend would require major change from european companies offering packaged software shifting to pure saas business model implies complete change to revenue recognition and strong investment in new skills to move from productoriented to serviceoriented company for instance they would increasingly need to recraft their sales proposition and retool their sales approaches to deal with the increasing number of technical queries software the driver of the future internet all of these trends are important in their own right but they come together in very significant way shaping the future of the internet software will drive the next generation of the internet as it grows to occupy an evermore central position in our society and economy the internet is now an essential economic and social infrastructure that supports not just consumers and domestic users but also businesses this business aspect is becoming ever more important influencing the way companies and the public sector operate in the future the future internet is huge opportunity for europe but also huge threat to major parts of european industry this in itself justifies key role for the future internet in european policy we return to this issue in section 9 9 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group 4 open source software over recent years open source software oss has become an established feature of the software landscape having shaken off its garagehobbyist origins oss is now credible alternative to proprietary offerings and in some areas is the only alternative to dominant commercial products lack of market confidence remains however due to concerns such as availability of support skill levels understanding of licence terms and liability oss tends to push the integration function into the hands of users as opposed to vendors as is the case for commercial products users are then exposed to issues problems and extra support and integration costs which can be offputting open source can be seen in number of different ways some see it as business model that reinvents the whole value chain others view it merely as software model an alternative way of writing and distributing code the overall trend is towards mixed models where companies offer both proprietary and offerings to meet customers needs oss is often quoted as european success story the facts do not entirely bear this out however while european experts and contributors are prominent and highly regarded in the community worldwide many of the technologies developed in europe are exploited by us companies according to one estimate 90 of the business derived from oss is generated by noneuropean players16 in addition most oss consortia the nonprofit organisations managing oss development and marketing are based in the united states and funded by us it companies europe must address this imbalance we need to exploit oss better and make sure the benefits stay in europe with european developers users and entrepreneurs open source can stimulate innovation and open up new generation of software products but the market still lacks thorough understanding of business models and how they can develop along planned roadmap without action there is very real prospect that the next generation of software will be developed and supplied from elsewhere there are specific issues around public procurement european legislation requires that public procurement be founded on principles of technology neutrality but oss solutions are not always given level playing field some argue that the application of rand17 terms for intellectual property discriminates against oss how can europe help here while it would not be appropriate to favour one part of the software ecosystem over another there does appear to be some scope for policy action aspects such as simplifying licensing developing skill sets and ensuring european research leads to results are all areas where policy action is justified to enable europe to nurture the potential of open source recommendations either specific recommendations around the above issues eg promoting in public procurement and promoting role of service companies or say the issues will be addressed within the sections on public procurement ipr entrepreneurship skills etc 16 ms comment nessi figures full reference needed is this consistent with comptias claim an estimated 12 billion has been invested by european firms in open source software development 17 rand reasonable and nondiscriminatory 10 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group 5 standards and interoperability standardisation plays crucial role in the development of the software industry as it is key element for innovation and interoperability standards can help to ensure that an ict product or service is fit for purpose and that competing products and services can communicate with one another and share information as result standards can increase users efficiency reduce transaction and implementation costs and promote competition in new fields such as the future internet standards could be pivotal in giving europe better competitive edge due to the rapid evolution of the industry many standardisation developments have been undertaken by industry consortia outside of the official standardisation bodies18 formal standards processes tend to be too slow for fastpaced market such as software industrybased consortia and other forums are seen as being able to respond more quickly to market requirements and so have been much more widely used in developing software specifications in some cases this has led to dominant proprietary platform becoming the facto standard while both formal and informal processes coexist this fragmentation has led to need for an in depth reflection on the coherence and efficiency of the entire standardisation landscape calls by customers for greater interoperability among software and other ict products and services have also raised the question of whether standards could be better used in this sector although standards can help facilitate interoperability19 they are panacea standards change over time as do the products in which they are used the evolution cycles of the standard and the products that implement it are rarely in synch leading to different generations of the standard being enacted which brings its own interoperability challenges these choices may have been made by engineers for the best of reasons to improve the welfare of consumers the aim should be to foster interoperability that is practical and meets market needs we must guard against laws that define interoperability too strictly and so drive flexibility out of this constantly changing process openness is key issue here in core areas of software and service interoperability the openness of standards determines whether technology development becomes lockedin by single proprietary technology or can be pursued openly only open standards20 permit all potential vendors to enter market develop innovative competitive interoperable products and offer choice to european consumers thus open standards should be at the core of strategy that seeks to promote an innovative and competitive european software sector for the software industry standards have to respect three major principles their initiation and drafting have to be marketled their acceptance and usage have to be voluntary and flexible and the development process should be open and transparent allowing for implementation in range of 18 the main european and international bodies in software are the european committee for standardisation cen and the international standardisation organisation iso examples of industry consortia and forums include the motion picture experts group mpeg the institute of electrical and electronic engineers ieee and the worldwide web consortium w3c 19 interoperability has number of dimensions here it can be applied internally among the softwarebased systems within an organisation between the systems of different organisations such as within supply chains and for interconnecting future systems with existing systems futureproofing 20 an open standard is standard that is publicly available and has various rights to use associated with it and various properties of how it was designed it is not the same as open source open standards can result from either or proprietary routes 11 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group competitive products to ensure consumer choice these factors are especially important for smes both as developers of technologies but also as users moreover given the international character of the industry it is important for europe to focus its efforts on benefiting and influencing the development of international standards rather than on promoting european standards once they have been adopted this should also apply to the reference of standards in public procurement the european commission has comprehensive and mature policy framework on ict standardisation this includes technical activities led by the ict standardisation steering committee policy work on ict standardisation led by dg enterprise21 and proposals for european interoperability framework eif for online government services this work has led to broad conclusion that the european standardisation system needs improvements rather than fundamental reform any additional measures in this area arising from the europe software strategy should reinforce these efforts in conclusion it is clear that standards are essential in achieving interoperability which is vital for the success of the european software industry in world markets on the other hand standards on their own will not drive innovation and in our view are of secondary importance to issues such as entrepreneurial capacity and skills recommendations along the lines of measures to facilitate pooling of resources in standardisation efforts such as through consortia noting the good progress achieved in standardisation on eskills which could serve as model other points from above 6 small and medium sized enterprises small and mediumsized enterprises are considered the backbone of the european economy providing jobs for millions of european citizens and the basis for economic innovation as set out in section 2 they also form the backbone of the european software industry situation that is closely related to industry and market fragmentation one consequence is that they are often dependent on large software companies headquartered outside europe not only does europe lag the us in terms of commitment to it innovation but india and china are rapidly catching up22 to compete in this global marketplace europes software smes must focus on quality innovation and competitiveness 21 for example eu study on the specific policy needs for ict standardization july 2007 and the way forward document prepared in view to the open meeting of february 2008 22 venture capital innovation and it driving forward the knowledge based economy library house june 2007 12 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group european software smes have been successful in creating ideas and developing products but they have been rather less successful in creating businesses to take those products to market the main problem is lack of management and marketing skills resulting in underperformance at the crucial commercialisation phases product marketing packaging customer support services etc excellent rd is substitute for excellent development strategy marketing and channel policy indeed each stage of software companys growth is critical from seed to early stage domestic development and international expansion public policy should target and encourage companies that invest in the complete innovation chain idea concept development and localisation validation pilot gotomarket consistent of course with international trade rules europe should encourage investment in innovative companies with special attention to high growth companies the socalled gazelles this will help accelerate the adoption of software specific measures by member states this in turn raises the need for single definition of innovative enterprise that would qualify for this sort of support such companies should be innovation centric as opposed to rd centric under existing definitions and should also include medium size enterprises studies eg ebusiness watch have shown that policies for ict are vertical sector oriented whereas support actions tend to be localhorizontal sector generic23 hence there is scope to improve innovation policy for the sector the eu has many experiences in associations networks and clusters of ict and software smes but still relatively few companies are involved further efforts should be made to improve coordination and exchange of experience recommendations possible measures as in the original paper plus realign eu ri policy towards innovation set ambitious objectives and guidelines to boost innovation and growth in software smes define key performance indicators benchmark successful policies and monitor progress introduce single definition of innovative company that would qualify for this type of help create european software expertise network esen based on existing trade associations clusters and expertise centres this should be light virtual organisation which would enable packaged software companies to share expertise and improve skills in key areas notably management and market it will also contribute to further enhance innovation and quality of madeineurope software help with management skills for software smes 7 the innovation environment 71 intellectual property protection intellectual property rights ipr are an essential feature of the software industry enabling software vendors to invest in innovation and attract venture capital protection of ip encourages investment 23 reference to be added 13 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group offering the potential for return on that investment it also facilitates trading in innovations so that innovations can be composed and can evolve further over time over the last decade the significance of ip has become even more apparent as technological developments have made piracy and patent infringements easier at the same time softwarebased systems have become part of the critical infrastructure of companies governmental institutions and society at large in this new environment companies need to be able to choose from portfolio of ipr to ensure their rights as creators are protected from illegal and illegitimate copying the most appropriate means of protection will vary depending on the type of software the investment made in developing it its usage and the business model adopted the main options are patents used to protect the technical solution implemented in the software program if it is novel and inventive24 copyright covers the program as form of expression25 trade secrets used to protect the valuable and confidential information contained in program trademarks used to protect product and service brands copyright and trade secrets have been the traditional forms of ip protection for software commercial software companies typically distribute their works in object code form and rely on copyright to prevent unauthorised copying and distribution contrary to perceptions in some quarters even open source developers rely on copyright to ensure that their innovations are freely distributed and not expropriated and made subject to more restrictive terms by their competitors is the software sector different to other technology industries in its ipr requirements we believe it is for number of reasons firstly the number of software patents has grown significantly over recent years partly due to defensive strategies by some players this has led to situations such as patent holes or patent trolls where patentee does not declare patent until technology is widespread and patent thicketsfences unused patents being used to block innovation many of these patents are of questionable quality secondly patenting has implications in terms of standards and interoperability patenting in some areas of the software market is particularly powerful eg apis26 thirdly uniquely27 within the patenting field software is an intangible the end result is not hardware or device or drug but computer code the sectors ip provisions will become 24 in europe patents are not generally available for software known in legal jargon as software as such but inventions with technical effect that are implemented by software sometimes called computer implemented inventions or ciis are patentable in the same way as other inventions national patent offices and the european patent office have granted patents on ciis since 1973 computer implemented inventions which only solve business problem using computer rather than technical problem are considered unpatentable as lacking an inventive step although they are allowed in the united states controversial proposals to widen cii provisions in europe to include business methods were rejected by the european parliament in 2006 check date 25 specifically copyright protects against unauthorised copying of source code object code sometimes called machine or compiled code the underlying design materials and other expression of software 26 application programming interface enabling interfaces that support the building of software applications 27 ms comment is it unique 14 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group increasingly important in future as the boundaries between hardware and software are blurred in software companies need to share knowledge to innovate leading to high degree of collaboration and pooling of resources innovation is generally incremental rather than through big breakthroughs but involves rapid cycles patenting on the other hand is slow and the period of the grant is much longer than the period of exploitation the current ipr system is out of tune with this fastmoving collaborative incremental innovation model the position regarding ipr in standards is also problematic some argue that ip provisions provide an incentive for rights owners to contribute their ipbased technology for use in standards by assuring that their innovations are protected and can be licensed on reasonable terms others believe that frand provisions are discriminatory especially against smes they wish to ensure that as far as possible standards are royaltyfree we propose middle way royalty terms should be discussed at the standardisation stage so all are clear how much compliance would cost standards bodies should not be obliged to follow but should know it is permissible finally we note that number of other factors influence the efficiency and effectiveness of ip protection for software litigation procedures for solving infringement must be fair and be seen to be fair enforcement of iprs in overseas markets must be efficient and workable and patent assessment and search procedures should be speeded up regarding the latter point we note as welcome development the use of open exchanges to share information between patent offices and interested communities28 accessible robust and effective ip protection remains essential to the software industry the issues here have been well rehearsed elsewhere and we do not wish to reopen old debates nevertheless the problems are real and urgent and we look forward to meaningful and concrete progress on these issues within existing forums in particular it is necessary to reduce complexity of the system and improve its flexibility and responsiveness the software industry has specific unique requirements in relation to ipr and it is essential that any new horizontal measures cater for the industrys special situation software is the foundation of innovation and adding value in the 21st century it cannot easily be accommodated within system created for the industrial age paradigm shift is needed recommendations to other bodies issues raised include simplification of the legal environment education on ip principles rd for protection platforms simplification and harmonisation of the european patent system 28 reference or url needed 15 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group 72 public procurement today it is widely acknowledged that ict and in particular modern software solutions are essential to enhance the cost efficiency as well as the quality of public services in turn public sector investments in technology will reduce administrative burden for businesses and citizens and will significantly contribute to european growth and competitiveness public administrations in the eu have yet to fully exploit the potential of ict however member states investment in egovernment is not sufficient and crossborder public services are still the exception consequently truly internal market for egovernment applications does not exist despite various eu initiatives such as the i2010 egovernment action plan and ministerial declarations on egovernment the public sector is by far the largest procurer of software and therefore public procurement policies can exert huge leverage in the european software market the large majority of public procurement contracts which are of interest for ict smes fall under national procurement legislation this has enormous macro economic implications and strongly impacts the ict industry and wider business stakeholders public procurement presents particular barriers for smes who are often not able to accommodate the high costs and slow processes involved in public tenders as noted above public procurement should be as open as possible and technology neutral in practice the public procurement policies set by governments often express preference for one software model over another these decisions may impact the choices of other organisations that work with the government sector inhibiting the ability of software companies to compete on level playing field provided that software is creative competitively priced and licensed on valid model it should be considered equally irrespective of its development methodology interoperability is key factor in gauging technology neutrality this may be achieved at the technical and semantic levels through commercial arrangements andor through implementation of open standards where they exist the guiding principles should be to promote competition vendor choice and adaptability to evolution in technologies and user needs functionality security reliability and price are also important factors consumers should be allowed to select which model works best for them similarly in deployment policies should be agnostic between selfhosted hosted software and services or pure saas models consumers should be free to choose how they wish to consume software in order to increase the size of the market the prospects of public procurement being used to create lead markets in which public agencies become early adopters of new technology has been discussed for some years in 2006 working group of the national ist research directors forum drafted procedures that would comply with state aid rules of the world trade organisation recommendations re promoting best practices use the open method of coordination to bring together national pp initiatives re lead markets focus would be on pan european evaluation of new technologies and accelerating the innovation process possibly using the cip as vehicle measures for smes 16 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group 73 financing software innovation few people perceive the software industry as capital intensive yet access to capital is one of the major critical success factors when it comes to speed of delivery factors such as packaging and go tomarket require much investment even if the early stage is the most critical capital is even more needed during the development stage for international expansion and acquisitions the european industry faces number of barriers here firstly venture capital markets in europe are less mature than in the us given that venture capital is needed to start businesses the european software industry is held back by lack of development finance ms comment strong statement which needs to be backed up by data secondly the software industry suffers from lack of appreciation by investors of intangible assets and misperceptions due to its resemblance to valueadd services industries thirdly europes riskaverse environment is not conducive to serial entrepreneurs in contrast to the dynamic investment environment of the united states these shortcomings could become even more challenging in the future while european software companies have traditionally been technology centric solution providers the global trend now is towards services many of them have already added the saas delivery model to their offering but heavy investment will be required to compete with more business and processoriented global players as the market takes off against the background of the current credit crunch these investment demands will not be easy to meet and could soon escalate into crisis joint initiatives between government and private financial institutions appear to be the most efficient way to leverage public financing examples are found throughout the member states while at european level industryled joint technology initiatives jtis pool public and private at least 50 investment in areas where existing funding mechanisms cannot deliver the scale and speed needed benchmarking of these initiatives both within europe and outside can provide successful case studies and help to spread best practice we believe there are also opportunities within european rd schemes packaged software companies experience the same problem of accessing rd funding schemes as smes in general they also face specific difficulties primarily that the innovation cycle in software does not match the pace of traditional european rd projects packaged software companies generally operate in the innovation part of the spectrum rather than in research very often they already have the technology in place and need to focus their efforts on pilots demonstrators and gotomarket bottomup projects that do not correspond to strategic research agendas should be given chance as they meet consumer demand and can generate rapid growth and jobs recommendations along the lines of benchmark and promote the best examples of national publicprivate funding schemes specific or adapted to the software sector so as to boost publicprivate funding in strategic innovation 17 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group set up european software investment fund within the high growth and innovative smes facility of the competitiveness and innovation framework programme cip run by the european investment fund this should focus on those areas where there is market failure eg investments below 250k and should be implemented through venture funds investing in innovative smes test on small scale an ambitious new programme called eurosoft which would fund projects focussing on innovation rather than just rd and award label to companies for meeting series of criteria such as usability of products in different european languages and cultures opportunities in the green it agenda software could play key role in making it greener and in sustainable development more generally 8 skills and lifelong learning for the european software industry to succeed in global markets it has to attract and retain the top talent the best software programmers managers and entrepreneurs yet like other areas of the ict industry software is affected by lack of experienced and well qualified people an it skills shortage is now serious and worsening problem throughout europe and at all levels of it use from consumers and business users through to software engineers the number of it graduates has dropped considerably over recent years especially in the software sector in the uk for example the number of software engineering students has dropped by 60 in the past five years29 similar falls have been seen in other european countries the roots of this problem lie in variety of factors social economic cultural and structural poorly defined career paths in ict the unattractive even nerdy image of software in the eyes of the public the lack of interest in science at school shown by young people in all western countries all of these contribute to the situation which we can justifiably call skills crisis now unfolding this shortage is compromising europes growth in several ways it prevents large sections of the population from participating in the eeconomy it makes the european workforce less attractive to companies seeking to base operations here it provides an incentive to outsource software development to other regions it inhibits the uptake of new technologies by european organisations and it is threatening to put brake on europes technological innovation and development we must do more to maintain and develop the european skillbase in software and its applications the need is not just for it specialists but for software engineers skilled in applying software and services technology in all other application domains and industrial sectors in such fastevolving sector replenishing the knowledge of existing practitioners is also key requirement moreover general public that is comfortable with it enthusiastic about using it at work and at home and excited about its future prospects will offer an environment in which the youth will be drawn to it as profession and so supply the future scientists and engineers 29 wwwvnunetcomvnunet news21597 2620bnriskukskills shortage 18 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group there is also strong business dimension here as noted in section 6 the key challenges for smes are human challenges european software smes often have strong technical competences but need help in developing management capacity and business skills technical skills are generally well covered by training providers but areas such as marketing finance and entrepreneurship need to be improved again the key difference in software is the fastmoving business environment in software as elsewhere skilled workers are becoming increasingly mobile changes in the work model with an increasing number of dispersed offices and project engagements rather than long term employment and the willingness of graduates to follow career abroad have had significant impact on employers this trend has been reflected in offshoring both within the european union and beyond currently cumbersome work and residency permit requirements impede and sometimes even prevent software vendors from employing third country nationals on paneuropean projects resulting in lower levels of service to customers and lost opportunities for the providers more must be done to improve the mobility of skilled workers at all levels as students researchers and employees and in this respect we welcome the commissions proposals for blue card scheme for highly qualified employment30 as noted above the skills crisis is not confined to software but is symptomatic of issues facing the digital economy more generally at generic level europe has well developed agenda on eskills led by the eskills industry leadership board ilb31 which we wholeheartedly support initiatives under the european software strategy should aim to extend and build on this by focusing on professional software skills within the industry itself and in other domains and application sectors also it is important to recognise that ictsmes are everywhere and embedded in their communities and hence can be key enabler to transmit eskills throughout the economy comment needed on the situation regarding ict certification which has not been discussed up to now issues around vendor versus general qualifications need for multistakeholder partnerships recommendations main issues discussed were proposal for european software expertise network not new institution but an open network bringing together established centres and companies barriers have been lack of resources and focus on national marketsactivities possible vehicles include networking trade associations research networks and kic within the eiit other recommendations specific measures needed to raise profile of the industry in general and in particular to attract more women into software careers eg european it night to demonstrate the profile of the sector 30 council directive on the conditions of entry and residence of thirdcountry nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment the directive would introduce blue card work permit system whereby after an initial two year period third country nationals would be allowed to work across the 27 member states and not be restricted to work opportunities in the member state that initially grants the work permit 31 see wwweskillsilborg 19 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group 9 the future internet what is the future internet over the last 30 years the internet has revolutionised our economy and society from an obscure academic network in the early 1980s the internet has grown into truly worldwide infrastructure for information and communication the internet is now central part of our lives in all sorts of ways and in many activities is displacing traditional channels as peoples first port of call it is the global network of the 21st century we are now witnessing the emergence of the next generation of the internet which will lead to wealth of new services and will have an even greater impact on society and the economy than the internet today in fact the future internet will be the essential part of europes future ict infrastructure which will be instrumental to fostering the internal market as well as to achieving the goals of the lisbon agenda and ensuring growth productivity and employment in europe the main building blocks of the future internet are the internet of services the internet of things and the underlying networked infrastructures the internet of services makes use of serviceoriented architecture soa flexible standardised architecture that allows various applications to be combined into interoperable services the internet of services also uses semantic technologies that understand the meaning of information and make content video audio print more accessible including by machine thus data from various sources and different formats can easily be combined and processed toward wealth of innovative webbased services in parallel things are becoming smarter the internet of things combines the power of ubiquitous networking connectivity with modern sensor technologies such as radio frequency identification rfid it merges the digital world with the physical world in the sense that information concerning the identity location and condition of physical objects can be made available through the internet anytime and anywhere moreover these objects possess the capability to communicate with each other and therefore can become active participants in global business processes impact on the european economy the impact of this future internet on the european economy and society will be significant the future internet will invigorate innovation resulting in tremendous productivity gains the benefits of these gains will be reflected most especially within the retail manufacturing logistics services and energy sectors according to industry experts rfid technologies could lead to efficiency enhancements of 40 in the luxury goods industry or even 100 in the food sector indeed rapid adoption of the internet of things and services throughout the european economy could be instrumental in closing the productivity gap with the united states and secure european competitiveness in the years to come the future internet will shape the future of the services sector the future internet will undoubtedly become one of the major growth engines in all knowledge based societies it will be business opportunity especially for startups and smes and could lead to the creation of high level jobs as services comprise twothirds of european gdp it is clear that 20 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group europe can only sustain economic growth and prosperity by developing strong webbased services industries moreover webbased services that will be developed in europe could easily be exported to global markets the future internet will bring disruptive technologies that will create tremendous business opportunities for the ict sector itself the world market for technologies products and applications related to the internet of things alone is estimated at 776 billion by 2012 with average annual growth rates of almost 50 as explained above saas also presents major growth market level playing field for future internet development unfortunately many of the new webbased industries and their underlying ict infrastructures are being developed outside of europe in the united states and asia all major service platforms for the future internet such as amazon google itunes and ebay are headquartered in the us furthermore the service platforms offered by these companies are proprietary with stack of infrastructural services running on computing cloud that is made available to the user as basis on which to build their higher level services this guarantees the user that the component services are able to interoperate and have been widely validated by many other users so issues such as trust and availability can be assumed to be managed well but the fact that usbased companies are setting the pace and the standards represents barrier for european companies trying to enter the market we need to do more to achieve level playing field for service development deployment and access32 one of the successes of the internet has been its openness at stake is not just the competitiveness of european suppliers but also maintaining openness for all users for discussion possible policy issues in fi noted in areas such as privacy eg harmonisation of legal framework for data stored in clouds use of spectrum governance security recommendations along the lines of industry welcomes and supports the ecs future internet initiative and in addition to the technical work encourages focus on business models and policy issues as part of this work industry encourages the formation of joint technology initiative as means of mobilising european efforts in this strategically important area 32 similar arguments are made by istag in its recent report on the webbased service industry full ref needed 21 towards european software strategy report of an industry expert group 22 10 the european software charter to be added in next draft wrap up of key arguments and summary of recommendations the conclusions should be presented around core challenges rather than the individual issues discussed above examples are found in most of the original submissions especially those of comptia and the ntas formulation of these challenges should be key focus for the working groups and the second experts meeting
