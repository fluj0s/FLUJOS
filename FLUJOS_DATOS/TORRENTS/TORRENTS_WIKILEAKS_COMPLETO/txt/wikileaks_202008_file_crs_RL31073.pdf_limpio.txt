assistance crafting an allotment formula has been one of the most controversial issues debated during past r eauthorizations of the clean wa ter act the dollars involved are significant and considerations of winner and loser states bear heavily on discussions of policy choices reflected in alternative formulations this is likely to be the case again when congress considers legislation to reauthorize the act because the current allocation formula is now more than 20 years old and because needs and population have changed the i ssue of how to allocate statebystate distribution of federal funds is likely to be an important topic in debate over water infrastructure legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31073contents introduction 1 f r m u l n d t h r c h n g s 2 grants allocation

provided to states through annua l appropriations according to the statutory formula to assist local governments in constructing wastewater treatment projects in compliance with federal sta ndards congress has appropr iated more than 75 billion since 1972 the formula originally applied to the acts program of grants for constructing such projects that grants program was replaced in the law in 1987 by new program of federal gran ts to capitalize state revolving loan funds srfs for similar activities the most recent formul change also enacted in 1987 continues to apply to federal capitalization grants for clean water srfs the current statebystate allotment is complex formulation consisting basically of two elements state population nd need the latter refers to states estimates

environmental protection agency epa in consultation with states has prepared 13 clean water needs surveys since then to provide information to policymakers on the nations total funding needs as well as needs for certain types of projects legi slation to fund water infrastructure projects is on the agenda of the 108th congress in part because the allocation formula is 16 years old and needs and population have changed the issue of statebystate distribution of funds is likely to be an impor tant topic when legislation is considered this report describes the formula and eligibility changes adopted by congress since 1972 revealing the interplay and d ecisionmaking by congress on factors to include in the formula two types of trends and institutional preferences can be discerned in these actions first there are differences over the use of need and population factors in the allocation formul itself during the 1970s the senate strongly favored reliance on use of populati on factors in the allocation formula while the house strongly advocated needsbase d approach during the 1980s the period when categorical eligibilities were restricted in order to emphasize water quality benefits the senate favored needs as the basis for grants distribution while the house position generally was to retain formulas used in prior years which incorporate both needs and population elemen ts when population has been used as factor differences have occurred over wh ether current or future year population estimate is appropriate but there is clear trend on this pointhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31073crs2 second there have been gradual increases in restrictions on types of wastewater treatment projects eligible for federal assistance beginning with limitation that denied use of federal f unds for stormwater sewer projects in 1977 debate over categorical eligibility has had two elements one has been fiscal desire to not fund types of projects with the highest costs and often the most unreliable cost estimates the other focus has been environmental desire to use federal resources to assist projects which benefit water quality protection most directly while some of these eligibility restrictions presente d congress with rather straightforward choices others have been more complex some continue to be debated such as whether certain types of projects should be fully eligible for federal aid or should be the responsibility of state and local governments formula and other changes the following table provides generaliz ed summary of the components of the allocation formula since 1972 details disc ussed below should be consulted because summary table such as this cannot fully reflect factors such as hold harmless or minimum share provisions frequently included in the statebystate distribution scheme to protect states with small llocations or to minimize potential disruptions when formula changes were adopted the term total needs refe rs to funding needs identified by states for all categories of projects and water quality activities eligible for assistance the term partial needs refers to subset of eligible project

pl 80845 started the trickle of federal aid to municipal wastewater treatment authorities that grew in subsequent years it authorized loans for treatment plant construction with each successive statute in the 1950s and 1960s federal assistance to municipal treatment agen cies increased grant program replaced the loan program the amount of authorized fundi ng went up the percentage of total costs covered by federal funds was raised and the types of project costs deemed granteligible were expanded 2 us congress senate committee on public works legislative history of the water pollution

fwpca pl 92500 the federal g overnment administered comparatively small program of aid for constructing municipal wast ewater treatment plants1 under the prior program assistance was allocated to states on the basis of population there was statutory formula nor was there systematic process for the federal government or states to timate and report on fundi ng needs for sewage treatment needs surveys had been devel oped by the conference of state sanitary engineers which reported generally but not rigorously on estimated construction costs of municipal waste treatment facilities planned by communities to meet water quality standards or other standards or enforcement requirements they lacked both consistent definitions of objectives and c onsistent reporting requirements moreover these surveys tended to be based on needs of larger municipalities so needs in small or rural communities were underrepresented the first funding needs survey undertak by the federal government was published in 1968 in response to genera l requirement in the 1966 clean water restoration act for an annua l report on the economics of clean water but it was considerably more modest effort than followed enactment of pl 92500 these early documents reported st atebystate and national total needs over given period of time but did not estimate or report n eeds for particular categories of waste treatment projects such as secondary tr eatment annual surveys were published each year through 1974 congress then changed the reporting requirement to biennial pl 92500 and the formula for 19731974 in pl 92500 congress provided the first statutory formula governing stateby state allocations in fiscal years 1973 and 1974 it was entir ely needsbased and contained categorical limitations despite weaknesses of the prior surveys they were the only tool available to guide congress when the decision was made in the 1972 legislation to move away from popula tionbased distribution of grants the 1972 survey estimated total needs from 1972 through 1976 to be 181 billion estimated construction costs for the first three years of that period were reported to be 146 billion the rationale for changing to needs basis for grants allocation despite limitations of available needs information was explained in the house public works committees report on the 1972 legislation2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31073crs4 2 continued sess p 780 3 us congress house committee on public works and transportation estimated construction cost of sewage treatment facilities planned for the period fiscal years 197274 committee print 9250 92nd cong 2nd sess table 3 p 3 this needs formula is sound basis for allotting funds since our experience to date clearly demonstrates that there is necessary correlation between the financial assistance needed for waste treatment works in given state and its population the committee is fully aware that at the present time there is satisfactory estimate of the total funds re quired by the states for construction of publicly owned treatment works howe ver the 1972 needs survey report does provide some measure of the relative needs of the various states and in the absence of any better measure has been incorporated in the bill for the determination of the state allotments for the fiscal years 1973 and 1974 the senate favored retainin g population as the basis for grants allocation and the available public records committee reports and senate debates give indication whether an alternative appro ach such as one based on needs was considered the 1972 fwpca incorporated statutory formula for distributing grants that was derived from the 1972 survey for th period 1972 through 1974 it covered reported needs in the 50 states and territori with little categorical restriction some limitation was included on use of federal f unds for new collector sewers which collect and carry wastewater from an i ndividual house or business to major or interceptor sewer that conveys the wastewat er to treatment f acility in addition eligibility for funds was limited to commun ities in existence when pl 92500 was enacted and could only be provided if the treatment plant had sufficient existing or planned capacity to treat sewage collected by such sewers section 205a of the fwpca crossrefere nced table in house public works and transportation committee print that id entified each states percentage share under the legislation3 the percentages would appl to total grant amounts made available through annual cong ressional appropriations the statute provided that this distribution formula would apply for two ears in section 516 of the act epa was directed to prepare new needs survey that would govern distribution in fy1975 the 1973 needs survey in response to the 1972 statutory directive epa undertook new method of preparing the needs survey and the 1973 needs survey was the first effort to report and evaluate needs for categories of waste treatment projects as well as state and national to tals this survey reported costs for the following categories i secondary treatment required by the 1972 act ii treatment more stringent than secondary required by water quality standards iii rehab ilitation of sewers to correct infiltration and inflowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31073crs5 4 water pollution

have continued to be based on th is same categorical arra ngement since the mid1970s however from an initial estimate of 63 billion in the 1973 survey the survey figure for wastewater treatme nt and collection system proj ects went to high of 342 billion in 1974 dropped to 96 billion in 1976 rose to 106 billion in 1978 120 billion in 1980 declined to 80 billion in 1990 and was assessed at 67 billion in 2000 the thirteenth and most recent survey since the 1992 survey states also have assessed needs for projects to address nonpoint pollution from sources such as agriculture silviculture and urban runoff in the 2000 survey needs for these types of projects were an additional 14 billion over time inconsiste ncies and variations in the surveys have been ascribed to several factors including the lack of precision with which needs for some project categor ies could be assesse d and the desire of state estimators to use the needs survey as way of keeping their share of the federal allotment as high as possible4 formula applicable in 1975 and 1976 in december 1973 congress enacted pl 93243 waste treatment fund allocations providing the section 205 allocation formula for fy1975 as enacted the formula was based on epa s november 1973 needs survey with formula that split the difference between total needs and partial needs the formula was onehalf of amounts reported in th 1973 needs survey for all categories secondary treatment more stringent than secondary sewer re habilitation to correct infiltration and inflow new collector sewers new interceptor sewers and cso correction but not separate stormwater sewers and one half of amounts just for categories including secondary treatment more stringent than secondary and new interceptor sewers the formula also included hold

6 in fy1976 construction grant funds provided to states resulted from the release of 9 billion originally authorized in pl 92500 which the administration had impounded the withheld sums amounted to 3 billion for each of the fiscal years 1973 1974 and 1975 continuedthe clean water act epas basis for this recommendation was the agencys assessment that the data for the other categories as reported by the states were limited and considerably less reliable than for these three categories in the 1973 survey epa reported that total needs nationwide were 601 billion 1973 dollars but that reported costs probably underestimated actual expenditures by half due to underrepor ting of cso needs and failure of states to report all needs in categories i and ii epa reported that estimates from only 15 states included cost surveys of all communities in the state data from the remaining 35 states represented all urban areas plus sample of commun ities of less than 10000 persons located outside urban areas the senate committee on public work s found that epas recommendations would lead to inequities affecting number of states in its version of legislation to establish an allocation formula for 1975 s 2812 it recommended distribution based 75 on partial needs and 25 on 1972 popula tion ie the ratio of states 1972 population compared to the population of all states the formula recommended by the house in its version of the legislation hr 11928 was the same as the version finally agreed to onehalf partial needs and onehalf total needs based on the 1973 ep needs survey the house committees actions were explained by the chairman of the public works and transportation committee5 the environmental protection agency propos ed two tables for allocation of the grant funds to the states one was base d on all of the needs of the statesthe other table was based on only part of the needsthe committee heard testimony from several states some of which would receive more funds under one table and some of which would receive more under the other table in addition some states found that under the needs concept they would receive less than they had previously when funds were allocated on the basis of population the primary reason for this appears to be that these states have not yet accurately identified their true needs for wastewater treatment facilities the committee is very much committed to the allocation of funds on the basis of need after much consideration we dete rmined that the most equitable solution would be to allocate the funds for the next 2 fiscal years on the basis of 50 percent of each of the two tables with state receiving less than its allocation of 1972 while some states may receive little less under the committees solution all states will benefit greatly in the long run although the housepassed bill called for twoyear allocation formula the enacted legislation applied only to fy1975 nevert heless the formula continued to apply through fy1976 because congress did not enact legislation to modify it until 19776httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31073crs7 6 continued in 1975 the supreme court affirmed lower cour t decision requiring the allotment of these funds train v city of new york 420 us 35 1975 and epa did so in february 1975 portion of the released funds representing the 3 billion from fy1973 and the 3 billion from fy1974 was allocated according to the allotment formula specified in pl 92500 that had applied to other funds previously distributed for those years the remaining 3 billion representing withheld fy1975 funds were allocated on the basis of the requirements of pl 93243 that is onehalf pa rtial needs onehalf total needs see us environmental protection agency amendmen t to final construction grant regulations 40

wa stewater needs survey the 1974 survey was transmitted to congress in february 19757 based on that survey epa recommended that future formulas focus on needs reported for categories i ii and ivb this recommendation came from the ag encys conclusion that data and cost estimates for other categories submitted in prior surveys had been of poor and inconsistent quality and had resulted in an inequitable allocation formula as expressed by epa admin istrator russell train8 there is serious doubt however that we will be able to provide accurate estimates of the total national needs or of needs for each state which would form an equitable basis for allocation of construction grant funds even categories i ii and ivb will be very difficult to refine for purposes of allocation because of the large variations in approach used by the states in estimating needs in these categories i believe that the fundamental differences in reported cost estimates for the construction of publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities highlighted by the last two surveys confirms our concerns about basing the allocation of federal funds on needs at least as they are currently reported

authorized funds for number of public works programs including wastewater treatment construc tion in order to counter unemployment conditions in certain regions of the count ry under the statutory language the wastewater treatment monies authorized in pl 94369 were to be allocated just to the 33 states and four territories that had received inequitable allocations as result of the prior two needs surveys9 the action in this legislation is significant because it restored population as factor in the c onstruction grants allocation formula the formula in pl 94369 was used to g overn the distribu tion of 480 million in fy1977 construction grants to the 33 states and 4 territories identified in that act10 the formula provided under pl 94369 was 50 partial needs as reported in the 1974 needs survey and 50 1990 projected population 1977 supplemental appropriations allocation the second portion of funds provided in fiscal year 1977 totaling 1 billion was governed by the formula that congress enacted in the fy1977 suppl emental appropriations act pl 9526 that legislation directed that construction grants allocation be according to the 2550 25 formula contained in the ta ble on page 16 of srept 953811 which was 25 total needs from the epa 1974 needs survey 50 partial needs from the 1974 survey and 25 1975 population the needs f actors used in this formula were the same as had been in use since fy1975 der ived from the 1974 needs survey but the population basis was different populati on in 1975 rather than projected 1990 population as under the formula that applied in

formula for fy1978 through fy1981 the final version of the formula was based 25 on total needs excluding costs of treating separate stormwater flows 50 on partial needs categories i ii and ivb and 25

255025 ratio in the fina l formula was the same as under the house bill the statebystate percentages were not identical so it appears that although conferees endorsed the basic house approach they

amendments made one categorical rest riction the legislation prohibited use of federal funds for projects to control pollutant discharges from separate storm sewer systems category vi in the epa needs survey the concerns here were fiscal the 1974 survey estimated category vi cost s at 235 billion or double all other costs in total and environmental the committee s ought to assure that federal funds would be used for facilities most critical to reduc ing pollutant discharges according to the report on the senate bill s 195213 the cost of controlling stormwater is subs tantial even after consideration of other options such as land use controls which may be more costeffective in some situations the federal share for stormwater projects is beyond the reach of the limitations of the federal budget it is furthermore cost for which water quality benefits have not been sufficiently evaluated particularly since stormwater discharges occur on an ep isodic basis during which water use

defined as facility requirements to meet the needs of the 1980 population rather than 20 years future gr owth as had been customary in previous needs surveys and allotment formulas the senate formula

these four categories were those wh ich were to be fully eligible for federal grants under categorical rest rictions included in the legislation see below because of delays in enacting reaut horization bill in the mid1980s congress extended this formula through 1986 as well categorical restrictions the 1981 legislation put in place several eligibility restrictions intended to restructure the grants program the senate committee explained the rationale in its report on the legislation14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31073crs11 the members of this committee the administration and the majority of the witnesses who came before the committee agree that the time has come to provide priority funding to those parts of the program which provide the greatest water quality benefit the committee bill refl ects this principle in the future only treatment facilities and the necessary interceptor sewers associated with those plants will be eligible for federal assistance two broad points were made by those w ho advocated restrictions 1 current budgetary problems made it necessary to focus limited federal resources on the highest priority environmental problems and 2 the administration believed that the federal governments funding responsibilities had largely been met and remaining water quality needs were local not national in scope based on these issues the reagan administration proposed number of program changes that congress endorsed with some modifications the administration recommended eliminating eligibility for new collector sewers sewer rehab ilitation infiltration and inflow correction and combined sewer overflow projects the 1981 amendments retained full eligibility for infiltration and inflow projects on the basis that they can reduce the need for additional sewage treatment plant capacity the amendments made the other categories generally ineligible for federal grants but allowed governors to use up to 20 of their annual allotment for such projects the general prohibition on use of federal funds for separate storm sewer projects established in the 1977 legislation was continued the administration recommended eliminating eligibility for reserve capacity to meet future population growth and recommended that the allotment formula be based only on backlog needs the legislation provided that after october 1 1984 grant would be made for reserve capacity in excess of that needed when an actual construction grant is awarded and in event in excess of needs existing on october 1 1990 the administration recommended eliminating hold harmless and minimum allocation provisions of the formula which were not related to water quality benefits congress did not adopt these recommendations finally although not part of the admin istrations recommendations the enacted legislation reduced the federal share for eligible projects from 75 to 55 to extend the availability of limited fede ral funds to more projects the current allotment

issues debated in this legislation concerned establishing stat revolving funds as the future funding mechanism thus replacing the previous construction grants program congress directed that the acts statutory allo tment formula would govern the new srf program title vi of the act and also would continue to govern construction grants allotment during the transition from the ol d funding program to the new one in 1991 nowhere in the legislative history of congress final action on the 1987 amendments is there clear statement about the weighting or factors that went into the final allocation formula it is even difficult to guess the conference report on the final legislation merely states the conference substitute adopts new formula for distributing construction grant funds and the state revolving loan fund capitalization grants among states for fi scal years 1987 through 1990 the allotment formula for fy1986 is the same as under current law15 it is clearer however where the two houses began during consideration of the legislation the house favored retaining the formula adopted in 1981 the senate proposed an entirely new formula the senate formula was ba sed on partial needs year 2000 needs not backlog needs as in the 1981 formula reported in the 1984 needs survey for the 4 categories which are fully eligible fo r federal funds i ii iiia made eligible in 1981 and ivb as reported by the committee the formula was essentially based on needs for these categories there was explicit population factor but an implicit population factor was incorporated in reverse because 21 small states were allotted slightly larger share in order to be able to maintain viable programs according to the committee report16 in addition the formula included an 80 hold harmless provision for 11 large states that were expected to experience greater changes in eligibility because of the revised fo rmula compared with the average17 the formula adopted by the senate af ter debate on s 1128 was different still it provided that the full extent of formula ch anges would apply to the last three of the five years covered by the r eauthorization and that m odified version would govern during the first two years the twoyear modified version gave the large states an 85 hold harmless by holding down the amount of increased share that the smaller states would receive so that large states would lose less and smaller states would gain less at least in the first two years accordingly the senate formula was essentially needsbased with an unquantifiable population factor apparently included as we ll it was merged inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31073crs13 18 in 1995 three districts of the usadminis tered united nations trust territory of the pacific islands which previously had been ligible for clean water act funds completed the process of becoming freely ssociated states with status as sovereign states by adopting compact of free association as of fy 1999 the trust territory which had been receiving 01 295 of available f unds is longer eligible for grants under the act epa made an administrative adjustment to allotm ent totals for all othe r recipients for fy2000 and onwards to reflect this changeways that are not clear from available public documents with the house formula which had total needs partial needs and 1980 population factors concluding thoughts since adoption of the allocation formula that has governed distribution of clean water act assistance since 198718 epa and the states have produced five updated needs surveys in 1988 1992 1996 2000 and 2004 in addition updated population information became available thr ough two subsequent decennial censuses in 1990 and 2000 although population chan ges have occurred during that time and needs for water quality projects also ve changed total needs increased by 86 between the 2000 and 2004 surveys none of this more recent information is reflected in the currently app licable distribution formula also since 1987 congress has on several occasions considered cwa reauthorization legislation that would ve modified that formula in the 104th congress the senate environment and public works committee approved bill s 2093 and in the 105th congress the house passed comprehensive reauthorization bill hr 961 in the 107th congress house and senate committees approved legislation to reauthorize water infrastructure financing programs in the act hr 3930 s 1961 these bills included revise d allocation formulas as well as other program changes neither received further action in the 108th congress legislation to extend cwa infrastructure financing was approved by house subcommittee hr 1560 in july 2003 it included changes to the allotment process it would have extended the current statutory formula for two years and thereafter portion of funds would be allocated by that formula and portion would be distributed based on each states proportional needs of total needs in october 2004 the senate environmen t and public works committee reported similar bill s 2550 srept 108386 like hr 1560 s 2550 w ould have modified the allotment formula moving towards target allotment based entirely on needs but with several complex factors intended to moderate the potential for substantial loss or gain of funds under the ta rget compared with the current statutory allotment formula for info rmation see crs report rl32503 water infrastructure financing legislation comparison of s 2550 and hr 1560 by claudia copeland and mary tiemann neither measure r eceived further action in part because

proposed allocation formula wa s different from that in the earlier bill as in the previous congress further action occurred on this bill in the 110th congress the house passed reauthorization bill hr 720 that was similar to the measure that the house transportation and infrastructure committees water resources and envir onment subcommittee pproved in the 108th congress hr 1560 including proposed ne w twopart allocation formula as in the earlier legislation in september 2008 th senate environmen t and public works committee reported cwa reauthorization b ill s 3500 with placeholder for new allocation formula but legislativ language there was further action on water infrastructure legislation in 1996 congress amended the safe dri nking water act and established drinking water state revolving loan fund program modeled after the clean water srf however in that act pl 104182 cong ress directed that drinking water srf capitalization grants be allotted among th states by epa based on the proportional share of each states needs identified in the most recent national drinking water needs survey not according to statutory allotment formula while the clean water and drinking wa ter srfs represent significant amounts of federal financial ssistance congress has provided othe r assistance as well in the form of grants earmarked in epa appropriations acts for specific communities both small and large in recent years cong ressional appropriators have dedicated an increasing portion of annual water infrast ructure assistance as earmarked special project grants which are not subject to any statutory or other allotment formula for example for fy2008 pl 110161 c ongress appropriated 689 million for clean water srf capitalization grants 829 million for drinking water srf capitalization grants and 177 million in earmarked grants for projects in 282 listed communities since the first of these earmarks in epa appropriations in fy1989 congress has provided 7 billion for special project grants crafting an allotment formula has been one of the most controversial issues debated during past r eauthorizations of the clean wa ter act the dollars involved are significant and considerations of winner and loser states bear heavily on discussions of policy choices reflected in alternative formulations this is likely to be the case again when congress reauthoriz the wastewater infrastructure funding portions of the act in part because the current allocation formula is now more than 20 years old the issue of how to allocate st atebystate distribu tion of federal funds is likely to be an important topic durin g debate on water infra structure financing legislation elements of funding nee d population and possibly other factors are likely to again be debated
