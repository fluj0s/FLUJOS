partnership and development branch of the division of operations of unodc ae200536501 executive summary in september 2005 oios conducted an audit of the p artnership and development branch pdb of the division for operations of the united nations ffice on drugs and crime unodc has accepted the recommendations made and is in the process of i mplementing them managerial functions pdbs managerial functions ie planning programm support monitoring and assessing performance were comprehensive and oios found adequ ate documentary evidence in submissions and performance reports to be assured that manageri functions were adequately documented and implemented an oios questionnaire sent to all of unodcs 21 fi eld offices received response rate of 80 per cent their responses were positive represent atives considered the functions of regional sections as essentialimportant for effective field operations and they viewed the support to programme matters and global initiatives as the reg ional sections biggest impact almost all were satisfied with the frequencysufficiency of communi cation and rated the relationships as goodexcellent eighty per cent valued the coordin ation and liaison function of the regional sections 20 per cent viewed the regional sections as knowledge and resource centre structure of regional sections and staffing the latin america and caribbean section lacs and the southeast asia and pacific section seaps are well structured and both of the regiona l sections were adequately staffed the europe and westcentral asia section ewcas and the afric and middle east section ames had less staff at the professional level than planned cons equently project coordinators and associate experts performed programme management officer pmo functions still the two p4 pmos had to carry substantial workload section chiefs did well in allocating tasks among t he staff even though their grades experiences and qualifications differed substantially with onl few staff having served in unodc field operations considering that 40 per cent of pmo s tasks are related to requests events or submissions which come up any time throughout the year the unpredictability of this workload further complicated task allocation functions of regional sections oios suggested that the strategic functions in the area of programme development partnership development and management support to field offices should be separated within pdb and with the current resources from the regional sections proj ect cycle management functions the former functions relate more closely to pdbs managerial f unctions and they require expertise normally performed by section chiefs or experienced pmos u nlike in project cycle management functions they do not lend themselves to quantifiable workloa d and performance indicators which are more difficult to formulate making allocation of respon sibilities and managing of time spent versus outputs difficult as well to address these concer ns would require pdb to change the current structure within the regional sections pdb considered the separation of functions as sugge sted however new developments occurred since the audit indeed senior management requested pdb to explore the possibility of decentralizing the re gional sections the latin america and the caribbean section has been selected to carry out th exercise on pilot basis decentralization would further reduce the already stretched resource s of pdb and thereby hamper reorganization of the branch as proposed by oios which suggested that the reorganization should be done without increasing resources therefore discussions with and decisions by senior management depend on the final decision on decentralization oios concurred with this approach responsibilities of regional sections the workload and responsibilities of regional secti ons and individual pmo were very similar as regards administrative support to field offices f or programme development the number of countries varied substantially between the regional sections and also for pmos the number of projects monitored was similar for th regional sections but differed substantially among pmos with an average of 14 pr ojects per pmo some had less than half the aforementioned number while others had more than 20 projects the average multiyear project budgets for pmos averaged 25 million with three s taff having responsibility for projects amounting to less than 10 million three staff above 40 mil lion and one pmo above 100 million there was need to examine the workload and if necessary r edistribute responsibilities more evenly among pmos pdb undertook to develop more indicators by june 20 06 however the potential redivision of responsibilities will also hinge upon available resources and related decisions on decentralization time spent versus actual delivery regional sections spent in general 45 per cent of total time on project cycle management and 22 per cent on programme development the remaining third is spent on five different areas management reporting ad hoc tasks financing and d onor relations administrative support and partnership development the main quantifiable outp uts in 2005 and until august 2005 for main activities were head2right project cycle management 150 project ideas documents were completed and 200 projects with multiyear budgets totaling 380 mill ion were monitored this is large area of responsibility with some pmos spending up to 60 pe r cent of their time head2right management reporting an impressive delivery of 400 briefs andor lett ers to management 40 normative reports to governing bodie s andor donors and regular management expenditure reports for 350 project segments head2right programme development 31 country profiles and strategic programme fram eworks head2right administrative support to field offices human reso urces management quantifiable output was identified but four per cent is reasona ble considering the total number of core staff and new appointments at the 21 field offices there was need to determine and monitor more quan tifiable indicators this was discussed during the presentation of ewcas on pdbs workflows and workload and some indicators had been identified pdb undertook to determine more indicators april 2006 table of contents chapter paragraph i ii iii

conducted an udit of unodcs partnership and development branch pdb the audit was conduc ted in accordance with the international standards for the professional practi ce of internal auditing 2 pdb is one of two branches of the division for perations it is structured in four regional sections each of which is responsible for several regional ro and country co offices as follows square4 africa the middle east section ames eastern africa ro nigeria co middle east and north africa ro southern africa ro and west and central africa ro square4 europe westcentral asia section ewcas afghanistan co central asia ro iran co pakistan co and russian federati on and belarus ro square4 latin america and the caribbean section lacs bolivia co brazil south cone ro caribbean co colombia co mexico central america ro and peru co square4 southeast asia the pacific section seaps east asia and the pacific rc lao pdr co myanmar co south asia ro and vie t nam co 3 the chief of pdb has the responsibility to super vise and coordinate the work of the branch and ensure effective cooperation and synergi with the human security branch and other headquarters units and reports directly to th director of the division for operations the field office representatives representatives report to the director for overall policy matters and to the chief of pdb for management and programme strategy for daytoday activities the representatives coordinate their wo rk and liaise with the chiefs of the regional sections 4 with the overall responsibility to manage unodc s technical cooperation programme in close cooperation with field offices and other headquarters units pdbs functions are clearly established and described in its terms of reference the unodc network of field offices is part of pdb and their f unctions are described in separate terms of reference for field offices functional areas f pdb are support to programme development programme implementation and monitorin g as well as headquarters liaison and policy guidance ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to square4 determine whether the functions performed by the ctions are in accordance with the terms of reference for pdb and as to whether an ade quate structure is in place to perform the functions taking into consideration th workload and staffing square4 evaluate the workflow processes mechanisms and pro cedures to determine whether adequate guidance is given and procedures are in pl ace to ensure the effective and efficient performance of functions square4 assess the performance of the sections and hence t he added value and availability of management information to measure performance and t he sections impact with relation to the field activities 2 iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on the managerial functions of pdb and the functions performed by the regional sections although not exclusively the audit looked into the processes linked to the functional areas of support to progra mme development programme implementation monitoring and headquarters liaison the managerial processes in place to guide unodcs project cycle management were also re viewed 7 the methodology comprised of time recording ex ercise discussions with and submissions from staff and the counting of actual utputsdeliverables ewcas with the assistance of the other regional sections prepared presentation of pdbs workflows that was presented to oios heads of the regional sectio ns and the chief of pdb on 21 september 2005 the presentation provided the foru m for discussion of internal processes workload and data available for the monitoring of ctivities within the regional sections furthermore oios sent questionnaire to all 21 fi eld offices and 80 per cent of the representatives responded oios analyzed the resul ts and included them in this report 8 oios interviewed staff in all regional sections to obtain an understanding of the functions and to identify similarities and differen ces in their roles and responsibilities extensive discussions were held with selected indiv iduals at all levels of responsibility including the chief of pdb staff were also given the opportunity to provide additional information that included information on their qua lifications field experiences functions and scope of work as well as general time spent on main activities 9 draft of the report was shared with the direct or of the division for operations on 4 january 2006 whose comments which were received i n january 2006 are reflected in italics in this final audit report unodc has accepted the recommendations made in the draft report and is in the process of implementing them iv audit findings and recommendations managerial functions of pdb 10 with an overall mission to ensure quality of s ervices and delivery of performance pdb grouped its managerial functions in four distin ctive areas of work ie planning programme support monitoring performance and asses sing performance these functions are interrelated to and applicable to both pdb and field offices the functions and underlying activities were comprehensive documente d and adequate guidance was provided in management instructions and other directives to implement them 11 pdb also developed numerous mechanisms and tool s for programming identification and formulation resource mobilizati on implementation and evaluation to assist field offices in performing their functions overall oios found adequate documentary evidence in submissions and performance reports and responses from staff to be assured that managerial functions were establish ed well documented and adequately implemented b regional sections 12 the regional sections managed unodcs technical cooperation programme and their functions 20 in total of which many had mult iple endproducts andor activities are divided into three areas i support to programme development ii programme implementation monitoring and iii headquarters l iaison and policy guidance 3 13 unodc operated in number of countries where t here are field offices and therefore regional sections had to implement some programmesprojects also the regional sections were the main consolidated datab ase of knowledge and centre for documentation from which most endusers internally and externally were served 14 unodcs work is expanding and covers as many as ten thematic areas therefore the capacity within the regional sections became in creasingly important according to the representatives the biggest impact of the regional sections was their support to programme matters and global initiatives 15 to assess the efficiency in which the regional sections carried out their responsibilities oios compared the estimated total time spent by staff with the outputs delivered products and services by regional secti ons to assess the quality of their work the satisfaction of endusers mainly field offices and unodcs programme and project committee was the main criteria accordingly our assessment comprised an analysis of the following square4 resources staffing within the regional sections and resourc available to them square4 responsibilities and workload volume indicators such as number of field office s projects products and services square4 efficiency time versus outputs square4 quality documentary evidence and enduser satisfaction c staff and functions staffing 16 the staffing table provided for 27 posts in pdb with the chief of pdb at d1 level 15 professional and 11 general service staff posts the planned staff component of regional section was reflected in the distribution structure dated 24 august 2005 and comprised of section chief p5 3 programme man agement officers pmos p2p3p 4 and 2 programmeteam assistants ptas g5g6 in addition and for the more complex regional sections the distribution struct ure reflected 1 to 2 project coordinators pc l2l3 for ewcas and ames ou r assessment of the complexity of regions corresponded with the difference in staff n umbers between the regional sections as per the distribution structure our ranking was from the most complex to the least ie ewcas ames seaps and lacs and the distribution s tructure provided for eleven nine seven and six staff respectively 17 however the actual staffing as shown in the f ollowing table was not in accordance with the distribution structure for ewcas and ame s table 1 actual staff as of august 2005 section section chiefs programme management officers project coordinators programme experts programmeteam assistants total ewcas 1

structured and both of the regional 4 sections were adequately staffed and as per the dis tribution structure 19 ewcas and ames were not at full strength apar t from the one pmo p3 for afghanistan that was large and complex operation with eighteen ongoing projects and total multiyear budgets totaling us 43 million t here was only one pmo p4 in ewcas recently appointed associate expert l2 and project coordinator l3 performed pmo functions 20 ames had two pmos p4 of whom one recently ppointed and on temporary assignment with the regional section project co ordinator l2 and junior professional officer performed pmo functions note d were the increased responsibilities for both the experienced p4 pmos in the aforement ioned regional sections 21 the grades experiences and qualifications of s taff differed substantially with only few staff having served in unodc field operations as much as 40 per cent of the 17 tasks of pmo related to requests events or submission s which occurred at any time and throughout the year as such the workload is uncer tain which further complicated task allocation irrespective of the aforementioned s ection chiefs did well in allocating tasks to their staff information received from the staff g ave clear indication that tasks and responsibilities were allocated taking into consid eration prior experiences competencies workload and individual performance appraisals functions 22 strategic functions in the area of programme velopment partnership and management support to field offices require numbe r of actions and decisions that are diverse in nature they are also more closely rela ted to the liaison work and managerial functions of pdb than the programmeproject impleme ntation and monitoring tasks of the regional sections they include the development of regional strategies overall financial and budgetary analysis reviewing field presence in member states and followup to partnerships training coordination monitoring of field office management in accordance with unodcmi8 followup on thematic evaluations and integration of best practices and the formulation of country profiles also these f unctions had to be performed by more experienced pmos and section chiefs under direct s upervision of and guidance from the chief of pdb it added substantially to the worklo ad of pmos within the regional sections because they still had to perform the project cycle management functions of the countries allocated to them within their regions furtherm ore it was difficult to find quantifiable indicators to determine the workload and assess per formance in these strategic functions 23 as an alternative oios suggested that pdb shou ld consider separating the programme development partnership and management s upport to field office functions from the regional sections programme implementatio n and monitoring functions still kept within pdb and without increasing resources pdb considered the separation of functions as suggested however new developments occurred s ince the audit indeed senior management requested pdb to explore the possibility of decentralizing the regional sections the latin america and the caribbean secti on has been selected to carry out the exercise on pilot basis 24 decentralization would further reduce the already s tretched resources of pdb and thereby hamper reorganization of the branch as pr oposed by oios which suggested that the reorganization should be done without increasin g resources therefore discussions with and decisions by senior management depend on t he final decision on decentralization oios concurs with this approach and the recommendat ion remains until informed of senior managements decision 5 recommendation head2right the unodc partnership in development branch should consider separating the functions within the functional area s of programme development partnership and management support to field offices from the regional sections because they require ex pertise and competence and include responsibilities that are mo re closely related to pdbs managerial functions rec 01 oios will close the recommendation upon receipt of copy of unodcs senior management final decision as unodc has indicated i n their abovementioned comments responses from staff 25 we analyzed information received from 23 staff in regional sections regarding their functions responsibilities and in general the pe rcentage of their time spent to carry out these functions their qualifications field experi ence field missions undertaken workplans and assessment of their performance in particular factors considered in analysing their functions were project formulation and monitoring support to field offices donor relations and reporting 26 the staff had clear understanding of their fu nctions and responsibilities which were in accordance with their workplans they ment ioned only few criticisms they felt that there were not enough field missions to monito r programmeproject implementation and that their reporting responsibilities involved too much editing and streamlining of reports received from the field offices also there was t oo little time available to keep abreast of country developments because of too much paper work in the project appraisal and approval cycle they also suggested delegation of approva l for smaller projects 27 most of the abovementioned concerns were raise d during the representatives seminar that was held in july 2005 and the actions to be taken were recorded they included the streamlining of the approval process f project documents and review of the programme and project committee mechanism they so discussed training in project formulation to enhance the quality of field office submissions and further defining the workflow to ensure that regional sections are invol ved at an earlier stage during the formulation of programmes and projects these actio ns should address most of the concerns and therefore oios is not making any recommendatio n d responsibilities and workload 28 oios considered the number of countries in each of the geographical areas as workload indicator in the functional area of projec t development the number of projects and their multiyear budgets were workload indicato rs in project implementation and project cycle managementwhile the number of regionalcount ry offices and the number of regular staff in the field funded under the suppor t and regular budget number of core staff were indicators for support to field office s some indicators were reflected in more than one functional area however for simplicity they were considered in the functional area where they added most to the workload 6 table 2 distribution of responsibilities and work load section number of countries number of projects regionalcountry offices number of core staff multi year budget in million ewcas 30 50 6 33 1086 ames 66 52 5 32 361 seaps 37 47 5 34 685 lacs 36 57 6 37 1671 29 the number of countries varied substantially be tween the regional sections and except for seaps each pmo had three countries so among the pmos although there were reasons such as the complexity of operations for example afghanistan required full time pmo and the knowledge and experience of staff there was correlation between the number of countries and the responsibilities of p mo in programme development 30 the total number of projects per regional secti on was similar however there were differences in the number of projects monitored by individual pmos except for ames in ames three pmos managed 15 to 16 projects each the average number of projects per pmo within regional sections was 14 four pmos mon itored half or less than half the aforementioned average while three pmos monitored more than 20 projects each 31 the total multiyear project budgets also diffe red substantially for the regional sections and individual pmos for pmos the averag was 25 million with three pmos below 10 million and three pmos above 40 million one pmo monitored 29 projects with multiyear project budgets of more than 100 m illion 32 the total number of regionalcountry offices an d the total number of regular and support budget staff were similar for each of the r egional sections there were material differences between the individual pmos responsibi lities 33 our conclusion was that although the regional sections were aware of the differences in the project portfolios of pmos proj ect cycle management functions had to be performed within given geographical area of re sponsibility regional structure which made certain differences in the number of countries and related project portfolios unavoidable however the actual outputs of pmos i ndicated that some pmos had to carry substantial workload and it seemed worthwhile to review it in the project cycle management functions the number of outputs per pmo related closely to the number of projects monitored by pmo making the number of p rojects good workload indicator in this functional area 34 the total number of regionalcountry offices an d the total number of core staff were good indicators for measuring responsibilities in support to field officesthere were discrepancies in responsibilities 35 although the number of countries was probably not the best workload indicator in programme development it could be used with other qualitative indicators such as the complexity of the operations to determine the work load within this functional area more than 20 per cent of pmos total time even more f or the experienced ones is spent on programme development and therefore there was ne ed to have some quantifiable indicators recommendation head2right the unodc partnership in development branch should decide on 7 which quantifiable indicators to use in determining the workload of pmos at least for the project cycle management fun ctions and if necessary redivide responsibilities if it would p rovide for more even distribution rec 02 pdb accepted the recommendation and undertook to velop the indicators by june 2006 however the potential redivision of responsibilit ies will also hinge upon available resources and related decisions on decentralization oios will record the recommendation as implemented when the indicators are determined actual delivery and time spent 36 it was understandably difficult to match functi ons and responsibilities with actual outputs achieved and the time spent to produce the outputs because many functions are interrelated and it is difficult to quantify the ou tputs especially those relating to programme development partnership development and backstoppi ng activities 37 the regional sections recorded their time spent for one month one in early 2005 and the others in mid 2005 staff recorded their t ime spent on seventeen activities we then compared the total time spent by section on each of the activities and found the time distribution to be very similar to the average of t he regional sections 38 because we selected particular month there w as risk that the month of july may not be representative snap shot of time spent wit hin year therefore we asked the staff to provide breakdown of the normal time spent t hroughout the year in percentage terms for the main activities this exercise showed that the only material difference between the actual time recorded for the month of july and nor mal time spent was that of the time spent in july on programme budget management which normally would be spent on regular project monitoring activities that include the moni toring of budgets the analysis showed that two thirds of the total time is spent on proje ct management 45 and programme development 22 the remaining third is spent on five different areas management reporting partnerships administrative support to field offices financing and donor relations and adhoc activities the distribution of total time spent on these activities for all of the regional sections and the main quantifiable outputs delivered from january to august 2005 andor volume indicator for projects and budge ts that were managed were as follows outputs projects 150 project ideasdocuments monitoring of 200 projects 300 project progress reports programme development 31 country profilesstrategic programme frameworks mgt reporting expenditures reporting on 350 project segments 400 briefs 40 normative reports administrative support 21 field offices with 136 core staff 32 new appointments 8 39 although the percentages of total time spent on each of the functional areas represent the distribution of time spent by all staff across the sections our analysis of individual staff members indicated that the chart represents best th time spent by pmos section chiefs for example spent naturally more time on managemen t reporting partnerships and programme development more experienced pmos also spent more time on programme development programme development 40 with the total number of 31 country profiles an d strategic programme frameworks regional sections prepared seven to nine each the re are other outputs that also relate to programme development such as the submissions to m anagement on regional programmes and strategies especially management briefs and re gular submissions on programme statuses that although reported as project implementing pro ducts assist in programme development therefore the completed country profiles and stra tegic programme frameworks were not the only outputs to account for 20 per cent of the time spent but they are high level documents that require expertise and knowledge of t he operations pdb staff mostly the pmos and hsb experts provided their inputs at rat her late stage in the process and it had been reported that they seldom participate in the d rafting in 2005 however only one pmo was not involved in the completion of the documents which substantiated the involvement of the regional sections in their completion one pmo in ewcas completed as many as five country profiles programme implementation and project cycle manageme nt 41 programme implementation and project cycle mana gement accounted for 45 per cent of total time spent within the regional sectio ns some pmos reported that they spent in general more than 50 per cent of their time on this functional area the main products are the development of project ideas and documents and subsequent revisions that are submitted to the programme and projects committee ppc management of budget allocations monitoring of projects and review of p roject progress reports in 2005 regional sections submitted total of 150 project ideasdocuments including revisions to the ppc for approval representatives viewed the r egional sections reviews and inputs to their submissions as one of the main contributions to their operations the total number of documents submitted varied from 20 to 50 for the re gional sections and an average number of 5 per staff in seaps 8 in ames 11 in lacs and 13 in ewcas the distribution of workload was good in lacs and seaps but not in ewc as and ames in both the latter regional sections the p4 pmos completed substanti ally more than the average for their sections as much as double in the case of ames s for the quality of the submissions the criterion was that of approval by the ppc which fou nd the submissions to be timely and of good quality 42 regional sections monitored more than 200 proje cts in 2005 with total multiyear budgets of 380 million and 20042005 biennium budg ets totaling 140 million the allocation for 2005 was 60 million for three of the regional sections the total allocations monitored were similar ames 10 million seaps 12 million lacs 25 million whereas ewcas monitored as much as 26 million ne vertheless we found budgetary management and control adequate for all the regiona l sections with the profi system providing uptodate financial information for fina ncial monitoring and decisionmaking purposes the regular monitoring of financial and narrative project data by the regional sections became imperative to ensure that managemen t donors and member states have access to accurate and complete information 9 43 although the number of projects was similar for the regional sections the number of project progress reports one or two per project reviewed by the regional sections did not tieup with the number of projects that were mo nitored ewcas 50 projects 68 reports lacs 57 projects 53 reports ames 52 p rojects 92 reports and seaps 47 projects 99 reports ewcas and lacs did not rec eive all required reports although the reporting requirements were already reduced from qu arterly to semiannual and annual reporting the followup on outstanding reports sh ould be strengthened and monitoring system should be introduced to monitor the receipt and review thereof to ensure that these reports are received and reviewed in timely manne r ad hoc followup by the regional sections is time consuming and therefore the syste m should be centralised within pdb to allow for systematic followup and action if report s are not received andor reviewed in timely manner considering the large number of pro jects and corresponding reports regional sections need adequate time to properly re view the reports and to provide their feedback late submissions hamper the review proce ss because bottlenecks may occur representatives reported that the sections reviewed the reports that real value was added to the content and that consistency in presentation wa s achieved but half of the respondents replied that systematic feedback was not always rec eived 44 oios suggested that centralized monitoring s ystem should be introduced for project progress reports to monitor the timely rec eipt and review thereof the system should allow for systematic followup of their subm ission review feedback and replies the recommendation was accepted and had been implemente d the centralized monitoring system was developed in august 2005 and launched in the framework of the profi system training was provided to programme managers in dece mber 2005 follow up on submissions their reviews feedback and replies ar embedded in the application 45 technical monitoring was mainly limited to desk reviews with limited number of field visits undertaken by pmos the responses fro m staff indicated that most missions undertaken were for purposes other than regular mon itoring visits such as meeting andor events most representatives indicated that it was very important that pmos visit their operations on regular basis pdb recognized the need for more field missions bu t the number of field missions depends largely on the tra vel budget performance in relation to field offices 46 responses from field office representatives on the regional sections performance were positive except their responses on the distri bution of authority and responsibilities between headquarters and field offices and advice n how to implement initiatives in the field almost all representatives considered the r egional section functions as essential for effective field operations or at least important be cause it adds real value the responses also indicated communication was very frequent or suffic ient and that the relationships were goodexcellent 90 per cent of the respondents 47 with regard to backstopping field office activi ties 80 per cent of the responding representatives valued the coordination and liaison function of the regional sections the remaining 20 per cent of the respondents viewed the regional sections as knowledge and resource centre for specific issues at headquarters that the field itself cannot easily or logistically deal with they were satisfied that t heir requests were always or mostly handled in timely and competent manner and that the respo nses to their requests were very useful and tangible or at least acceptable 48 almost all of the representatives reported that the sections inform them of initiatives but half of them felt that headquarter s does not always give advice on how to follow up on or how to implement the initiatives in the field considering that half of the 10 representatives responded as such the division for operations should discuss the matter with the representatives this step should be adeq uate and therefore recommendation is made support to field offices human resource managemen t 49 regional offices had similar workloads in huma n resource management taken the number of core staff within the field offices as indicator ames 32 ewcas 33 seaps 34 and lacs 37 also and in 2005 the r egional offices assisted field offices in 32 new appointments this accounted for 4 per ce nt of total time spent which is reasonable management reporting donor relations and partnersh ips 50 oios found management reporting by the regional sections to be comprehensive and was impressed by the number of reports and brie fs that were delivered in 2005 and the limited time 14 per cent of total time generally spent to achieve these outputs there were periodic and regular management expenditure reporti ng in respect of more than 350 project segments some 400 briefs andor letters to managem ent and some 40 normative reports to governing bodies andor donors these outputs are interrelated with financing partnership development and donor relations and fully accounts for the time recorded as being spent performance in relation to planning 51 regional sections planned their work in documen ted workplans and reported their achievements in performance reports the expected results and performance indicators were documented but review of the workplans monitori ng tools and performance reports indicated that measurable outputs could have been b etter quantified standardized and monitored in general we found that the monitorin g and reporting tools narrative descriptions of achievements added to the already xtensive paper workload and were not tools that were automatically updated at the comple tion of quantifiable output good monitoring table was found for ppc submissions pdb should determine more measurable outputs and develop monitoring tools which should allow for an automatic update at the completion of tasks to monitor delivery number of these quantifiable outputs were already discussed during the presentation of ewcas on pdbs services its products and workflows 52 the monitoring of these indicators should howe ver not be timeconsuming and should add value in that they should be relevant to determine responsibilities and assess performance recommendation head2right the unodc partnership in development branch should determine which quantifiable outputsdeliverables should be m onitored for planning and performance purposes rec 03 the recommendation as above was accepted estimated target date for implementation is june 2006 however oios previous suggestion to velop tools that automatically monitor delivery did not seem realistic in
