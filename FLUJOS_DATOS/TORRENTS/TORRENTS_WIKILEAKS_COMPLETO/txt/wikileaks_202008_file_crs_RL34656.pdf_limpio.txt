accrued benefits if their defined benefit pension plan is terminated without adequate funding the pbgc receives appropriations from general revenue its operations are financed by in surance premiums set by congress and paid by sponsors of defined benef it plans investment income from the assets in its trust fund and recoveries from the companies form erly responsible for the trusteed plans the pbgc insures the pension benefits of 44 million workers and retirees in fy2007 the pbgc paid about 43 billion in benefits to almost 13 million workers whose pension plans had failed the pb gc currently has 141 billion deficit in assets necessary to satisfy all claims made throug h fy2007 although the pbgcs liabilities are not explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government congress could face political pre ssure to bail out the pbgc at taxpayer expense should the agency become financially insolvent as of september 30 2007 the value of th pbgcs total investments including cash and investment inco was approxima tely 626 billion premium income is required by law to be invested in debt obligations guaranteed by the us government the assets from terminated plans and their sponsors are accounted for in trust fund that was most recently va lued at 481 billion there are statutory limitations on how pbgc can invest the assets in its trust fund in february 2008 the pbgc announced th at it had adopted new investment policy aimed at generating higher investment returns the new policy allocates 45 of the assets to fixedincome investment s 45 to equity i nvestments and 10 to alternative investment classes including real estate and private equity the pbgcs previous investment policy adopted in 2004 set an equity inves tment target of 15 to 25 with the remaining assets allocated primarily to fixed income investments if the pbgcs higher expected investment returns are accompanied by reduced risk as the pbgc has asserted then us taxpayers as the ultimate guarantors of pbgc insurance will be better off however if the higher returns are accompanied by commensurately higher risk then taxpayers are neither better nor worse off because the pbgcs true fi nancial condition will not have changed taxpayers would be worse off under the ne w policy if higher investment returns forestall fundamental reform s in the pension insurance system such as adopting riskbased premiums that could result in improving the longterm financial condition of the agency taxpayers who would benefit from reduced exposure to the risk of having to bail out the pbgc if fundamental reforms in pbgc financing and governance were enacted will be worse off if the agency does not achieve the reduction in its deficit that it has predicted the new investment policy will attainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34656contents background on the pbgc 1 t h t w k i n d s f p n s i n p l n s1 t h p b g c s b n f i t g u r n t e2 t h s i n g l m p l r i n s u r n c p r g

corporation established under title iv of the employ ee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa pl 93406 the pbgc insures pr ivate pension beneficiaries against the complete loss of accrued benefits if their defined benefit pension plan is terminated without adequate funding the pbgc receives appropria tions from general revenue its operations are financed by in surance premiums set by congress and paid by sponsors of defined benef it plans investment income from the assets in its trust fund and recoveries from the companies form erly responsible for the trusteed plans the two kinds of pension plans there are two kinds of pension plans defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans participant in fined benefit plan receives fixed benefit at retirement prescribed by formula set fo rth in the plan usually based on pay years of service or both the employer makes c ontributions to the pl an based on actuarial calculations designed to ensure that the plan has sufficient funds to pay the future benefit prescribed by the formula unde r defined contributi on plan particular benefit is promised instead benefits ar based on the balance of an individual account maintained for the benefit of th employee the benefit received by participant at retirement is generally pendent on two factors total contributions made to the plan during the workers participation in the plan and the investment experience of the amounts c ontributed on the employees behalf under either type of pension plan employees may be permitted to make contributions the pbgc insures qualified defi ned benefit pensions provided by employers in the private sector plan is qualified if it meets th requirements of the internal revenue code and erisa and is thus eligible for favor able tax treatment defined contribution plans and nonqualified define d benefit plans are not insured by the pbgc in defined benefit plan the employer b ears the risk of investment losses the internal revenue code nd erisa contain minimum funding standards that require the employer to make contributions to defined benefit plan to fund promised benefits if for example the plan ex periences poor inves tment performance or actuarial miscalculations the employer will be required to make additional contributions to the plan the minimum funding rules provide for funding over period of time and do not require the plan to have sufficient assets to pay all the benefits earned under the plan at any particular time it is possible for defined benefit plan to terminate w ithout having sufficient assets to pay promised benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34656crs2 1 pbgc annual management report 2007 httpwwwpbgcgo vdocs2007amrpdf 2 pbgc annual management report 2007 3 in general changes in pension liabilities are inversely related to changes in interest ratesthe pbgc insures defined benefit plan benefits up to certain limits to protect plan participants in the event of such ter mination however the pbgc may not protect all benefits promised under plan consequently if defined benefit plan is terminated while it is not fully funded th participants might receive less from the pbgc than they were promised under the plan the pbgcs benefit guarantee the pbgc currently insures the pension benefits of 44 million workers and retirees participating in mo re than 30000 privatesector defined benefit pension plans in fy2007 the pbgc paid about 43 billion in benefits to almost 13 million individuals whose pension plans had failed1 the pbgc insures both singleemployer and multiemployer pension plans the pbgcs singleemployer program guarant ees payment of basic pension benefits when an underfunded plan terminates wh an underfunded pension plan sponsored by financially distressed company is terminated the pbgc takes over the plan assets and assumes respons ibility for paying retirement benefits to the plans participants subject to the statutory benefit limits the singleemployer insurance program in 2007 the pbgcs singleemployer program insured the pe nsions of 338 million workers and retirees in about 28900 plans the program is direc tly responsible for th benefits of about 12 million workers and retirees in almost 3800 trusteed pension plans the pbgc insurance program for singleemployer plans reported defi cit of 1311 billion in fy2007 based on assets of 6724 b illion and liabilities of 8035 billion2 the deficit for 2007 was 5 billion less than the 181 billion deficit reported one year earlier the pbgc reported that the decline in the deficit was due primarily to investment income of 47 billion and 28 billion actuarial credit as result of higher valuation interest factors3 through the end of fy2006 the pbgcs singleemployer program had incurred net claims of 290 billion see table 1 of this amount nine of the ten largest claims against the pbgc totaling 198 billion occurred between 2001 and 2005 the pbgcs net claims equal the portion of guaranteed benefit liabilities not covered by plan assets or recovered from the genera l assets of the employer these claims will eventually have to be cove red through premiums earning s on pbgc assets or other sources of revenue the multiemployer insurance program multiemployer plans are collectively bargained plans to which more than one company makes contributions the pbgcs multiemployer program provides financial assistance through loans to insolvent plans to enable them to pay benefits the pbgc does not become the trustee of insolvent multiemployer plans these loans which are typically not repaidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34656crs3 4 pbgc annual management report 2007 generally continue year after year until the plan longer needs assistance or has paid all promised benefits at the

milli on net deterioration from the end of the previous year4 the loss for the year was due larg ely to pbgcs booking of additional probable losses from expected future financial assistance to

general hearing of the senate commerce science and transportation committee the impact of federal pensions and bankruptcy policy on the financial health of the airline industry october 7 2004 pbgc benefit limits there is statutory ceiling on the benefits that are insured by the pbgc different benef it limit applies to each program for plans that terminate in 2008 the annual limit fo r the singleemployer program is 51750 for single life annuity payable at ag 65 the guarantee for the multiemployer program is much lower in 2008 for an individual with 30 years of service the annual guaranteed limit is 12870 the annua l benefit limits are indexed each year to the average annual increase in wages in jobs covered by social security because the benefit limit is higher than the pensions earned by most participants in insured plans most workers in singleemployer plans taken over by pbgc receive the full benefit earned at the time of termination however the lower guarantee limit for the multiemployer program has left most of the retirees in insolvent plans without their full benefits5 the pbgc currently has 141 billion defic it in assets necessary to satisfy all claims made through 2007 the govern ment accountability office gao has identified pbgcs singleemployer program as highrisk stating that the program remains exposed to the threat of termin ations of large underfunded plans in weak industries and of sponsors vol untarily terminating or freez ing their defined benefit plans6 in 2007 the pbgcs timated potential exposure to future claims was approximately 66 billion down from 73 billion in 20067 not all underfunded pension plans are likely to present claims to the pbgc the estimate of 66 billion represents underfunding of plan sponsors whose credit ratings are below investment grade or meet one or more financial distress criteria it is not an estimate of likely claims against the pbgc the pbgcs liabilities are not explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government8 however should the agency become financially insolvent the gao has noted that congress could f ace enormous pressure to bail out the pbgc at taxpayer

the priv ate sector the pbgc cannot set the premiums for the insurance it provides plan sponsors are required by law to purchase insurance from the pbgc and the insurance premiums are set by congress historically premiums have been the mo st reliable source of pbgc revenue the agency received 1557 billion in premium revenue in 200710 an employer that maintains singleemployer defined benefit pension plan must pay an annual premium for each participant in the plan the pbgcs singleemployer premium income was 148 billion in fy2007 initially set at 1 per participant by erisa in 1974 congress has raised the premium periodically since then the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 pl 100203 imposed an additional variable rate premium on unde rfunded plans the variable rate premiu m was initially set at 6 for each 1000 of the plans unfunded vest ed benefits up to maximum of 34 per participant the omnibus budget reconciliation ac t of 1990 pl 101508 increased the basic per capita premium to 19 and the va riable rate premium to 9 for each 1000 of the plans unfunded vested benefits up to maximum of 53 per participant beginning in 1991 the maximum variable ra premium was 72 pe r participant the retirement protection act of 1994 pl 103 465 left the per capita premium at 19 per participant however the cap on the variable rate premiu m was phased out over threeyear period beginning in 1994 the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 in creased the per capita premium from 19 to 30 for 2006 and i ndexed the premium to the annual rate of growth in the national average wa ge beginning in 2007 the 2008 premium rate for singleemployer plans is 33 per par ticipant the dra also created new premium of 1250 per par ticipant to be asse ssed on any underfunded singleemployer plan that undergoes distress termination or is involuntarily terminated by the pbgc to be paid annually for each of the three years following the date of termination or if later the employers exit from bankruptcy this premium is in addition to any other pbgc premiums that are due for the plan year as enacted by the dra the special premium would not have applied to plan s terminated after december 31 2010httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34656crs6 the pension protection act of 2006 ppa pl 109280 made the special termination premium permanen t for plans that undergo di stress termination or are involuntarily terminated by the pbgc the ppa also made the vari able rate premium of 9 per 1000 of underfunding mo re widely applicable pr ior to enactment of the ppa the variable rate pr emium was waived for an underfunded plan if it was not underfunded in any two consecutive years out of the previous three years under the ppa the variable premium is assessed on all underfunded plans regardless of the plans funding status in earlier years the premium for multiemployer plans wa s initially 050 per participant the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of 1980

although the pbgcs net position has improved 92 billion since 2004 it fell 310 billion from 2001 to 2004 many factors contributed to the large swing in pbgcs funded positi on chief among them the terminations in 2002 and 2005 of several large pe nsion plans in the steel and airline industries with high levels of underfunding fa lling interest rates used to discount future benefit payments significantly increased the va lue of pbgcs liabilities and poor stock market returns in 2001 and 2002 resulte d in negative investment income in part to address the pbgcs deteri orating funded status congress passed the pension protection act of 2006 the most comprehensive reform of the nations pension laws since the enactment of erisa in 1974 the ppa established new funding rules for defined benefit plans increased the flatrate premium paid by pension plan sponsors and required the variable premium to be assessed on all underfunded plans the ppa provided for exceptions to some of the new funding rules for plans sponsored by commercial airlines although the impact of these reforms is still unclear the congressional budget office cbo has stated that the ppa fa iled to address the underlying structural problems facing the pbgc because the increased premiums are not commensurate with the amount of unfunded pension claims from terminated plans that the pbgc is likely to assume in the future11 the future financial condition of the pbgc is highly uncertain because it depends greatly on how many private pens ion plans terminate and on the amount of underfundi ng in those plans both factors are difficult to for ecast over its history relatively few pension plans with very large unfunded liabilities have dominated the pbgcs claims and its future may likewise depend significantly on the fate of few large plans future terminations will be influenced by overa ll economic conditions the prosperity of particul ar industries competition from abroad and variety of factors that are specific to particular firms such as their competitiveness in their industries their agreements with labor gr oups and the credit ratings in addition the pbgcs losses with respect to future terminations will depend on how well companies fund their plans the pbgcs exposure to pension plan underfunding can shift dramatically from year to year in response to conditions in the stock market and changes in interest rates recent report by credit suisse equity resear ch estimated that the funded status of defined bene fit pension plans operate d by companies in the standard poors 500

of the pbgc 19902007 the pbgc has stated that the objective of the new investment policy is to prudently maximize investment returns in order to meet the corporations current and future obligations17 the pbgc has stated that it expects the policy to generate higher returns and to reduce risk by di versifying its asse t allocation including investment in alternative assets such as private equity18 forecasting model developed by pbgcs investment consu ltant rocaton investment advisors llc suggested that shifting the pbgcs allocation from fixed income to equities andor alternative asset classes would improve the pbgcs financial condition in the longrun according to the rocaton analysis the new asset mix chosen by pbgc gives the agency 57 likelihood of full f unding within ten years compared to 19 under the previous policy19 the study by rocaton estimated that compared to the previous policy the pbgcs expected f unded ratio would be higher and its worst case funded ratio would be lower

of assets in the lifecycle funds offered by many 401k plans the assets of younger plan participants who will not need access to their retirement funds for many years are invested primarily in equities under the continuedinvestment strategies other things being equal higher expect ed rates of return on investment are associated with higher levels of inves tment risk however the pbgc has asserted that even though its equity exposure is increasing it expects its new investment policy to reduce its overall risk through asset dive rsification under the new policy the pbgc would hold 45 of its assets in equities 45 in bonds and 10 in alternative investments the pbgcs previous investment portfolio was less diversified consisting ma inly of longterm investmentgrade bonds the pbgc also has stated that its longterm investment horizon allows it to benefit from what is sometime s called time dive rsification this is theory of investment that asserts that the risk associ ated with investing in stocks decreases over time20 in its analysis for the pbgc rocaton stated that investors with time horizons of 1020 years and greater seem wellpositioned to wait out market volatility and realize the significant longterm rewards of investing in riskier assets21 although there is general agreement among economists on the be nefits of asset diversification with respect to portfolio ri sk there is divergence of opinion as to whether or not investment risk associated with particular asset or class of assets declines as the period of time that the asset is held increases the changes in the pbgcs investment policy in 2004 and 2008 embody two very different approaches to investment ri sk that reflect this divergence of opinion these approaches can be referred to as total return strategy and an assetliability matching strategy the total return approach the new pbgc inve stment strategy with its emphasis on increasing the proporti on of assets invested in equ ities is based in part on the assumption that the higher expected rate of return on equities will result in the pbgcs assets growing faster than its liabilities this approach is used by majority of the pension plans that the pbgc insures see figure 5 asset allocation decisions are based upon what investors be lieve will deliver the highest possible return for given level of risk measured as the likely deviation of rates of return around the average common stocks equ ities have higher expected rate of return than bonds but they also are riskier in that the actual rates of return vary more around the average than the rates of return on bonds investors with long time horizons often invest greater percentage of assets in equities than investors with shorterterm time horizons they expect that the higher longrun expected rate of return on equities will offset the risk associated with the greater volatility of the rate of return on equities22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34656crs15 22 continued assumption that their long time horizon will give their investment portfolios time to recover from shortterm declines in the stock market as participants grow older and are nearer to retirement their assets are sl owly reallocated to heavier concentration in bonds which have lower expected rate of return than st ocks but also are less subject to large capital losses than stocks 23 pbgc annual management report

contrast the pbgc has other part onto which it can offload its unfunded liabilities except ultimately the taxp ayers the gao has noted that investments in riskier assets with higher expected rates of return may allow financially weak plan sponsors and their plan participants to benefit from the upside of large positive returns on pension plan assets without being truly exposed to the risk of losses the benefits of plan participants are guaranteed by pbgc and weak plan sponsors that enter bankruptcy can often have their plans taken over by pbgc24 the assetliability matching approach the assumption that the risk of holding stocks decreases as the period of time that they are held increases is disputed by some economists these economists assert that the risk associated with stocks actually rises with the length of time that they are held they note that if stocks were not risky in the long run then the financial services industry would be quite willing to provide maybe even for free longterm financial contracts that provide rock solid guaran tee that investors would not lose money if they held on to broadly diversified st ock portfolio for say 30 years yet such longterm put option contr acts do not even exist because financial market participants believe that the risk of ch contract is increasing with the time horizon not decreasing25 modern portfolio theory holds that th higher expected return on stocks is exactly the price of the risk associated with the investment and that the riskadjusted rates of return on stocks and bonds are qual despite the higher expected nominal rate of returns on stocks th present value of 1 invested in bonds at any given time is equal to the present value of 1 invested in stocks the higher rate of return on stocks the socalled equity premium represents compensation to an investor for taking on the additional risk measured as the standard deviation on the expected rate of return of holding stocks rather than bonds26 given this risk pension fund for example should choose an asset alloca tion that minimizes the risk that the fund will be unable to pay its liabilities when they come due as result of an untimely decline in the value of equities this approach often called asse tliab ility matching favors investme nt in fixedincome instruments such as bonds with maturities that are matched to the times at which the pension plans liabilities will come due for payment27 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34656crs17 28 bond with face value of 1000 that pays annual interest of 50 or 5 could be sold for 1250 if interest rates were to fall to 4 because 50 is 4 of 1250 however the bond could be sold for only 833 if interest rate s were to rise to 6 because 50 is 6 of 833 when the bond matures the origin issuer will pay the holder the f ace value of 1000 regardless of the prevailing rate of interest maturitymatched pension plan portfolios are thus immunized against the risk of unfavorable changes in interest rates 29

of pension plans liabilities is greatly influenced by changes in interest rates like bonds changes in pens ion plan liabilities are inversely related to changes in interest rates liabilities increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise28 some economists have argued that pension plans should invest all of their assets in bonds that ar matched to the plans expected cash flows in order to avoid the possibility that the pe nsion plan will be forced to sell bonds that have not yet reached maturity at time of rising interest rates29 in contrast investing assets in equities can be poor hedge against interest rate swings stock prices often rise when inte rest rates fall providing protection from interest rate risk but there have been pe riods when this was not true including the period from 2000 to 2002 when bear market in stocks coincided with falling interest rates in 2004 soon after experien cing capital losses in equity investment the pbgc announced that it would adopt an assetliability matching approach to investing its assets thus reducing its equity exposure in favor of fixedincome securities matched to its liabilities at that time the pbgc noted that adopting portfolio concentrated in highquality l ongterm bonds would bring it closer to the portfolios held by insurance companies which have historically limited their equity exposure according to the american council of life insurers acli bonds represent the majority of assets held by private life insurance providers while equity represents about 5 of total insurance company assets 72 of insurance company assets are in bonds30 there is some evidence that corporate pension plans also are exploring assetliability matching as an investment strategy provisions in the ppa and

reducing their pension plans investment in equities in favor of increased investment in bonds and othe r assets including hedge funds and private equity however in this survey the median equity allocation in 2007 was still 63 down only slightly from the 65 median allocation in 200633 because the pension plans that the pbgc insures are heavily invested in equities an assetliability matching approach would help to ensure that the pbgcs own financial condition would not deteriorate at the same time that the assets held by the pension plans it insures are declining in value if the pbgc invests substantially in equities it risks having to take ove r underfunded plans at the same time that its own assets are declining in value because pension plan underfunding often increases during periods of falling stock prices implications of the new policy pbgcs future financial condition the pbgcs decision in 2008 to reduce ssetliability ma tching in favor of strategy aimed at generating higher exp ected returns was driven in part by the agencys concerns about its deficit the pbgcs previous investment policy was not designed to maximize investment income but to keep the agencys deficit from deteriorating further while policymakers pursued reforms to address pbgcs funding deficit however even after the ppa was enacted the presidents budget for fy2009 noted that neither the singleemp loyer nor multiemployer program has the resources to satisfy fully the agencys longterm obligations to plan participants34 the pbgc has limited authority to adopt po licies that could di rectly affect its financial condition unlike insurers in the pr ivate sector it has authority to set the premiums for the insurance it provide s it cannot strengthen the funding requirements for insured plans reduce the am ount of pension benef its that it insures or reject companies that it deems excessively risky to insure all of these authorities rest exclusively with the united states congress the companies that sponsor defined benefit pension plan s have financial intere st in lobbying congress to persuade it not to make pbgc premiums too high or pl an funding requirements too

consisting mainly of the assets of underfunded plans for which the pbgc has become the trustee in assets of its choice in announcing the new investment policy adopted in 2008 th pbgc stated its desire to maximize its investment income and thus reduce its deficit however while the pbgc has asserted that its new policy will be less risky in the longterm than its previous policy some of the assumptions underlying that assertion are open to question the pbgc adopted its new investment polic in part in response to an analysis of investment options conducted for the agency by rocaton investment advisors llc the conclusions reached in that analysis are sensitive to the met hods and assumptions on which they were based an assessment of the relative risks of the pbgcs previous investment policy and its new policy for example depends largely on how the risk associated with each class of assets in the portfolio is measured and on the relative weights of each class of asset in the old and new portfolios the risk associated with holding given financial asset is that the actual rate of return will deviate from the expected rate of return this risk is measured as the standard deviation of the rate of return the more volatile the asset that is the more widely actual annual ra tes of return are dispersed around the average the greater the standard deviation in its st udy for the pbgc rocaton assumed that the rate of return on longterm treasury bonds with 15year average duration35 will have standard deviation of 112 crs examined rates of return on longterm treasury bonds over the pe riod from 1926 thr ough 2007 and found the standard deviation around the mean real rate of re turn to be 84 for 10year treasury bonds and 112 for 30year treasury bonds36 the rocaton study

analysts conducted sensitivity analysis in which the key assumptions such as the standard deviations of the rates of return on st ocks and bonds were changed to evaluate the effect on the results of the analysis to the extent that the relative riskiness of the pbgcs new investment policy compared to its previous policy is directly influenced by thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34656crs20 37 pension protection fund statement of investment principles july 2008 at httpwwwpensionprotecti onfundorguksip_july_2008pdfand other key assumptions it would be prudent for the model used by rocaton to be subjected to sensitivity analysis it is possible that the shift away from assetliability matching to an investment policy focused on earning higher rates of re turn on investment could increase the risk that the pbgc will experience decline in the value of its investments at the same time that the plans it insures are beco ming increasingly underfunded in stock market downturn the plans that pbgc stands to inherit are likely to have experienced drop in the value of their assets if it were more heavily invested in equities the pbgc would be exposed to the same investment losses as the plans that it insures effectively giving the pbgc doubleexposure to the effect of stock market decline as the agencys liabilities were increasing although the pbgcs statements bout the new investment policy have emphasized the corporation s longterm investment horizon the pbgc still needs access to cash in the shortrun to pay the bene fits of beneficiaries in the plans it has trusteed when looking at the pbgcs current and potential future cash needs rocaton noted that the duration of the pbgcs current liabilities allows the corporation to weather shortterm vola tility in its investment portfolio however rocaton did not examine pbgcs contingent liabilities the liabilities that the pbgc has not yet assumed from underfunded plans that have yet to terminate noting only that these liabilities are uncertain in both timing and magnitude in contrast to the pbgcs new investment policy the asset allocation strategy of the pension protection fund ppf the governmentsponsored guarantor

assetliability matching investment strategy had very little chance of eliminating the pbgcs deficit according to pbgcs former director steven kandarian the previous investment strategy was tool to keep the program from falling further into deficit while policymakers pursued longterm solutions to the problem of pension underfunding38 the new policy will likely generate higher average annual returns than the previous policy however it also increases the likelihood that the pbgc will suffer investme nt losses concurrently with an increase in the underfunding of the plans that it insures if the pbgcs new investment policy generates higher expected returns accompanied by reduced risk as the pbgc and rocaton have asserted then us taxpayers as the facto guarantors of pbgc insurance will be better off if the higher returns are accompanied by commensurately higher risk then taxpayers are neither better nor worse off because the pbgcs true fina ncial condition will not have changed however if that higher risk results in investment losses that the agency would not have experienced unde r the previous policy and the pbgcs deficit grows then taxpayers will be worse off taxpayers also could be worse off if higher investment returns forestall fundamental reforms in pbgc financing such as adopting riskbased premiums that could improve the longterm financial condition of the agency and reduce the risk that they will at some point in the future have to bail out an insolvent pbgc
