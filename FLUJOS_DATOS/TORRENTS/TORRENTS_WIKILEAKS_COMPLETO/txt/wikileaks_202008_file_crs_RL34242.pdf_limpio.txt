on on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity was introduced in the 110th congress and appears to represent half of an earlier bill that dealt with both gender identity and sexual orientation discrimination gender identity appears to include but likely is not limited to transgender status like the earlier bill hr 3686 would also prohibit employment discrimination against an individual based upon the gender identity of persons associated with that individual and does not permit disparate impact claims of gender identity discrimination minority of states have enacted their own prohibitions against gender identity employment discrimination additionally some types of gender identity employment discrimination may already be prohibited by ex isting prohibitions against sex stereotypes and harassment in title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 despite the fact that title viis definition of sex generally has not been interpreted to encompass transgender status hr 3686 does not appear to apply to religious organizations as defined under title vii however even if hr 3686 were enacted religious organizations may still be prohibited from engaging in those types of gender identity discrimination that are currently prohibited by title vii alternatively despite the fact that hr 3686 does not claim to limit the provisions of any other federal or state discrimination law the bill could be read to implicitly repeal judicial interpretations of sex stereotype discrimination under title vii

although title viis prohibitions against discrimi nation on the basis of sex generally have not been interpreted to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity4 in schroer v billington the united states district court for the district of columbia recently held that title vii may in fact encompass transgender discrimination5 according to that court the factual complexities that underlie human sexual identity warranted more developed record including the scientific basis of sexual identity and gender dysphoria in particular6 other courts while not adopting the reasoning of the court in schroer have held that under some circumstances victims of treatment that would arguably also qualify as gender identity discrimination may be able to successfully assert that they were victims of sex stereotypes or sexual harassment under title vii g21g142g161g561g156g157g142g155g142g152g157g162g153g142g156g561 victims of gender identity discrimination may prevail under title vii where the

firm had instructed her to act more femininely in order to be considered for partnership in the future8 the court held that price waterhouse was applying standards for partnership in prohibited sexually disparate manner in that title vii did not permit an employer to evaluate female employees based upon their conformity with the employers stereotypical view of femininity9 the sex stereotype theory may also be viable in cases involving transgender individuals in smith v salem male firefighter who was undergoing gender transition to female argued that he had been suspended because of his feminine appearance10 the sixth circuit held that to the extent that the firefighter asserted that she expe rienced discriminatory treatment due to the fact that she did not conform to what her employer be lieved males should look and act like she had sufficiently plead prima facie case of sex discrimination11 similarly in barnes v cincinnati male police officer undergoing gender transition to female was denied promotion because she acted too femininely in her supervisors opinions12 coverage under the sex stereotype theory however only goes so far the ninth circuit has held that it does not violate title vii for covered employers to require female employees to wear makeup and long styled hair so long as these requirements do not impose an unequal burden when compared to grooming requirements for male employees13 in addition the tenth circuit has held that employers may require employees undergoing gender transition to use the bathrooms designated for their current anatomical sex14 g21g142g161g158g138g149g561g145g138g155g138g156g156g150g142g151g157g561 in the context of sexual harassment recent court decisions have been guided by the supreme courts decision in oncale v sundowner offshore services 15 in that case the court held that the critical question is whether the harassment occurred because of sex16 furthermore relying on price waterhouse the third circuit held in bibby v philadelphia coca cola bottling comapny that harassment of an individual for failure to conform to sex stereotypes could constitute harassment because of sex consistent with oncale 17 8 id at 233235 partners also objected to her use of vulgar language and reported that she acted too macho 9 id at 250251 interestingly the court in schroer refused to apply sex stereotype theory reasoning that transgender individuals are not attempting to deviate from sexual stereotypes but are embracing them as part of their gender transition schroer v billington 424 f supp 2d at 211 10 smith v salem

523 us 75 1998 16 id at 81 the court also recognized that an inference that harassment is because of sex is not obvious where the harasser and the victim are of the same sex but provided three examples of how such an inference could be established 1 if the harasser sexually desired the victim 2 if the harasser was hostile to the presence of one sex in the workplace or 3 if comparative data showed that the harasser targeted only members of one sex id at 8081 this discussion of oncale is not meant to imply that gender identity harassment is only perpetrated by persons of the same sex as the victim but merely to suggest that an employers assertion that harassment occurred solely because of transgender status and not sex may be refuted by the methods of proof offered in oncale 17 bibby

harassment which targeted body parts clearly linked to persons sexuality constituted sexual discrimination prohibited by title vii and that whatever else those attacks may or may not have been because of has legal consequence18 although the plaintiff in rene prevailed the holding of the ninth circuit may contradict the supreme courts earlier holding in oncale as the dissent in rene noted the ninth circuit relied in large part on doe v city of belleville in which the seventh circuit argued that evidence of physical abuse of sexual nature alone could lead to an inference that the victim was targeted because of his gender19 that judgment however was vacated and remanded to the seventh circuit after the courts decision in oncale 20 the text of the opinion in oncale also seems to require more than conduct of sexual nature in order to give rise to an inference that it was because of sex21 g7g143g143g142g140g157g561g152g143g561 hr 3686 g561g152g151g561g142g161g146g156g157g146g151g144g561g149g138g160g561 hr 3686 would define gender identity as the genderrelated identity appearance or mannerisms or other genderrelated characteristics of an individual with or without regard to the individuals designated sex at birth22 given this definition reasonable court could conclude that the definition of gender identity includes the kind of employer behavior evidenced by the facts in price waterhouse v hopkins smith v salem and bibby v coca cola if hr 3686 were enacted it is unclear whether facts similar to these cases would be governed by hr 3686 or existing protections of title vii section 14 of hr 3686 states that the act shall not invalidate or limit the rights remedies or procedures available to an individual claiming discrimination under any other federal law or regulation23 therefore hr 3686 might be interpreted to leave price waterhouse s judicially created protections in place the supreme court has held that repeals by implication are strongly disfavored24 however in united states v fausto the supreme court also held that the normal presumption against implicit repeals is not present when dealing with repeal by implication of legal disposition implied by statutory text25 therefore in that case the court held that the civil service reform act had implicitly repealed prior judicial interpretation of the back pay act26 18 rene v mgm grand hotel 305 f3d 1061 1064 1066 9th cir 2002 in this case the plaintiff believed he was harassed because of his sexual orientation but the courts holding may have broader implications bey ond this type of harassment 19 id at 1066 citing doe v city of belleville 119 f3d 563 580 7th cir 1997 20 city of belleville v doe 523 us 1001 1998 the court remanded and instructed the court below to determine whether harassment had occurred because of sex however the case settled before the seventh circuit could rehear the case 21 the plaintiff must always prove that the conduct at issue was not merely tinged with offensive sexual connotations oncale 523 us at 81 22 hr 3686 2a6 23 hr 3686 14 this section also disavows preemption of any state discrimination law 24

might argue for implicit repeal of price waterhouse first the bills stated purpose is to provide comprehensive federal prohibition of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity27 second the bill explicitly does not allow disparate impact claims of gender identity discrimination while title vii appears to28 third price waterhouse sex stereotypes brought under title vii would apply to religious institutions generally while hr 3686 explicitly appears not to apply to religious organizations and schools 29 if the intent of hr 3686 is to leave price waterhouse as it stands the purpose of the drafters inclusion of these last two limits is substantially less clear therefore court might conclude that hr 3686 if enacted was meant to supplant the price waterhouse sex stereotype theory currently viable under title vii however one should not take this to mean that hr 3686 is exactly coterminous with price waterhouse under title vii for example if an employer refused to hire any applicant that had undergone gender transition regardless of the applicants sex that act likely would not violate title vii but appears to be prohibited by plain reading of hr 368630 other cases of gender identity discrimination may not be so clear cut we re an employer to refuse to promote or hire any applicant that was simply too aggressive regardless of sex it is likely that this adverse employment action would pass muster under title v ii but it is not totally clear whether hr 3686 would prohibit it courts have not yet determined what appearances or mannerisms are gender related as would be required by these bills given the etymology of genderloaded word such as macho its classification as gender related seems reasonable however characteristics such as aggressive vulgar or demure may be more difficult as they arguably bear relationship to gender beyond crude stereotypes nevertheless such characteristics could easily be used to mask discrimination on the basis of gender identity in these cases it remains to be seen how far beyond existing law hr 3686 would extend interestingly with respect to sex stereotyping under title vii courts have been careful to refrain from explicitly defining what the traditional masculine or feminine stereotypes are instead courts have generally looked to the intent of the employer finding sex discrimination where the employers words or actions indicated reliance upon stereotypical attributes of men or women 31 it is possible that courts would continue to use this methodology to determine when employment decisions are made on the basis of gender related characteristics under hr 3686

types of employment actions prohibited by hr 3686 dovetail with title viis prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of race color sex national origin and religion 32 notwithstanding this overall similarity the provisions of the bill do go beyond title 27 hr 3686 11 emphasis added cf united states v fausto 484 us at 454 holding that the comprehensive nature of the civil service reform act supported implicit repeal of the back pay acts previous interpretation 28 see infra notes 3738 and accompanying text for discussion of hr 3686s provisions regarding disparate impact 29 see infra text accompanying footnote 46 for discussion of religious exemptions under title vii and hr 3686 30 other sections of hr 3686 refer to employees that are undergoing or have undergone gender transition

prohibit discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity33 the text of title vii contains comparable prohib ition against discrimination on the basis of the perceived race color sex national origin or religion of person the americans with disabilities act ada however does include in its definition of disability being regarded as having physical or mental impairment34 the semantic similarity between perceived and regarded suggests that existing judicial interpretation of that language in the ada may be instructive for courts agencies or employers attempting to interpret what is meant by perceived gender identity in other words to the extent that being regarded as disabled under the ada has been held to require an examination of an employer s subjectively held beliefs courts may read hr 3686 to require the same g3g156g156g152g140g146g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g155g146g144g145g157g156g561g138g155g142g561g153g155g152g157g142g140g157g142g141g561 hr 3686 would additionally prohibit adverse empl oyment actions taken against an individual on the basis of the actual or perceived gender identity of person who associates with that individual35 although title vii contains analogous text associational rights under title vii have been recognized by federal courts in the context of interracial marriage36

hr 3686 would disallow disparate impact claims on the basis of gender identity37 therefore whereas title vii claim could proceed where the plaintiff showed that particular job requirement disproportionately impacted one racial or religious group it does not appear that this bill would allow plaintiff to show that part icular job requirement disproportionately impacts one gender identity over another38 hr 3686 would also explicitly allow employers to enforce continued current version of title vii compare hr 3686 3a4a with 42 usc 2000eb 33 hr 3686 3af 34 42 usc 121022c for

owned or supported by particular religion religious corporation association or societ or ii the curriculum of the institution is directed toward the propagation of particular religion41 this

college university or other educational institution or institution of learning is in whole or in substantial part owned supported controlled or managed by particular religion or by particular religious corporation association or society or if the curriculum of such school college university or other educational institution or institution of learning is directed toward the propagation of

considered when determining if an institution is religious none of which are determinative 1 whether the entity operates for profit 2 whether it produces secular product 3 whether the entitys articles of incorporation or other pertinent documents state religious purpose 4 whether it is owned affiliated with or financially supported by formally religious entity such as church or synagogue 5 whether formally religious entity participates in the management for instance by having representatives on the board of trustees 6 whether the entity holds itself out to the public as secular or sectarian 7 whether the entity regularly includes prayer or other forms of worship in its activities 8 whether it includes religious instruction in its curriculum to the extent it is an educational institution and 9 whether its membership is made up by coreligionists 45 although as discussed above hr 3686 would not apply to religious organizations neither it nor title vii exempt qualifying religious entities from defending claims of sex discrimination therefore gender identity claims brought under sex stereotype theory may still be viable against religious entity insofar as hr 3686 does not

rimination whether brought under hr 3686 or title vii would likely not be applicable to religious organizations selection of certain positions involved in worship or ritual discrimination on the basis of race sex national origin or religion has been held to be permissible in these positions under the judicially created ministerial exception to title vii this exception was created to reconcile some of title viis prohibitions with the free exercise clause of the federal constitution it has been adopted in eight federal circuits and applies to employees whose primary duties include teaching spreading the faith church governance supervision of religious order or supervision of participation in religious ritual and worship 47 this exception to title vii allows discrimination on the basis of any characteristic including race and sex but only with respect to religious institutions choice as to who will perform spiritual functions48 because the rationale for this exception is derived from the federal constitution and not the text of title vii it would likely be wholly applicable to hr 3686 as well 45 leboon v lancaster jewish comm ctr assn 2007 us app lexis 22328 1920 3rd cir 2007
