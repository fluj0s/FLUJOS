personal exemption unless the right to claim the childs personal exemption is waived in writing by the custodial parent this report will be updated as events warrant alimony payments it was 4 years after enactment of the income tax before the tax treatment of alimony payments was determined by 1917 supreme court ruling commonly referred to as the gould case the case law stood from 1917 to 1942 in the absence of statutory internal revenue code provision in the period between 19171942 alimony was not included in the recipients income and was not deductible by the payor this tax treatment was changed in 1942 c ongress was concerned that the payor was fully taxable on all income even though portion of that income alimony was not available from which to pay taxes it was feared that the combination of alimony and the increased taxes due to high wartime tax rates would not leave taxpayers with sufficient resources with which to meet their tax oblig ations accordingly the revenue act of 1942 taxed alimony to the former spouse receivi ng payments and per mitted an income taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20004crs2 1 typically the payor of alimony is in higher tax bracket than the spouse receiving alimony payments hence the treatment instituted in 1942 reduces federal tax revenues 2 it is likely that the tax treatment of alimony payments evolved partially from the tax systems treatment of the family familys earnings are taxed once as an economic unit typically on joint return while the spouses relationship may be severed by divorce it does not necessarily follow that the economic relationship has ended the retention of an economic relationship may lead to the conclusion that the proper taxation of earnings should correspond before and after divorce in the case of alimony payments both the shifting of income and its taxability prevent double taxation of the same earnings and thus pr ovide rough tax equivalency after divorce to do otherwise would be to treat divorced taxpa yers as two economic units with income taxable to the spouse who has custody of the child and nondeductible to the pa yor with resulting increase in tax burden following divorce this result would conflict with social policy and generally accepted principles of taxation of the family 3 us congress house committee on ways and means the revenue bill of 1942 washington us govt print

making the payments1 2 in 1954 the congress extended this tax treatment to decree for support commonly known as separate maintenance payments where spouses have sepa rated but are not legally divorced3 under the tax reform act of 1976 the law was changed such that alimony payments are taken from adjusted gross income rather than as an itemized deduction this change stems from the belief that the allowance of deductibility is more appropriate as an adjustment to income and hence can be claimed by all taxpayers whether or not they itemize deductions4 clarifying changes were made with the passage of the defic it reduction act of 1984 those changes were designed to provide uniform definition of alimony since differences in state w created differences in federal tax consequences and as result administrative difficulties for the internal revenue service the act defines alimony to distinguish it from property settlements and prevent the deduction of onetime lumpsum payments5 uniform standard leads to simpler tax law for administration by the internal revenue service and more equitable tax treatment of the parties to divorce child support payments in 1942 and also in 1984 congress conf irmed that payments made for child support are not deductible by the payor or taxable to the payee6 7 however congressionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20004crs3 7 continued then payments are first applied as child support payments and than as alimony payments thus any underpayment of support is more likely to consist of deductible alimony payment rather than nondeductible child support payment payments made under post1984 instruments that either establish an amount of money or part of the payment as child support are treated as child support for tax purposes and are not deductible if an amount set out in the instrument relates to the child and is reduced based on contingency such as reaching specified age or income level dying or marrying leaving school or becoming employed the reduction amount is treated as child support and is not deductible th tax court found that if the divorce instrument designates an allocation to an arrearage betw een alimony and child support payments then the instruments allocation controls the tax tr eatment of the payments see verticelli v commissioner 62 tcm 1991 8 the economic relationship of alimony and child support payments are similar and thus similar tax treatment can be derived from the tax sy stems treatment of the family such change would involve tradeoffs between hor izontal equity and simplicity and could be expected to result in lower federal tax revenues lower revenues would result since payors of child support usually have higher marginal tax rates associated w ith higher earnings than those receiving

household tax status see divorced fa ther complains of unfair taxation tax notes september 7 1998 p 1131 reports fail to explain the reasons why congress deemed this tax treatment proper some have inferred that the rationale rests with state legal restrictions on support payments these restrictions designate th at child support payments are made for the benefit of the child and not for the benef it of the custodial parent the treasury department has provided re lated explanation for the tax treatment of alimony and child support payments treas ury finds that the ta x treatment of alimony is justified because the payments are neith er personal nor family expense since the family relationship has been terminated by the divorce8 however the treasury finds that divorce does not terminate childparent relati onship even if the child and the parent longer live together as such child support remains pers onal family expense9 some years ago the american bar asso ciation house of legates approved resolution in support of legislation whic h would include all family support payments child support as well as alimony in the inco of the recipient and provide that those amounts be deductible to the payor in the report on the resolution issued by the section of family law it stated th at the 1984 tax amendments created tax disincentive to paying all support except alimony the am endments are at odds with the need to encourage parents to pay their entire family support obligation the principle sic purpose of the family support concept is to recognize that although the marriage dissolved the duty to the family continues as long as there are children in the custody of parent the need for family support is present10 11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20004crs4 12 prior to the change in 1984 some held the view that the availability of the childs personal exemption provided partial offset against nondeductible child support payments this offset worked only up to the amount of the personal exem ption and thus tended to provide benefits for only modest amounts of support payments the 1984 legislative history does not show comprehensive examination of all the issues at the time of this change in tax treatment 13 either or both parents may itemize payments fo r childs medical expenses regardless of who is entitled to claim the childs personal exemption 14 the rule is longer applicable when the child reaches the age of majority and parental control ceases under state law 15 the agreement must be in writing oral agreements may be recanted at later date see dependency

or separated parents the form is attached to the noncustodial parents tax return each year that the childs personal exemption is claimed written declaration including the same information as required by form 8332 may be used in lieu of the form typically the custodial parent provides an annual release so as to ensure receipt of child support payments 17 the courts have found that the father was entitled to his two childrens personal exemption since the pre1985 divorce decree entitled him to the exemptions his former wife insisted that it was inequitable since the childrens father had failed to pay all the medical expenses of the children as required by their modified divorce d ecree with the result of the mother having paid more than half of the childrens support see bonnie broughton v commissioner tc memo 1998409personal exemption of child prior to the passage of th deficit reduction act of 1984 the custodial parent was entitled to the childs dependency exemption if the parent provided more than half of the childs support an exception to this rule provided the noncustodial parent with the dependency exemption if either 1 there was written agreement or decree allocating the personal exemption to the noncustodial parent and the noncustodial parent provided at least 600 per calendar year for the childs s upport or 2 the noncustodial parent provided minimum of 1200 per calendar year for child support and the custodial parent did not establish greater support spending12 special rules applied to multiplesupport agreements where one person provided more than the requisite onehalf of the childs support under provision enacted as part of th deficit reduction ac t of 1984 the personal exemption for child typically be longs to the custodial parent13 14 there are

former spouse15 16 or pre1985 divorce decree or separation agreement providing the exemption to the noncus todial parent who mu st provide at least 600 for the childs support17 the prior rules allocating the dependenc exemption between parents often were subjective and presented difficult problems of verification and substa ntiation as result the internal revenue service was compelled to intercede when both parents claimed thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20004crs5 18 kenneth w gideon former assistant cretary of treasury for tax policy 19891992 states that in 1984 when this change in law wa s sought by the internal revenue service it was estimated to eliminate approximately 2000 docketed cases of disputed exemptions per tax year he goes on to say that the rule replaced perhaps more theoretically correct rule which allocated the exemption to the parent furnishing the most support but that rule led to repeated and protracted litigation and dispute later he explains that successful practical rules like these ought to have high value not just to ta x practitioners but also to tax legislators and tax thinkers because ultimately they make it eas ier for all of us to be compliant tax payers such rules are understandable they can be applied with high degree of certainty that the taxpayers return position and the internal revenue service position on audit will be the same and that there will not be large economic spread between the two resolvable only by processes of negotiation and even litigation resolution by negotiation and litigati on however fairly conducted must impose real costs uncertainty delay attorneys and accountants fees compounding these difficulties is the fact that outcomes in negotiated and litigated cases are not uniform thus creating sense of

provided certainty by allowing the custodial spouse the childs personal exemption unless the custodial spous waives his or her right to claim the exemption18 as result the internal reve nue service is longer involved in dependency disputes between parents19 as an interesting aside it is not always advantageous for highincome taxpayer to claim the childs personal exemption under provision of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 the pe rsonal exemption amount is reduced or eliminated for very high income taxpayers the phaseout range depends on the taxpayers filing status and is annually adjusted for inflation the personal exemption is reduced by 2 for each 2500 or fraction thereof by which the taxpay ers adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold level for 2002 the threshold levels are 206000 for joint returns 137300 for single returns and 171650 for head of hous ehold returns thus for higher income taxpayers the ability to claim childs dependency exemption may have little or tax consequences interactions with other code provisions former spouse qualifies to use the lower than single tax rates associated with head of household filing status if heshe pr ovides the principal residence exceeding more than onehalf the year for stepson daught er or stepdaughter of the taxpayer or descendant of or daughter of the taxpayer however if the relative is married at the close of the taxable year then the head of household filing status is available only if the former spouse is entitled to claim depe ndency exemption for the relative under code 151 or but for an agreement to release th dependency exemption to the noncustodial parent under code 152e4 would have been eligible to claim the dependencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20004crs6 20 mcmahon martin
