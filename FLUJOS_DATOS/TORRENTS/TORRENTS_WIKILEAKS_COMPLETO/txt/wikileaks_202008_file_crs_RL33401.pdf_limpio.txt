the committees of jurisdiction for analysis and ultimately for possible report it was regarded as singular piece of legislati on in 1996 the measure emerged as rider to more general economic measure

congress to amend the fair labor standards act by william g whittaker 2 proponents and opponents of an increase in th minimum wage have variously discussed the potential impact of such approach pr and some view additional provisions for example comp time or an expanded s mall business exemption as an appropriate strategy others regard such collateral measures as poison pill intended to scuttle minimum wage revisionsthe fair labor standards act minimum wage in the 109th congress the fair labor standards act flsa of 1938 as amended is the primary federal statute in the area of minimum wages and certain related labor standards issues eg overtime pay and child labor1 various bills related to the flsa have been introduced in the 109th congress thus far none of these measures has been enacted there are expiration dates embedded within the flsa and thus congress is under obligation to act on amendments to the statute though the declining value of the minimum wage could provide an impetus for action were congress to take up minimum wage legisl ation it could focus narrowly upon an increase in the base rate raising the floor above the current 515 per hour level but it could act more expansively dealing with variety of minimum wagerelated issues and perhaps revising certain other aspects of the act such as its overtime pay or child labor provisions some during recent years have urged that changes in wagehour standards should be coupled with tax and other benefits for busin ess while such linkage seems to have become popular issue fo r discussion there is structural reason to proceed in that manner broadening the scope of the flsa legislation including overtime pay child labor and assorted other economic issues within single comprehensive bill could reduce the likelihood that any measure in this area would ultimately be adopted but c onversely depending upon the overall content of such package it could expand the measures appeal2 introduction the flsa is an umbrella statute that deals with series of labor standards issues these fall roughly into three categories first minimum wage section 6 of the act second overtime pay s ection 7 and third child labor section 12 section 3 of the act defines the concepts used throughout the statute and therebyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33401crs2 3 see for example crs report rl31501 child labor in america history

comparable worth the next step by linda levine 4 several aspects of minimum wage coverage may need to be taken into account first many states have statemandated minimum wage standards these may be roughly parallel to the federal minimum wage they need not be and often are not second not all workers are covered under the flsa nor under state wage hour standards these coverage patterns including patterns of exemption need to be taken into account when considering the potential impact of changes in federal wagehour law third because of variations in coverage with extensive admi nistrative rules governing implementation and enforcement of wagehour law it may be peril ous to suggest who is or is not covered by the requirements of statute too many variab affect coverage to allow easy assessment 5 under current law there are special rates for youth workers for fulltime students who continuedlimits or qualifies its wage hour and child labor provisi ons traditionally congress has mandated broad ge neral coverage and then has specified select groups or categories of workers who are not to be covered by the act section 13 provides body of exemptions or special treatment for segments of industry andor groups of workers in the latter areas the secretary of labor has been granted wide interpretive powers though these have not been without limit while the act is often treated as an inte grated unit it can also be approached in terms of its three general component part s and of individual subunits of each this report focuses narrowly upon the fede ral minimum wage ot her related issues eg child labor and overtime pay are considered parately in ot her crs products3 under the flsa congress has estab lished basic minimum wage since 1997 515 per hour that must be paid to most covered workers however the level of the wage floor may vary from one group of workers to another with various exceptions and subminima built into the statute thus the issue may be which minimum wage rate is applicable and to which workers it should be applied4 through the past century the minimum wa ge alone or with other wagehour issues has sparked partisan comment and assertion th issue has not been solely whether there is an appropria federal role in wagehour regulation that continues to be debated but what that role ought to be at what level should the minimum wage be set should it be indexed how broad should minimum wage coverage be and if there are exemptions which there are upon what foundation should they rest for example should small firms be able to pay their workers at lower rate than large firms should wage rates be productivitybased or respond to the needs and personal lifestyle s of the workers involved might the wage floor depend upon an employees nonwork status eg whethe r the worker is the sole earner in family secondary earner or student as under current law should the rate vary with the age of the worker even wher the work performed and productivity level among workers may be comparable5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33401crs3 5 continued work more than parttime for disabled persons and for others that these rates except nominally for the disabled are related to productivity may not be entirely clearminimum wage background and comment when the flsa was enacted in 1938 its coverage wa s largely limited to industrial workers engaged in

change has been restricted largely to increases in the basic wage rate and modification of ex isting flsa provisions amendment has often been contentious conditioned by ec onomic considerations and political compromise6 generally expansion of coverage has been opposed by employers and supported by workers reflecting in the short term who benefits from an increase in the minimum wage and upon whom the costs fall the basic federal minimum wage rate is statutory and will remain at its current level until congress takes specific action to alter it again congress has specific obligation to revisit the minimum wage and thus may not do so however over the long term congressional inacti on could have the effect of repeal through attrition fewer and fewer workers would likely ear n the

some advocates of minimum wage view it not only as socially useful but also as economically useful promoting socioeconomic equity provi ding floor under wages stimulating demand for goods and services expanding employment and with other measures bolstering the general economy some critics of the minimum wa ge conversely have view ed it as an inefficient approach to income redistribution and an unjustified intrusion into the operation of the free market they contend that minimum wage increases have an inflationary impact restructure employment patterns may reduce aggregate employment and impose an unnecessary burden upon employers and consumers such critics often view the wage floor as economically harmful especially for the unskilled and new workforce entrants who critics say ma be priced out of the job market economists and policy analysts continue to disagree about the impact of changes in the minimum wage and about what the effects of the minimum wage have been the issues are both socioeconomic and ideological and have changed little since the debates of 193719389httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33401crs7 10 some may argue that basing wage rate on the productivity of the worker may be itself misleading since in large measure worker productivity is based upon the skills of management and upon managementcontrolled elements such as work organization availability of appropriate equipment mo rale ambience and other similar factors 11 this suggests some of the problems in ca lculating minimum wage earnings while worker under age 20 can be paid 425 per hour through the first 90 consecutive days with any employer his wage after 90 days would have to be increased to the full 515 per hour continuedwhat do we mean by minimum wage when people speak of minimum wage they often speak in terms of livable wage or decent wage or fair wage or suggest that the working poor ought to be able to live in reasonable comfort and enjoy economic dignity early in the century it was common to speak of living family saving wage but when individuals use such terms is there any reasonable assurance of consistent meaning in statute the minimum wage is clearly defined 515 per hour for most but not all covered workers the flsa does not translate that do llar amount into social or human terms is 515 an hour actually livable wage and livable by whose standard does reasonable comfort for ex ample mean safe and adequate shelter with modest amenities how are safe and adequate and modest defined if one thinks in terms of family wa ge how should the family be structured should both spouses engage in paid work should one spouse re side at home his or her companion earning the livelihood for the family might there be children in the household if so how many two or four or six see for example the calculations in table 3 some may view minimum as the west wage an individual will accept reservation wage or the highest amount an employer is willing to pay some urge repeal of legislated wage floor altogether and define the minimum as whatever rates are set by s upply and demand in free market economy ie market wage how minimal is minimum minimum wage bates contain frequent references to the poverty vel for family of two or three or more if congress intends the minimum wage to be set at level high enough to move family out of poverty as some suggest then some measurement of family size and of total household income is necessary in assessing the adequacy of the flsa minima if instead the minimum wage is productivityb ased ie resting upon the contribution of the worker then family size and non wage income support for example from other household members or through sources of income not related to the individuals employment would seem irrelevant10 under current law minimum wage worker employed fulltime and fullyear 40 hours per week for 52 weeks at 515 would earn 10712 fulltime worker under age 20 and paid at the statutorily permissible submin imum rate 425 per hour could earn 8840 for the same hours of work and for performing the same duties after 90 consecutive days with an individual employer however his or her subminimum rate would ordina rily increase

debate on the original flsa congressional record june 14 1938 p 9257some minimum wage work may provide fri nge benefit component such fringes are often not available until worker has been engaged for minimal period of time period that minimum wage worker quite possibly cannot reach minimum wage work often provides only cash income and little more under present law the concept of minimum wage is limited to cash wage to whom should not less than the minimum wage be paid flsa minimum wage requirements have always been subject to exceptions sometimes excluding from coverage those likel to be the most poorly paid workers upon what basis has congress included or excluded workers from minimum wage protection under the flsa12 when member of congress or that body collectively through legislation speaks of the minimum wage worker to whom is reference made is the minimum wage worker viewed as sing individual parent single parent the sole economic support for family teenager is the flsa minimum intended to be wage floor for all workers urban and ru ral for employees only of large firms or for those employed by small businesses as well should any nonwork or nonproductivity factors be taken into account when setting the wage floor for example age youth or senior citizen student status or family size whom does legislator have in mind when setting the federal minimum wage at for example 515 per hour is that mental image consiste nt with the demographic reality of the minimum wage workforce various social and demographic distinctions have been cited to justify minimum wage rate differentials for example the flsa under certain conditions allows fulltime student employed in retail or service establishment agriculture or the institution of higher education that such student attends to be paid lower minimum wage than that required for nonstudent even for equal work so long as the student works only parttime defined by th statute the wage level here may be conditioned less upon productivity than upon how the worker spends his offduty hours ie that he is student and is rolled in academic course work if he drops out of school but keeps his job the law requi res that his hourly ra of pay be raised to at least the full applicable minimum similarly even while remaining an employed fulltime student if his hours of work increase to more than parttime he must be paid at the full applicable minimum rate applicability of the student sub minimum rate section 14b is depende nt upon maintenance of fulltime student status and not more than parttime employment what is the rationale for paying parttime worker less on perhour basis here subminimum rate than full time worker even for the same work performed under the same conditions and equally well what assu mptions about need and productivity are implicitly built into the student subminimum wage opti on and are these assumptions valid some may argue that this wage struct ure creates an incentive for young persons to leave school or to shift their primary focus from study to work the rationale for subminimum wage treatment however is that it may offset the problems younghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33401crs10 13 since workers compete with each other in the labor market paying needsbased rate could encourage an employer to hire single persons without dependents and thus to keep labor costs wages low to avoid hiring pe rsons who are married w ith children similarly youth workers paid at subminimum rate are often thought to be potentially economic substitutes for older workers who must be paid full minimum scalepersons have in finding work that will ma tch their academic sche dules ie making them cheaper and thus more attractive to employ it can be argued that younger persons by definition are less experienced and therefore less productive than prime age adults this conclusion however may not be valid for minimum wagetype work and indeed an argument can be made that for lowskilled entrylevel positions young persons may be more productive ie more vigorous more nearly satisfied with such routine activity what criteria should be taken into account with respect to the elderly who may be less or more productive in minimum wagetype work or the disabled should minimum wages be need sbased or productivitybased if worker has an affluent spouse or parents s hould he or she be payable at subminimum rate because his or her combined family income is relatively high should one who spends his wages on luxury items designer clothes cds beer and pizza be paid at lower rate than one who spends his ear nings on tuition baby formula or for food rent or transportation if need sbased then should the minimum wage be pegged to family size the more children the higher the minimum wage rate are such distinctions useful or workable nd do they lend themselves to public policy formulations who should pay the minimum wage how the minimum wage worker is defined and the intent of congress in establishingmaintaining federal minimum wage are critical to consideration of by whom the minimum wage ought to be paid speaking generally is the minimum wage intended to be sufficient to sustain worker however defined by congress ie single person without dependents or sole breadwinne r for family if so should an employer be obligated to pay wage of at least the amount needed to sustain the worker and where applicable his or her dependents an amount that could presumably be affected by the assumptions built into the definition of minimum wage worker 13 if productivitybased minimum wage is not sufficient to sustain worker and his or her dependents if any then by whom if anyone should the deficiency be made up should it be paid by the employ er who directly benefits by paying low wages through utilizing the services of lowwage workforce and indirectly by the consumer of the goods and serv ices such lowwage workers provide through an increase in the minimum wage rate or should the difference between ones wage and ones need be subsidized by the taxpayer the minimum wage v the eitc in 1975 congress established the earned income tax credit eitc

some laud the eitc for helping to lift working families above the poverty threshold and to provide greater work incentive to lowincome workers15 but the eitc can also be viewed as wage suppl ement not only for workers but also for lowwage employers who may continue to pay low wages to their workers and profit from utilization of such lowwage employees while tax revenues through the credit mechanism or through other public subsidies assist their workers in meeting basic living costs thus arguably the routine cost of doing business is shifted from the individual employer to the general taxpayer similarly the eitc can be viewed as subsidy to the consumers of the goods nd services produced by lowwage workers conversely some argue the eitc affo rds firms that operate on slim margin an opportunity to remain in business and to provide employment even if at low wages however the eitc is conditi onal upon the low earnings of the worker not the marginal profitability of the employer it makes distinction between businesses employers that are struggling economically and those that are doing well speaking generally some view the eitc as supplement to the minimum wage predicated upon the needs of worker rather than upon his productivity others as substitute for future minimum wage increases employerbusiness acceptance of the eitc and hostility toward the minimum wage may reflect an economic reality with the eitc the taxpayer subsidizes the employers wage costs with the minimum wage those costs fall directly upon the employer or businessperson and indir ectly upon the consumer small businesses the flsas small business exemption allows certain qualifying employers to be exempt from the flsa minimum wage requirements in general though the exemption is complex this could include firms whose annual gross volume of business done is ss than 500000 though individual employees of such firms engaged in interstate commerce may be covered individually in addition the act contains numerous more narrowly focused exemptions over time there has been pressure from the small business community to expand its exemption proponents have argu ed that small firms may be adversely affected or even driven out of business by having to pay their workers the minimum wage however some may argue that test of profitability has been proposed with respect to firms benefitting from the small business exemption it ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33401crs12 16 the term pin money historically was frequently used with respect to womens wages ie to provide little something extra but not for the essentials of household increasingly the term is now used mostly disparagingly with respect to youth workers who have various alternative sources of income and do not really need to be employed or who are doing so as lark 17 surveys of income may collect information only with respect to workers main jobenjoyed by prosperous and struggling busine sses alike but where small businesses are free from minimum wage obligation th question remains how will workers employed by small businesses sustain th emselves and where applicable their families further what are the implications of small business exemption with respect to competition between small firms and midsized or larger firms needs of the minimum wage worker much of the debate over increasing the minimum wage has focused upon the low wage worker does he or she really need the increased income is he productive enough to justify to earn higher minimum wage does he have other sources of income for example working spouse or an employed parent how will the worker spend his earnings for essentials or for luxuries in short is he or she merely working for pin money 16 comparable issues have not been raised about business does the small businessperson really need the increased profits from employing lowwage sub minimum wage workers could he or sh reasonably pay higher wage when assertions are made with re spect to the limited resources of an enterprise should means test be prescribed for such employers general demographics of the minimum wage workforce data concerning the minimum wage workforce are difficult to develop with precision not everyone is covered by th minimum wage some lowwage workers may be paid at or below the federal minimum wage but because of exemptions built into the statute they may not be affected by the changes that congress may make in such cases their pay may continue at whatever levels without being influenced by congressional action conversely so employers may choose to pay the statutory minimum because it is convenient and generally recognized basic rate for lowwage employment even where their workers may not be subject to the acts minimum wage provisions in addition persons employed at or below the federal minimum wage may change jobs and economic status with some frequency moving into and out of work in response to nonworkrelated fact ors school pregnancy or perhaps change in marital status some workers may be multiple jobholders17 not all workers covered under the flsa are covered in precisely the same way thus statistical data in this area may be somewhat imprecise and we may often be speaking of the lowwage worker rather than the minimum wage worker covered under the flsahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33401crs13 18 about 756 million workers out of ci vilian noninstitutional workforce of around 150 million were paid hourly rates in 2005 in transmitting numbers of minimum wage workers the bureau of labor statistics states it should be noted that it is not possible to determine whether workers surveyed in the cps cu rrent population survey upon which bls relies are actually covered by the fair labor standa rds act or by individual state minimum wage laws thus some workers being reported as earning an hourly wage of 515 may not in fact be covered by federal or state minimum wage laws at the same time the presence of sizable number of workers with wages below the prevailing federal minimum wage does not necessarily indicate violations of the fair labor standards act or applicable state laws because of the numerous exemptions to th wage statutes emphasis added 19 it is difficult to assess needs in the context of minimum wage work but one might speculate that persons who continue to be employed in very lowpaying jobs over time may have pressing need for the income earned 20 in addition to their legally allowable lower wage rate other arguments can be made for the competitive advantages of youth workers they may have more energy than older workers and may be more flexible they are normally shortterm employees who do not join unions do not vest in pension programs do not earn vacation benefits and are less continuedwho are the minimum wage workers in 2005 about 1882 million workers paid at hourly rates earned at or below the federa l minimum wage of 515 per hour about 479000 were paid at the minimum rate and about 1403 million were paid below the minimum18 these are workers who are 16 years of age or older in absolute numbers according to data provided by the bureau of labor statistics bls persons working at or below the minimum are about as likely to be adults as youth see the discussion below more likely to be female than male and more likely to be white than of another race further persons working at or below the minimum wage are more likely to be working parttime than fulltime critics of the minimum wage often point to minimum wage worker who is young person working for pin money and being supported by suburban middleclass family conversely proponent s of higher minimum often view the lowwage workforce as largely adult and thus suggestive of more serious needs statistics can be used to support either interpretation if for example using 2005 data one defines youth as someone between 16 and 19 years of age then about 261 of workers paid hourly at or below the minimum wage are youths and about 739 are adults if ones definiti on is more expansive defining youth as between 16 and 24 years of age then about 533 of persons earning at or below the minimum wage are youths and only 467 are dults thus even with an expansive definition of youth 16 to 24 years of ag close to half of the minimum wagesub minimum wage workforce is 25 years of age or over19 for minimum wage type work the two demographic groups may well be in competition with youth workers readily subs titutable for older workers and with younger workers having an employment advantage even where covered by minimum wage requirements youth workers may often legally be hired at sub minimum wage and often at hours of wo rk fragmented parttime employment that could not sustain family or even single adult20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33401crs14 20 continued likely to be ill or suffer jobrelated strains that one might associate with longterm employment or age conversely the argument can be made that they are less disciplined have fewer skills though few sk ills are required for minimum wagetype work are less dependable and may be less acclimated to the culture of the world of work 21 bls divides the lowwage workforce into white black and asian within the context of race and provides separate classi fication of hispanic or latino the various shadings of color are becoming increasingl difficult to categorize concerning this classification see mary bowler et r evisions to the current population survey effective january 2003 employment and earnings feb 2003 pp 47 and 14 22 data here have been drawn from unpublished sources provided by the us bureau of labor statistics the bureau has used in formation drawn from the current population survey cps provided by the us census bureau 23 the early history of the flsa was marked by relatively sparse coverage which through the 1960s and 1970s was generally broadened giving the act roughly its present form among hourly workers paid at or below the general minimum rate about 656 were women and about 344 men although the data are imprecise because of definitional questions with respect to race and ethnicity it is clear that the majority of workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage are white21 in 2005 about 598 of workers at and below the minimum wage were employed on parttime basis about 399 were fulltime some 711 of part time workers were female some statistical variation may result from small number of multiple jobholders lowwage employment may tend to be less stable than more highly compensated employme nt with workers suffering involuntary joblessness or moving in and out of th labor force because of discouragement quitting to seek better wages and working conditions or for other personal reasons fulltime employment is not synony mous with fullyear employment estimating the annual income of minimum wage worker s may be problematic since many full time minimum wage workers may not be employed on fullyear basis there may be periods when they are not workin g or not working at the minimum wage beyond uncertainties about combinations of parttime or fu lltime partyear or fullyear employment one must recall that the minimum wage is cash wage fringe benefits earned by minimum wage worker are likely to be less than those of more highly paid persons widening the gap between the economic wellbeing of the minimum wage worker and others on the other hand minimum wage workers may have other sources of income22 the size of the minimum wage workforce in 2005 as noted above there were roughly 1882 million workers pa id at hourly rates who earned at or below the federal minimum wage of 515 per hour they constituted only about 25 of hourly pa id workers from an aggregate of about 756

minimum wage fact sheet by brian w cashellthis numerical decline is not necessarily indicative of improved economic status for the lowwage worker rather it may be that as the value of the statutory minimum shrinks in terms of constant dollars fewer workers are employed at or below the rate reflected in the reduced value of the statutory minimum nor does this imply that the economic status of those who have moved to rate little in excess of the statutory minimum has improved ie those who are above the statutory minimum but who are still lowwage workers rather their wage may have kept pace with inflationary pressures while the statutory minimum did not suggesting little or actual change of economic status in policy terms this would appear to ve several implications if the statutory minimum wage remains at its current level while the general wage level rises because of inflation andor productivity improvements the number of minimum wage workers could reasonably be expected to experience further decline fewer and fewer people could be expected to be empl oyed at the low wage level even though their economic condition may not have improved thus were congress to take action with respect to the minimum wage allowing its value to continue to decline the size of the minimum wage workforce could reasonably be expected to decline until it virtually disappears this would not mean that the lowwage workforce had shrunk but merely that an increasingly large number of such persons would be employed at wages above the declining real value of the statutorily defined minimum under this scenario which is generally consistent with the trajectory of legislated increases in the statutory min imum wage since its peak year 1968 the minimum wage would have been effectively repealed by attrition 24 in that context an argument might be made that since so few would actually be employed at rates at or below the statutory minimum its relative value notwithstanding the problem of the working poor could be handled throug h other more narrowly targeted means possibly through transfers of income rather than through strictly workrelated earnings this however may run counter to public policy that income from work is generally preferable to transfers or entitlements that must be financed through taxation finally as noted on table 2 state minimum wage rates have in some respects moved in to fill the gap of declining federal minimum wage however such considerations have been uneven eighteen states and the district of columbia have rates higher than the federal standard but most of these are on the west coast and in new england illinois laware maryland the district of columbia and florida provide exceptions and even here florida might not be classified as traditional southern state speaking generally the dwest and the old south have either gone along with the federal rate they would have had little choice since the federal rate if the standard is higher takes precedent over state rate or they have simply stood apart to the extent that there is disparity in earnings this might be viewed by some as contributing to certain fracturing of the

issue of indexation by gerald mayerduring the initial debates on wage hour legislation in 19371938 it was suggested that reasonable rate for that period would have been 40 cents an hour and 40hour work week under prolonged objections from southern industrialists the operative figures were dropped to 25 cen ts per hour and to 44hour work week in each instance to be raised or lowered according to statute thus congress avoided dealing with regional option nd southern industrialists also avoided stricter standards because the minimum wage under the flsa is set in statute it remains at fixed level without regard for changes in the general economy until congress alters it through legislation failure of the minimu m wage to maintain parity with the cost of living has been continuing concer n some have questioned whether the minimum wage floor should remain at fi xed point subject to action by congress they suggest it might usefully be indexed to reflect changes in the cost of living or shifts in other economic vari ables thus providing more regular pattern of increase on the other side some contend that there really isnt need for federal minimum wage at all indexation was discussed dur ing the last century as an approach to wage stability but was rejected it was last subject of extensive congressional debate during consideration of the 1977 flsa ame ndments but was once again rejected the congress seemingly preferring the curre nt method of direct legislative action35 several states notably oregon washin gton and vermont have experimented with minimum wage indexation in

differently from the senator from wyoming study after study finds raising the minimum wage does not cause job loss inflation he stated was yet another canard that was pointed to by minimum wage critics but with the sm all amount of the minimum wage increase less than onefifth of 1 percent of the national payroll an inflation would be offset by other factors one could exp ect increased morale and greater productivity as people take greater pride in their work he argued absenteeism would be reduced because people were treated with greater respect minimum wage is fairness issue it is also

incomes of american workers we are being told by the business community that there is this incredible shortage out there they cant find workers so they have to have foreign workers senator sessions then observed if business wants to find more workers they will usually increase wages not decrease them again senator sessions stated i would say that the current rate of immigration legal and illegal has depressed the wage s of lowskilled american workers senator kennedy disagreed with these observations we are talking about jobs an american does not take and that an american worker has not been interested in and refused to accept senator kennedy said52 senator judd gregg stresse d that the enzi proposal was thoughtful and effective way to meet the needs of working people especially single women in the workplace especially single moms senator gregg suggested that the kennedy proposal would raise the minimum wage too quickly and to level that small employers cant afford but the thrust of the senators comments focused upon family time though impassioned bout the wage rate proponents of an increase in the minimum wage stiffarm th working mother in this country the senator said senator gregg then proceeded to discussion of compensatory time comp time as replacement for overtime ra tes an enzi proposal sure the minimum wage is important but there are lot more people who are going to

added it is kneejerk reaction on the part of organize d big labor to this language53 senator kennedy responded that the comp time proposal suggested by senator enzi and endorsed by senato r gregg

concern the tip credit debate on the issue was interspersed throughout the day of august 3 2006 senator norm coleman rmn early in the day suggested that he found it regrettable that some of my democratic colleagues are now arguing that the tip credit provision would actually lead to reduction in the minimum wage for those workers in nontip credit states further the charge that the tip credit provision would result in the minimum wage for tipped workers going down is absolutely false senator coleman sought pe rmission to have printed into the record statement by victoria lipnic

whd the wage and hour divisi on would read section 402 as protecting the current minimum wages of the tipped employees in the seven states that now exclude tipped employees tips from being considered as wages because to do otherwise would be inconsistent with what we understand to be the intent of congress and the fair labor standards act which whd enforces nevertheless we are aware that so have argued that section 402 is ambiguous emphasis added senator coleman said that lipnic letter says that absolutely the fair labor standards act prohibits employers from paying less than the current minimum wage he emphasized that the lette r from the department of labor is very clear128 for others however the clarity of the proposed amendment was more problematic they questioned how protecting

through tips according to senator levin although this tip penalty has been federal law for years states have been free to guarantee higher wages to workers in these industries this bill would supersede those state laws to permit the lower wages this will decrease wages in at least seven states and it will set dangerous precedent by allowing the federal government to interfere with the

employers in fact the fair labor standards act encourages states to enact laws that are more protective for workers than the federal law then he moved on to an analysis of the current proposal the

experimental to begin on april 1 1990 and to end on apr il 1 1993 at the end of the trial period the secretary of labor was to provide congre ss with an assessment as it turned out almost one used the prog ram and it was not extended150 three years passed in 1996 minimum wa ge legislation came up as floor amendment to an industryoriented bill with subminimum wage for youth as one of its provisions following floor deba and approval in the house the measure was forwarded to the senate negotiations continued in the senate and ultimatelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33401crs50 151 when signing the new minimum wage bill president clinton observed i should note that i disagree with certain provisions added to the minimum wage title of the act such as the provision creating new subminimum wage for young people and the one denying increased cash wages to most employees who rely on tips for part of their income still those defects do not obscure the central accomp lishment of this act securing

signed into law by president william clinton pl 104188151 as enacted the bill would allow an employ er to pay youth under 20 years of age subminimum wage of 425 per hour through the first 90 consecutive days of employment with an employer having set forth youth subminimum ra congress then raised the general minimum rate to 515 an hour but without linking the youth worker option to the new standard unless congre ss takes specific action to increase the youth rate it will remain at 425 per hour even if the genera l minimum wage is raised legislatively the youth rate is separate i ssue from the general wage floor152 the tip credit provision during the 1960s and 1970s the flsa wa s progressively expanded to provide protection for retail and serv ice employees some of these workers were tipped employees and their employers argued successfully that since they were given tips by the public they the employers ought not to be responsible for paying such tipped employees full minimum wage through the years the level of the socalled tip credit the value of tip income received by tipped employees that an employer could count toward his or her minimum wage obligation has varied under the 1996 flsa amendments congress provided tip credit at 50 of the regular minimum wage ie 213 an hour based upon the 425 pe r hour general minimum wage as it was then in effect so long as an employee received tip income on regular basis sufficient to reach the statutory minimum wage when combined with an employer contribu tion of 213 per hour the employer had further minimum wage obligation the cred it deals only with the amount to be paid by the employer of tipped employee thereafter the tipped employee would receive either in combination of tip s and cash wages or cash wages alone where there were insufficient tips an amount sufficient to reach the full minimum wage then congress increased the federal min imum wage in steps to 515 per hour153 in the 1996 flsa amendments congress was

increased to have certain computer services workers defined administratively by the partment of labor as professional and therefore exempt under section 13a1 of the flsa from the standard minimum wage and overtime pay protection when the department seemed to demur congress in 1990 enacted legislation direc ting the secretary to develop regulations that would permit such an exemption if among other criteria such employees are paid on an hourly basis at rate that is at least 6¬Ω times greater than the applicable minimum wage pl 101583 the department proceeded as directed developing regulation under section 13a1 nd justifying the exemption on the professional character of the targeted personnel under the 1996 flsa amendments congress directly amended the act with section 13a17 to exempt the targeted computer services workers where among other qualifying criteria they are paid on an hourly basis at rate of not less than 2763 an hour pl 104188 while 2763 was 6¬Ω times the then applicable

congress has attempted variously to exempt certain small businesses from coverage under the act ultimately congress instituted dollar volume test for exempti on though the level of that test has been

or seemed to apply to samoa as it did to the states of the union however the wagehour statute does not appear to have been immediately enforced during the early 1950s the tuna canning industry became samoas major private sector employer when it appeared that the industry would be required to pay its worker s the national minimum wage though its economy was somewhat different from that of the mainland the industry appealed to congress to write an exception into the act following hearings the flsa was amended an industry committee structure was created under which an appropriate minimum wage for the island group woul d be developed administratively157 the industry committee structure was inte nded it appears to have been an interim measure while the insular econom progressed toward

certain aspects of hea lth care legislation the bill hr 4505 the health care incentive act was referred to the committee on education and the workforce and to the subcommittee on workforce protections under the issa bill the secretary of labor would be directed to promulgate rule requiring that any employer engaged in interstate commerce where federal or state law establishes minimum wage at rate that is higher than the minimum wage required by section 6a of the fair labor standards act of 1938 as in effect on september 1 1997 ie 515 per hour would be permitted in accordance with regulations promulgated by the secretar to count the value of creditable health care benefits provided by such employer to an employee in determining the wage such employer is required to pay an employee the secretary shall include contribution to health saving acc ount or similar account in determining creditable benefits and shall determine formula for minimum value of such benefits finally the bill provides the following in case shall the credit permitted by the rule promulgated under this section ex ceed the difference between the minimum wage under section 6a in effect on september 1 1997 and the wage rate otherwise applicable under the issa proposal the wage fl oor would be 515 per hour the rate payable under section 6a of the flsa on september 1 1997 any amount above that level whether under state or federa l law could be payable in the form of creditable benefits to be defined by the secret ary of labor but to include contribution to health savings account or similar account the credit for health care benefits could be substituted for any future increase in the cash minimum wage thus in effect the minimum wage coul d be capped at 515 per hour depending upon how the benefit package is assessed by th secretary the valu that is assigned to it and whether it is fully utilized
