shveras digital white area provisions in more detail this is the final edition of this report introduction the three most common methods by which consumers receive levision signals are broadcast cable and direct broadcast satellite dbs broadcast television is free to consumers who receive the signals via overt heair rooftop or rabbit ear antennas cable and dbs compete in the multichannel video programming distribution mvpd marketplace where providers offer p ackages of video and sometimes audio programming for monthly fee according to the federal communications commission fcc there are 107 million television households in the united states1 of those 88 subscribe to an mvpd service cable tv serves 75 of mvpd subscribers while dbs serves 22 the remainder use other mvpd services that are described in the fcc report cable and satellite offer greater programming choices and sometimes better signal quality than broadcast television but can be costly congress has fosteredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21768crs2 2 shvia is title i of the intellectual property and communications omnibus reform act of 1999 included in the fy2000 consolidated ppropriations act p l

independent broadcast stationscompetition in the mvpd market place partially in an attemp t to keep cable tv rates in check two major companies offer dbs services today directv subsidiary of news corp and echostar which ma rkets its service as dish tv another company rainbow dbs subsidiary of cablevision offers comparatively small number of satellite channels through service called voom background the satellite home viewer improvement act the 1999 satellite home viewer improvement act shvia2 extended and expanded upon provisions of the 1988 satellite home viewer act s hva as amended in 1994 in passing shva and shvia as well as the 1984 and 1992 cable acts3 congress has attempted to balance the interests of the broadcast sate llite and cable industries with the goal of ensuring that as many households as possible have access to free local television programming while expanding consumer choices in programming and service providers shva enacted in the early days of sate llite television allowe d satellite companies to retransmit broadcast netw ork and superstation progra mming only to households that could not receive viewa ble signals via overtheair antennas because they are too distant from the transmitters or in areas where tv signals are blocked by buildings or terrain formally called unserved hous eholds the limitation was designed to protect the nationwide system of broadcast network ffiliates which depend on advertising revenue based on their number of viewers the goal is to preserve localism where consumers can watch local news weather and communityoriented programs the availability of local programming is largely dependent on network affiliates which in turn are dependent on viewers under shva satellite compan ies could retransmit broadcast network programming only to unserved households so th majority of viewers would watch their local affiliate but the sma ll percentage of consumers in unserved households could also receive network programs even though they came from an outofmarket affiliate these outof market signals are called distant network signals shva created fiveyear com pulsory copyright license4 whereby satellite companies may retransmit distant networ k signals to unserved households without permission from the copyright owners and the government sets the price the satellite companies pay as copyright royalties the satellite companies pay the royalties to the copyright office of the library of congre ss which passes them on to the copyright owners similar compulsory copyright li cense was given to cable companies in 1976 although the cable license is permanent th satellite distant netw ork signal license is codified in 119 of the copyright act title 17 usc and was re newed for another fivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21768crs3 5 dmas are defined by nielsen media research which explains that dma consists of all counties whose largest viewing share is given to stations of that same market area httpwwwnielsenmediacomfaqdma_satellite20servicehtm 6 see fcc report fcc 00416 et docket n 0090 november 29 2000 http www fccgov bureausengineering_technologyorders2000 fcc00416doc for definition of grade b signalsyears in 1994 it was extended for further five years in shvia and is now set to expire on december 31 2004 shvia also exempts satellite companies from the requirement to obtain retransmission consent from broadcaste rs to rebroadcast distant network signals and that provision expi res on the same date shvia significantly expanded upon shva by allowing satellite companies to retransmit local broadcast network programming back into the same market area where it originated called localintolocal service the law permits but does not require satellite companies to offer localintolocal service shvia created royaltyfree compulsory copyright license fo r localintolocal satellite sign als that is codified in 122 of the copyright act and is permanent like the cable license according to their websites on november 30 2004 echostar offe red localintolocal in 160 of the 210 designated market areas dmas5 in the country and directv offered it in 130 dmas under shvia unserved households could recei ve distant network signals even if local intolocal service is offered in their area local versus distant network signals the distinction between local and distant network signals is important for unders tanding shvia local signal is received within broadcast network television affiliate s local market area distant network signal is from elsewhere in the country for example if consumer lives in denver and receives signal from denver network affiliate that is local signal if consumer lives in west virginia and receives sign from that denver network affiliate via satellite it is distant network signal eligibility for distant network signa ls white areas and grade b signals determining which consumers are eligible to receive distant network signals via satellite is complicated and is disc ussed is more deta il in crs report rs20425 generally only consumers livin g in unserved households where broadcast television reception is extremely poor or nonexistent may receive distant network signals via satellite unserved households colloquially known as white areas are defined based on the fccs grade b signal inte nsity standard cong ress mandated in shva that the grade b standard be used for this purpose and in shvia directed the fcc to review whether the grade b standard still should be used in 2000 the fcc concluded that it should6 computer models are used to mathematically pred ict which households can receive at least grade b signal if they cannot they are unserved for purposes of shvia in 1999 the fcc adopted an impr oved model called the individual location longelyrice illr to predict signal intens ity at specific households instead of in general area some satellite companies tran smitted distant network sign als to consumers who were not eligible to receive them leading to court challenges by the networks to try to force the satellite companies to obey the law on landmark case was 1998 ruling by miamihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21768crs4 7 cband dishes are the original large backya rd antennas the number of cband subscribers has declined from high of about 25 million in 1995 to less than 05 million at the end of 2003judge cbs broadcasting v primetime 24 joint venture 48 f supp2d 1342 sdfla 1998 under which over 2 million c onsumers reportedly had or were scheduled to have distant network signals terminated by their satellite companies that action was pending when congress debated shvia congress grandfathered those consumers who were receiving distant network signals illegally if th ey could not receive grade signal for new subscribers the original rules apply exceptions were made fo r recreational vehicles commercial trucks and consumers using cband satellite dishes7 in summary under shvia the following consumers could recei ve distant network signals until december 31 2004 if they do not receive signal of gr ade b intensity from the local affiliate of particular network if their satellite dish is installed on an rv or commercial truck or if they had been receiving distant network signals illegally and those signals were terminated or schedul ed to be terminated under the 1998 miami court ruling and they do not receive signal of grade intensity from the local affiliate of the network grandfathered subscribers consumers using cband dishes are not s ubject to the fiveyear limitation they may receive distant network signals they were receiving before oct ober 31 1999 indefinitely consumers who believe they cannot receive grade b signal despite predictive models showing that they can may request waiver see crs report rs20425 for more information on the waiver process the issue of who may receive distant network signals vi satellite remains controversial even with the advent of locali ntolocal service first distant network signals primarily serve consumers in the most rural parts of the country who also are likely to be in the dmas that do not yet receive localintolocal service from the dbs providers second some c onsumers want distant network signals not because of reception problems with their own local signals but because they want greater programming choices or to watch network programming airing at different times in the various us time zones key provisions of the 2004 satell ite home viewer extension and reauthorization act shvera on november 20 2004 congress passed the satellite home view er extension and reauthorization act shvera also known as the william j billy tauzin satellite television act as title ix division j of the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act hr 4818 pl 108447 that final vers ion was compromise between hr 4518 which passed the house on october 6 2004 and legislation that was pending in the senate hr 4518 l smith had been reported from the house judiciary committee hrept 108660 on september 7 2004 as passed it incorporated many of the provisions of hr 4501 upton which wa s reported from the house energy and commerce committee on july 22 hrept 108634 in the senate s 2013 hatch was reported amended from senate judiciary written report on june 17 and s 2644httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21768crs5 8 the retransmission consent exemption for distan t network signals also was due to expire but extending it was not contentiousensignmccain was reported amended from the senate commerce committee srept 108427 on december 7 neither b ill reached the senate floor extension of compulso ry copyright license the compulsory copyright license was the chief impetus behind consideration of shvera because it was due to expire on december 31 20048 certain satellite subscrib ers see bulleted list above would lose access to distant network signals if the license was not extended copyright owners often represented by the motion pi cture association of america mpaa object to the compulsory licenses they argue th at the cable and sate llite companies should be required to negotiate copyright royalties like everyone else prices for the cable and satellite compulsory licenses ar set by different methods nd on different cycles prices for the satellite license had st been set in 1997 as required by law the copyright office through copyright arbitration roya lty panel carp set price based on fair market value 27 cents per subscriber per ear for both distant network and superstation signals the satellite companies objected becau the prices were significant increase and much higher than what cable compan ies pay see crs report 98140 in shvia congress rolled the rates back by 45 fo r distant network signals and 30 for superstation signals the mpaa argued that if the distant network signal license was extended the royalty rates should be substa ntially increased and adjusted annually the copyright office wanted parity between the cable and satellite licenses and recommended that the satellite distant network signal license be renewed for five more years while both licenses were reexamined the satellite broadcasting and communications association sbca representing the dbs companies wanted the distant network signal license made permanent the national association of broa dcasters nab wanted the distant network signal license extended only for five years and limited to areas where localintolocal is not available the final version of shvera extended the license for another five years and allowed the parties to reach voluntary ag reement on the royalty rate if they cannot reach agreement the rate is to be set by carp process shvera also requires most subscribers to choose between calintolocal service or dist ant network signals if local intolocal is available in their area generally existing subscribers who are currently receiving distant network signals because they live in white areas not those who were grandfathered in shvia may continue to receive both distant and localintolocal signals other existing subscribers must c hoose one or the other new subscribers may not receive distant network signals once localintolocal is available in their area digital white areas to date white areas or unserved households have been defined based on the transmission of analog levision signals the broadcast television industry however is transitioning from analog to digital signals and eventually will cease transmitting analog signals see crs report rl31260 sbca and the digital transition coalition dtc want digital white areas to be defined similar to the existing analog white areas where satellite companies would be allowed to provide distant digital network signals to subscribers unable to receive local network digital signals terrestrially sbca and the dtc argue that allowing satellite tv companies to provide digital distant network signals to unserved households would s pur the broadcasters to convert to digitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21768crs6 more quickly the nab called sbcas propos recipe for misch ief disputing the assessment that broadcasters are moving sl owly on digital tv the final version of shvera contains complex wording about di gital white areas and both sides declared victory the details are explained in crs report rs21990 essen tially subscribers who are unserved for purposes of analog tv signal s and meet certain conditions regarding the availability of analog or digital localintolocal service will also be considered unserved for purposes of digital tv signals and receive distant digital signals other satellite tv subscribers may receive distant digital sign als only under very narro w circumstances that appear to minimize the numbe r of eligible households localintolocal issues more consumer choices including significantly viewed stations and echostars twodish policy as discussed earlier localintolocal allows satellite companies to retransmit local stations signal back into the dma from which it originated the use of dmas to define the areas into which particular signal can be retransmitted is mandated by shvia however dmas often cross state borders so consumer in one state may receive progra mming from another state when subscribing to localintolocal service also consumers within state that might have only one network tv station may not be eligible to receive that stations signal because based on dma boundaries it is distant network signal that the consumer is ineligible to receive because the consumer can receive grade b signal from station in neighboring state shvera pe rmits additional stations to be retransmitted to subscribers in certain states because of such factors subscribers in new hampshire are allowed to receive via sa tellite signals from the one netw ork station licensed in that state subscribers in vermont are allowed to receive the signals of any network station licensed in that state subscribers in four oregon counties umatilla grant malheur and wallowa that are in dmas principally com posed of counties in neighboring state are allowed to receive signal from any networ k station licensed in oregon subscribers in two adjacent mississippi counties wilkinson and amite that are in dma composed primarily of counties in another state are llowed to receive any network station from the state capital jackson shvera also allows satellite companies to retransmit outof market significantly viewed stations as explained in crs report rl32641 p 11 to be significantly viewed stations must meet threshold viewersh ip levels based on the number of overtheair viewers for network stations mark et share of at least 3 of total weekly viewing hours and net weekly ci rculation of 25 for independent stations 2 of total weekly viewing hours and net weekly circulation of 5 another issue was echostars policy that in some areas consumers must obtain second satellite dish to receive all their local programs that is because echostar uses satellites in different orbital locations to transmit the programming and separate antennas are needed to point toward the different satellites the nab and others complained that the practice is discriminatory because the ch annels for which the second dish is needed are primarily religious or fore ign language stations echos tar responded that there is cost for the second dish the channels all ppear on the tv program guide and special steps must be taken by the consumer to access those programs once the second dish is installed nonetheless shvera requires satellite companies to offer all local channels on single dish within 18 months of the laws enactment except that digital tv service signals and nondigital tv service si gnals may be on separate dishes
