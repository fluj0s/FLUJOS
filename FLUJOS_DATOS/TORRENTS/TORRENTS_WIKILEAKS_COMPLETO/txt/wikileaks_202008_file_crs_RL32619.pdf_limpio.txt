products as delivery devices for nicotine an addictive drug the agencys 1996 tobacco regulation was invalidated by the us supreme court in march 2000 the court concluded that c ongress had clearly intended to preclude fda from regulating tobacco products it found that because the ffdca prohibits the marketing of products that have not been found to be safe and effective the statute would have required fda to ban such manifestly harmful products as cigarettes and smokeless tobacco if the agency had jurisdiction over them such ban argued the court would plainly contradict congressional intent the supreme courts decision made it clear the c ongress would have to enact legislation giving fda statutory authority over tobacco products in order for the agency to assert jurisdiction

2007 representatives henry wa xman dca and tom davis rva and senators ted kennedy dma and john cornyn rtx introduced the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act hr 1108 s 625 on july 30 2008 the house passed hr 1108 by vote of 326102 the senate health education labor and pensions help committee approved s 625 by vote of 138 on august 1 2007 but the bill did not see floor action in the senate the two measures are broadl similar to each other and to legislation introduced in past congresses the legislation would create new chapter ix in the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca 1 giving the fda broad new authority to regulate the manufacture distribution advertising promotio n sale and use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco ie snuff and chewing tobacco in its 1996 final rule the food and drug administration fda had claimed jurisdiction over tobacco products under the ffdca based on its conclusion that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are delivery devices for nicotine an addictive drug however in 2000 the us supreme court invalidated the fda tobacco regula tion in 54 decision the court ruled in fda v brown williamson that fda does not have the authority under the ffdca to regulate cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products as drugdelivery devices2 the court based its ruling on the finding that congress has precluded the fda from asserting jurisdiction over tobacco products according to the court such authority would be inconsistent with the congressional intent clearly expressed in the ffdcas overall regulatory scheme and in other tobaccorelated legislation for example the court concluded th at if the fda asserted jurisdiction under the ffdca it would have choice but to prohibit the marketing of such harmful products ban on tobacco products argued the court would plainly contradict congressional policy which permits tobacco companies to market their products with limited oversight by the federal trade commission ftc in addition the court noted that congress had in enacting other tobacco specific legislation repeatedly rejected proposals to grant the fda authority over tobacco thereby demonstrating the intent to deny the agency such jurisdiction the supreme courts decision ended fouryear legal challenge by the tobacco industry to overturn the fda regulation the ruling made it clear that congress would have to enact legislation giving fda explicit statutory authority over tobacco products in order for the agency to assert jurisdiction lawmakers first drafted such language in the 105 th congress and included it in legislation that would have implemented the1 997 proposed national tobacco settlement that legislation was debated and rejected by the senate in 1998 following the supreme courts ruling several lawmakers introduced fda tobacco legislation in the 107 th congress without subsequent legislative action3 the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act was first introduced by representatives davis and waxman and senators dewine roh and kennedy in the 108th congress hr 4433 s 2461 its introduction fo llowed months of negotiations in which 1 21 usc 301 et seq 2 fda v brown williamson tobacco corp 529

of smokeless tobacco products4 the fda rule included three sets of provisions restrictions on the sale and distribution of tobacco products to minors limits on tobaccoproduct marketing and advertising and new labeling requirements for packaging and advertising see box on next page the agency said that the purpose of the rule was to reduce the easy access to tobacco products by minors it also hoped to reduce the amount of positive advertising imagery used by manufacturers to make their products appealing to minors while the rule did not directly address adult tobacco use data from the national survey on drug use and health nsduh suggest that over time it would help reduce adult tobacco consumption nsduh data indicate that most smokers take up the habit as teenagers thus reducing the number of new teenage smokers who are needed to replace adult smokers that quit or die is expected to lower overall tobacco consumption in the future 4 61 fed reg 4439645318 21 cfr parts 801 803 804 807 820

under the ffdca drug and device manufacturers must demonstrate that their products are both safe and effective in order to gain fda marketing approval the safety and effectiveness standard poses difficult challenge for regulating tobacco products which are manifestly unsafe when used as intended critics of fdas rule argued that in asserting regulatory authority over tobacco products the agency would have choice but to ban them because of their harmful and addictive effects in its rulemaking the fda conceded that tobacco products are unsafe as that term is generally understood but concluded that banning tobacco products was not realistic option because the health care system would be overwhelmed by more than 40 million nicotine addicts seeking assistance for withdrawal symptoms moreover the agency argued banning cigarettes would create an enormous black market which might lead to the use of unregulated and potentially even more dangerous products

tobacco by concluding that nicotine is drug and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are drugdelivery devices under the ffdcas definitions the statute defines drug in relevant part as articles other than food intended to affect the structure or any function of the body5 in its rulemaking the fda drew on the extensive scientific literature documenting nicotines pharmacologic effects on the body including satisfaction of addiction stimulati on and sedation the agency also concluded that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are devices that deliver nicotine into the body as with drugs the ffdcas definition of medical devices includes articles that are intended by the manufacturer to affect the structure and function of the body6 unlike drug however device is defined in part as an article which does not achieve its primary intended purpose through chemical action7 in the absence of direct claims by the manufacturers about the intended use of tobacco products the fda relied on other lines of evidence in order to meet this key definitional criterion for drugs and devices for example the agency considered evidence of foreseeability ie reasonable manufacturer would foresee that consumers will use the product to satisfy nicotine addiction and actual consumer use ie consumers use the product because they are addicted fda officials combed through thousands of pages of internal tobacco company documents before concluding that the manufacturers intended their products to be addictive having made the determination that tobacco products fall under the statutory definitions of drugs and devices the fda further concluded that these products are combination products since they have components that are both drug and devi ce under the ffdca the fda is authorized to regulate products that constitute combination of drug device or biologic product8 the agency has interpreted this provision as giving it the discretion to regulate combination products as drugs as devices or as biologic products 9 in its final rule the fda chose to regulate tobacco products under the device provisions of the ffdca because they offer the agency greater regulatory flexibility than do the drug provisions of the act10 the device authorities of the act present range of regulatory controls that apply to all devices the fda stated in its rule that these mandatory controls would apply to cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products they include among others adulteration and misbranding provisions labeling requirements establishment registration device listing and premarket notification recordkeeping and reporting requirements and good manufacturing practices the act also requires the agency to classify each device based upon the degree of risk it poses to the user as well as other regulatory concerns and unique qualities of the device the fda indicated in the final rule that it would classify cigarettes and smokeless tobacco as either class i ii or iii devices at some point in the future the agency further stated that when classification was determined it would impose any additional requirements that were appropriate 11 5 21 usc 321g1c ffdca 201g1c emphasis added 6 21 usc

discretionary provisions that apply to devices under certain circumstances the fda predicated its authority to regulate tobacco products on one such provision regarding restricted devices the acts restricted device provision states in relevant part that the cretary may by regulation require that device be restricted to sale distribution or use upon such other conditions as the secretary may prescribe in such regulation if because of its potentiality for harmful effect or the collateral measures necessary for its use the secretary determines that there cannot otherwise be reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness12 in the final tobacco rule the fda relied on the ffdcas restricted device provision when it concluded that because of the harmful effects of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in the absence of reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of such products it needed to implement additional restrictions on tobacco access and advertising in order to prevent new users from becoming addicted 13 as result the fda used its restricted device authority to limit youth access to tobacco products agency officials also concluded that the authority under the ffdcas restricted device provision was broad enough to permit the fda to restrict tobaccoproduct marketing and advertising it reasoned that without advertising restrictions the access restrictions would be substantially diminished if manufacturers were free to entice children and adolescents to circumvent the access restrictions14

and sought summary judgment on the grounds that the fda lacked the authority to regulate tobacco products when such products are marketed and sold without explicit claims of therapeutic benefit the lawsuit further charged that the fda exceeded its statutory authority because the ffdca does not authorize the fda to regulate tobacco products as drugs or devices 15 finally the companies argued that

court of appeals for the fourth circuit overturned the lower courts decision and ruled th at the fda lacked the statutory authority to regulate tobacco products18 the court held that the decision to regulate cigarettes as restricted device rather than as drug in order to avoid having to ban them was obvious sophistry which reinforces the conclusion that regulation of tobacco products under the act was not intended by congress 19 the courts decision was stayed pending further appeal on november 10 1998 in 63 decision the full appellate court rejected the administrations request to reconsider the ruling20 the justice department filed petition for writ of certiorari with the us supreme court on january 19 1999 requesting that the court review the fourth circuit ruling and find that the fda

decision written by justice sandra day oconnor affirmed the ruling of the appeals cour t that the fda does not have the authority to regulate tobacco products as drugdelivery devices21 although the majority opinion acknowledged the public health threat posed by t obacco use the court concluded that congress has clearly precluded the fda from asserting jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products such authority is inconsistent with the intent that congress has expressed in the ffdcas overall regulatory scheme and in the tobaccospecific legislation that it has enacted subsequent to the ffdca22

in chevron the court enunciated twostep test for judicial review of an agencys interpretation of its statute 1 has congress spoken directly to the precise question at issue and 2 if congress has not done so and the statute is silent or ambiguous with respec t to the specific issue is the agencys answer based on permissible construction of the statute24 under chevron step one if congress has spoken directly to the question at issue then chevron deference is not due and the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress25 in this case the court examined both th ffdca and other tobaccorelated statutes ultimately concluding that congress had clearly intended to preclude the fda from regulating tobacco as result the court did not need to reach step two of chevron in reaching its decision the court relied on number of factors first the court found that because tobacco is dangerous product and because the ffdca prohibits the marketing of products that have not been found to be safe and effective the statute would require the fda to ban tobacco products if the agency did indeed have jurisdiction over such products such ban argued the court would plainly contradict the congressional intent reflected in the enactment of several pieces of legislation that clearly contemplate the continued marketing of tobacco products 26 thus the court held that congress had clearly intende d to exclude tobacco products from the fdas jurisdiction27 in addition the court found that the fda had repeatedly denied that it had jurisdiction over tobacco and that congress had repeatedly rejected bills that would have granted the agency such authority28 instead congress had demonstrated its intent to create distinct regulatory scheme for tobacco by enacting other tobaccorelated regulatory statutes such as the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act and the comprehensive smokeless tobacco health education act 29 the court cited these tobaccorelated statutes as additional evidence in support of its conclusion that congress had intended to preclude the fda from regulating tobacco30 writing in dissent justice stephen breyer argued that cigarettes and other tobacco products clearly fall within the plain meaning of the stat utory definition of drugs and devices because such products are intended to affect the structure and function of the body

products for these reasons the dissent would have upheld the fdas jurisdiction over such products31 the supreme courts decision clarifies that the fda cannot assert jurisdiction over cigarettes and

attorneys general announced that they had reached an agreement with the tobacco companies to settle the state tobacco lawsuits32 fortyone states and puerto rico had sued the tobacco industry seeking to recover the costs primarily medicaid expenditures of treating smokingrelated diseases under the proposed national settlement the industry agreed to pay 3685 billion over the first 25 years and 15 billion year thereafter to reimburse states for their tobaccorelated medical costs and pay for tobaccocontrol programs to reduce tobacco use among teenagers in addition to settling the state lawsuits the proposed settlement would have terminated all pending cla ssaction lawsuits and nicotine addiction claims and provided the companies with immunity from such lawsuits in the future the proposed settlement incorporated all the provisions of the fda tobacco rule and included additional restrictions on marketing and advertising as well as new warning labels it also proposed amending the ffdca to classify tobacco products as class ii devices and give fda the authority to reduce or eliminate harmful compounds added to tobacco products or found in smoke summary of the key provisions in the pr oposed national settlement is provided in the box on the next page public health officials criticized the restrictions the proposed settlement would have placed on fdas ability to regulate nicotine for example any proposal by the agency to reduce nicotine yields or eliminate other harmful ingredients in cigarettes would have required formal rulemaking with judicial review instead of the informal noticeandcomment rulemaking that is typically used by federal agencies to promulgate regulations formal rulemaking which is seldom used today involves trialtype hearings before an administrative judge at which parties present evidence and conduct crossexaminations it is rigorous and lengthy process that places considerable burden of proof on the agency 33 the fda also would have been required to show 31 id at 16164 32 the full text of the june 1997 proposed national tob acco settlement is available on line at httpwwwsticneuedu settlement620settlehtm 33 most federal regulations are issued under the noticeandcomment procedure established by the administrative procedure act 5 usc 551 et seq the agency publishes notice of proposed rulemaking in the federal register solicits public comment and incorporates in the final rule concise statement about the rules basis and purpose courts review such rules under the arbitrary capricious and abuse of discretion standard generally upholding an agencys action if it is found to be rational based on consideration of the relevant factors and within the scope of the authority designated to the agency by congress formal rulemaking by contrast is more rigorous and timeconsuming process that tends to place greater burden of proof on the agency promulgating the rule under the proposed national settlement the fda would have had to show substantial evidence in support of its cigarette performance standards which is more stringent standard than the arbitrary capricious and abuse of discretion standard

tobacco bill although the measure was intended to implement the proposed national settlement it was tougher on the industry in several key respects s 1415 would have cost the companies 516 billion over the first 25 years an amount significantly higher than the figure agreed to in the proposed settlement ie 3685 billion it included stiffer financial penalties if the decline in underage tobacco use did not meet the reduction targets and it also provided the industry with fewer legal protections than those negotiated in the june 1997 agreement the mccain bill also added new chapter ix to the ffdca solely for the regulation of tobacco products that language which was provided by senator frist drew extensively on the acts existing drug and device provisions in chapter v but with modifications 35 by establishing new legal authority within the ffdca for regulating t obacco products the bills sponsors sought to address the unique challenges tobacco products present and avoid the safety and effectiveness standard that applies to the regulation of drug s and devices under the new language fda would be required to demonstrate that any proposed tobacco regulation was appropriate for the protection of public health such determinati on would involve consideration of the risks and benefits to the population as whole the tobacco companies opposed s 1415 and launched 40 million advertising campaign that helped defeat it they portrayed the legislation as nothing more than massive tax increase to pay for new government spending during the senate floor debate which stretched over four weeks may 18june 17 1998 lawmakers focused on where the bills revenues should go how to compensate tobacco growers and whether to limit the fees of private attorneys who were retained by the states amendments were added to the bill to eliminate the socalled marriage income tax penalty boost funding for antidrug programs and cap attorneys fees there was debate on the bills fda provisions public health officials supported many of the mc cain bills tobaccocontrol provisions but were critical of the measures fda provisions they feared that the agencys attempts to implement the new law would be blocked at every turn by leng thy legal challenges from the industry instead they sided with the fdas arguments for assert ing jurisdiction under existing law ie ffdcas chapter v device provisions in its rulemaking the agency concluded that the device provisions which have been interpreted in case law regulation and agency practice for over two decades have established comprehensive regulatory scheme that is appropriate for regulating tobacco products several other comprehensive tobacco bills were introduced in the 105 th congress though none of them saw any legislative activity36 the bills which were supported by the public health community and opposed by the industry would have given fda explicit authority to regulate tobacco products under the ffdcas chapter v drug and device provisions in each case the legislation amended the acts definitions of drugs and devices to include nicotine and tobacco products respectively and authorized the agency to regulate tobacco products using standard of 35 the frist language incorporated with modifications the following ffdca drug and device provisions adulterated drugs and devices 501 misbranded drugs and devices

in the 107th congress none of which saw any legislative action four bills ie s 190 frist s 2626 kennedy s 2764 miller and hr 2180 tom davis adopted the same approach as the mccain legislation they would have created new ffdca chapter ix solely for the regulation of tobacco products senator kennedys bill s 2626 was almost identical to the fda provisions in the mccain bill the three other bills included many of the same provisions however they contained few small but significant changes that were intended to address industry concerns over the extent of fdas regulatory control for example all three measures specified that fda could not compel the industry to change the composition of its products in ways that would render them unacceptable for adult consumption they also required the agency to show that any proposal to restrict the sale distribution advertising and promotion of tobacco products was based on determination that such regulation would be appropriate for the prevention of or decrease in the use of tobacco products by children finally all three measures reserved for congressnot fda the authority to eliminate nicotine or ban tobacco products in addition to giving fda new regulatory authority over tobacco products hr 2180 also contained restrictions on youth access advertising and marketing that were broadly similar to those included in the mccain bill the provisions in hr 2180 were subsequently incorporated into representative mcintyres bill hr 3940 to eliminate tobacco quotas and the price support loan program and compensate quota owners and active growers s 2764 also contained substantially similar buyout provisions the three remaining fda tobacco bills introduced in the 107 th congress ie s 247 harkin hr 1044 waxman and hr 1097 ganske rather than creating new legal authority for regulating tobacco products would have given fda the authority to regulate tobacco products as drugdelivery devices under chapter v of the ffdca this approach was favored by some public health advocates but strongly opposed by the industry as with the earlier versions introduced during the 105 th congress each of these bills merely amended the definitions of drugs and devices to include nicotine and tobacco products respectively and specified that tobacco regulation would be based on general standard of protecting the public health additionally the three measures would have made effective all the provisions of the 1996 fda tobacco rule httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32619g8g6g3g561 g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561
