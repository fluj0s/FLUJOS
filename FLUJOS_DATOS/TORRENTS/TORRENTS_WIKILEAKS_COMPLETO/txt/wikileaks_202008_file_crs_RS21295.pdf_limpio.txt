addition to the davisbacon act its elf congress has added prevailing wage provisions to approximately fi ftyseven statutes that provi financial assistance for construction projects through grants ans

relief and emergency assistance act the federal statute that authorizes the federal emergency management agency fema to provide funds for the repair and reconstruction of facilities following major disaster and for construction related to emergency preparedness also includes prevailing wage provision12 section 611j8 of the stafford act requires the payment of locally prevailing wages to laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects related to emergency preparedness13 however section 611j8 does not apply to repa ir or reconstruction projects involving state or local public facilities private nonprofit fac ilities and owneroccupied priv ate residences following major disaster14 opponents of section 194 maintain that if the senate homeland security proposal was enacted locally prevailing wa ges would be required for laborers and mechanics that work on these kinds of projects15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21295crs4 15 continued 22 2002 the legislation would require

fiscal year 1995 budget request is made in section 197c of the senate proposal 19 the basis for finding disaster relief constructi on to require the payment of locally prevailing continuedwhile construction that satisfies the thr ee davisbacon conditions would be covered by the davisbacon act itself other construction would not require the payment of locally prevailing wages unless related act imposes coverage for example construction on an owneroccupied private reside nce occurring after major disaster and funded with assistance provided under the stafford act would not require the payment of locally prevailing wages such cons truction would not involve the united states or the district of columbia as party to the contract fo r construction in addition section 611j8 of the stafford act applies only to constructi on projects related to emergency preparedness and not disaster relief projects thus s ection 194 or similar provision would be needed if congress wanted to require the payment of locally prevailing wages on disaster relief projects the stafford act appears to be th only related act to involve either an agency or program that would be tr ansferred to the proposed depa rtment of homeland security homeland security the senate homeland security proposal pr ovides for the transfer of twentytwo agencies and programs to new department of homeland security16 fema the us coast guard and the animal and plant health inspection service are among the entities that would be transferred s ection 186 of the senate proposal provides for the transfer of assets unexpended bala nces of appropriations authoriz ations and allocations to the secretary of homeland security for appropriate allocation17 funding for fiscal year 2004 would be provided pursuant to budget request submitted by the president for the department18 opponents of section 194 seem to belie ve that by providing for the transfer of unexpended balances of ppropriations and authorizations and because future funding for the transferred agencies and programs w ould appear to flow from budget requests for the department disaster relief construction woul d be financed in whole or in part with assistance received under this act subject to the pr evailing wage requirement19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21295crs5 19 continued wages pursuant to section 194 does not appear to have been articulated by the administration the associated builders and contractors or an other organization however the most likely argument for finding requirement to pay locally prevailing wages would seem

debate regarding new homeland security employees continuedthe operative language of section 194 woul d seem to be assistance received under this act the us supreme court has observe d that statutory construction must begin with the language employed by congress nd the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose20 the ordinary meaning of the verb receive is to come into possession of or to acquire21 here it could be argued that funding for disaster relief proj ects would be acquired following the transfers prescribed by the senate proposal and as re sult of future budget requests however an alternate argument may be available the senate proposal authorizes appropria tions for at least two new programs section 135d provides for the creation of an acceleration fund to support research and the development of technologies relevant to homeland security22 the proposal authorizes to be appropriated 200000000 for the fund for fi scal year 2003 and such sums as are necessary in subsequent fiscal years section 153 establishes the emergency preparedness enhancement pilot program23 under the program the department shall award grants to private entities to pay for the federal sh are of the cost of improving emergency preparedness and educating employees and other individuals using the entities facilities about emergency preparedness24 the proposal authorizes to be appropriated 5000000 for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2005 it may be argued that section 194 applies only to construction undertaken in relation to these new programs such construction would be financed with assistance acquired under the proposal in this case with funds specifically authorized by the act sec tion 194 would seem to ensure that locally prevailing wages are paid to laborers and mechanics that work on these projects whether section 194 is meant to apply to all construction recei ving funds under the proposal including construction funded thr ough transfers of authorizations and unexpended appropriations or simply to construction related to programs specifically authorized by the proposal is not clear the ordinary meaning of th verb receive would suggest the payment of not less than locally prevailing wages on all construction projects so long as assistance was somehow acqui red under the proposal senator joseph i lieberman sponsor of the sena proposal is reported to have said that the proposal requires prevailing wages for construction workers so long as federal money is spent on substantial renovation projects25 it is not clear how much construction would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21295crs6 25 continued daily lab rep bna july 30 2002 at a7undertaken to further the objectives of the acceleration fund or the emergency preparedness enhancement pilot program further if locally prevailing wages were to be paid only on construction projects related to the new programs alternate language could have been used sec tion 194 could have specified c onstruction work financed in whole or in part with assistance authorized under the act rather than assistance received under the act because the senate proposal was amende d at business meetings of the senate committee on governmental affairs and not during proceeding where formal report would be prepared there is explanatory nguage to assist with interpreting section 194 if section 194 is meant to apply only to construction related to the new programs authorized by the proposal language that speci fies the use of assistance authorized by the proposal may be appropriate
