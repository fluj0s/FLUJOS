staffed by some 100000 employees usda is responsible for many activities outside of the agriculture budget func tion hence spending for usda is not synonymous with spending for farm progra ms similarly agriculture appropriations bills are not limited to usda and include re lated programs such as the food and drug administration and the commodity futures trading commission but exclude the forest service within usda usda gross outlays for fy2005 were estimated to be 1005 billion including regular and supplemental spending the mission area with the largest gross

million 05 mandatory vs discretionary spending key distinction between mandatory nd discretionary spending involves how these two categories of spending are tr eated in the budget process congress generally controls spending on mandatory programs by setting rules for eligibility benefit formulas and other parameters rather than pproving specific dollar amounts for these programs each year eligibility fo r mandatory programs is usually written into authorizing law and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law spending for discretionary programs is controlle d by annual appropriations acts the subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees originate bills each year that decide how much funding to devote to continuing current activities as well as any new discretionary programs approximately 80 of total spending within the usda is classified as mandatory which by definition occurs out side of annual appr opriations the vast majority of usdas mandatory spending is for the following programs the food stamp program and most child nutrition pr ograms the farm commodity price and income support programs including ongoi ng programs authorized by the 2002 farm bill and emergency programs authorized by various appropriations acts the federal crop insurance program and various agricu ltural conservation nd trade programs although these programs have mandatory status many of these accounts ultimately receive funds in the annual agriculture appropr iations act for example the food stamp and child nutrition programs are funded by an annual appropriation based on projected spending needs suppl emental appropriations generally are made if these estimates fall short of required spending an nnual appropriation also is made to reimburse the commodity credit corporation for losses in financing the commodity support programs and the va rious other programs it finances the other 20 of the usda budget is fo r discretionary programs which with the exception of the forest service are f unded in the agriculture appropriations act forest service programs are funded in th interior appropriations act major discretionary programs within usda include forest service programs certain conservation programs most rural development programs research and education programs

the 2002 farm bill p l 107171 and is funded through usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the ccc is wholly owned government corporation it has the legal authority to borrow up to 30 billion at any one time from the us treasury these borrowed f unds are used to finance spending for ongoing programs such as farm commod ity price and income support activities and various conservation trade and rura l development programs emergency supplemental spending also has been paid from the ccc over the years particularly for ad hoc farm disaster payments and direct market loss payments to growers of various commodities in response to low farm commodity prices the ccc eventually must repay the funds it borrows from the treasury because the ccc never earns more than it spends its losses must be replenished periodically through cong ressional appropriati on so that its 30 billion borrowing authority debt limit is not depleted congress generally provides this infusion through the annual usda appropr iation law because most of this spending rises or falls automatically on econo mic or weather conditions funding needs are sometimes difficult to estimate in recent years the ccc has received current indefinite appropriation which pr ovides such sums as are nece ssary during the fiscal year pl 10997 provides the ccc with an indefinite appropriation such sums as necessary for fy2006 timated

rate policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insurance companies that have their program losses re insured by usda the annua l agriculture appropriations bill traditionally makes two separate appropriations for the federal crop insurance program it provides discre tionary funding for the salari and expenses of the rma it also provides such sums as are nece ssary for the federal crop insurance fund which pays all other expenses of the program including premium subsidies indemnity payments and reimbursements to the private insurance companies pl 10997 concurs with the

billion that was estimated for fy2005 at the time of enactment of the fy2005 appropriations bill annual spending on the crop insurance program is difficult to predict in advance and is dependent on

human variant and microbial hazards such as salmonella opponents of the ban have expressed concern about the integrity of bse surveillance if these animals are longer brought to slaughter and have questioned the scientific basis of the ban in light of its economic impacts some within the industry have further argued that us das downer ban should distinguish between animals that cannot walk
