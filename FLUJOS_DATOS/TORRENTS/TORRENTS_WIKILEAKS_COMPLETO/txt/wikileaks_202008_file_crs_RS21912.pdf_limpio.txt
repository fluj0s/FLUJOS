past several years directv has been engaged in an aggressive campaign to prevent the theft and piracy of its satellite television signal one element of this campaign has been to bring civil lawsuits against individuals who possess certain devices that apparently can be used to intercept satellite transmissions directv has brought these lawsuits primarily pursuant to the civil remedies section of the elec tronic communications piracy act wiretap act arguing that the statute allows them to bring civil suit for any violation of the wiretap act numerous defendants to these suits have responded by arguing that directvs use of this civil remedy is inappropriate because the act does not provide the statutory authority to bring civil lawsuit for violations of other sections of the wiretap act rather they contend that the civil remedy is limited to the speciﬁc violations listed in the statute this argument has been met with inconsistent results among the federal district courts that have ruled on its merits recently the eleventh circuit court of appeals became the ﬁrst federal court of appeals to address this speciﬁc issue holding that the plain language of the wiretap act does not

circum vent their encryption system for the purpose of viewing directv s signal without payment this can be accomplished according to directv by either procuring pirate access devices from private nondirectv affiliated companie s or developing th em independently4 to combat the illegal pirating of its signal directv has targeted consumers that it alleges have intentionally intercepted or ndeavored to intercept directvs transmission in violation of the electronic communi cations privacy act wiretap act5 the wiretap act contains numerous provisions several of which are relevant to these proceedings first section 25111a prohibits both the interception and atte mpted interception of wire oral or elect ronic communications6 in addition section 25121a of the wiretap act forbids the manufacture assembling distribution possession and advertising of wire oral or electronic communica tion intercepting devices if the person knows or has reason to know that the primary purpose of the devi ce is the pirating of such communications7 finally section 2520a of the wiretap ac t provides the following civil remedy in general except as provided in section 25112aii any person whose wire oral or electronic communication is interc epted disclosed or intentionally used in violation of this chapter may in civil action recover from the person or entity other than the united states which engaged in that violation such relief as may be appropriate8 directv has consistently argued that th civil remedy provided in section 2520a creates private right of ac tion for violations of secti ons 25111 and 25121b and therefore it can pursue these indi vidual defendants in federal court9 numerous defendants have asserted that the civil remedy section does not create private right of action against persons simply in possession of pirate access devices to date this question has produced inconsistent results several federal dist rict courts either expressly or implicitly have held that section 2520a does create private right of action10 whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21912crs3 10 continued v karpinsky 274 fsupp2d 918 919 ed mich2003 directv inc v dougherty 2003 us dist lexis 23654 at

the first federal court of appeals decision on the merits of directvs arguments the eleventh circuit ruling directv inc v treworgy in this case directv had brought an ac tion against mike treworgy for allegedly possessing and using specific pirate access vices to steal directvs satellite signal12 directv argued that mr treworgys posse ssion of these devices was in violation of sections 25111 and 25121b and that pursu ant to section 2520a it had the statutory right to bring private civil action agai nst him for money damages mr treworgy responded by arguing that section 2520a di d not create private right of action for directv and therefore the complaint should be dismissed the district court agreed with mr treworgy and granted partial motion to dismiss13 in defense of its position before the eleven th circuit directv made three distinct arguments first it contended that the re fact that its communications have been intercepted affords it the right to sue for violations of the wiretap act this right exists according to directv regardless of whethe r particular defe ndant actually committed any interception14 second directv attempted to argue that because congress specifically excluded only certain violations of the wiretap act as basis for civil liability any other violation of the wiretap act gives them the right to sue pursuant to section 2520a15 finally directv asserted that the existence of private right of action better effectuates the purpose of the wiretap act by encouraging private parties to aid in the acts enforcement16 the eleventh circuit began its analysis with review of the plain language of the statutes in question according to the court section 2520a clearly defines victims as the persons whose communication is intercepted or intentionally used and the offenders ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21912crs4 17 id at 1126 18 id at 1126 19 id at 1127 citing lujan v defenders of wildlife 504 us 555 560 1992 20 id citing vt agency of natural re s v united

2001 24 id at 1126the persons or entities engaged in the violation17 conversely section 25121b provides for criminal punishment simply for engaging in the trafficking of interception devices and is silent with respect to the availability of civil remedies thus the plain language of the statute makes clear that it was the intent of congress to limit liability to certain class of defendants18 responding directly to directvs interpretation of section 2520a the court pointed out that such reading of the statute would potentially create constitutional problems given that the federal courts ar courts of limited jurisdiction according to the court it is difficult to see how directv could establish case or controversy and invoke the jurisdiction of the court without an allegation that the wrongdoer against whom directv seeks relief actually injured or directly threatened to injure directv19 therefore the court was requi red by controlling precedent to avoid construction of the statute that raised potential constitutional issues20 with respect to directvs second argument the court again referred to the plain meaning of the statute and pointed out that the exception provided by section 25112aii21 is limited to interceptions that assist law enforcement and in way expands the scope of the availa ble civil remedy relying on flowers v tandy corp fourth circuit decision holding that under pr evious version of section 2520a there was private right of action for violations of other wiretap act secti ons the court was able to point to nothing in either the new streamlined statutory language or the legislative history that requires differe nt reading of the statute22 finally the court addr essed directvs final argument regarding the need for private enforcement of the statute and its effectiveness as an enforcement tool as the court clearly points out this argument contains basic flaw namely that courts may not create private right of action matter how desirable that might be as policy matter or how compatible with the statute because that is determination congress alone can make23 although the decision by the eleventh circuit is controlling precedent for only alabama florida and georgia the ruling nevertheless potentially deals blow to directvs overall litigation strategy according to the court directv represented that it had approximately 1800 cases pending in the fe deral district courts of florida alone and hundreds more in various fede ral courts around the country24 while it is far from certain that courts outside the eleventh circuit will adopt the reasoning of this opinion thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21912crs5 25 see eg benefit authors without limiting adva ncement or net consumer expectations balance act of 2003 hr 1066 108th cong

on the availability and scope of private right of action pursuant to section 2520a of the wiretap act in addition to further judicial action congress could undertake revision of the statute clearly providing in the text that such right of action exists for any and all violations of the wiretap act while there are numerous bills currently pending before congress relating to both the pirating of intellectual property and electronic communications25 at this time there does not appear to be any legislative proposals that expand the private right of acti on afforded by the wiretap act
