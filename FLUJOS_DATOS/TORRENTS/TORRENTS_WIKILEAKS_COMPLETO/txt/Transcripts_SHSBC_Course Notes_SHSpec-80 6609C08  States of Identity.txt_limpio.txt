6609c08 shspec80 states of identity apparently there is boundary beyond which you dont have thetans you have endowment of form with life the little things that wiggle for instance the amoeba or the cell is endowed an ot comes along and says let there be chicken he leaves puddle of theta to animate it this is the concept of how bodies are built there is some truth in the idea that talking to flowers makes them grow better way back someplace the thetan probably did something like this the green thumb phenomenon is perhaps lowerscale harmonic of this there do seem to be people with green thetan other natural abilities of thetans sometimes get preserved in or by individuals in an outofcontrol state so you get telekinesis telepathy child geniuses etc jung had trouble with poltergeists actually he was subject to form of belowawareness telekinesis some skills that are on automatic will temporarily vanish in the course of clearing suddenly you find that you cant do it anymore but when it comes back it is you doing it instead of machine or something jung went into only one past life that of the english druids anything wrong with thetan is lower harmonic of that he can do higher up on the scale when that goes wrong his ability on it goes into an inversion or goes out of his control and still happens in his vicinity as with jung and puzzles him it is just little facet of his ability that has been brought down with him and not yet eaten up boy wonders tend to fold up because they dont know that they are doing it it is not under their control the musical child prodigy has probably been good musician in the near past as you go upscale you tend to lose circuits if we exempt endowed states of wiggle we can find out how far down in the fifth dynamic thetan can go the answer is someplace in the insect or animal kingdom above that you get thetans below that wiggle sometimes you run into horse who is thetan and sometimes you run into one that isnt or bee who was and bee who wasnt when nothing much is required of an animal or insect you can get survival as just piece of automatic machinery unchanging in habit pattern etc it is shadow of thetan because thetan made it you occasionally find vegetables in the human race bodies without thetans maybe sometimes some thetan picks up the body and it changes spectacularly body can survive although not well without thetan when it has been totally guided by thetan and the thetan leaves the body isnt on any automatic functioning and it wont do well also if thetan caves body in the body wont do well body will only get as good as you take away what is caving the body in most mammalian bodies live six times as long as it takes them to grow up thus mans lifespan should go to 110120 years the reason why it doesnt is that the human body is driven by thetan an aberrated thetan causes sick body thetan with service fac is quite capable of keeping body from getting well as society becomes more aberrated it becomes more sick one form of endowed life may destroy another form so it shouldnt upset you that you can cure up the thetan and the body doesnt get well there are variety of illnesses that body suffers from because it is being messed up by thetan who with his intention and aberration is influencing his physical body that body will get as well as you relieve the aberration of the thetan in those sectors where the thetan is causing the body to get sick therefore dont assume that all that is wrong with the body is the mind but in addition to the effects of the thetan on the body there is also different seement of illness caused by endowed life units that are designedly contrary to the bodys life units eg disease germs parasites worms etc then there is physical injury if you hit body with battering ram it doesnt matter what state the thetan is in the body is going to go splash if body is badly guided it is smashed often so you can reduce this category of bodily ills by fixing up the thetan so that he has fewer accidents however some accident is pretty inevitable in an uncleared environment another factor is the repairing ability of the being if one were really upscale as thetan he could patch up or repair the body directly or he could mock up new one lower scale manifestation the thetan stops knocking the body about upper scale manifestation the thetan can put the body back together again so there are three sectors of attack on body 1 endowed life attacking the endowed life of the body 2 aberration of the thetan influencing the body 3 mechanical damage to the body this would include chemical damage poisons lack of air etc and there are three basic means of cure 1 the thetan can repair the body directly 2 you can use beneficial endowed life units as in antibiotics to help the body 3 you can repair the body mechanically as with surgery here you can repair damage or misplaced parts eg from faulty construction of the body or cut out endowed life forms infected tissue or cancerous tissue that attack the endowed life of the body chemical repair could be in this category also eg antidotes oxygen water etc therefore to assume that you can cure everything with auditing is as silly as to assume that you can cure fear of spiders by means of neurosurgery beings do tend to an allness cureall propensity as long as you are not able to endow matter with life you have to settle for what youve got you have to live with the body youve got or do without one so you have to decade whether you are looking at 1 endowed life forms countering each other 2 pure mechanical injury 3 something the thetan is doing to the body you are better off in the last sphere the first two need to be handled in an emergency but the thetan is quite capable of preventing body from recovering eg with service fac so auditing can act as before or after adjunct to the handling of 1 or 2 above you could make thetan less susceptible to 1 or 2 and you could come along after the fact and speed up healing to the degree that the thetan was preventing it from happening your only mistake is to run the incident while it is still going on treat it first and dont get into an allness about auditing and its healing effects the mechanism of miracles using religious relics or tokens eg saints knuckle bone is restimulation of the curative abilities of thetan if they existed that is the thetans idea of his own power is restimulated by demonstrating that there is power somewhere nut this is mental intervention faith healing restores momentarily thetans ot ability to do something with the body it has drawbacks since every now and then when body was endowed by thetan when thetan b comes along and puts some life into it it will get sicker some faith healers have not lost the ability to endow life or change the life endowment of body you can look around the eyes and get the stars that you can see surrounding them these are little gold balls throw them away and put in your own and you can get sicker bodies dont like having their anchor points messed around with or exchanged to complete the experiment throw your gold balls away and get the other ones back there are many things that man didnt know about beingness or life therefore he made fantastic mistakes dont make these mistakes recognize mans limitations relative to this recognize also that they are not your limitations but that they are mans therefore you need an understanding of states of beingness cavedin thetan is on reverse he is totally the unknowing effect of his own cause anything he can do is being done but he is not doing it he has lost some of his ability to have even that happen he is totally gone so estimate how far down he can go he can go down to being the effect of the effect of the effect etc of himself but this is way beyond his reality so dont expect him to got any reality on how he is doing it when you get body animated by thetan as opposed to having body that is merely endowed you go into fringe that is well below being oneself or being conscious one is sort of automatically awake automatically existing with responsibility for being alive awake or existing just below that you get unconsciousness below where he has clue that he is conscious you are getting down to the lower dregs of thetanhood and the upper strata of the human race the thetan conceives that he is body endowed life and more he is removed something he is an identity body he can be picked up rapidly from there to the state of grade 0 release quite distance grade 0 release is less the effect of causes but he is not up to causative alertness he is awake or groggy on an effect basis as he improves he gets to be less the effect both of his own cause and of others cause guy who is really low down on cause is the effect of anything that occurs anywhere he worries about train wrecks 8000 miles away he could go downscale from that point so that he doesnt worry anymore because he doesnt exist and isnt worth anything so it doesnt matter what he is the effect of he can go down below that into faith i have an automatic regulator of my destiny so i dont have to be alert or be concerned about anything because something somewhere is taking care of this isnt necessarily connected with religion people will mock this state up for themselves without even knowing that they are doing it at this point the thetan is totally irresponsible going downscale from there he goes into sort of numbness further release from responsibility below this he is subject to any number of automaticities which if triggered would produce total certifiable insanity the majority of the human face is about quarter of an inch above that that is why many people dont listen to you their state of beingness isnt up to it you must keep the above in mind when asking wog to look at responsibility an individual asked to look at his mind as cause or an effect can get into such anxiety instead of looking into himself that he goes frenziedly mad say that we were in an arena someone let in tiger and you said to joe jump over the railing and deal with the tiger he would think that you were joking at first but if you tried to force him over the railing you would have fighting screaming person on your hands who would be liable to say most anything so it is with the sp when you get him to look at his mind eg to look at breakfast sps arent trying to disprove scientology there is doubt in their minds that you could make them do things and the thought terrifies them the sp thinks that you are likely to drive him mad sps think that they are public benefactors who are discrediting scientology so that people wont have to look at their minds an sp is below being able to be the effect of anything even an automaticity so when you bring him upscale the first thing he has to confront that he might possibly be the effect of is the mind and he goes sting he goes bit insane sps are below the level of insanity so they have to come up through band of insanity cf rd laings idea that the path to sanity is through insanity they are below the level of being the effect of anything good or bad any effect is bad so they have to be an automatic thing cause that has an automatic effect actually they are and aing with an endowed self your presence however can bring them upscale you can be up to the point where your ability to endow is on automatic and you get guys twitching around you when you get to ot that comes under control there has always been way up and road out but it hasnt been pursued because philosophers are thoughtful types they are noted for being reasonable and getting themselves martyred but few stand up strongly when the firing squad marches down the street voltaire got reasonable breakthrough like this isnt scholarly affair it has to be done with here goes nothing attitude to follow up on scientology person would either have to be very reassured in very quiet environment for considerable period of time if the person was pretty bad off ie normal he would have to be calmed down before he could confront something the percent of people who can confront is the upper one percent of the planet when you have the ability to confront it is possible that you could exert enough influence on the environment possible is horrible understatement to calm it down to point where he could confront and disenturbulate it enough to make gains to handle the insane you go down to what he can confront being still in still environment with one worrying him with one solid stable object you could let him disenturbulate in this environment the psychotic doesnt have engrams that make him insane he is insane because his ability to confront the environment in his immediate vicinity is so low that he could never possibly take his mind off his environment long enough to look at his mind it is too dangerous just as your super sp screams when you tell him to confront his mind the psychotic screams when you tell him to confront the environment hence quiet environment is the only cure for insanity insanity is study of environments its not study of the mind there is reason to audit the insane at all when the environment is very safe and the individual is longer actively insane then on very light gradient you could get him to confront the mind scientologys problem is not the problem of making one ot if clears have trouble communicating with wogs ots have even more trouble you could endow crippled boys leg with life and heal it this would be ok unless you tried to explain what happened possibly he would come upscale to faith but he would be more likely to go into terror than into faith your main line is the improvement of the being who is willing to be improved doing this you will get enough improved beings to handle the problems in society that must be handled to snap the society out of being insane you dont want to lift people up by faith though but by hope the hope that maybe some day they could do something about it first you give him the hope that you can do something for him or about it then that he can do something about himself and it then the small hopes materialize states of beingness that man will recognize do include saints gods miracle men and messiahs all sorts of beings because man is familiar with superman batman etc he tends to attribute these characteristics to anything that is step forward for man in the past they would have attributed the characteristics of saints to scientologists in greek society it would have been the characteristics of gods man is capable of conceiving of such beings as long as they are unreal and exterior they are ok if looked at through holy book or something what man can conceive and what man can confront are two different things catholic priest professes belief in supernatural phenomena but what would he do it christs hand suddenly appeared disembodied and started turning the pages of his breviary similarly what being can conceive he can become and what he can confront being there is gap between these two things we need further definition to distinguish clears and ots clear has lost the matter energy space and time connected with thing called the mind he is not an allknowing being he moves up through becoming cause over the matter energy space and time of his mind an ot is being who is knowing and willing cause over life thought matter energy space and time that definition doesnt say mind life includes endowed cells not only or necessarily other thetans the ot may or may not be able to handle another thetan but he can handle this commodity called life so there is big gap between clear and ot clear makes nottooaberrated human being almost fly into pieces this happens to minority of people but it does give an element of fear connected with clears you are making people confront something that is somehow little bit within their ken you will not find them tracing the source of it it isnt bad for them if they sat around long enough they would run out all the pictures clear puts normal people at effect without trying to do thing he just has sufficient zone of beingness that what falls into that zone is liable to be asised or go into some sort of action sometimes people fear clears little and dont quite know why they feel that way they dont necessarily associate the feeling with the clear even grade iv release can be so much calmer and more at cause than the environment that his presence can be therapeutic so as you come downscale to grade iv release they stand out rather remarkably and they are still little bit out of reach as you go downscale from there you get person who is more able to disseminate because he more closely matches the reality level of the rest of the environment as you go down the release stages you get closer and closer to an ability to influence another without causing mess directly immediately understandably and without restimulation the bridge stays in as gradient for dissemination even the book one clear was looked upon with considerable awe bodhi is probably below dianetic release it is stable for from two seconds to two years but buddhisms promise to make bodhi was enough to civilize three fourths of asia having moved out of the reality of wogs the scientologist tends to compare himself with other scientologists he is unaware of his state of beingness until he is surrounded by wogs that makes him somewhat unhappy in the company of wogs as you go up towards clear this is less true if you go out in the wog world as clear they dont spot you as source you tend to produce certain phenomena you give the impression of being in command even when you dont do anything to command people will say i have to concentrate to talk to you or you have such command of the situation when nothing is being commanded you dont bother to use this mainly life becomes easier the pity of these states of beingness is that there is limit to what one being can do for another you can do lot but you cant live anothers life for him what you can do is 1 provide safe environment 2 show way methodology 3 provide for the ethical application or administration of methodology 4 give advice 5 pervade the environment with calmness 6 mock up new leg for crippled boy but that is the limit the rest is up to the other guy unless you lead the person to increase his own beingness he will never arrive this is the point that has been missed in all prior attempts to better man the only miraculous intervention there is or ever will be comes from the person himself he must overcome the terror of becoming the effect he must be led upwards by an unenturbulated environment to destimulate enough so that he can put his own feet on the road out and walk you can help him only with those first steps helping the individual is the only way to help humanity out
