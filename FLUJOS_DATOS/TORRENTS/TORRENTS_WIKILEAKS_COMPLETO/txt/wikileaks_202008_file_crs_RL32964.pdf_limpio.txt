value of usowned assets abroad and foreignowned assets in the united states measured on an annual basis at the end of the calendar year some observers refer to the net of this investment position or the differen ce between the value of usowned assets abroad and the value of foreignowned ssets in the united states as debt or indicate that the united states is in net debtor position because the value of foreignowned assets in the united states is greater than the value of usowned assets abroad in fact the nations intern ational investment position is not measure of the nations indebtedness similar to the debt borrowed by some developing countries but it is an accounting of assets by yearend 2007 the latest year for which data are available the overseas assets of us residents totaled approximately 17 trillion while foreigners had acquired about 20 trillion in assets in the united states with direct investment measured at historical cost as result the us net international

diffe rent methods for valuing dir ect investments that yield roughly comparable estimates for the ne t position although the three methods do provide estimates on us direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment that can be considerably different at times valuing investments the department of commerce provi des updated estimate s on the nations international investment position each year typically in july based on data for the previous year through the end of the calenda r year except for direct investment all of the accounts in the international inves tment position are estimate d directly by the department of commerces bureau of economic analysis bea relative to readily observable market prices for exampl the value of positions in portfolio investments securities gold loans currencies and bank deposits can be directly estimated by the bea based on the face va lues or market prices of recent transactions estimating the value of direct investments however presents number of challenges according to the department of commerce these challenges arise because foreign direct investments typi cally represent illiquid ownership interests in companies that may possess many unique attributes such as customer base management and ownership of intangible assets whose values in the current period are difficult to determine because there is widely accepted standard for revaluing company financial statements at historical cost into prices of the current period2 as result the department of commerce estimates the us international investment position in three ways reflec ting three different accounting methods for estimating the value of direct investments historical cost current cost and market value initially direct investments are valued at historical cost or the cost at the time of the investment this historical cost value can become outdated because it is not updated to account for changes in the value of an investment through appreciation or through internal growth and expansion or through changes in various intangible assets the current cost approach estimates the value of capital equipment and land at their current replacement cost using general cost indexes and inventories using estimates of their replacement cost rather than at their historical cost the third measure market value uses indexes of st ock market prices to revalue the owners equity share of direct investment for the most part the current cost and historical cost estimates have tracked closely together for us direct investment abroad and for foreign direct investment in the united states as indicated in figures 1 and 2 respectively these two measures of direct investment demonstrate steady increase in the value of the investments over the 26year period fro m 1982 to 2007 the market value estimatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32964crs4 of direct investment however displays markedly different pattern these estimates spiked during the rapid runup in stock mark et values in the 1990s and then dropped sharply when market values declined at the end of the 1990s the market value estimates rose sharply again in 2003 th rough 2007 as the rebound in stock market values pushed up the estimated market value of firms as result the market value of us direct investment abroad wa s estimated at 51 trillion in 2007 pushing the overall us position to 195

position for current cost timate since the early 1980s the annual value of foreign direct investment in the united states has been greater at times than the annual value of us direct investment abroad but the accumulated value of us direct investment abroad or the positi on has continuously been valued higher investment patterns foreign direct investment in us bus inesses surged in the mid1980s and has at times outpaced the annual amount of us direct investment abroad for various reasons us direct investment abroad nd foreign direct investment in the united states have tended to track together so that the annual flows increase or decrease somewhat in tandem3 except in 2005 when us direct investment abroad dropped sharply as us parent firm s reduced the amount of reinve sted earnings going to their foreign affiliates for distribution to the us parent firms in order to take advantage of onetime tax provisions in the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108 357 between 2001 and 2006 us direct investment outflows have been greater than similar inflows as whole however foreign investment among all us assets has been greater than u s investment abroad which has tende d to push the net us international investme nt position further into negative position this is not the first time in the nations history that the us net international investment position has been negative early in the nations history as the united states made the transition from being developing economy to being major economic superpower foreign investment flowed into capital development projects such as railroad and canal construction which aided the westward expansion and th development of heavy industries by 1920 foreigners had withdrawn many of their assets from the united states to finance world war i which turned the united states into net creditor this net creditor position grew unabated after worl d war ii and into the 1980s when large inflows of foreign investment once again turned the nation into net international investment debtor the us net debtor status continued to grow through the 1990s and into the 2000s as indicated by figure 3 by yearend 2007 us assets abroad are estimated to have reached 171 trillion while fore ign owned assets in the united states reached 198 trillion as result the us net international i nvestment position was estimated at negative 28 trillion or equi valent to about 19 of us gross domestic product marking substantial increase in the relative size of the net investment debt position over the previous decade as indicated in table 2 the net investment position worsened by over 250 billion during 2007 with direct investment measured at historical cost according to the two other measures for direct investment current cost and market value the net investment position was valued at about negative 24 trillion and 17 trillion respectively httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32964crs6 table 2 us international investment status billions of dollars usowned

assets and as the value of existing assets appreciates these assets are broadly divi ded into official and private investments reflecting transactions by governments among themselves and transactions among the public at times some observers ve been concerned about the amount of foreign official investment in the us economy particularly in us treasury securities and more recently purchases of us businesses by foreign governments as figure 4 indicates official asset holdings were valued at about 33 trillion in 2007 or about 16 of the total foreign inve stment position share that has remained relatively stable over the 15year peri od of 1 993 through 2007 official assets include such monetary reserve assets as gold the reserve position with the international monetary fund imf and hol dings of foreign currency an important component of foreign official holdings in th united states is the acquisitions of us treasury securities by foreign governments at times such acquisitions are used by foreign governments either through coordinated actions or by themselves to affect the foreign exchange price of the dollar foreign currency holdings account for relatively small share of the to tal foreign investment position private asset holdings are comprised primar ily of direct inves tment in businesses and real estate purchases of publicly trad ed government securities and corporate stocks and bonds as indicated in figure 5 the composition of us assets abroad and foreignowned assets in the united states is different in number of ways the strength and uniqueness of the us treas ury securities markets make these assets sought after by both official and private foreign investor s whereas us investors hold few foreign government securities as result foreign official assets in the united states far outweigh us official assets abroad both foreign private and1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 20060246810121416trillions of dollars foreign official assets foreign private assets source

jacksoninternational investment sources and economic impact international investment not only has an impact on the us economy but it is affected by the economy for us inve stors foreign markets provide them with opportunities to seek out the greatest returns for their investments returns which are repatriated back to the united states in addition us direct investment abroad for the most part tends to stimulate us exports which in turn stimulates the most productive sectors of the economy5 us direct investment abroad is highly sought after by developing countries which want the capital not only to supplement their own limited domestic sources but they so want american technology and expertise foreign capital inflows augment domestic us sources of capital which in turn keep us interest rates lower than they would be without the foreign capital indeed economists generally argue that it is this interplay between the demand for and the supply of credit in the economy that drives the broad inflows and outflows of capital as us demands for capital outstrip domestic sources of funds domestic interest rates rise relative to those abroad which tends to draw capital away from other countries to the united states the united states also has benefitted from surplus of saving over investment in many areas of the world that has pr ovided supply of funds this surplus of saving has been available to the united states because foreigners have remained willing to loan that saving to the united states in the form of acquiring us assets which have accommodated the growing curre nt account deficits over the past decade the united states expe rienced decline in its rate of savings and an increase in the rate of domestic investment as indicated in table 3 the large increase in the nations current account deficit would not have been possible without the accommodating inflows of foreign capital as table 3 indicates compared with the 19942001 period us saving in 2007 declined by 34 of gross domestic produc t gdp while investment increased by 08 of gdp this shift toward greater investment relative to saving was accommodated by an increase worldwide in saving relative to investment among other advanced economies and the newly industrialized economies in asia both saving and investment declined in 2007 relative to the 19942001 period but investment declined more as share of gdp than did saving so in relative terms saving increased as share of gdp in the emerging developing economies the developing economies of asia which includes china and the middle east saving as share of gdp increased faster and in some cases much faster than did investment which also increased in most of these areas the large inflows of foreign capital to the united states likely aris from the relatively more robust economic growth that occurred in the united states compared with almost any other area the welldeveloped us financial system and the overa ll stability of the us

inflows also allow the united states to finance its trade deficit because foreigners are willing to lend to the united states in the form of exchanging the sale of goods represented by us imports for such us assets as stocks bonds and us treasury securities such inflows however put upward pressure on the dollar which tends to push up the price of us ex ports relative to its imports and reduce the overall level of exports furt hermore foreign investment in the us economy drains off some of the income earned on the fo reignowned assets that otherwise would accrue to the us economy as foreign

and payments in 2007 the united states received 900 billion in income receipts including receipts on royalties on its investments abroad and paid out 761 billion in income payments including payments on royalties on foreignowned ssets in the united states for net surplus of 139 billion in income receipts6 this surplus has varied over time as rising interest rates increases payments to foreign investors on such assets as treasury securities and corporate bonds7 as the annual amount of foreign investment in the us economy continues to exceed the amount of us i nvestment abroad it seems inevitable that us payments on foreignow ned assets will exceed us receipts net outflow of income payments would act as drag on the national economy as us national income is reduced by the net amount of f unds that are channeled abroad to foreign investors one of the positive areas of the income accounts is the income receipts the united states receives on us direct inve stments abroad although the historical cost value of us direct i nvestment abroad and foreign di rect investment in the us are roughly equal the united states earne d 234 billion more on its direct investment assets abroad in 2007 than foreigners ear ned on their direct investments in this country as indicated in figure 6 as indicated previously in 2005 us parent firms reduced the amount of reinvested earning s going to their foreign affiliates for distribution to the us parent firms in order to take advantage of onetime tax provisions in the american jobs cr eation act of 2004 pl 108357 the department of commerce has analyzed data on direct investment to determine the source of the low rate of return of foreign direct investment relative to us direct investment abroad8 this analysis concluded that the gap in the rate of return between usowned enterprises abroad nd foreignowned enterprises in the united states is narrowing over time and seems to be related to the age of the investment or that as foreigners investments mature the rate of return of the assets approaches that of us direct investment abroad the us net surplus of income receipts arising from direct investments was offset to large extent by large net income payments to foreign holders of us government securities which grew by 22 to 165 billion in 2007 up from the 135 billion it r eceived in 2006 the overall us income surplus was increased further by the income payments made to us hol ders of foreign corporate stocks and bonds the united states received 444 billion in income from the corporate stocks and bonds americans owned abroad and paid out over 427 billion to foreign holders of us corporate securities for net infl ow of 178 billion in income receipts on such assets in addition the united states received 82 billion in

response despite expressing concerns at times about the us net inte rnational investment position members of congress ge nerally have been reluctant to intervene in the investment process whether

position continues to turn more negative prospects increase that th positive us net income receipts will turn negative as us income payments overwhelm us income receipts in such case the us economy

continues to import large amounts of foreign capital some observers are also concerned about the growing role foreign investment is playing in the economy by bridging the gap between domestic sources and demands for credit one chief consideration is how the capital is being used investment funds that are flowing into di rect investment and into corporate stocks and bonds presumably are being used to bol ster investments in plant and equipment and other investments that aid in corporat productivity over the long run as such those investments may well pr ovide boost to us economic growth well into the future foreign investment in us treasury securities directly aid in financing the federal governments budget deficits and indirectly eas the federal governments demands on domestic credit markets wh ich assists us firms and consumer consumption by freeing up capital in the economy and by relieving some of the pressure on domestic interest rates one growing concern among some policymakers is the rising amount of investment by foreign governments in u s businesses real estate and portfolio assets corporate stocks and bonds and us government securities such investments by foreign governments are bol stered by the growing holdings of us currency by foreign governments known as sovereign wealth funds which are estimated to amount to more than 25 trillion11 us policy toward foreign investment generally has been one of acceptance and openness investments by foreign governments however are viewed by some as new and different kind of investment that bears greater scrutiny ch investments by foreign governments are viewed by some as contrary to longsta nding us policies wh ich have encouraged foreign governments to shift away from ow ning businesses enterp rises and to support private ownership for some observers investments by foreign governments also raise the potential for official interference into broad range of market activities there is evidence to date that owners hip of various us assets by foreign governments by itself has affected the ma nagement of those assets or the markets in which they exist in ways that differ from ownership by private foreign entities nevertheless such concerns likely helped motivate congress to pass and president bush to sign on july 26 2007 pl 11049 the foreign inves tment and national security act of 2007 which increases c ongressional oversight over acquisitions of us businesses by foreign governments some observers contend that sharp decline in capital inflows or sudden withdrawal of foreign capital from the economy could spark financial crisis congress likely would find itself embroiled in any such financial crisis through its direct role in conducting fiscal policy nd in its indirect role in the conduct of monetary policy through its supervisor responsibility over the federal reserve such coordinated withdrawal seems high ly unlikely particularly since the vast majority of the investors are private tities that presumably would find it difficult to coordinate withdrawal short of fi nancial crisis events that cause foreign investors to curtail or limit their purchases of us securities likely would complicatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32964crs15 efforts to finance budget deficits in the current environment without such foreign actions having an impact on us interest rates domestic
