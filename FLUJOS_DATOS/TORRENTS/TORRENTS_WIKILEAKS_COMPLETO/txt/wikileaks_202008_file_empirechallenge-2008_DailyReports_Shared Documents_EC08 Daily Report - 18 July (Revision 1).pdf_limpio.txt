issues in china lake and australia unable to fully test the network and software applications at all this week canadian army task force victory location ecr pocs major keith laughton personnel 43 personnel with issues to report activities summary of planned activities sensor deployment limited by road conditions testing training and interoperability confirmation continued significant issue cfe link is being put in this afternoon imagery products products collected limited due to deployment restrictions summary success all canadian client systems demonstrating at least minimal interoperability lessons learned observations for bug fixes and future development continue where help is needed cfe link remains outstanding issue additional comment we appreciate all the host nation

activities support dib federation across the ddte enterprise function as tped node for u2 and global hawk missions test dcgs 102 ingest capabilit ies of other available imagery from additional platforms during ec08 significant issue dib federation is only par tially complete continue to work through compatibility issues with the different di b versions spread amongst the ddte nodes imagery products products collected nitf and mpg data from the dib nodes successfully federated with at this point summary success worked directly with the joint isr managers regarding site exploitation capabilities have better understanding of how the tped is being managed down to the node level due to this interaction additional comment we learned today that ipl is not the primary means of imint dissemination to support exploitation we should now expect to retrieve mission imagery through dib federation dcgsn location dcgsn integration and development lab spawar system center charleston sc pocs tk quigley personnel 8 personnel with issues to report activities summary of planned activities complete repairs required to get our ipl working verify our aggregator is able to reach the ipl web service rebuild content server aggregator and adapters and verify communications with ipl and dib as well as portal interface validate external user access to the wiki significant issue need user names and passw ords to access portals of other ddte nodes summary successes completed all planned activities accessed portals of nine sites arranged usernames and passwords for four sites attempted federated search on all four obtaining search results on two downloaded product from dcgsa v30 at ft monmouth dhmodia humint team mivg location michelson labs echo range pocs john grant matt leclaire bert newton personnel 3 personnel with issues to report activities summary of planned activities participate in humint source meet ambus h and capture scenario on echo range to set up ttl system test and assessments and possible personnel recovery mission continue to make access to mivg data on cfe coi ddte available to all on those networks imagery products products collected mivg collect of ambush imagery quality digital ip cameras are posing image quality issues summary successes participated in humint source meet ambus h and capture scenario on echo range to set up ttl system test and assessments and possible personnel recovery mission updated mivg data on cfe to allow tracking on google earth while viewing in geoviewer lesson learned digital ip cameras on mivg can be problematic based on the constant bright sunshine environment of echo range gbs cfblnet project diamond location jaric and digby pocs bill craig andy mcaleer flt lt neil towers personnel 13 personnel with issues

sent over night from jitchuachuca to resolve latency issue at danville summary lesson learned for ec09 need to do fu ll equipment and software rehearsal at home station to facilitate analysis pilot location naws china lake pocs john bordner personnel 16 personnel with issues to report activities summary of planned activities there were airborne collectors flying so very light activity exploitation systems were using archived im agery and the motion imagery standards board personnel had time to further their collection efforts with respect to ground sensors significant issues the captured imagery from general atomics king air was deemed restricted to us eyes only be the general atomics legal staff this now prevents us from loading the imager on the cfe network where the majority of the tools lie the one tool in particular that is on t he ddte requires metadata fields which the king air video lacks it will be of limited value there imagery products airborne collectors were available summary success because of the light workload furt her progress was made with the collaboration efforts between fame and both vpc and majiic initiatives lesson learned we had reconfirmation that time gained on slow work day can be fruitfully used to further cooperation and b rainstorming new ttps and technical solutions between different initiatives where help is needed there is preliminary indication from general atomics that their contract to support ec08 may be in jeopardy with that and the recent real ization of the us only caveat to their output an alternative predator or predatorsurrogate video source should be found the best option may be to reopen dialog with the us navy mq9 squadron and procure tapes from their nigh training sorties in north range pstb

scenarios with wami imagery products products collected product were made for bluegrass scenario note these are not released as they do not r eally pertain to the scenarios being conducted at china lake and would probably just cause confusion summary success completed mission for today lesson learned there are couple of astor cgs compatibility issues that needed to be worked out astor seems to have buffer downloadty pe problem onboard the aircraft and cgs seems to drop some of the data once received the army jitc team is investigating along with their british counterparts raf 5ac sqn 56r
