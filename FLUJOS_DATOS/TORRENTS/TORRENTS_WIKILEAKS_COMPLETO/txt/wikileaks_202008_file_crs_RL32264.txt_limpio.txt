philip d winters analyst in government finance government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress the budget for fiscal year 2005 summary the deficit for fiscal year fy 2005 was 318 billion 26 of gross domestic product gdp below most earlier proposals and estimates from the administration congress and the congressional budget office cbo and smaller than the fy2004 deficit of 412 billion 36 of gdp the presidents original budget for fy2005 in february 2004 proposed deficit of 364 billion estimates from july and august 2005 expected deficit of between 333 billion and 341 billion larger than expected receipts rather than lower spending produced the reduction in the deficit the presidents original fy2005 budget february 2004 included among many policy proposals extending and making permanent many of the tax cuts adopted in 2001 and 2003 on may 12 2004 the administration requested an additional 25 billion for the ongoing operations in afghanistan and iraq the budget did not include estimates for the cost of the war on terror beyond fy2004 provided limited information on the costs of extending the tax cuts past fy2009 which is the period in which most of their budget effects would occur and did not propose providing relief from the expanding coverage of the alternative minimum tax amt after fy2005 the congressional budget offices cbo january 2004 budget report for fy2005 the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20052014 provided an fy2005 baseline deficit estimate of 362 billion cbos report provided estimates of the costs of selected alternative policies measured from the baseline such as estimates of the cost of extending the tax cuts reforming the amt and alternative assumptions about discretionary spending growth in march 2004 cbo released its estimates of the administrations proposals using cbos underlying assumptions and budget estimating methods these produced deficit of 358 billion in fy2005 falling to 258 billion in fy2009 by extending the effect of the administrations policies past fy2009 the estimated deficit would climb slightly after fy2010 moving to 284 billion in fy2014 the lack of congressionally passed budget resolution for fy2005 in 2004 added procedural hurdles to resolving already existing policy disputes and further slowed the passage of the annual appropriations congress needed several continuing resolutions on appropriations to complete its work on the fy2005 appropriations in the second of two afterelection sessions with only four of the 13 regular appropriations

analysis presidents generally submit their budget proposals for the upcoming fiscal year fy early in each calendar year the bush administration released its fy2005 budget the budget of the us government fiscal year 2005 on february 2 2004 the multiple volumes contained general and specific descriptions of the administrations policy proposals and expectations for the budget for fy2005 through fy2009 it contained limited information on the revenue and mandatory spending changes after 2009 and section on longterm fiscal issues facing the nation the full set of budget documents budget appendix analytical perspectives historical tables among several others contains extensive and detailed budget information including estimates of the budget without the proposed policy changes current service baseline estimates historical budget data detailed budget authority outlay and receipt data selected analysis of specific budget related topics and the administrations economic forecast in addition to its presentation of the administrations proposals the budget documents are an annual reference source for federal budget information including enacted appropriations the administrations annual budget submission is followed by congressional action on the budget this usually includes the annual budget resolution appropriations and possibly reconciliation bill or bills as required by the budget resolution over the course of deliberation on the budget the administration often revises its original proposals as it interacts with congress and as conditions change in the economy and the world the current situation fy2005 ended on september 30 2005 the treasury released actual budget data for fy2005 in midoctober 2005 unexpectedly higher receipts reduced the deficit below previously expected levels for fy2005 the deficit was 3185 billion receipts were 21533 billion and outlays were 24718 billion as shares of gross domestic product gdp the deficit was 26 of gdp receipts were 175 of gdp and outlays were 201 of gdp these numbers may be revised as more data become available the presidents original budget for fy2005 from february 2004 proposed deficit of 364 billion

current services baseline current service baseline estimates that follow the deficit control act directions for producing baselines csb current services baseline differences in totals result from differing underlying economic technical and budgetestimating assumptions and techniques used by omb and cbo as well as differences in policy assumptions often the policygenerated dollar differences among the estimates for an upcoming fiscal year may be relatively small compared crs3 to the budget as whole these small differences can grow over time sometimes substantially producing widely divergent future budget paths budget estimates should be expected to change over time from those originally proposed or estimated by the president cbo or congress budget estimates and proposals cbos first budget report for fy2005 the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20052014 outlook january 2004 contained baseline estimates and projections for fy2004 through fy20141 the report estimated an fy2005 deficit of 362 billion down from an estimated at that time deficit of 477 billion in fy2004 the actual deficit for fy2004 was 412 billion by fy2009 the baseline deficit estimate had fallen to 268 billion under the baseline assumptions the cbo estimates increased discretionary spending at the rate of inflation expected the tax cuts to expire as scheduled and allowed the alternative minimum tax amt relief to expire as scheduled which would then boost receipts the report also under baseline assumptions had the budget in deficit through fy2013 16 billion the baseline estimates produced small surplus 13 billion in fy2014 the reduction in the deficit after calendar year 2010 leading to the small surplus was largely explained by the scheduled expiration of major tax cuts after calendar 2010 producing large increase in revenues cbos budget reports generally include the estimated budgetary costs including higher or lower debt service costs of selected policies not included in the baseline estimates these alternative policies have included the cost of extending expiring tax provisions in cbos january 2005 report this would increase the fiveyear cumulative deficit by 103 billion and the 10year cumulative deficit by 14 trillion reforming the alternative minimum tax 147 billion fiveyear cumulative increase in the deficit and 430 billion cumulative increase over 10years it provided several alternative assumptions about the growth rate of discretionary spending including defense that ranged from freeze in appropriations 184 billion cumulative fiveyear decrease in the deficit and cumulative 10 trillion decrease in the deficit to increasing discretionary spending at the growth rate of gross domestic product gdp 236 billion fiveyear cumulative increase in the deficit and 13 trillion 10year cumulative increase president bushs fy2005 february 2004 budget called for extending and making permanent large number of the tax cuts adopted in 2001 and 2003 the treasurys estimates at that time of the tax proposals produced 213 billion revenue reduction from administration baseline estimates between fy2005 and 1 baseline estimates are not meant to be predictions of future budget outcomes but instead are designed to provide neutral measure against which to compare proposed policy changes in general they project current policy into the future discretionary spending is increased by the rate of inflation their construction generally follows instructions in the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 dca and the congressional control and impoundment act of 1974 crs4 fy2009 and 1240 billion revenue reduction between fy2005 and fy2014 most of the cost of extending the tax cuts would fall on the budget after fy2009 the administration modified its presentation of the current services baseline estimates instead of following the traditional method of constructing baseline estimates as set out in the balanced budget and deficit control act of 1985 and the congressional control and impoundment act of 1974 the administrations fy2005 current services baseline assumed the extension of certain tax provisions that by current law are scheduled to expire excluded the future cost of one time events such as fy2004 emergency funding and included timing adjustment to the calculation of federal pay increases for fy2005 the administrations modified current services deficit estimate was 33 billion smaller than the traditional baseline estimate by fy2009 the administrations modified estimated baseline deficit was 60 billion smaller than the traditional baseline deficit estimate the administrations budget provided minimum amount of information beyond fy2009 the budget did include estimates of the cumulative proposed revenue changes and proposed mandatory spending changes for the periods fy2005 through fy2009 and fy2005 through fy2014 but little other information for the individual years after fy2009 in march 2004 cbo released revised baseline estimates including 1 billion increase to 363 billion in the expected deficit for fy2005 the revised projections also had deficit of 15 billion in fy2014 instead of the surplus expected in the january estimates the cbo september 2004 revisions had smaller 348 billion fy2005 baseline deficit estimate and larger fy2014 baseline deficit 65 billion estimate than its previous estimates the administration provided revised estimates of the presidents budget in the midsession review july 30 2004 in general the revisions showed improvement in the budget outlook with smaller deficits recovery in receipts and somewhat higher outlays through fy2009 the net increase in estimated receipts between the january and july reports came from changes in underlying economic assumptions and technical reestimates rather than any substantial changes in policy most of the increase in outlays between the two estimates came from changes in policy in january 2005 cbo included revised baseline budget estimates for fy2005 in its budget report the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20062015 the report had revised fy2005 baseline deficit 368 billion that was similar to the baseline deficit estimate 362 billion that cbo had made year earlier in january 2004 the presidents fy2006 budget request february 2005 contained revised and reestimated fy2005 budget data including larger deficit estimate for fy2005 427 billion than it had shown in its july 2004 midyear report 331 billion the proposed policy changes combined with changes in underlying assumptions produced smaller receipts larger outlays and larger deficit for fy2005 than in the administrations previous estimates the presidents fy2006 budget included the estimated effects of his proposed defense supplemental for the fy2005 budget cbos analysis march 2005 of the presidents fy2006 budget proposals produced crs5 smaller fy2005 deficit 394 billion smaller outlays and similar receipts to those in the administration forecast see table 1 the administrations midsession review msr july 2005 and cbos budget and economic outlook an update update august 15 2005 included smaller deficit estimates than in their respective budget reports released earlier in 2005 omb reduced its fy2005 deficit estimate to 333 billion 27 of gdp from the 427 billion 35 of gdp deficit estimate in february 2005 cbos fy2005 deficit estimate fell to 331 billion 27 of gdp from its march 2005 baseline deficit estimate of 365 billion 30 of gdp the reduction in the deficit estimates resulted from higherthanexpected receipts in 2005 that did not result from policy change the administration expected the higher receipts to persist in slightly diminishing amounts throughout its five year forecast period cbo expects the higher receipts to diminish fairly rapidly over the next several years and have little longterm effect on the budget the cause of the higher receipts remains somewhat uncertain additional data that are not yet available are needed to determine the cause of the higher receipts once the cause is known whether the higher receipts are temporary or persistent will also likely be known uncertainty in budget projections all budget estimates and projections are inherently uncertain their dependence on assumptions that are themselves subject to substantial variation over short time periods makes budget estimates and projections susceptible to fairly rapid and dramatic changes2 information in appendix the uncertainties of budget projections of cbos budget report the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20052014 january 2004 indicated how greatly the budget outcome can be altered especially over time in this case over five years by changes in economic and the related technical factors that underpin the budget estimates cbo included but not separately discussion of uncertainty in its january 2005 budget report the chapter contains discussion of optimistic and pessimistic alternative scenarios for cbos baseline projection the optimistic scenario assumes more favorable economic and budget conditions than the baseline while the pessimistic scenario assumes less favorable conditions than the baseline cbo estimated that the 10year cumulative optimistic and pessimistic baseline surpluses or deficits would be 8 trillion apart according to cbo twothirds of the growth in the difference occurs in the last five years of the estimates figure 1 is from cbos january 2005 budget and economic outlook 2 some things are known with certainty about the direction of future spending and receipts demographics can partly determine the shape of future budgets in the next decade the beginnings of the retirement of the baby boom generation will rapidly increase the spending for social security and medicare as well as other federal spending or tax breaks for the elderly because virtually all those who will become eligible for these benefits are alive today estimating the growth in the populations eligible for these programs is relatively straightforward crs6 it shows the most likely deficit or surplus outcomes clustered in the center in the darkest part of the figure the lightest gray represents the less likely outcomes cbo predicts that the deficit or surplus will have 90 chance of falling somewhere between the top and bottom of the fan over the five years covered the presidents fy2005 february 2004 budget also included information on budget uncertainty in the chapter comparison of actual to estimated totals in the analytical perspectives volume of the budget the administration used budget data from fy1982 to fy2003 to produce statistical measures of the differences between the estimated and actual surpluses or deficits over these years according to the administrations february 2004 calculations there would be 90 chance that the fy2009 budget will have deficit or surplus that would fall within 500 billion above or below the administrations then currently estimated deficit for that year this produced range of outcomes from deficit of approximately 740 billion to surplus of approximately 260 billion within which the deficit or surplus has 90 chance of falling budget projections are very dependent on the underlying assumptions about the direction of the economy and expected future government policy and how these interact along with other factors such as changing demographics that affect the budget any deviation from the assumptions used in the budget estimates such as faster or slower economic growth higher or lower inflation differences from the expected or proposed spending and tax policies or changes in the technical components of the budget models can have substantial effects on moving the eventual budget outcomes away from the previous budget estimates and projections figure 1 uncertainty in cbos projections of the surplus or deficit under current policies deficit or surplus as percentage of gdp source chart created by cbo from the budget and economic outlook fy2006fy2015 january 2005 p 11 note this figure calculated on the basis of cbos forecasting track record shows the estimated likelihood of alternative projections of the budget deficit or surplus under current policies the baseline projections described in this chapter fall in the middle of the darkest area of the figure under the assumption that tax and spending policies will not change the probability is 10 that actual crs7 deficits or surpluses will fall in the darkest area and 90 that they will fall within the whole shaded area actual deficits or surpluses will be affected by legislation enacted in future years including decisions about discretionary spending the effects of future legislation are not reflected in this figure budget action cbo and the administration released their first budget reports for fy2005 in late january and early february 2004 cbos report provided baseline estimates for fiscal years 2004 through 2014 ombs documents provided proposals and estimates for fy2004 through fy2009 with few instances of cumulative estimates for fiscal years 2004 through fy2014 these were limited to revenues and mandatory spending and provided data for the individual fiscal years after fy2009 the budget also lacked detailed data on program or account spending beyond fy2005 the analytical perspectives volume of the presidents budget provided the administrations current services baseline estimates for the years through fy2009 on march 8 2004 cbo released its estimates of the presidents proposals and slightly revised its own baseline estimates in the report an analysis of the presidents budgetary proposals for fiscal year 2005 the report recalculated the administrations proposals using cbos underlying assumptions and estimating techniques cbo also extended its projections of the administrations proposals through fy2014 the cbo reestimates produced smaller deficits in fy2004 and fy2005 than in the presidents budget by late february and early march 2004 the house and senate budget committees began discussing the budget resolution for fy2005 the senate budget committee sbc reported its version of the fy2005 budget resolution on march 5 without numbered report the senate considered the resolution sconres 95 the week of march 8 and after amending the committeeadopted resolution approved it on march 12 the house budget committee hbc approved its version of the fy2005 budget resolution hconres 393 hrept 108441 on march 19 week later than originally planned disagreements within the committee majority over components of the resolution delayed its consideration the house approved the resolution after rejecting several proposed alternatives on march 25 the house substituted the text of hconres 393 for the text of sconres 95 on march 29 to facilitate the conference on the resolution conference committee began its efforts to resolve the resolutions differences on march 31 the most difficult issue became the differing paygo requirements in the house and senate resolutions the house resolution required offsets for proposed increases in mandatory spending the senate resolution required offsets for both mandatory spending increases and revenue reductions after month and half of efforts the conference committee reported hrept 108498 an agreement the agreement reduced the resolutions coverage to one year from the fiveyear coverage in the resolutions adopted by the house and senate the paygo rules were limited crs8 to the one year of the resolution and would expire on may 15 2005 the reconciliation instructions in the agreement incorporated the cost 229 billion revenue reduction and 46 billion in outlay increases of extending three popular tax cuts the marriage penalty relief the increased child care credit and the expanded 10 tax bracket that expire this year the resolution accommodated another 277 billion in additional tax cuts that were not included in the reconciliation instructions the house passed the conference resolution on may 19 the house rules committee resolution allowing consideration of the conference resolution hres 649 included provision putting the budget resolution once adopted by the house in effect for the house this provided guidance to the appropriations and other committees that needed to adopt legislation to implement the fy2005 budget unsure that it had enough votes to adopt the resolution the senate leadership delayed senate consideration of the conference agreement until early june as june came and went and the summer recess beginning july 24 2004 approached the conference report on the resolution remained unconsidered by the senate the senate never considered the fy2005 budget resolution conference report the lack of budget resolution for the year altered the way budget legislation appropriations tax cuts moves through congress the house put in place instructions through hres 649 to treat the budget resolution conference agreement once it passed the house as if it had passed congress this provided cap for discretionary spending 821 billion excluding 50 billion reserve for afghanistan and iraq and allocations of that amount among the 13 appropriation subcommittees in the senate the lack of resolution initially left the appropriators working from the discretionary spending cap 814 billion for fy2005 included in last years fy2004 budget resolution hconres 95 in addition without the taxcut reconciliation instructions from an adopted budget resolution tax cut legislation was open to amendment in the senate this difficulty was resolved with the enactment of the first appropriation defense for fy2005 see the next paragraph congress passed the first of the 13 regular appropriations on june 22 2004 the defense appropriation hr 4613 hrept 108622 provided 4175 billion for the new fiscal year including the administrationrequested 25 billion for operations in afghanistan and iraq this 25 billion became immediately available for fy2004 upon enactment the legislation signed into law pl 108287 by the president on august 5 2004 included provision setting the discretionary spending limit at 8214 billion in the senate the same amount as was being used by the house speculation began in july 2004 that continuing resolution on appropriations cr or an omnibus appropriation would be needed before the start of fy2005 either would provide funding for federal activities not other wise funded by regular appropriation or by permanent funding as time ran out in september congress passed hjres 107 cr on appropriations to fund otherwise unfunded federal activities at fy2004 levels minus supplementals through november 20 2004 the president signed it into law pl 108309 on september 30 crs9 congress passed three more of the 13 regular appropriation bills during october 2004 but was unable to pass the remaining nine individually two more crs pl 108416 november 11 2004 pl 108434 december 3 2004 were adopted to provide congress with the time needed to complete action on the fy2005 appropriations in an afterelections session congress combined the remaining nine regular appropriations into one omnibus bill using the foreign operations appropriation legislation hr 4818 as the vehicle the legislation passed congress on november 20 2004 and was signed by the president pl 108447 the consolidated appropriations act 2005 on december 8 2004 the appropriations will provide approximately 837 billion in budget authority for fy2005 earlier on september 23 congress adopted legislation hr 1308 extending over 20 expiring tax provisions most of the extensions would run through december 2005 while several extend further into the future the 10year estimated cost of the bill was put at 146 billion the president signed the legislation into law pl 108311 on october 4 2004 the administrations fy2006 budgets policy proposals other than requested supplemental appropriation see next paragraph had little effect on the fy2005 budget totals changes in the underlying assumption both economic and technical produced most of the change in the budget numbers between the july 2004 midyear administration budget report and the presidents fy2006 budget at the same time as the release of the administrations fy2006 budget proposals february 2005 it proposed an 82 billion supplemental appropriation for fy2005 to support the military activity in iraq and afghanistan the global war on terror tsunami relief along with other activities of the 82 billion in budget authority requested the administration expected about 35 billion to become outlays in fy2005 and another 25 billion in outlays in fy2006 the house passed the supplemental appropriations hr 1268 with changes on march 16 2005 the senate passed its version of the legislation on april 21 2005 the senates version differed from the one passed by the house and what the administration proposed conference committee reached agreement on may 3 the agreement provided the 82 billion but changed numerous allocations and policies compared to the presidents request3 the president signed the legislation into law on may 11 2005 pl10913 congress adopted and the president signed 105 billion emergency supplemental appropriations hr 3645 pl10961 on september 2 2005 for hurricane katrina relief some of the funding will be spent in the last month of fy2005 additional substantial funding is expected in the near future most or all of which will be spent in fy2006 rather than in fy2005 3 for

fy2009 under the traditional method of calculating the baseline current services baseline outlay estimates would rise from 2442 billion in fy2005 to 2952 billion in fy2009 the administrations modified

in afghanistan or iraq after the end of fy2004 which produced smaller outlay estimates for future years than if these had been included on may 12 2004 the administration requested 25 billion in additional defense funding for continuing operations in afghanistan and iraq the amount requested was included in the fy2005 defense appropriation bill pl108387 august 5 2005 as shares of gross domestic product gdp the administrations original february 2004 proposals showed outlays falling from to 199 of gdp in fy2005 to 194 of gdp in fy2009 cbos march 2004 estimate of the presidents outlay proposals showed the shares falling from 200 of gdp in fy2004 to 197 of gdp in fy2005 to 196 of gdp in each of the fiscal years from 2006 through 2010 before rising to 199 of gdp in fy2014 these outlaysassharesofgdp are below both the average from fy1980 through fy2003 211 of gdp or the average from fy1990 through fy2003 202 of gdp cbos march 2004 revised baseline estimates showed outlays rising from 200 of gdp in fy2005 to 201 of gdp in fy2009 and remaining at that level through fy2014 using one of cbos alternative scenarios for spending one that assumes discretionary outlays would grow at the rate of nominal gdp rather than the lower rate of inflation outlays would equal 201 of gdp in fy2005 rising to 210 of gdp in fy2009 and to 219 of gdp in fy2014 ombs midsession review msr july 2004 indicated modest increase in outlays for the five years forecast policy changes accounted for most of the increase in the estimate for fy2005 while reestimates of underlying policy produced most of the increases in subsequent years outlays as share of gdp would fall from 198 in fy2005 to 191 in fy2009 under the proposals in the msr combined outlays for defense and homeland security would grow by 26 billion over five years 5 the fy2005 outlay proposals would be 42 billion 17 below the traditional formulation of the baseline crs12 nondefense nonhomeland security discretionary spending would fall by 1 billion over the same period total mandatory spending would grow by 352 billion and net interest would increase by 112 billion over the same five years cbos revised baseline estimates in its september 2004 update showed larger outlays than in the march baseline estimate for each of the 10 years in the forecast most of the change resulted from legislation adopted after the march report the revisions did little to alter relative growth in the components of spending discretionary spending would increase the least while mandatory and net interest outlays would increase the most for both the fy2005fy2009 and the fy2005 fy2014 periods the administrations original proposals envisioned holding to almost zero growth if not actual reductions the nondefense nonhomeland security discretionary spending throughout the five year forecast the traditional baseline assumed that all discretionary spending will grow at the rate of inflation for cbo the baseline estimates showed that the slow dollar growth in discretionary spending would offset some of the growth in mandatory and net interest spending the result was reduction in total outlays as share of gdp cbos adjusted baseline which included faster rate of growth for discretionary spending slowly raised outlays as share of gdp over the 10 years the january 2005 cbo budget report reduced slightly from 2442 billion to 2425 billion estimated baseline outlays compared to its september 2004 estimates cbos new report estimated that outlays through fy2014 would be slightly smaller in each year than it had expected in its previous report different assumptions about discretionary spending between the two reports produced the apparent reduction in outlays when made comparable the january 2005 outlay estimates are higher than september 2004 outlays estimates the presidents fy2006 budget february 2005 showed slightly larger outlays for the years fy2005 through fy2009 than it had estimated in july 2004 the administrations proposed supplemental appropriation 82 billion in budget authority 35 billion in outlays in fy2005 plus some changes in underlying assumptions produced most of the changes between the two estimates the fy2006 budget contained little additional policy changes for fy2005 figure 2 shows outlays as shares of gdp from ombs july 2005 msr and cbos august 2005 budget reports cbos outlay baseline estimates decline slightly as shares of gdp over the period shown the cbo baseline assumes inflation adjustments to discretionary spending unchanged policies for mandatory spending and repeat of the 2005 supplemental in each future year in the projection as required by baseline rules the alternative baseline adjusts the cbo baseline to assume that overall discretionary spending growth matches the rate of growth of gdp rather than the rate of inflation which is generally smaller and adds in the higher debt service costs from larger deficits for both higher outlays and smaller receipts these changes produce total outlays that grow as share of gdp throughout the period rising to almost 21 of gdp in fy2015 the administrations policies include slowdowns in mandatory spending growth close to freeze if not actual reductions in nondefense discretionary spending slowing in defense spending crs13 growth and did not include assumptions about future supplementals for iraq and afghanistan the administrations proposals show outlays falling as share of gdp after fy2006 ombs midsession review july 2005 showed little change from the administrations february 2005 estimates in expected outlays for fy2005 policy changes increased spending by an estimated 1 billion while outlay reestimates due to technical and economic changes since february 2005 reduced expected outlays by 8 billion the msr estimated fy2005 outlays at 2472 billion slightly below the 2479 billion estimated in february as part of its efforts to constrain spending the administration proposed dollar

midsession review under the initial request receipts would grow from an estimated 2036 billion in fy2005 to 2616 billion in fy2009 these increases would reverse the slump in receipts over the years fy2001 through fy2003 receipts had reached their highest post world war ii level both in dollars 2025 billion and as percentage of gdp 209 of gdp in fy2000 by fy2003 receipts had fallen for three

as share of gdp to 163 of gdp the administration expected receipts in fy2005 to exceed in dollars but not as percentage of gdp receipts in fy2000 the administrations proposals would extend the current middle class relief from the alternative minimum tax amt for one year without further extension growing number of middle class taxpayers will find themselves subject to the amt estimates indicate that the amt which affected little over 600000 taxpayers in 1997 could affect 33 million taxpayers by 20108 cbo estimated september 2004 that providing extended or permanent amt relief would reduce receipts by 136 billion between fy2005 and fy2009 and by 340 billion between fy2005 and fy2014 the presidents budget arbitrarily reduced its fy2004 and fy2005 initial receipt estimates by 20 billion and 15 billion respectively in the interest of cautious and prudent forecasting9 the downward adjustment increased the resulting estimated deficits by 20 billion in fy2004 and by 15 billion in fy2005 the 2004 midyear budget reports from both omb july 2004 and cbo september 2004 contained higher receipt estimates than in their earlier 2004 budget reports both omb and cbo attributed these increases mostly to technical reestimates and revisions in the economic outlook rather than to any policy changes in early 2005 revised receipt estimates and projections from cbo and omb were fairly similar for fy2005 through fy2009 see table 3 and somewhat smaller than the previous budget reports from cbo and omb the new receipt estimates were shown rising from 163 of gdp in fy2004 to 168 in fy2005 and to 177 of gdp in fy2009 cbos baseline in its january 2005 report reflected the scheduled expiration of most of the tax cuts and projected receipts through fy2015 these baseline projections of receipts

fy2005 19 and by 95 billion in fy2006 over its february 2005 estimates the msr showed the higher receipts 18 persisting over the next five years in slowly declining amounts the 17 increase was not due to legislative action but to higherthanpreviously expected income and payroll taxes 16 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 it attributed the increased receipts in large part to stronger economy that it claimed resulted from tax relief although the administration argued that the higher receipts resulted from stronger economy the economic data in the msr differed little from the february 2005 data many analysts disagreed with the administrations contention lack of understanding of the underlying causes for the higher receipts in 2005 and whether they will persist raises uncertainty about any claims to know what receipts will do in the next five years 10 cbo indicates in its update that combining the amt changes and making the tax cuts permanent produces an interactive effect increasing the combined loss over the sum of the two estimates separately crs17 cbos update also showed receipts 85 billion higher in fy2005 and 68 billion higher in fy2006 than previously forecast as with the msr the update attributed most of the increase to higher than expected income and payroll tax collections in 2005 the update does not expect the surge in receipts to extend at their current levels through the rest of the decade cbo expects the increases to fade over time falling to an estimated 10 billion receipt increase in fy2010 above the receipts projected for that year in cbos march 2005 report cbo indicated that changes in the economic outlook and technical changes produced the higher receipts there is lack of data to fully understand the source for this jump in receipts deficits and surpluses deficits and surpluses are the residuals left after congress and the president set policies for spending and receipts surpluses in which receipts are greater than outlays reduce federal debt held by the public which can lead to lower net interest payments among other effects deficits in which outlays exceed receipts increase government debt held by the public generally increasing net interest payments assuming change in interest rates reducing the deficit and eventually reaching balanced budget or generating and keeping surplus fy1988 saw the first surplus in 30 years the budget returned to deficit in fy2002 was major focus of the budget debates in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s the presidents fy2005 budget proposals included an estimated deficit of 521 billion in fy2004 falling to 364 billion in fy2005 those projections showed the deficit falling to 237 billion in fy2009 the 237 billion would fulfill the administrations pledge to reduce the deficit by half starting from the fy2004 estimated deficit most of the deficits fall would occur from fy2004 to fy2006 after which it showed relatively little change in dollars in the original proposals the february 2004 budget showed the deficit falling from 45 of gdp in fy2004 to 30 of gdp in fy2005 and to 16 of gdp in fy2009 under the administrations policy proposals and assumptions the success of the administrations deficit reduction efforts both in its fy2005 and fy2006 budget depended and depend on underlying policy assumptions that may prove difficult to maintain one is the heavy reliance on constraints and reductions in nondefense discretionary spending which are approximately onesixth of total outlays another is the absence of any estimates for the funding of operations in afghanistan and iraq after fy2006 third is the absence of cost estimate for longerterm fix for the expanding coverage of the alternative minimum tax atm the administrations fy2006 did not include atm relief after fy2005 although the administrations proposal to reform the tax system in the fy2006 budget is supposed to address the issue the continuing growth in entitlements and the likely growth in net interest along with the administrations opposition to tax increases limits the focus of the administrations deficit reduction proposals to relatively small areas of the budget the fy2006 budget proposals

estimates cbos january 2004 budget report and most of its subsequent budget reports included estimates of the budgetary effects of policy alternatives not included in cbos baseline some of the alternative policies may more accurately reflect budget experience than allowed by the baseline construction instructions in the deficit control act dca or may estimate policy options with high possibility of adoption the alternatives have included estimates of extending expiring tax provisions the reform of or the extension of relief from the alternative minimum tax amt and variations on the future growth rates of discretionary spending cbos august 2005 budget report included two alternative estimates of discretionary spending freeze at fy2005 levels and an increase at the rate of gdp growth and an estimate of the cost of phasedown in military activities in afghanistan and iraq and the global war on terrorism table 5 contains the estimates for these policy alternatives the alternative policies that cut future taxes or raise future spending would be fairly costly compared to cbos baseline extending the expiring tax provisions would reduce receipts by an estimated 92 billion between fy2005 and fy2009 while letting discretionary spending grow at the expected growth rate of gdp instead of the rate of inflation would increase outlays by an estimated 217 billion over the same five years these estimates do not include the higher interest costs associated with larger deficits and debt13 the same report indicated that freezing discretionary spending at the fy2005 level would reduce spending by an estimated 196 billion for the fy2005 through fy2009 period compared to the baseline estimates the costs or savings of the alternatives become substantially larger

157 billion in higher interest costs most of that 12 trillion and 150 billion in higher interest costs would occur in the second five years fy2010 through fy2014 reforming the alternative minimum tax over the 10 years would cost an estimated 347 billion plus another 83 billion in interest costs of the total 10year cost 210 billion plus 73 billion in interest costs falls in the second five years 13 these two policies would produce an estimated 7 billion and 16 billion in interest costs respectively crs22 table 5 the cumulative effects of cbos policy alternatives not included in cbos baseline for

deficit or an increase in the surplus debt service refers to changes in interest payments on federal debt resulting from changes in the governments borrowing needs this alternative does not extend the 95 billion in supplemental appropriations enacted during 2005 however it assumes that about 85 billion in budget authority will be needed in 2006 to maintain activities related to iraq afghanistan and the war on terrorism such budget authority is projected to decline to 65 billion in 2007 50 billion in 2008 35 billion in 2009 and about 25 billion per year thereafter total of 393 billion over the 10year period b this alternative assumes that the supplemental appropriation enacted during 2005 are projected at baseline levels that is increased at the rate of inflation c this alternative does not include the effects of extending the increased exemption amount for the alternative minimum tax amt which expires in 2005 the effects of that alternative are shown separately d this alternative assumes that the exemption amount for the amt which was increased through december 2005 in the working families tax relief act of 2004 is extended at its higher level and together with the amt tax brackets is indexed for inflation after 2005 if this alternative crs23 was enacted jointly with the extension of expiring tax provisions an interactive effect would occur that would make the combined revenue loss greater than the sum of the two separate estimates by about 247 billion plus 24 billion in debtservice costs over the 20062015 period increasing discretionary spending at the rate of nominal gdp growth produced 10year 11 trillion cumulative increase in the deficit plus another 190 billion in debt service costs in cbos august 2005 budget report most of the cumulative increase 925 billion would take place in the second five years of the10year period table 5 shows cbos august 2005 estimates for these alternatives for the five and 10year periods the longer run over longer time period one beginning in the next decade and lasting for decades into future both cbo and the administration indicate in their respective budget documents that they expect under existing policies and assumptions that demographic pressures will produce large and persistent deficits cbo states in the decades beyond cbos projection period the aging of the babyboom generation combined with rising health care costs will cause historic shift in the united states fiscal situation over the next 30 years the number of people age 65 or older will double while the number of adults under age 65 will increase by less than 15 percent driven by rising health care costs spending for medicare and medicaid is increasing faster than can be explained by the growth of enrollment and general inflation alone if excess cost growth continued to average 25 percentage points in the future federal spending for medicare and medicaid would rise from 42 percent of gdp today to about 115 percent of gdp in 2030 outlays for social security as share of gdp are projected to grow by more than 40 percent in the next three decades under current law from about 42 percent of gdp to more than 6 percent by contrast federal revenues credited to social security are expected to remain close to their current level around 5 percent of gdp over that period together the growing resource demands of social security medicare and medicaid will exert pressure on the budget that economic growth alone is unlikely to alleviate consequently policymakers face choices that involve reducing the growth of federal spending increasing taxation boosting federal borrowing or some combination of those approaches14 omb echoed the cbo language in the presidents budget documents the document included section on the longterm fiscal challenge that stated that unlike the administrations positive nearterm fiscal expectations the same cannot be said of the longterm deficit picture as result of long standing imbalances between what major entitlement programs currently promise 14 cbo the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20062015 jan 2005 p 1011 crs24 in benefits and the resources expected to be available to meet those promises due to combination of demographic and cost pressures social securitys and medicares unfunded obligations pose the real fiscal danger to the federal budget and to our economy in general15 the shortterm budget outlook can change when it is buffeted by economic or policy changes as indicated by both cbo and omb the longterm budget outlook is expected to be dominated by the spending growth for social security medicare medicaid and other programs for the elderly as the baby boom generation begins retiring in large numbers in the next decade not only will these programs be affected but their constant growth will put great stress on the rest of the budget the governments ability to finance its obligations and the ability of the economy to provide the resources needed the tax cuts and spending increases of the last few years have not produced the difficult fiscal future but they appear to have made solution more difficult the budget and the economy the budget and the economy affect each other unequally small economic changes have more significant effect on the budget than the effect large policy changes have on the economy the worsethanpreviouslyexpected economic conditions that lasted from 2001 into 2003 played substantial role directly and indirectly in the deterioration of the budget outlook over those years the rebound from that slowerthannormal growth results according to cbo results in expectations of faster than normal growth in 2004 and 2005 for the period 2006 through 2014 cbo projects that real gross domestic product gdp will grow about as fast as potential gdp16 under governmental policies that are in fiscal balance return to economic growth that is close to the growth of potential gdp should reduce or eliminate deficit or produce surplus in both the presidents budget and in cbos budget reports the budget under current policies experiences shrinking deficit and under cbos january 2005 baseline moves into surplus in fy2012 under the cbo alternative policies based on cbo estimates the deficit grows as percentage of gdp it does not shrink or disappear during period of expected normal economic growth this result implies that the budget has basic fiscal imbalance that cannot be eliminated by economic growth to produce balanced budget or one in surplus will require spending reductions or tax increases the last extremely positive budget outlook that was forecast in early 2001 and was substantially based on the favorable future economic conditions that were then expected along with government policies that were in approximate balance if not favoring surpluses that outlook expected continuation in the overall improvement of the budget situation that had occurred since the early 1990s much of the budget 15 omb budget of the united states government for fiscal year 2006 feb 2005 p21 16 potential gdp represents an estimate of what gdp would be if both labor and capital were as fully employed as is possible crs25 improvement in the 1990s had come from strong and sustained economic growth and the rest from policy changes to reduce the deficit when those favorable economic conditions faltered along with policy changes cutting taxes and raising spending so did the string of positive forecasts for the budget outlook what good economic conditions give bad economic conditions can take away the unexpectedly lengthy economic weakness into 2003 the start of recession in march 2001 the lengthy fall in the stock market the policy responses to the september 2001 terrorist attacks along with negative changes in the technical components of the budget estimates raised outlays reduced receipts beyond policy changes and eliminated the previously expected surpluses
