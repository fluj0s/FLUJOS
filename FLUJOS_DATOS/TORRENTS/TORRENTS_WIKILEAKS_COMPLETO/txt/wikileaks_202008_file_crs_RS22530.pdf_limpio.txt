poses and appropriate re sponses differ from us views on september 24 2005 india voted w ith 21 other states on international atomic energy agency iaea resolution gov2005 77 which found iran in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement however the resolution did not refer the matter immediately to the security council and i ndia apparently was one of several states pressuring the eu3 to keep the issue at the iaea according to indian foreign secretary shyam saran india voted for the resolution and against the majority of nam states which abstained because it felt obligated to do so after having pressured the eu3 to omit reference to immediate referral to the security c ouncil2 moreover the official explanation of indias vote seemed designed to highlight indias differences with the united states in our explanation of vote we have clearly expressed our opposition to iran being declared as noncompliant with its safeguards agreements nor do we agree that the current situation could constitute thre at to international peace and security nevertheless the resolution does not refer the matter to the security council and has agreed that outstanding issues be dealt w ith under the aegis of the iaea itself this is in line with our position and ther efore we have extended our support3 nonetheless india again voted with the united states on february 4 2006 when the iaea board of governors voted to refer irans noncompliance to the security council4 the ministry of external affairs re sponded to questions about its vote in this manner while there will be report to the security council the iran nuclear issue remains within the purview of the iaea it has been our consistent position that confrontation should be avoided and any outstanding issue ought to be resolved through dialogueour vote in favour of the resolu tion should not be interpreted as in any way detracting from the traditionally close and frie ndly relations we enjoy with iran it is our conviction that our active role along with other friendly countries enabled the tabling of resolution that recognizes the right of iran to peaceful uses of nuclear energy for its development consistent with its internati onal commitments and obligations while keeping the door open for further dialogue aimed at resolving the outstanding issues within the purview of the iaea5 indias prime minister told the indian parliament on februa ry 17 2006 that as signatory to the npt iran has the legal right to develop peaceful uses of nuclear energy consistent with its international commitments and obligations

noted that it is incumbent upon iran to exercise these rights in the context of safeguards that it has voluntarily accepted upon its nuclear programme under the iaea6 india has supported the eu3 negotiations despite their ostensible objective of halting irans pursuit of sensitive nuclear t echnology that is enrichment reprocessing and heavy water in part this may be because the talks offered second avenue of negotiation that did not necessarily lead to security council sanctions or because they have offered viable discussion forum india welcomed the us decision to join the talks stating india has all along advocated that issues relating to irans nuclear programme ought to be resolved through dialogue and that confrontation should be avoided against this background the readiness of the us to join in the dialogue between eu3 and iran which india has all along supported is to be welcomed7 in september 2006 however india joined ot her nam states in statement issued at the havana nam summit on irans nuclear program the statement reaffirmed the basic inalienable right of all states to develop research produc tion and use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes without any di scrimination and in conformity with their respective legal obligations therefore not hing should be interpreted in way as inhibiting or restricting this right of st ates to develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes they furthermore rea ffirmed that states choices and decisions in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear technology and its fuel cycle policies must be respected8 two other us nonproliferati on policies that may help underpin solution to the iran crisis are related to restrictions on the nuclear fuel cycle ban on transferring enrichment and reprocessing technologies to states that are not already technology holders and steps toward multilateralizing the nuclear fuel cycle so that sensitive technologies are not as widespread key ne w us initiative in this area is the global nuclear energy partnership or gnep i ndia under the july 18 2005 joint statement with the united states committed to refrain from transferring enrichment and reprocessing technologies to states that do not have them as well as to support international efforts to limit their spread indias future support for those policies however may be predicated on india being c onsidered one of those technology holders recent statement from president bush on gnep did not recognize india as such technology holder my administration has announced new pr oposal called the global nuclear energy partnership under this partnership america will work with nations that have advanced civilian nuclear energy programs such as great britain france japan and russia to share nuclear fuel with nati ons like india that are developing civilian nuclear energy programsthe strategy will allow countries like india to produce more electricity from nuclear power it will enable countries like india to rely

international relations committee that the united states was pre ssing india to announce its intention to participate in the proliferati on security initiative both the house hr 5682 and senate s 3709 bills to create an exception for i ndia from relevant provisions of the atomic energy act refer to the desirability of getting india to join psi but do not make it prerequisite for cooperation prime minister singh told th parliament in august 2006 that the proliferation security initiative is an extraneous issuetherefore we cannot accept it as condition for implementing the july statement separa tely the government has examined the psi we have certain concerns regarding its legal implications and its linkages with the npt finally efforts to prevent iran from acqui ring nuclear weapons rely on coordinated export controls and strong nati onal export control systems india has agreed to harmonize its export controls with the guidelines of the nuclear suppliers group under the july 18 2005 joint statement india also passed new law in may 2005 the weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems prohibition of unlawful activities bill according to indian officials the act prohibits the possession manufacture transportation acquisition development of nuclear weapons chemical weapons or biological weapons by nonstate actors11 it would prohibit the export of any good or technology from india if the exporter knows it is intended to be used in wmd program the us commerce and state partments have not yet assessed indias export control law and regulations12 which were promulgated in response to security council resolution 1540 requiring all states to take actions to criminalize proliferation particular ly to nonstate actors some observers have stated that india does not have the nece ssary regulations in place to implement the law and that indias resources for implementation are remarkably limited13 third issue is whether india will follow through in imposing penalties on

in the early 1990s when iran actively sought nuclear related assistance and technology from many fo reign sources india appears to have played only minor role in contrast to other states india signed an agreement in november 1991 to provide 10megawatt research reactor to tehran but cancelled under pressure from the united states nonetheless i ndia reportedly trained iranian nuc lear scientists in

publication in 1997 india signed the chemical weapons convention in 1993 and deposited its instrument of ratification until 1996 other considerations one consideration in assessing countrys nonproliferation record is the extent to which its export control and procurement sy stem helps limit or eliminate illicit transfers david albright president of the institute for science and international security has argued that three factors contribute to fl awed nonproliferation record for india in the nuclear area poorly impleme nted national export control system an illicit procurement system for its own nuclear weapons progra m and procurement system that may unwittingly transfer sensitive inform ation about uranium enrichment20 when asked formally to respond to albrights allegations the administration stated it would be happy to discuss the allegations in classi fied session with members of congress21 albright has suggested that the illicit procurement system in india has led entities to mislead suppliers about the ultimate destin ation of their goods such system could be used to mask onward proliferati on from february 2003 to april 2006 the
