summary medicaid is jointly financed by the federal and state governments but each state designs and administers its own versi on of the program under broad federal guidelines the complexity of medicaid can present an enormous challenge in meeting the needs of hurricane katrinas victims especially when evacuees cross state lines state variation in eligibility covered services and the reimbursement and delivery of services is the rule rather than the exception furthermore although medicaid is targeted at individuals with w income not all of the poor are eligible and not all those covered are poor as federalstate program that helps to finance health care services for people with limited resources medicaid is an obvious avenue of quick response for support of victims in the aftermath of disaster the programs federal budgetary status as mandatory spending means that federal funding is availa ble to support coverage for all people who meet the pr ograms eligibility criteria without the need for supplemental appropriation however the ability of medicaid to res pond to disaster in terms of the numbers and types of people who can re ly on it for health care support may depend on number of factors including congressional action to modify statutory provisions eg the level of federal medicaid reim bursement offered to states the secretary of health and human services ability to waive certain program requirements administratively eg regarding eligibility and benefits and actions of the states each of whom operates its own unique medicaid program within federal guidelines this report which will be updated as events warrant discusses the following medicaids rules on eligibility benefits and financing in the context of current questions and issues raised by hurricane katrina recent state actions in response to medicaid issues raised by the hurricane federal medicaid waiver authority including information on current activity in this area and the

and state governments but each state designs and administers its own versi on of the program under broad federal guidelines the complexity of medicaid can present an enormous challenge in meeting the needs of hurricane katrinas victims especially when evacuees cross state lines state variation in eligibility covered services and the reimbursement and delivery of services is the rule rather than the exception furthermore although medicaid is targeted at individuals with w income not all of the poor are eligible and not all those covered are poor while some of the federa l rules governing medicaid are flexible enough to allow states to act without federal inte rvention in the wake of hurricane katrina certain issues raised by the disaster may be addressed only through administrative or legislative action by the federal government on the administrative front the centers for medicare and medicaid services c ms has developed voluntary medicaid waiver option to address some of the hurricanerelated eligibility and benefit issues raised in this report on the legislative front congressiona l action may be re quired if enhanced federal reimbursement is to be provided to states for medicaid costs incurred as result of hurricane katrina congress may also consider the desirability of uniform treatment of hurricane victims across states rather than relying on participation in the waiver program developed by cms number of bills that would provide hurricane katrina medicaid and schi p relief have been introduced this report begins with discussion of medicaids rules on eligibility benefits and financing in the context of current questions and issues raised by hurricane katrina many of which could arise in the wake of other emerge ncy situations eg hurricane rita it then provides information on recent actions taken by states discusses federal medi caid waiver authority and descri bes current federal legislation dealing with medicaid and hurricane relief efforts medicaid eligibility and access background in general to qualify for medicaid c overage an individual must meet both categorical and financial elig ibility requirements catego rical eligibility requirements relate to the age or characteristics of an individual categories of individuals that may qualify for medicaid generally include aged persons 65 and over certainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33083crs2 persons with disabilities children and their parents and pregnant women in addition within federal guidelines states set functional require ments for individuals seeking medicaidcovered longterm care services financial requirements g overn the amount of income and assets that categorically eligible individuals may have and still qualify for medicaid as well as how these amounts are calculated eg wh ether portion of earned income or the value of car may be disregarded the specific income and asset limitations that apply to particular group are determin ed through combination of federal requirements and state options consequently different standards apply to different groups and the standards themselves ma vary considerably among states individuals who do not meet categorical eligibility requirements eg nonelderly adults who are not disabled and do not have child ren generally cannot qualify for medicaid coverage even if they are poor however as discussed later in this report section 1115 waivers which llow the secretary of health and human services hhs to waive certain statut ory medicaid requirements for purposes of conducting research and dem onstration projects provide exceptions to these eligibility rules for states that have obtained an approved waiver issues raised by hurricane katrina people who are currently eligible for their states medicaid program may face difficulty accessing health care services if they have lost their medicaid cards and other identification or have been evacuated from their home state in addition to creating problems for those who are current medicaid enrollees the large losses of hurricane katrinas victims may also swell the numbers of people who are financially eligible for medicaid either in their home state or in the state to which they have been evacuated residency current federal medicaid rule s governing residency help in understanding which program is the right one for evacuees to appeal to if they believe they are medicaid eligible state dicaid programs are required to provide coverage to all state reside nts who are otherwise eligible for medicaid an individual is generally considered resident of state if he or she is living in it with the intention of remaining there permanently or indefinitely eligibility may not be denied because an individual has not resided in the state for specified period or because the individual is temporarily absent from the state state is also prohibited from denying coverage to an individual w ho satisfies residency rules but who did not establish residence in the state before entering medical institution for currently enrolled medicaid recipients who have been displaced from their home state the home state is required under certain circumstances to pay for covered services ie covered under the home state s medicaid program furnished in another state to the same extent that it would pa for services furnished within its boundaries and may opt to pay for outofstate services under other circumstances see the payment and financing section of this re port for additional info rmation however the medicaid recipient must find an outofstate provider willing to accept medicaid payment from the home state as well as enroll or otherwise enter into an agreementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33083crs3 1 for example individuals applying for cert ain medicaidcovered longterm care services must provide financial records for up to fi veyear lookback period these requirements are outlined in section 1917c1a of the social security act 2 major exception to this rule is for indi viduals applying for certain medicaidcovered longterm care services in which case up to five years of financial records may be examined 3 traditionally eligibility for dicaid was linked to the receipt of cash welfare payments continuedwith the home states medicaid program as condition of receiving that payment and not all providers may be willing to do so regardless of whether they are enrolled in medicaid in their home state displaced individuals might wish to be considered residents of the state to which they have evacuated either to obtain medicaid coverage in the case of those who were not previously eligible or to facilitate access to care in the case of those who were eligible for medicaid in their home state but are having difficulty finding provider that will accept their outofstate coverage if an individual meets the residency requirements described above and is otherwise eligible for medicaid in the state to which they have evacuated coverage cannot be denied however it should be noted that the eligibility and benefit rules of an individuals host state may be different than the rules of his or her home state income and asset documentation in general federal law stipulates few documentation requirements for medicaid app licants state policies on this issue vary based on the eligibility group but c onsiderable amount of documentation may be required to determine whether an individual meets financial eligibility requirements for medicaid1 although states have flexibility to collect income and asset information through selfdeclaration alone they also have the ability to require supporting documentation federal law does require states to have an income and eligibility verification system ievs but states are not required to verify income and assets through the ievs for every medicaid recipient and may conduct these verifications after enrollment under these systems state medicaid agencies use information from number of federal and state sources to verify financial eligibility including state wage information maintained by the state wage income collection agency swica and information on net earning s from self employment wages and retirement benefits maintained by the social security administration ssa lookback period for financial eligibility for evacuees who may have lost their homes and other assets and are now without jobs will requirements related to the period over which income is examined for the purpose of determining medicaid eligibility prevent medicaid funds from being used to meet their needs here again federal laws and regulations stipulate few ru for the lookback period used to determine an individuals financial eligibility for medicaid leaving states with great deal of flexibility2 for many eligibility gr oups federal regulations require that states use income counting methods that are more restrictive than method used under the most closel related cash welfare program3 such methodshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33083crs4 3 continued while this is longer true for all coverage groups many income and asset counting rules are still linked to those used under existing or former cash welfare programscan be less restrictive at states option for certain other groups such as the medically needy generally people who become eligible for medicaid in part because they spend considerable amounts of their income on medical care the budget period can be longer than six months again states have the flexibility to shorten such budget accounting periods people who do not meet curre nt eligibility requirements s previously noted medicaid eligibility is limited by two primary types of current law restrictions financia l and categorical individuals qualify for medicaid by having income and assets that fall below certain thresholds and by falling into particular groups or categories of individuals in ge neral those categories include the elderly people with disabilities dependent children parents of dependent children and pregnant women could exceptions to thes categorical restrictions be made for people impacted by the katrina disaster many states have used section 1115 medicaid waivers discussed later in this report to allow categorical eligibility requirements to be waived many states have also exercised options that allow them to liberalize eligibility without the use of waiver such as the option to disregard certain amounts of income or assets for particular groups medicaid benefits background medicaids basic benefit ru require all states to provide certain mandatory services listed in federal statute examples of services that are mandatory for most groups of medicaid recipients include 1 inpatient and outpatient hospital services 2 federally qualified health center fqhc services 3 lab and xray services 4 physician services 5 certain nurse practitioner services 6 pregnancyrelated services including postpartum care 7 ear ly and periodic screening diagnosis and treatment epsdt for children under age 21 8 nursing facility care for persons age 21 and over and 9 home health care for persons entitled to nursing facility care the statute also lists additional services that are considered optional that is available to recipients if st ates choose to include them in their state medicaid plans some of these optional benefits are specific items such as eyeglasses and prosthetic devices other benefits are defined as cl asses of medical provi ders whose array of services are considered to be medicaid c overed benefits eg psychologists nursing facility care for persons under age 21 in termediate care facility services for individuals with mental retardation icfs mr still others include wide range of types of medical care and services eg phy sical therapy prescribed drugs personal care services private duty nursing hospice clinic services and rehabilitation in addition to the above general rules regarding mandatory and optional benefits medicaid statute specifies special benefits or special rules regarding certain benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33083crs5 4 information on benefit coverage is taken from us department of health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid services medicaid ataglance 2003 publication cms1102403 hereafter cited as cms medicaid ataglance 2003 these data are based on review of approv ed state medicaid plans and waivers as of september 30 2003for targeted groups of individuals for example for children under the age of 21 epsdt guarantees access to all federally coverable services that are necessary to correct or ameliorate identified defects physical and mental illnesses and other conditions states are required to provide otherwise optional services to medicaid child even if that service is not listed in the state medicaid plan thus children in any state can receive eyeglasses through medicaid for example while adults living in the same state may not have any or limited access to this optional benefit medicaid is also an important financing mechanism for longterm care ltc ltc services refer to wide range of supportive and health services generally provided on an ongoing basis for persons who have limitations in functioning because of disability or chronic conditi on medicaidcovered nursing facility nf and icfmr services are generally categor ized as institutional services because individuals reside in and receive health care services in specific type of certified facility other medicaidcovered ltc services eg personal care home health care are categorized as home and co mmunitybased care because individuals generally receive these services in the community eg in their homes or apartments states also have the option of re questing permission from the federal government to provide other home and co mmunitybased services for individuals who would otherwise need the level of car in an institution these other services may be offered as supplement to or inst ead of those optional services available through the state plan this option is referred to as home and communitybased services hcbs waiver authorized unde r section 1915c of the social security act unlike services offered as part of the state medicaid plan the hcbs waiver allows states to limit the number of individuals served and to offer the services on lessthanstatewide basis these waivers include broad range of services such as case management services homemakerhome health aide services personal care services adult day health services habilitation services respite care home modifications and hom edelivered meals issues raised by hurricane katrina variation in benefit coverage across states because each state designs and administers its own medi caid program under broad federal rules coverage of benefits varies from state to state among the five states initially declared to have public health emergencies due to hurricane katrina alabama florida louisiana mississippi nd texas certain optional services4 are covered in all of these states eg hospice care icf mr prescribed drugs prosthetic devices and transportation other op tional services are not covered by all of these stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33083crs6 5 includes care that is necessary to prevent the death or serious impairment of the health of recipient and because of the threat to lif or health necessitates the use of the most accessible hospital that is equipped to provide these services even if that hospital does not meet the conditions of participation in medi care or the definition of mandatory inpatient and outpatient services under medicaid 6 for example hhs substance abuse and mental health services administration samhsa has awarded 600000 in emergency grants to four states to meet mental health assessment and crisis counseling needs see httpwwwsamhsagovnewsnewsreleases050913_hhshtm 7 cms medicaid ataglance 2003 eg physical therapy emergency hosp ital services in non certified hospitals5 care for the elderly in institutions for mental disease imd eyeglasses and basic dental care in addition to choosing the menu of opti onal services they will provide states define the specific parameters eg am ount duration and scope of each mandatory and optional service covered under the stat medicaid plan within broad federal guidelines thus even for mandatory benefits there will be variations in the breadth of coverage from state to state there has been discussion about the poten tially substantial mental health needs of survivors of hurricane katrin in both home and host states6 wide range of inpatient and outpatient mental health rvices may be provi ded through several mandatory and optional benef its under medicaid however even among states that cover specific benefit eg psychologist serv ices services in mental health clinics other mental health rehabilitation and stabilization services there may be interstate variations in the amount duration nd scope of such covered benefits in the wake of hurricane katrina ques tions have been raised about which states benefit package will apply to indivi duals who have been displaced from their home state for example if 16yearold medicaid recipient from louisiana relocates to texas because of hurricane katrina and needs inpatient psychiatric services will he be able to obtain this care given that the texas medicaid program does not cover this be nefit while louisiana s medicaid program does7 the answer to this question is currently unclear as discussed in the payment and financing section of this report if medicaid recipient is evacuated to another state the home state is obligated under cer tain circumstances to pay for covered services ie covered by the home state th at are provided outofstate however the medicaid recipient must fi nd provider who is willing to accept the home states medicaid coverage which may be difficult as discussed earlier in the medicaid eligibility and access section of this report there is also residency question for people who have been displaced if medi caid recipient or any other individual has intention of returning to their home state will they now be considered resident of their host state which may offer di fferent benefit package than their home state for medicaid purposeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33083crs7 8 section 1915c of the social security act c onstrains states to budget neutrality test in defining which services they cover under the hcbs waiver program specifically the statute requires that the average per capita dicaid expenditures estimated by the state in any fiscal year for waiver enrollees can not exceed the amount medicaid would have paid if the individuals were residing in an institutionaccess to longterm care services individuals eligible for medicaidcovered ltc servi ces generally have significant physical or mental impairments that often require 24hour s upervision and assistance with activities of daily living eg eating and drinking using the toilet getting in and out of bed medicaid covers longterm care services in both institutional eg nursing homes and icfsmr and home and communitybased settings eg home care adult day care transportation personal attendant care for certain individuals because ltc recipients are highly dependent upon paid direct care staff also referred to as paraprofessionals such as certified nursing assistants in nursing homes and home health aides providing range of services to beneficiaries in their homes access to such care will be critical in the locations to which these individuals are evacuated unfortunately many states are experiencing difficulties in attracting and retaining sufficient supply of paraprofe ssionals to meet the growing demand for longterm care services in all settings even in the absence of disaster such as hurricane katrina furthermore many medicaid beneficiaries with longterm care needs obtain assistance from unpaid caregiv ers such as spouses relatives or neighbors such assistance often enables th individuals to remain at home or in community setting helping to reduce reliance on medicaidcovered ltc institutions the death or displacement of paid and unpaid caregivers may lead more evacuees to go without needed assistance or to seek rvices from medicaidcovered institutions in both home and host states fu rther straining stafft oresident ratios in institutions another factor to consider is the impact on access to home and community based services posed by the movement of hcbs waiver recipients across states it remains unclear whether persons enrolled in hcbs waivers in their home states will be able to enroll in similar waiver programs in their host states first enrollment in waiver programs is dependent upon person having access to housing in the community it is unclear whether communitybased housing will be available to evacuees with longterm care needs second many states already have waiting lists for waiver enrollment slots as result host states might request federal approval to lift their enrollment caps to cover evacuees and may need to renegotiate cost neutrality agreements with the secretary8 third each hcbs waiver covers different set of services and is targeted toward distinct population as result persons eligible for waiver services in their home state may find that they are either ineligible for waiver services in their host state or that the services offered do not meet their needs if appropriate commun itybased alternatives are available will these evacuees then be placed in host state institutions costsharing finally while costsharing is not widely applied under medicaid state policies may also be an issue for hurricane katrina survivors who remain in their home states as well as those that relocate to other states this issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33083crs8 9 section 1903 of the social security act govern s payments to states for medicaid see the discussion of federal waiver authority later in this report for more information on provisions of medicaid law that can and ca nnot be waived administrativelyis particularly relevant to some of the working people with disabilities who pay substantial premiums for medicaid coverage will home states continue to require costsharing for instate evacuees will host states require outofstate evacuees to comply with participation and pointofser vice costsharing re quirements applicable to instate medicaid recipients or will the home state costsharing requirements if any apply instead payment and financing background the medicaid program is jointly financed by the federal government and the states states incur medicaid expenditures by reimbursing providers for the covered care and services they provide to medicaid recipients and by administering their medicaid programs eg c onducting eligibility terminations pro cessing claims enrolling providers in compliance with federal requirements each quarter states submit accounting statements detailing thei r medicaid expenditures to the federal government and are reimbursed at the applicable federal rate the federal medical assistance percentage fmap is the rate at which states are reimbursed for most medicaid service ex penditures the fmap is based on formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average and vice versa it has statutory minimum of 50 and maximum of 83 the federal reimbursement rate for administrative expenditures does not vary by state and is generally 50 but certain administrative functions receive enhanced usually 75 reimbursement issues raised by hurricane katrina increased costs resulting from increased enrollment states affected by hurricane katrina including both thos that have taken in large numbers of individuals displaced by it and those whose own population may be struggling financially in the aftermat h are concerned about the possibility of surge in medicaid program enrollment and some advocate that enhanced federal reimbursement should be made available for medicaid cost s associated with serving hurricane victims legislative change may be required to provide such enhanced reimbursement because the secretary of hhs does not have the authority to waive provisions of federal medicaid law that govern payments to states via the fmap and other federal medicaid reimbur sement rates eg those that apply to administrative functions9 as described above the fmap is used to reimburse states for most of their medicaid service expenditures current statutory exceptions to the fmap include family planning services and supplies reimbursed at 90 services that are receivedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33083crs9 10 section 1931h of the social security act 11 section 1902a16 of the soci security act and 42 cfr 43152through an indian health service ihs facility reimbursed at 100 and services provided to targeted lowincome childre n enrolled in medicaid who qualify through state childrens health insurance prog ram schip provisions reimbursed at an enhanced fmap that varies by state and may range from 65 to 85 subject to the availability of funds from st ates federal schip allotment in addition to experiencing an increase in expenditures for medical care states may also see an increase in administrative costs associated with performing eligibility determinations for hurricane victims in the past temporary increases in federal reimbursement separate from the permanen t enhancements available for specified administrative functions such as the 100 reimbursement provi ded for operating an immigration status verification system have been authorized by congress to assist states with administrative costs fo r example 500 million federal fund was made available beginning in 1997 and continuing until exhausted to provide states with enhanced federal reimbursement for administrative expenditures attributable to eligibility determinations that would not have been made were it not for the implementation of the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program10 payments for outofstate care under federal law regulations promulgated by the secretary of hhs dictate the extent to which states must furnish medicaid assistance to state residents who are absent from the state11 under these regulations state must pay for services furnished in another state to the same extent that it would pay for services furnished within its boundaries if the services are furnished to recipient who is reside nt of the state and any of the following conditions is met medical services are needed because of medical emergency medical services are needed and the recipients health would beendangered if he were required to travel to hi s state of residence the state determines on the basis of medical advice that the needed medical services or necessary supplementary resources are more readily available in the other state or it is general practice for recipients in particular locality to usemedical resources in another state the regulations also require states to establish procedures to facilitate the furnishing of medical services to individua ls who are present in one state but eligible for medicaid in another in cases where medicaid recipient seeks outofstate care not related to medical emergency th home state may typically require prior authorization of the care the home state may also require the outofstate provider to enroll or otherwise enter into an agreement with its medicaid program as condition of receiving payment in the case of bordering states where recipients commonly cross state lines to seek care states often have agreements in place to facilitate the provision and payment of medicaid serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33083crs10 12 for example barbara coulter edwards the ohio medicaid director has reportedly indicated that her agency had received calls from hurricane victims who had found shelter in ohio but were turned away by health care providers unwilling to accept outofstate medicaid cards see httpwwwnytimescom20050907nationalna tionalspecial06cndwelfarehtmlei50

would prevent the home state from paying for all covered services ie cove red under the home states medicaid program that are provided to recipients while they are in another state at minimum the home state must pay if any of the conditions listed above are met however the medicaid recipient must find an outofstate provi der willing to accept medicaid payment from the home state and not all providers may be willing to do so12 in addition since an individual may be considered resident of the state to which they have evacuated he or she may be subject to the eligibility rules of that states medicaid program see the medicaid eligibility and access section of this report for more information on residency state and federal responses states operate their medicaid programs in the context of federal rules while some of these rules are flexible enough to allow states to act without federal intervention in the wake of hurricane katrina certain issues raised by the disaster may be addressed only throug h administrative or legislative action by the federal government for example although states have great deal of flexibility in setting eligibility and benefit rules they are generally requi red to apply these rules equally to all applicants and recipients to ensure that they meet federal medicaid requirements governing statewideness and comparability of benefits if state wants to modify these rules substantially eg by allowing coverage of childless adults who ordinarily could not qualify for medicaid or apply speci rules to select group of individuals eg allowing medicaid coverage for ll hurricane victims who meet categorical eligibility requirements by disregarding their income federal permission in the form of waiver granted by the secretar of hhs would gene rally be required although states are not obligated to participate in the section 1115 waiver arrangement being offered by the federa l government in response to hurricane katrina described later in this report several have opted to do so as discussed earlier congressional action may be required if enhanced reimbursement is to be provided to states for medicaid costs incurred as result of hurricane katrina congress may also wish to consider the desirability of uniform treatment of hurricane victims across stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33083crs11 13 for example see kaiser commission on

hurricane katrina to access dicaid services without any prior authorization requirements in or out of state from any medical provider that is willin g to accept louisiana medicaid as payment an emergency procedure was put in place to expedite provider enrollment for purposes of receiving medicaid payment and the state was making medicaid staff members available at the family assistance centers being t up by the federal emergency management agency fema and at many shelters across the state to help those affected by hurricane katrina fill out forms to get health coverage because of the severe statewide impact of hurricane katrina all of louisiana medicaids staff is being called upon to sign up those who have been devastated by the hurricane and need health coverage nd all people who currently have coverage through the states schip or medicaid program will have their renewal dates ex tended by six months15 louisiana also requested permission from cms to cancel as yet unpaid
