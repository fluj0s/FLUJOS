already receiving them three new laws continue or restore ssi medicaid and food stamps for many beneficiaries the period during which refugees may receive assistance also was extended cbo estimates that the cost of these modifications will cut the estimated savings of the 1996 changes by more than half nevertheless the basic policy set by the 1996 law remains in place for aliens who enter after its enactment background the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 prwora pl 104193 significantly restricted the eligibility of noncitizens for needs based public assistance before prwora legal aliens who settled here generally qualified for public assistance on the same basis as citizens did however prwora discontinued this similar treatment it bars most legal aliens regardless of when they arrived or whether they were already receiving benefits from supplemental security income ssi which provides cash assistance for needy persons who are aged blind or disabled and from the food stamp program it further allows the states to limit alien access to medicaid temporary assistance for needy families tanf and activities funded under social services block

the noncitizen provisions of prwora 237 billion over seven years however while expensive these modifications are limited in scope only three programs are substantially affected and the modifications primarily benefit noncitizens who were here before august 22 1996 the restrictive policy laid out in prwora remains essentially unchanged for most noncitizens entering since then noncitizen ssi and medicaid eligibility under pl 105333 eligibility for ssi and medicaid eligibility was restored to some noncitizens under pl 10533 the balanced budget act of 1997 signed on august 5 1997 cbo estimated
