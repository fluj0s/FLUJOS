protest against the impri sonment of ayman nour the runnerup to the 2005 presidential elections4 few observers expect that discussions will resume before the presidents trade promotion authority expires in july 2007 some analysts believe that the postpone ment of fta talks upset egypt which pursued economic reforms in part to increase us willingness to engage in negotiations egypt also felt that the united states shoul d reward egypts cooperation in the war on terror and ongoing efforts to promote peace in the middle east through an fta there is concern that the postponement may decrease momentum for continued economic reform in egypt other commentators suggest that the delay will galvanize egyptian authorities to push ahead with economic reform s under this view the reforms are both key to egypts economic interests and means to obtain an fta eventually there is speculation by some analysts that the delay may weaken usegyptian commercial ties as egypt seeks other trad opportunities for instance through the 2001 euromediterranean association agreement5 others counter that egypt already has open access to us markets for some goods thr ough the qualifying industrial zones qiz program which permits egyp tian industrial produc ts with specified amounts of inputs from israel to enter the united states dutyfree and without quotas egypt initially resisted
