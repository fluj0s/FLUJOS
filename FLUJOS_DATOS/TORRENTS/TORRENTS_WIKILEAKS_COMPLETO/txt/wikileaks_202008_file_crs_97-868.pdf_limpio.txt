internet protocol ip number that designates their specific location thereby making it possible to send and receive messages and to access information from computers anywhere on the internet domain names were created to provide users with simple cation name rather than requiring them to use long list of numbers for example the ip number for the location of the thomas legislative system at the library of congress is 1401472489 the corresponding domain name is thomaslocgov top level domains tlds appear at the end of an address and are either given country code such as jp or uk or are generic
