committee reform background at the apex of the olympic movement is the international olympic committee ioc which is organized under swiss law as nonprofit society with legal status under both swiss and international law1 the ioc entrusts to each countrys national olympic committee the responsibility to deter mine which athletes will represent that nation in the olympic games the united states first established such committee originally known as the united states olympic association in 19502 fourteen years later that body took its current name the united states olympic committee usoc the usoc at that time was more of membership organization than coordinating body with real hierarchy of authority and factional disputes between the national governing bodies ngbs of the various sports often broke out3 by the mid1970s it became apparent that the am erican olympic move ment was suffering from this lack of coordination4 and in 1975 president gerald ford formed the presidents commission on olympic sports to determine how best to bring direction to the usoc after two years of inves tigation the commission released its report recommending that the usoc become the national coordinating body through which the countrys amateur sports organizations provide athlet to represent the united states in the olympics5 congress responded in 1978 by passing the amateur sports act6 which adopted many of the commi ssions recommendations and specified detailed procedures for recognition of ngb s and dispute resolution significantly while the amateur sports act was very detailed in listing the duties and responsibilities of the ngbs the act was rela tively silent on the governance structure of the usoc itself in the last fifteen years the usoc has come under increasing criticism as scandals have tarred its image in 1991 thenusoc president robert helmick resigned amidst allegations of ethical misc onduct few years later local organizing committees involved in the drive to secure the 2002 winter olympics for salt lake city were caught up in bribery scandal that further eroded public confidence in the usoc early last year internal fricti on between thenceo lloyd ward and

ethics committee investigation of mr ward when the ethics committee ruled that mr ward had committed two technical violations of the usocs ethics code number of usoc executives resigned their posts in protest by march of 2003 both ward and mankamyer had re signed under intense pressure7 in the wake of this most recent s candal the senate commerce committee held three hearings in 2003 to discuss reformin g the usoc at the second hearing the commerce committee requested that the usoc establish an independent commission to review the usoc governance structure which the usoc did and in june the independent commission on refo rm of the united states olympic committee released its report this report formed the basis for the four bills introduced in the 108th congress before reachin g the independent commissions report or proposed legislati on however it is important to first understand the current structure of the usoc the usoc under the amateur sports act under current law the usoc is federallychartered corporation that receives government funding rather the co mmittee gets almost all of its money from corporate sponsorships and licensing agreemen ts for the rights to broadcast olympic events8 the usoc is prohibited from engaging in business for profit issuing stock or engaging in political activities9 the committee is required to submit every four years report of its operations including statement of receipts and expenditures and data on minority female nd disabled participation10 the usoc is empowered t among other things make contracts acquire and transfer property borrow money issue publications approve and revoke membership sue and be sued and do any other act necessary to carry out the committees purposes11 specific to the olympic games the usoc serves as the national coordinating body represents the united states in dealings with the ioc controls us representation in the olympic pan american and paralympic games hereinafter collectively referred to as the games resolves disputes regarding participation and pr ovides financial assistance to nonprofit organizations in furtherance of th usocs purpose12 the committee also has exclusive

recognize certain amateur sports organizations as the na tional governing bodies ngbs of their respective sports14 the ngbs have general aut hority over their sports which includes the ability to

description of accomplishments and activities during the fouryear period in formation on the par ticipation of women minorities and the disabled in the american olympic movement and the steps taken to encourage their participation17 the amateur sports act directs the usoc to establish governance structure18 but gives very little guidance on what it should look like other than that it must account for the reasonable representation of 1 the national governing bodies of various amateur sports 2 amateur athlet 3 other amateur sports organizations sufficiently connected to olympic sporting events and 4 the american public19 to that end the usoc established in its constitution board of directors with ultimate responsibility over the business po licies affairs nd activities of the committee20 the usoc constitution commands that the board consist of the committees executives the ioc members for the united states and member from each olympic and pan american sports organization21 under this structure the board currently has 124 members22 the board of directors which is only required to meet once every four years23 selects the usocs officers which include the president three vice

that the board does not select is the chief executive officer ceo also referred to as the secretary general who is selected by the executive committee25 the executive committee which is primarily responsible for establishing usoc policy consists of the seven committee officers five members from the national governing bodies council ngbc and one member from the educationbased multisport organizations26 the independent commission report the independent commissions report c oncluded that many of the usocs problems can be traced to its large board membership the current size of the usoc board of directors 124 members makes it impossible for the organization to operate in coordinated way the re port stated the costs of its size are disproportionate to any value brought to the organization27 in addition the independent commission found that the large number of directors leads to lack of accountability individual director will feel responsible when he or she is one of 124 directors28 the report stated the independent commission also pointed to the lack of independence shown by the individual directors which the co mmission blamed on the size of the board and the usocs election process nearly all usoc directors are elected to the board by constituent groups such as the ngb s athletes or other organizations the report stated as elected representatives of an organization these directors will ordinarily tend to look first to the interests of the organization that elected them rather than the best interests of the american olympic movement29 in testimony before the senate commerce committee donald fehr member of the independent commission expanded on that point the usoc is more like legislative body with the differing interest groups struggling with one another to protect their own and get their piece of the pie what this means is that for all practical purposes the structure of the usoc ma kes dispute and discord the order of the day30 the

things that there is clear delineation of authority between volunteers and fulltime paid personnel32 that there is great deal of confusion within the usoc as to its overall mission33 and that the current governance structure does not promote financial transparency34 to remedy these problems the inde pendent commission first recommended statutory overhaul of the usocs g overnance structure the independent commission found that reducing the boards mbership to nine would increase the boards ability to coordinate the report stated that five of the nine directors should be independent35 two should be elected from indi viduals proposed by the athletes advisory council aac and two should be elected from individuals nominated by the ngbc36 the five independent directors the report stated should be nominated by new nominating and governance committee to be established by the board37 the independent commission recommended the establishm ent of three additional standing committees by the board an audit committee compensation committee and an ethics committee38 for the volunteer corps of the us olympic movement the independent commission recommended an assembly repres enting various
