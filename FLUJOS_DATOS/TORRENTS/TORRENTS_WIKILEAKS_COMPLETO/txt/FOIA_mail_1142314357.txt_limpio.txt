from jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu to edwardcook drdendroldeocolumbiaedu subject re nrc study date tue 14 mar 2006 003237 0700 cc keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno hi ed thanks for trying to fit something in quick for the nrc group im not sure about richards full motives but i think he has his heart in the right place that the nrc committee might have gotten the impression he did and this will be reflected in their report perhaps in way that is even less satisfactory to you and keith and this report will likely have enormous political potential it needs to get things as right as possible from the start so time well spent on the part of you and keith thanks much peck hi peck being in bangkok on to paclim on to concord in mendoza back to bangkok and back to ny on may 1 makes it difficult for to do much but i will do what i can to salvage bad situation the longish emails i sent out to you all contain much of what i would write the main point to make one that richard seems to be totally oblivious to is that there is evidence for loss of sensitivity prior to the 20th century in largescale nh sense like that seen in the 20th century on the other hand there is evidence that there was not loss of sensitivity in largescale nh sense in my qsr paper fig 6 i acknowledge the weakness in the data prior to about 1200 but even so the regional comparisons only show divergence between north and south in the 20th century with none indicated during the putative mwp so why is richard and the nrc panel apparently stating without evidence that divergence probably is problem in the past and therefore tree rings cannot be trusted to reconstruct past temperatures it is honestly unscientific when the only evidence that i have seen refutes that premise and it plays unfairly into mcintyres hand i almost admit to being very irritated that richard should anoint himself as the arbitrator of this debate he knows nothing substantive about tree rings in that sense he is just like ray bradley cheers ed on mar 14 2006 at 629 am jonathan overpeck wrote hi ed and keith i hate to say it but richards take on the political aspects of the nrc vs ipcc reports seem worth some extra effort since you were both invited to speak with the nrc committee i would suggest that you both together or separately submit formal comments asap i dont know when the comment period starts or ends but im guessing you have to work fast im also thinking that you two might want to get out peerreviewed paper on the topic really soon too i worry that the hole will continue to deepen for dendroclimate if you two dont act to clarify what we knowdont know and when it is safe and why to use dendroclimate data to address the issue of longterm variation in temperature please dont construe my suggestions or comments as procon dendro but rather just as someone who wants the truth whatever it is to be communicated clearly and as best we know it but i do think that if richard is suspect dendro has real problem he doesnt have personal bias in this and is clearly trying harder than most to understand whats really going on with climate and the proxies effort now might save time later also are you both going to be at the swiss mtg in june we really have to get this all ironed out better before the next last draft of the ipcc ar4 thanks peck jonathan t overpeck director institute for the study of planet earth professor department of geosciences professor department of atmospheric sciences mail and fedex address institute for the study of planet earth 715 n park ave 2nd floor university of arizona tucson az 85721 direct tel 1 520 6229065 fax 1 520 7928795 1httpwwwgeoarizonaedu 2httpwwwispearizonaedu jonathan t overpeck director institute for the study of planet earth professor department of geosciences professor department of atmospheric sciences mail and fedex address institute for the study of planet earth 715 n park ave 2nd floor university of arizona tucson az 85721 direct tel 1 520 6229065 fax 1 520 7928795 httpwwwgeoarizonaedu httpwwwispearizonaedu references 1 httpwwwgeoarizonaedu 2 httpwwwispearizonaedu
