case analysishealing lecture given on 5 march 1964 thank you whats the date female voice 5th of march fifth of march five march ad 14 saint hill special briefing course little news bulletin here you know you know the nervousness with which you go on for tv demonstration well just about the complete total exclamatory height of that has just been reached melbourneyou know theyre having hearings on scientology you see the legislature of the great state of victoriathats just south of the deserts thereyou heard thats the government of australia actually it isnt the government of australia thats just the government of victoria thats formerly the government of australia so that its old comm lines are in and its been raising the devil and we finally found out who was doing it it was the bmas committeea doctor daks arms with yak i mean it rhymes with yak anyway weve gradually consistently been winning here and they were coming down on it and they were raising the devil with history of man they were doing all kinds of things and so forth the moment the government began to attack scientology the newspapers started to swing in favor of it the wheel has turned the wheel has turned and those hearings are going very successfully and the people conducting them are getting more and more friendly more and more friendly what swung the day saint hill graduate audited pcs of the selection of the legislature on tv for the hearing running such things as r2h and so forth and he was knocking off cases left and right and the last one he ran why the board was trying to get note to him in hurry not to stop because they wanted to hear the rest of it they were all sitting there absorbed and anxious andto get it all and very interested and laughing in the right places and but thats definitely duty above and beyond the call of well theywe win were definitely on the way now i wasalready started running my goals plot and you miss something here or there trouble is ive had holes run in my goals lineup you see so i can get to certain pointall of the research on this was done on two banks mary sues and myself and the biggest weight of it had to be carried by my bank so weive had lot of gpms run out out of sequence dont you see and so forth and boy you hit one of those and you dont know whether its gone or not you know i mean from standpoint of did you get all the items in it and the difficulties of actual gpms is the goals series are consecutive and it just goes in over and over and over and over same goals series same goals series same goals series same plots with different gpms you see same line plot but different gpms and they just go on and on so you run out one youre immediately convinced you couldnt possibly have run it out because of course its sitting on one ofthe same one of the earlier series so it looks like all the goals are alive there so if you run one too deep you fall through you go into an earlier goals series well the only way you can turn on somatic and tear pcs head off skip some goals well try skipping fortytwo at one fell swoop and this can be pretty gruesome so its dicey just to this degree the more we get to one of these gpms of mine that has been run previously the question is have the items been run out of it all or havent they been run out of it since if you simply bypass it and start the next one you see you turn on some very interesting somatics by reason of bypassed charge if there is any very very very gruesome but in any event were making very very nice progress and theres enough gpms there to please almost anybody i just want to give you some kind of an idea of exactly what you face i wouldnt want to upset you anyway but youve got fifteen thousand of them isnt that horrible in consecutive serieses of fortytwo theres fortytwo goals fortytwo lps they never change but theyre consecutive and they just go fortytwo and another fortytwo and another fortytwo and another fortytwo theyre all the same and they get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger as you go backbigger and bigger and bigger i suppose some of the early track rissome of the early track ris are about the size of mount vesuvius i dont think youd ever get anywhere near one but anyway the gpms this lecture doesnt concern this im just giving you some notes on it the lecture concerns case analysis the first seriesthe present time seriesyou will find itwe proved this conclusively last night and if you dont get it right your pc goes into sad effect which is something on the order of bailing out of an airplane with parachute at about fifteen thousand feet sad effect youve seen sad effect take place by somebody being audited up against some arc breaks youve seen pc im sure get sadder and sadder over period of couple of weeks till somebody kindly found the bypassed charge and so forth well this sad effect takes place in about four or five seconds you get the wrong gpm to start the series with you see to begin with and youre running the pc where there is none only hes trying to pick up the items from the second series which are fortytwo gpms away because there isnt any goal formed yet in the first series at that point and you hit sad effect that is just like that fifteen thousand feet bailout of the airplane with parachute and youre just about to catch up with sad effect just that fast i never hit toboggan so quick in my life and we actually were quite unwilling to believe because weve had so many troubles with truncated you knownot all the gpm formed but the idea of not all the first series formed yet see the line plot incompletely formed and then the first series of goals the first fortytwo goals on the track from present time back you see only some of those formed you see moving up from fortytwo on toward present time you see but i had become frankly very bored with the whole subject of truncated anything you see so we were saying just to hell with it and we started in at gpm number one i told the auditor i said i thinki dont think the two items which were calling for here for gpm number one ii dont think those are standard theres something about the first two items on the track that are not standard and id started to list some odd randoms and the auditor said to oh well your proper item here is and gave number one gpm top oppterm see well it was just exactly like stepping out of an airplane with parachute because that gpm wouldnt have been formed for four more gpms i wasi was perfectlyi was perfectly correct the items i should get to begin this series were not the items on the line plot but the third pair of the fifth gpm or the fifth goal of the series that was all the gpm existed at that point there was gpmthere was upper fifth the last five pairs of the fifth were missing the fourth was missing the third was missing the second was missing and the first was missing which is very interesting took us quite while to untangle this situation bemostly because we had just stopped believing in truncated anythings because wed been bitten too many times find number one gpm oh its truncated run couple of items out of it and the pc wraps around telegraph pole see the rest of it was there dont you see so it was crying wolf one too many times and when we confronted the real article of real truncation and so forth we were all set just to abandon the whole subject and there we went bang and the auditor did arc break assessments and so forth trying to knock out this sad effect you see and decided wed gotten rid of it and audited awhile and obviously hadnt gotten rid of it and so forth and then with great brilliance after some hours finallymust be truncated the series must be truncated and the goal is truncated hadnt even formed the whole series much less just one goal truncated the series was truncated so you can expectyou can do your line plot as long as you talk about goalsthe first goal of the series the second goal the first actual goal in the series the second actual goal as soon as you start saying the first actual gpm of the series youll probably get away with this but of course its not there the first actual gpm of the first series undoubtedly is not there but of course the pc does know and you can get the response of the first actual goal of the series you see quite fascinating proposition this quantitative approach i can tell you you have fifteen thouswe had the first evidence first real evidence that person does make these things himself makes them exactly according to preconceived line plot which everybody has in common youve learned your lesson well lord knows when before the track began or something of the sort you knew just exactly where to put what and it doesnt vary from pc to pc its the most marvelous thing you ever saw in your life and theres fortytwo goals in the series and they go in certain harmonics and its all taped you see well it isnt too peculiar you look at body itevery body has liver and it has left ear and so forth well gpms are exactly this way and thats why it takes trained auditor because this is tricky stuff man tricky stuff an untrained auditor running one of these things against its actual line plot wrap pc around telegraph pole so fast the pc wouldnt know what hit him somebody in keokuk offers up his goal to be very good girl all the time see so the auditor takes this lp thats more her acan actual gpm or an actual goal than the man in the moontakes this line plot he will be able to get fragments of items maybe out of goal to be good or something like this you see and to get those fragments of items partially run out of sequence with all of the gpms skipped before you get to it pc all of sudden feels the head being severed in half stomach torn in two different directions the four corners of the room go into complete outofplumbness and you see why were not releasing this materials indiscriminately ive seen some of the things people have been willing to buy as goals thaahh its fascinating you know everybodys very interested in the second dynamic and so on and wethere are actual second dynamic goals far as i can tell i have never found one never seen one might be goal an actual gpm to feel or to something or other you see or to have sensation or something like this but there are sexual goals otherwise youll see goals like that to suffer and to enjoy life or something like this you might see something like that but thats about as close as it comes to it lot of implant gpms to be sexual you see to have sex all that sort of thing we owe to papa freud you see this tradition that if you audit somebody you should get into the second dynamic and heres funny one for you ive never seen case crackedneverby touching on the second dynamic isnt that interesting the only thing freud got on resurgence on patientsbecause he hit the second dynamic it was fruitful source of withholds so hed get one withhold see so he got one withhold auditor worthy of his salt who cant pull fifteen twenty thirty withholds in session withhold session ought to quit anyhow see so hed work for seven years to get one withhold off see but this gives us tradition tradition that the second dynamic is something we should operate on of course its pleasant to operate its not without its recompense from the standpoint of titillation and so forth and its interesting to listen to some girl or some young man get rid of all of their second dynamic peccadillos of one kind or another it makes good stuff but better stuff for true romances than auditor reports so im afraid i havent much faith in that i want to talk to you today about case analysis and this succeeds in the various lectures that ive been giving you here lately and youve been making very very good use out of those lectures and i thank you very much this is the stuff of which case supervision is made and if you really want towant to be good case supervisor youd have to know all this stuff cold and if you want to be good auditing supervisor and so forth well you ought to be able to whipstall this stuff back and forth and upside down and if you want to be marvelous case cracker of some kind or another to homo sap without going up to ot if you want to stay in the lower levels then youd better hear this lecture this is how to become healing wizard and upset the ama healing is not in mans tradition its not in his tradition as such its usually in the tradition of graft or fraud or picking on the poor dear departed theyve had six hundred successful kidney implants and transfers in the medical profession in the united states in the last couple of years taken kidney from one person put it in another person theyve had six hundred of them which is marvelous i think theyre to beto be credited with this great deal pavlov used to swap kidneys around and hearts and things amongst dogs and theyre right in the tradition there and obviously somebody cant live without kidney or without his kidneys or something of this sort so its good thing to transplant kidneys but to give you some kind of an idea of the validity of medical report on the subject of healing im not berating the medical doctor you need plumbers you need medical doctors somebodys got leak in the pipes why you should have somebody there who knows how to operate blowtorch and put some lead on them but thats just about the end product theyre talkingnow theyre going upstairs into healing now that isnt healing thats plumbing and what do you get what do you get you get six hundred kidney transplants and then they dont bother to tell anybody that the whole ruddy crop of them died within two years some of them died in days and some of them died in weeks and some in months and the longest lived ones were two years i think its very interesting commentary on the released data you see now these are the boys who are coming down on us and raising the devil with any group that is trying to handle any subject like healing and their first accusation is fraud well youre acquainted with the overt motivator sequence i am sure guy will always accuse somebody else of committing the overts which he is committing because you see he needs the motivators hes got scarcity of motivators and so there it is well these boys these boys have given healing rather bad name and over the period of years healing has ebbed and flowed and gone up and down and weve had barbers and phlebotomy and goofy activities and the aesculapians used to keep high rate down there i was down few years ago alongside the parthenon taking look at the old grounds where the aesculapians used to heal people and they have great big bath swimming bath there and they used to dump them in this as holy springs and that sort of thing the remains of their old buildings are there scattered down the slope and its quite interesting but even as many years after their last activities and so forth their tradition survives and their tradition locally in athens is thatwell they were they were pretty slippery people because if anybody looked like he was getting worse why they quickly and quietly removed him to his home so that he would die there and then published abroad you see the fact that they had practically hundred percent healing record well their hundred percent record was based upon those they kept who would get well got well and those they didnt keep of course were longer part of their records but it was even dicey then back in the time of socrates and coming up the line man knowing nothing about the mind knowing nothing about the preconceived efforts of individuals to aberrate themselves knowing none of the more basic fundamentals of existence that well not even knowing about overts the best way they could handle overts was repent repent the kingdom of heaven is at hand thats the way you did your overts and so forth iand its not an adequate process so anyway here washere was the mind of man ready to upset the most cunning devices which were about to heal somebody so man more or less went into structure and got healing very closely associated with structure because somebody had broken leg you could at least set the broken leg and so forth and his mosthis most successful areas of healing of course knowing nothing about the mind had to do then with structure and he could see obviously that he could set broken leg you see something like that he knew nothing about disease and to this day knows nothing about disease and i was on the heels of disease not too long ago i found that gpm if you fragmented it and it slapped you in the face or something like that that you could develop for instance sty in the eye or something like this and apparently infection has something to do with actual gpms now we dont know whether it had anything to do with bacteria or not in spite of the fact you can see the bugs wiggle under microscope i dont know what that proves see nobody has ever proven that it proved anything because there are enough variables in it to make other theories possible in order for something to be true it has to be sweepingly true it cant be partially true there are such things as partial truths something that is true on monday tuesday and wednesday may be only vaguely workable but it isnt true if it is not true on thursday friday and saturday then there must be something wrong with that truth so man tended to go into structure and he really has healing background because healing was done by the body by the individual it was not done by the doctor the doctor would arrange the parts so that they would grow back together again and hope that the patient would do the rest you see so the healing was always resident upon the individual who was injured or ill and until you have cracked the problem of the individual wish to be well or sick until youve cracked the problem of how the individual influences his own healing of course healing is impossiblebroad broad healing is impossible so wonder man has been up against it and wonder his healing associations or activities or practitioners very often fall within the frameworks of fraud or monopoly and he goes in two directions he either tries to make healing practice legal by becoming monopoly and getting laws passed that enforce it as theis the case with psychiatry you know its against the law in some states not to electric shock somebody you know you see itsthey become monopoly and get laws passed to enforce it you see or they stay as somebody who is still trying still trying one way or the other in the field of healing but actually for financial reasons and so forth passing off into the borderlines of fraud promising cures that cannot be delivered and so forth so he varied man varied between these two activities in the center ground there were some fellows who hoped you could heal something that would try to heal something that wouldwho would make some effort of it but the main bodies of healing professions have sharply divided into these two classes up through the years so you can say theres three classes those who were still trying to heal something those who knew they couldnt and were charging for it anyway and those who were trying to enforce healing practices by monopoly the modern medico and psychiatric professions and so forth have chosen the monopoly road as their method of progress in this particular line to this they have joined research and theirresearch is quite racket these days ityouthey can work it up so that they can devour billions of dollars in research and you notice that its research somebody has to have discovered something for the stuff to be researched so they fall back on such people as the witches the witchcraft and so on and they get various types of healing that they drag out of the hinterland and they go over these things at vast rate this is not an exaggeration by the way this is discovery of foxglove digitalis and so forth well used consistently used by the people in scotland for various cures of various things and well known in its dosages and so forth and one day student at edinburgh happened to be out in the country and happened to find out something about it and actually devoted his life trying to get the doctors to use this stuff that the witches had already been using for long time this is usually the background the background of such material and so research research has amounted to fabulous sums of money and therell be promoter and he will get together great deal of research money and then he will turn loose teams of quote scientists one way or the other unquote on this and recorders of some kind or another and they plow into it and busily busily busily busily busily muck about and write papers and then read each others papers and then rewrite the papers of somebody elses you see and fill up file cases full of stuff and they come to some very remarkable conclusions one of the remarkable conclusions which theyve come to recently is there is such thing as standard science i think thats very remarkable conclusion because outside of the field of the exact sciences socalled which are very inexact physics chemistry and all that to call anything standard science you see or orthodox science and so forth well that would be one thing but to use it in courts of law to demonstrate that something is or is not true demonstrate that it isnt true because it isnt accepted by orthodox science of course is to bang the door shut on searchnot research but on search so the door is kept pretty well shut on the subject of search by those who seek to dominate the field of healing by monopoly they have to keep that door shut because at any time somebody might discover something they feel and so on this is not selfthis is not an egocentric lecture of what is happening to us it just happens to be abecause it isnt really happening to us you would be amazed of how little of it is happening to us were getting lashback from their efforts against other healing activities and the reason theyre laying an egg is is were not really not basically healing activity you see and they really havent anything they can put their paws on so they have great difficulty in their understanding of what its all about we dont fit you see into their twocamped group the monopolist and the fand the honest frauds so as we dont fit into these groups we dont easily communicate what we are doing to these fellows because they have certain stylized methods of thinking about these things well sooner or later sooner or later in spite of all this in any society certain discoveries get made harvey firestone dropped some raw rubber on kitchen stove and finds out that its now pliable and usable which it never has been before and all of sudden we have rubber industry or something like this various accidental or on purpose discoveries get made and the society pushes along and these things get developed and researched and then researched and researched and researched and then somebody comes up and finds out that ruddy rods really didnt exist in the first place and thats brandnew discovery dont you see and takes off on new line of scien quote scientific approach for research research research you see vast sums of money expended there are great many fraudulent activities go on in the united states and abroad concerning concerning research money for instance the american medical profession gets itselfthe medical association gets itself big propaganda campaign going against cigarettes even gets town councils sufficiently upset down in texas to make it i think three years in prison for anybody caught smoking cigarette on the street and that went into law just few months ago i mean im not exaggerating it its matter of record and theyre not going to investigate people in their homes and theyre not going to bother tourists going through the town but their local residents have had it if theyre seen smoking in public well theyve got this bigbigbig smoke going if youll pardon the pun and theyve got all of this hammer pound and blast of various kinds ason the subject of tobacco what was this all about i dont think youll hear too much more about it in the near future but for while it was very hot and very heavy indeed ireading i think in pogo the joke of the general was going to be shot and they blindfold him and offer him last cigarette and the general goes straight up and screams in their faces my god havent you read the report of the surgeon general see marvelous gag what was that all about well the tobacco companies have finally run up the white flag and theyve given the ten million dollars in research to the american medical association that was required of them in the first place im afraid you wont hear much more about that now because the blackmail has been accomplished im not giving you anything inside track ive given you associated press reports straight on the wire its aits method of getting funds dont you see so you want to know what our meter case is all about is anybody interested in meters in the united states they werent interested in meters during this entire time they werent interested in meters they were hammering and pounding around trying to get more appropriation for the food and drug administration so they were making great deal of smoke they were just hammer and shand shout and bing and bang and theyve got more legislation now theyve got legislation which is very very full of teeth and theyve gotten their appropriated funds and unlessif of course they want some more funds we may still hear about the emeter see but the probability is we may hear nothing about it at all they simply drop it it was mechanism by which to obtain research funds from the united states government they just collected bunch of odd things that they never had to prove but could shout into the papers about and make big confusion about dont you see and shake congress down for some money so researchresearch is very current and is the thing to do all that sort of thing so anything that were traveling along on islooks very strange to these chaps looks very strange because things are being found out and things are being done dont you see and so on well thats because research isnt being used as means of obtaining money do you see and the materials involved are not being dedicated to the creation of monopoly and theyre not being dedicated to fraud that makes us very peculiar so we become incomprehensible but then of course we would have been incomprehensible from viewpoint of the monopolist or the fraud or any of these fellows in any society at any time in the past because we travel forward on the assertion that there was such thing as truth and actually that it was dangerous to know halftruth and carrying forward in this particular direction one could possibly succeed in bettering the lot of his fellows and himself you see but weve come to that point in our development where our goals and dedications which is greater freedom and greater state of beingness which state of beingness by the way is beyond the imagination of the ordinary manhaving parted company to that degree and ascended above his level of reality it is necessary then to bridge in the fellow in the street on up well the classifications plan is part of that it brings him in at certain levels and moves him on up along the line now with the advent of certain recent techniques based on early work it becomes possible to make freedom from psychosomatic illness one of the gains of one of the lower levels this is so easy to do that it puts us into the front rank of healing it is not direction that is particularly desirable direction it is not direction which has very good bedfellows but if you enter the field where theyall areexist in that field are monopolists and frauds what do you think youre going to do what do you thinks going to happen what catastrophe is liable to occur here well in the first place youll be fought by the monopolists and shunned by the frauds so the first thing you should know about healing i have just got through telling youthe nature and state of the world of healing as man now knows it divided up more or less in that fashion and the second thing you should know about healing that if youre moving up into the field of healing heal that is the one thing that would move you through and get you through in other words if youre going to heal heal dont heal in order to just heal and youll find out that this becomes relatively simple activity now almost any one of you going into community would find yourself in very very desirable position if you started healing people you would be up against the monopolist on the one hand and the fraud on the other hand the ins and the outs you know youll be up against the government of healing but if you could lick that in some particular fashion then the fellow down at the garage with lumbosis and the fellow up the line with swellisis these birds these birds would carry the day now the only reason you dont get into that field much is youre talking about making the able more able and so on but it doesnt mean that it isnt fruitful field for the auditor if the auditor had tools with which he could heal and if he could use those tools adequately and if he could go up against the closed circle of the monopolists and actually escape the wrath of the frauds and so on hed probably make himself very wealthy and very famous indeed this would be thethis would be the gamut however he would run and one should look at that with some reality i dont for moment say that you cant get away with it thatits easy to get away withim just showing you what you have to get away with thats all its just factual statement now if you made your business at the lower levels that when somebody came into scientology with psychosomatic illnesses and so on this person was rid of theseif you rid the person of theseproviding you had given him some earlier indoctrination providing you had given him some earlier training providing he had someplace to go and providing you didnt do it all in an afternoon but made him come to several meetings before anything was doneyou get the idea hes only got one goal being there he wants to be rid of his lumbosis well you just better make sure that his horizon is bit wider open dont you see lets make sure that his horizon is just bit wider before we take his lumbosis away from him otherwise he falls back into his indoctrinated classifications ofthere is somebody who heals and there is somebody who fixes pipes and there isyou know this specialized society the road that he would be walking would be blocked just to the degree that he thinks his goal in life would be to get rid of his lumbosis well this means then that to go at healing on the standard pattern of opening up an office somewhere and hanging out sign that you heal lumbosis and so forth is not the way to go about it at all but oddly enough you do have in your hands whether you have any reality on it or not you have in your hands the means of healing now i relapse into some instructor sarcasm here on the basisof course if you go on auditing the way ive seen some of you audit lately you never got prayer in hell of doing anything but thats just aan aside im afraid i saw somebody yesterday running double qanda process on pc there every time the pc answered the question i heard the auditor interjecting something to find out something else that had something else to do with something else and we had an auditing cycle there which was perpetuity we had complete auditing cycles of any kind whatsoever you do things like that of course youre never going to heal anything but were just going to leave that aside that wasnt too bad now given then the ability to do an auditing cycle given the ability to handle the session given an ability to read meter see given these fundamentals there exists actually technology that you know ofand it will surprise you great deal when i reintroduce you to itthat is totally capable of healing any disease or illness to which man is subject of chronic nature any chronicim talking now about the difference between acute and chronic acute is somebody who gets cold and he has cold for week and then its gone now that is an acute illness and that is opposed to that is opposed to another type of illness which would be chronic and that you would then call sinusitis or something he hadsort of had cold all the time see thats different so the difference between acute and chronic is just time duration now of course somebody can split hairs and say how long does an acute have to be acute in order to become chronic and so forth well ill leave that up to you since its your question the division line is not that sharp well i think somebody whos been bothered with cold for year you see im afraid thats chronic so the way you do separate the line i wont i wont quip with you theres way you do separate this lineis when an illness exceeds its expected course we can call it chronic and thats fairly sloppy definition but its quite workable within certain limits when an illness exceeds its expected duration you can call it chronic this fellowthis fellowordinarily ordinarily people recover from scraped knee in matter of week or two see certainly they have nothing more to dotheir knee would longer be showing abrasions and contusions after week or two see but for some reason or other this fellows knee month or two later is still in bad state of dishabille what then is this well this must be something chronic then see weve moved over into that field now that is what we mean although we can say all illnesses are basically psychosomatic not seventy percent of them all of them are basically psychosomatic wed have to pull some torturous mental logic in order to get some of them into this classification you say broken neck is psychosomatic well yes the fellow had to have rocks in his head in order to make mistake that would cause him to break his neck theres certainly evenyou say well how about an accident fellow going along in an airlinewell youre dealing with fellow who iswho is very happy to get into this type of argument it gives so much latitude for imagination you see you say well how about this fellow thats gotten busted up in an airplane crash you say there must have been something wrong with his intuition not to know that if he went he was going to crash he must have had bad judgment or something like that see you can even get silly on the subject of accidents this way but we dont have to get that silly to demonstrate the psychosomatic nature of illness in the first place psychosomatics begin with the acquisition of body so that makes them all psychosomatic doesnt it guess that dealt with that subject now well how come this fellows stuck in body well that would be very large problem and that doesnt get settled until you get up there into class vi or something like that to anybodys satisfaction see so itll stay that way so obviously thats beyond the range of healing and one of the first lessons you should learn on the subject of healing is that because you can see the individual is sick from something is reason why you should treat it in other words diagnosis immediately flies out of your hands as an unnecessary and often retarding activity theres really not much difference between diagnosis and evaluation and evaluation is more or lesswell it is forbidden by the auditors code so that just knocks out in actual fact diagnosis now were talking about healing diagnosis you see to say what this fellow was suffering from is an adventurous statement because it may be so purely psychosomatic that it isnt nose at all dont you see now ive conducted some experiments in hypnotism inearly on longer using anything like hypnotism never did use it in this particular field but its terrific terrific piece of research material and ive caused somebodys nose to run for two or three hours he had the worst cold you ever saw in your life person didnt have any cold at all caused the persons nose to run simply by an hypnotic commandwhen you wake them up theyre going to have cold and their nose is going to run up until the time you snap your fingers and say abracadabra see so person wakes up and he has cold for two or three hours and im telling you that nose will really run its quite startling you say how on earth could they get into that condition and then say abracadabra see and noit justits gone you know slightest residue runny nose nothing you see unpleasant subject but it was unpleasant to the person going the experiment too whats this all about once youve conducted few of these experiments theres not much doubt in your mind that the autosuggestion or the various mental mechanisms of the individual himself can bring about or perpetuate any illness theres not any doubt in your mind after youve conducted few of these but you have in actuality the genus of psychosomatic illness in the matter of suggestion now to scientologist suggestion becomes postulation and much more clearly stated proposition because actually nothing can be suggested to the individual that he himself has not earlier postulated theres nothing nothing can be suggested to the individual who has not himself earlier postulated it which is quite remarkable and people can figure out well theyre not guilty of any overt acts because if everybody does it to themselvesoh yes youre guilty of an overt act of keying it in on them because its now gone beyond their power pretty good eh youpeople try to argue themselves out of the fact there are overt acts well the only overt act would be key in what the individual had once had intended to happen anyway but nevertheless it is an overt act so if these things can be produced hypnotically under laboratory conditions and if these things can be produced by suggestion and if key ins can occur of persons past experiences or postulates and if rather violent reactions and malformations can be brought about in this way then we see the genus of illness is psychosomatic the individual must have willed the destruction of body before his own body could even be bent out of shape this is the philosophic lineup and it happens to be an actual one he must have conceived the possibility of breaking legs before you could break his leg in fact he must have broken few most pathetic picture of psychosomatic illness i ever heard of was bird who made his living of grabbing people up dark alleys and hitting them in the jaw and taking the money out of their pockets its very very interesting that his arm with which he did the hitting even yet was paralyzed from the shoulder to the wrist he could sort of hitch his back around in some particular way and still strike blow with that arm he was still doing so this ostensibly traced back to the point that he used to be beaten up by newsboy who took all of his money away from him when he was small newsboy this bigger newsboy you know took all his money away from him and the hold on the track was one morning he almost hit his mother when she woke him up and this practically broke his heart and more or less paralyzed his arm well thats all very interesting but you know that fighter nearly always postulates paralysis of the other fellows arm well now it really isnt then what happens to the individual that brings about the psychosomatic illness its what the individual is willing to happen and as crooked and as upside down and backwards as that often looks we nevertheless can trace these things back to that if we go all the way but the odd part of it is it is not either possiblenow hear this very carefullyit is neither possible nor necessary to trace the psychosomatic illness to its genus and erase it in order to cure it it is neither possible nor necessary to trace psychosomatic illness to its self generated genus you see that is to say the individuals own intention of having it and erase that in order to cure psychosomatic illness the word cure is used advisedly and why is that well he doesnt have to have keyin to make his postulates come true but when one of his early postulates suddenly mysteriously materializes in the physical universe and he doesnt know anything about it it was necessary for something else around him to key it in so the key in is otherdeterminism now this is very very slippery you shyou should get this verythis is one of those things iyour jaws almost dropped off your faces the other day when i told you that an arc break assessment waswell id already told you that in an earlier lecture and you all said oh yes yes yes put it all down in your notebooks and you were all very happy about it so forth and then when i told you in the last lecture i gave you that you never audit during an arc break i thought your faces were going to fall apart i never saw such silence occur in all directions in my life and yet thats the obvious conclusion from the earlier datum i gave you how did it surprise you so much so dont be surprised at this one see when it all of sudden comes up and hits you in the face because its the same kind of datum you see the individual did it himself but when he did it himself he knew he did it himself dont you see and if its happening and he doesnt know that hes doing it himself then it must be the result of keyin you see its this old intention has been activated which he has not wot of he doesnt know hes doing this but something has happened that causes it to go into action hypnotism for instance is merely keyin of the persons own basic postulations theres such thing as an othercontrolled human being but there is such thing as an otherkeyedin human being lets put up gag here that will drive this home little more closely lets take this fellow we want him to become prisoner we want him to become prisoner of some kind or another so we lock him up well how are we able to do that this isthis is marvelous you mean you can lock up thetan you can puzzle this one over philosophically for some time how does this come about that anybody can be put in jail ive had to crack lot of these conundrums along the line and disentangle an awful lot of things in order to get data on which life operates and that was one of the stoppers how in the name of common sense could you ever lock anybody up if it is true that man is spirit and so forth how does it ever come about well it must have come aboutit eventually materializesand when you get up to class vi you certainly know why and how he had to lock himself up first he had to lock himself up before you could ever lock him up and the only thing you can do is key in his locking himself up however hes doing it its about the only way you can ever make prisoner actually in an environment if youre going to govern it well or keep it calm you must be careful of whats being keyed incareful of whats being keyed in youve seen civilized men im sure go into heavhigh level of bestiality when faced by war the most fantastic things occur in war and so on well how come well its the keyinness of the environment it isnt war does this it gives enough keyins to key in his bestialities and they were absentthat is like sleeping dogs lying quietly behind the chair until all of sudden why youve got bunch of keyins going now you could key in all sorts of viciousness so you can key lots of things in on being because he is basically complex person very complex thetan is unbelievably numerously prepostulated do you know that you can just find 212 locks on an individual practically as long as he will sit still and years after youre liable to take the same case and find out hey what do you know theyve all been off one actual ri you know heres fifteen thousand gpms you multiply thats rough number but you multiply that by the sixteen ris there are in bank thats sixteen times fifteen thousand see and then recognize that any one of those items from that result can have thousands of locks we can add it up to mans extreme individual age which is very extreme hes had tremendous quantities of experience you see so theres an almost unlimited fund of things to key in you can key in almost any combination its not even hard to do he may not be master of his own destiny but he is sure victim of his own postulation so anyway anyway to make long story short here what are you healing when youre healing with psychosomatics what are you handling out of your reach if youre belowauditing below the level of classes v and vicompletely out of your reach are the basic postulations which brought about the conditions you just say that just cut it off right there at v and below that man thats out of your reach its out of the reach of the individual its out of the reach of the lower auditing skills and fortunately is not necessary to effect cure because were now dealing with very lowlevel auditing result believe it make awfully spectacular to somebody whos going along and had headaches headaches headaches headaches all his life to cease to have this headache thats very spectacular so this looks fabulous as result see this looks huge as result well its result compared to the retainattainable results dont you see likeso you can feed him some cereal or you canyou can look at tree i mean thereit isnt anything spectacular and unless you cease to regard it as miraculous thing you seeitsif you cease toyou have to take it out of the religious tradition entirely although ithealing probably belongs more securely in religion you have to take it out of the tradition that religion has assigned to it which is this fellow was sainti dont care how much you let the public believe this thats beside the point this fellow was saint man he washe was terrific magnificent fellow just marvelous cured boils pure pure evidence of his godliness he could cure boils thats the religious tradition with regard to healing and you just have to stop regarding it with that much awe because its not that complicated and it basically also is not done by feeding him some more illness spoonful by spoonful he will bust out in lots of side effects because to cure him youre keying in something else this fellows had suffering from these two cycles of action see theseoutthese arethese two steps on the cycle of action first he had to determine it but that may be in such an unthinkably long past that we dont want that much to do with that next he had to do it to somebody or something and then for him to mysteriously get ill and not recognize what it is he has to receive keyin something has to be done to him which restimulates it now nothing violent has to be done to him so it might be something quite mild has to be done to him i wot an experience that was happening to i used to havewhen i was very little boy in this lifetime i used to have sore throats around my grandmother and she used to singwhose song is it the little toy dog is covered with rust you know and the tin soldier you know that sort of thing whatever the quote is on the thing very sad song shed sing that song to well she wasnt giving sore throat but she was sure as hell kicking in picking up baby in 1870 and having his heart stop beating and looking up and seeing little toy dog sitting alongside of his crib see gave good sore throat got the idea in other words there was an action dont you see there was symbol which represented the event and here is the symbol mysteriously reappearing in song from beloved person so you see youre not looking for violence youre just looking for keyin and it may be anything may be anything well the first two of these thingsthe first one that is the business of class v vi vii those particularly class vi and that is such restimulative process that sick person probably couldnt do it whole thing is defeative action trying to handle this i notice some of you every time your pc doesnt feel well reaching for an l4 now its calledit should be called an l6 arc break assessment sheet to get his gpms in order thats pretty heroic that isnt what you should be reaching for at all as unless youre going to run him out the only thing you can do is pull him out if youre going to run him out all right thats class vi man and thats the whole operation not devoted to illness believe thats the whole operation from one end to the other that is full complete overhaul you jack up the car and put new one under it nothing to do with healing so you can just cancel out all of your handling of gpms implant engrams all this sort of thing all running this kind of thing and what youve been calling case analysis on the thing and getting that to cure somebody ofjust knock it out man has nothing to do with healing you can do some remarkable things with it with very advanced auditor who is probably all ready to do so and the other day i handled ptpheres little twobit ptpby simply finding the gpm that was causing it but this on pc who has practically complete line plot you see this persons already on the way so you dontyou dont fool around with those things those are basic causation see youll find all this basic causation lies in that particular line but you dont want anything to do with that in healing now the person in doing this to somebody else probably did it so long ago and it is so far off course of any current activity at all that to get the basic overt on the track is equallywell actually its something you would probably never do nowi mean you probably never will pick up the basic overts on the track you see theres point once youve got the first postulates out why pick up the overts that keyed them in but you can pick up the keyin of the overt so weve got another factor going here of subdivision under the heading of keyin so theres another kind of keyin he does another little overt that keys in the big overt see so theres the big postulate followed by the big overt so you get it up into pt present life sort of thing where he got this little tiny little tiny thing done to him where he got little tiny overt and you can make people well with just handling those little things yeah its all whisk broom stuff you dont even have to know the basic postulates you dont even have to know its complexity you dont even have to know the basic otherlife waybackwhen overts these you dont have to have anything to do with at all to make person well its only necessary to bail him out of his keyins and mark my words for homo sap you better not try to do anything else than just bail him out of his keyins what would spoil you as an auditor is to find this occasional and rare bird whose lumbosis suddenly disappeared because you found the first helatrobus on him or something see that would practically ruin you because after that youd be looking for the heroic now you see youre perfectly right as an auditor perfectly right as an auditor to know that there is great big postulate miles wide broad and deep which is attainable on this ease youre perfectly correct in assuming that there is such thing on this case you know that instinctively because youre always going for it youre perfectly correct youre perfectly correct in assuming that theres great big huge overt act on the backtrack you know he burned civilization down or something youre perfectly correct in assuming this and because you down deep yourself know this you have tendency to go for it to get out prime cause youre not going to do that by the nature of case and by the thousands and thousands of hours and years of research done on this very subject without doing whole class vi ectomy that postulates too big its too tricky its anatomy is too huge to be handled with the whisk broom that youre going to audit somebody with so the only thing you have to do is to pick up the keyin whether the keyin is an overt or what we dont care but all you have to do is pick up the keyin and you try to pick it up as close to present time as you can you dont try to pick it up as early as you canyou try to pick it up effectively as close to pt as you can now someday youre going to be very unlucky and youre going to find somebody with chronic twistosis who didnt get it keyed in in this lifetime and now youre going to be in little bit of trouble and youre going to have very protesting person and youre going to find yourself suddenly slopping over into 1861 i did this one time polio case ill at two years with polio and it dived instantly and straight back to about three lifetimes ago in the middle of the nineteenth century and that was one of the most unwilling screaming pcs i ever had anything to do with because it was of course by that time jammed up so that it was quite painful pc had reality on any other lifetime and yet any time the pc tried to give anything about it why this other incident would come up which was over hundred years ago you see itd practically been keyed in solidly continuously ever since it was an unlucky break the way to take it apart was to pick up the keyin closest to pt that could be picked up hed even pick up the keyin of the keyin you understand not to the big keyin was too tough pc was going straight back to it straight stuck in it there they were bang and he couldnt do anything else move him out of it apparently moved him out of it and so forth and the proper course of action there was to pick in keyinup keyin of the keyin or pick up the latest overt on that subject the latest overt on the subject might beyou see this is all softly softly see this is all quietly this is all with the feather duster youre perfectly correct in knowing that theres target there very suitable for eighteeninch guns see youre perfectly correct in this but youre not correct in the field of lowerlevel healing in going for it so if all i could teach you if all i could teach you was just this that yes theres great big postulate yes yes yes yes great big postulate oh yeah tremendous experiences that go back over god knows how many years yes yes yes theyre all there yes theres overts there that made that postulate backfire and gave him switch of valences and all that sort of thing yes yeah oh definitely yes yes yes thats there we agree with all this and then teach you all we want is their keyins and the lightest keyin of that that we can approach and thats all we want then i could teach you to heal because healing is not in actual fact very highclass activity in spite of the fact that it has so much relief now compare the fact that well i cured her bunions as statement to i restored being to his full intelligence ethics and power im afraid thats far more godlike see they are not comparable activities but if you know that about healing if you know that about healing and know about what this field consists of that its the thetan versus the body in his own worries anyhow and you do it lightly why then i could open the door to that degree to show you how towell just heal anything you walked into but if iif i cant teach you that and make that one point first and have you understand that and think it over and look it over understand it thoroughly then you get trapped into going for prime postulate see on the subject you get trapped into going for the dramatics of the prime overts you see and so forth and youryou as scientologist could probably make it but not the guy youre auditing and you wont heal thats the first thing to learn now you can see that that must be very interesting lesson in view of the fact that practically nobody in the field of healing has ever learned it in the history of man see so its not much of lesson it looks that at first glance but just let call it to your attention that it really has never really come to anybodys attention theres little mention here or there perhaps amongst the various records you could probably find something ofyou shouldnt use such heroic methods you know that sort of thingbut its the very very lightest of the methods that succeed and these heavy ones such as well fellow has headache all the time well lets cut out his brain well those fields are not successful because that is the physical effort to get to the ultimate postulate simply being dramatized by the healing practitioner of course you being smarter and better educated as to what there is there to reach for have to practice in actual fact little more restraint because you know what to head for you say well this guy this guy looks like hes had his head bashed in i wonder whose head he bashed in see on the backtrack all right whose head did he bash in oh well lets see lets go back lets get it on the meter all right and so on now lets find the first head he ever bashed in youd probably get it too see and hed have his head bashed in all right hed have it bashed in completely when time you got through because you could handle it as the auditor but could he handle it as the pc and youll probably wake up at the end of the thing with finding the other side of his head is now bashed in he wouldnt have made the grade your proper course of action is not withholding yourself from doing so but just understanding the basic mechanics of how that thing is keyed in and then taking out the little bits that keep it keyed in and the mystery of it all is is why it all drops away and will key out thats the miracle how come it can be keyed out as thoroughly as it can be and yet it can be keyed out with great thoroughness and the destimulation of the incident was easily the thing that will produce your great miracles of course the fellows going to run on the backtrack hes going to get into actual gpms hes going to get into the stuff of which life is made one way or the other he may collide with his own overts and he may not and when he finally gets back there why oh yeah there was plenty of reason for him to do so and hes actually likely to pick up the whole somatic ten times as strong all over again particularly if you make little mistake as an auditor or something like that but itll be gone then because hes in the position and doing the process which is competent of erasure but hes not in position to do that when you first find him so the field of healing will remain closed door unless you find out that it can be done lightly on tiptoe lightly thank you
