date here you have an educated thetan thetan who knows enough to handle the problems of the mest universe knows enough about universes to handle his own and knows enough to protect and handle his own universe when he has one and knows enough of the track and what happens in the mest universe so that it cant happen to him again l ron hubbard dear name as you probably already know in scientology we are not just trying to make it easier to achieve goals on onelifetime basis but stop the dwindling spiral of the spiritual being and thus restore full awareness and ability so we can never be the adverse effect of anything ever again this has everything to do with the priceless ot hatting lectures that lrh left for everyone to avail themselves of within these lectures are the answers and the knowledge that we have been without for countless trillions of years and with we can again regain our native and inherent abilities i know you have been receiving emails from on the newly released essentials of ot hatting lectures and with all the feedback and communication i have had so far there are some common questions about these lectures which i want to take up and answer here in this email are these lectures for whereas ot hatting was originally intended for those auditing through the highest ot levels it soon became apparent that knowledge of and application of this technology could help scientologists at any level move up the bridge and operate from more ot perspective in life that is ot technology to help you get to ot has become the maxim for scientologists today worldwide with the release of these lectures you may be also asking which lecture should i listen to next with plans well underway to release the entire library in the next 4 years and with guide chart to all of them you will easily see where each series fits in the chronology of lrhs research and development until every series is available it was imperative we provide ones that were broadly applicable so for any scientologist who wants to move up the bridge faster and operate more at cause in life these lectures are for you why the essentials of ot hatting lectures here is brief history of what these five lecture series are about and why they were selected specifically for scientologists to get and listen to each series covers broadly applicable data from the 1952 1953 time period where lrh was heavily researching and mapping out the state of operating thetan drawn from the entire library of ot lectures the newest releases on cd include not only the most popular series but also one that was never before released and all of them have one thing in common they are essentials they have everything to do with lrhs track of research and his breakthroughs along that track as lrh himself stated the subject of scientology is to some degree developed in reverse order the task was to undercut the current level of man and this was the general target therefore one finds the higher levels of publicly spoken of most frequently in the earlier books and tapes lrh from hcob 30 july 1973 scientology current state of the subject and materials by actual survey and sheer numbers of public buying these lectures and doing the ot hatting these are the most popular and although those surveyed may not have known why they felt that way it has everything to do with knowing the context of the technology one is studying some lecture series stand on their own practically anyone whatever level of training can listen to them and get the data then there are those that assume the listener has grounding in some prior fundamental he can listen to them and clear his misunderstoods but he would still seem lost it isnt an mu but skipped gradient he missed some data that came before by placing these lectures in context and how they relate to that lrh path of discovery through mans ignorance to the technology we posses today one finds the information that bridges from each milestone to the next or to put it more succinctly from book to book these lecture series fill in the gaps what were the breakthroughs from book to book it all began with book one and the isolation of the reactive mind next came science of survival and the introduction of the thetamest theory then with advanced procedure and axioms came whole new discovery the genetic line in fact here was lrhs complete analysis of pictures and their technically accurate term facsimiles moreover and more importantly here was the discovery of the individuals use of these facsimiles in causing his own aberrations the entire thrust of dianetics to this point had been the reduction of the reactive mind yet with advanced procedure and axioms came the approach of increasing selfdeterminism and with that came his discovery of the life continuum specifically one individual attempting to carry on the life of another deceased individual or departed individual by means of generating in his own body the infirmities and mannerisms of the deceased or departed individual lrh that is the subject of advanced procedure and axioms and its companion manual the handbook for preclears immediately upon completing the handbook for preclears something new entered the scene that something was the first emeter and its first use to verify the existence of what preclear after preclear kept encountering past lives lrh did more than that he plotted the principal incidents on the whole track which can now be found in the book history of man in other words from the handbook for preclears and the breakthroughs of how an individual lives the lives of others their valences the next breakthrough was that of ones pastlife existence along the whole track itself how did lrh get there and what were the discoveries in other words what were the actions steps thoughts tests and demonstrations that lay along that route here are the specific ot lectures that give the answers in chronological sequence now available on compact disc scientology milestone one the route to infinity the command of theta the factors admiration and the renaissance of beingness first international congress of dianeticists and scientologists and that is what comprises the newly releases essentials of ot hatting lectures chronological study of lrh materials the importance of studying dianetics and scientology materials in proper sequence can mean the difference between total skipped gradient and 100 conceptual understanding of the tech lrh comments upon that here chronological study of materials is necessary for the complete training of truly topgrade expert in these lines he can see how the subject progressed and so is able to see which are the highest levels of development not the least advantage in this is the defining of words and terms for each when originally used was defined in most cases with considerable exactitude and one is not left with any misunderstoods lrh from hcob 30 july 1973 scientology current state of the subject and materials with the new essentials of ot hatting lectures you study from the very first lecture series on scientology as subject scientology milestone one through some of the most profound and broadly applicable breakthroughs in dianetics and scientology to the very first congress in our history where lrh sums it all up and tells you how to take everything youve just learned and put it into action 3x your case gain just by listening to lrh did you know that by just education alone from scientology books lectures and materials you can increase and maximize your gains in auditing review done on this exact point showed that preclears being audited with education in scientology while still making gains incomparable to anything possible before scientology make less progress per hour of auditing than educated preclears pcs were given materials to study between sessions after reading just one book divisions of tone arm action which measure case gain increased by 30 percent furthermore those studying regularly on average doubled the tone arm action per hour while some increased their tone arm action by as much as three times thats literally three times the case gain per hour simply from studying the materials of scientology sounds good but why should i get them right now frankly as spiritual being you need this data now the biggest reason is of course the immortal knowledge and education on the principles of ot and how to operate above the level of mest so you can resume full cause on all dynamics something you are already on the road to achieving but there is another very good reason you should get these lectures now and this has to do with mest universe level reason special package price for all five ot hatting essentials previously
