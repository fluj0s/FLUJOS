updated july 16 2003 nicolas cook analyst in african affairs foreign affairs defense and trade congressional research service the library of congress diamonds and conflict background and policy responses summary in several diamondrich countries affected by armed conflict notably in africa belligerents have funded their military activities by mining and selling diamonds and competition over the use and control of diamond wealth has contributed significantly to the depth and extended duration of these conflicts diamonds used in this fashion labeled conflict diamonds were estimated to have comprised an estimated 37 to 15 of the value of the global diamond trade in 2000 the present volume of such trade appears is difficult to estimate several diamondrelated conflicts have ended but others have burgeoned policy makers attention has also increasingly focused on the possible role that diamonds may play in the financing of terrorist operations in response to public pressure to halt trade in conflict diamonds and due to the persistence of several diamondrelated conflicts governments and multilateral organizations have pursued efforts to end such trade several international policy forums national legislatures and diverse private parties have proposed various reforms and legislation to achieve such goals effective regulation of the diamond trade is difficult diamonds are highly fungible concentrated form of wealth and the global diamond industry is historically insular and selfregulating the illicit diamond trade exploits these factors proposals to end illicit trading generally center on legally identifying the origin of diamonds and requiring the registration identification and monitoring of crossborder trade in diamond as is common for trade in other goods methods for achieving such ends include the cataloging of unique physical diamond features the tagging of diamonds with minute markings and the creation of certificationoforigin laws to document the origin of diamonds the clinton administration worked to create certificates of originbased international diamond trade regime but sought to ensure that such efforts would not negatively affect the legitimate industry it also backed marketing reforms and regulatory capacity building in diamondrich african countries consulted with the diamond industry pushed for sanctions to end the conflict diamond trade and created an interagency group on conflict diamonds the bush administration has pursued policies that broadly mirror those of its predecessor the united states participates in the kimberley process certification scheme global diamond trade regulation framework the administration began implementing the scheme in the united states with voluntary interim compliance measures prior to the passage of hr 1584 see below several congressional hearings have addressed trade in conflict diamonds potential links between terrorism financing and trade in diamonds have garnered increasing congressional attention the 106th and 107th congresses considered several diamondrelated bills the 108th congress passed hjres 2 in february 2003 it contained several conflict diamondrelated

developments on april 11 2003 an amended version of hr 1584 houghton introduced april 3 2003 received from the senate was passed by the house president bush has approved the bill which was designated pl 10819 the intent of hr 1584 entitled the clean diamond trade act is to implement the kimberley process certification scheme the scheme or kpcs hereafter in the united states the scheme is consensusnegotiated text that defines diamond trade control and tracking system based on the use of importexport certificates that establish the legal origin of internationally traded rough diamonds its purpose is to curtail trade in illegally exported rough diamonds in order to end international trading in conflict diamonds which are further discussed below the scheme is work in progress the kpcs calls for participants to meet in plenary session annually to review the status of the scheme implementation which officially began in january 2003 the first postimplementation plenary session of the kimberley process is convene in johannesburg south africa from april 28 to 30 2003 the clean diamond trade act was passed following the issuance of provisional world trade organization waiver exempting the kpcs from certain wto rules some had feared that such rules might enable nonkimberley participants to challenge the kimberley process as an unfair constraint on international trade1 approval of hr 1584 will enable the united states to fulfill its stated intention to implement the scheme on permanent basis which it had signified by endorsing the interlaken declaration november 2002 joint statement of intent by kimberley process participants to implement the scheme beginning in 2003 prior to the passage of hr 1584 the bush administration had begun to put the scheme into effect in the united states with the voluntary issuance by the us diamond industry of kimberley certificates to accompany roughdiamond export shipments beginning on january 1 20032 background issue

mining and sale of diamonds3 all of the conflicts in which diamonds have played role have been characterized by severe human rights abuses massive internal population displacements and the destabilization of internationallyrecognized governments diamonds used in this manner have been labeled conflict diamonds or blood diamonds in several conflicts diamond wealth appears not only to have been used to pay for military resources but to have itself become focal point for further conflict thus contributing significantly to the depth and extended duration of hostilities diamonds have also led to the internationalization of these conflicts and added significantly to their complexity the possibility of gaining access to diamonds and other natural resources has also motivated diverse foreign actors including governments private securitycummining firms armed nonstate groups and mercenaries to become party to several conflicts geographic context the persistence of conflicts in sierra leone and angola in the late 1990s and the first years of the present decade was attributed in part to the role of diamonds in funding the activities of parties to these conflicts wars in these two countries which long represented the most prominent diamond related conflicts have now ended however both countries continue to be affected by local diamondrelated political tensions and occasional armed conflict in the larger mano river region sierra leone liberia and guinea historically politically volatile area diamonds continue to present potential motivating factor for future conflict or for regional broadening of instability related to the current armed insurgency in liberia in the democratic republic of the congo drc an emergent peace process is taking hold but significant levels of conflict aggravated by contention over control of diamonds and other natural resources and related illicit activities continue both state and nonstate actors that have been party to the drc conflict appear to have active interests in diamond extraction and trade activities in the drc4 in the central african republic car diamonds appear to have indirect links to political violence that has repeatedly affected the country most recently after rebel attack beginning in october 20025 3 some definitions such as that used by the kimberley process certification scheme categorize conflict diamonds as those used by rebel movements or their allies to undermine legitimate governments other definitions are more broad and categorize conflict diamonds as those that are used to fund armed conflict by variety of other armed actors especially in cases as in the democratic republic of the congo where competition over natural resources appears to have become an increasingly central cause of continued conflict 4 see security council final report of the panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth of the

that current and former parties to the drc conflict continue to engage in diamondbased commerce that employs business assets such as mining concessions or production marketing rights trade and transport networks and enterprises that were established during or as direct result of their involvement in the drc conflict6 in the central african republic car rebel group called the movement for the liberation of congo mlc intervened on behalf of the recently ousted government of president angefelix patasse after it was attacked in late october 2002 by its opponents the mlc has been involved in the drc conflict and has reportedly engaged in extensive diamond trading in car libya which supported the patasse government militarily after an armed attack on it in 2001 had reportedly obtained mineral exploitation rights in the country those rights are now in question as is the continued influence of the mlc in the car the newly proclaimed government of francois bozize currently has relations with the mlc which fought the armed supporters of bozize prior to the ouster of patasse in late march 2003 similarly actors involved in the ongoing civil conflict in liberia have reportedly financed their activities in part by mining and trading diamonds and unregulated artisanal mining has also reportedly increased in some parts of liberia these activities have reportedly contributed to ongoing smuggling of diamonds into neighboring countries official exports of diamonds from liberia have been made since the liberian government officially banned the export of diamonds in may 2001 in compliance with sanctions related to the recently ended conflict in sierra leone sanctions monitoring committee has found little evidence to bolster accusations that liberia has violated diamondrelated measures of the sanctions regime imposed on it and has found that few if any diamonds are being exported from liberia7 rise of conflict diamonds as policy issue as several diamond related wars continued or burgeoned in the late 1990s the role of diamonds and other natural resources in the financing of armed conflict increasingly drew the attention of journalists analysts and policy makers the problem of conflict diamonds also focused increased analytic attention on the general connections between armed conflict and control of natural resources8 the world bank for instance

resources demographic characteristics and the occurrence of conflict research associated with the bank study series portrayed diamonds as particularly concentrated example of what it termed lootable commodities which analyses sponsored by the bank indicated are important factors driving conflict9 the release of sanctions monitoring panel in march 2000 in particular was instrumental in motivating widespread concern and recognition of the connection between conflict and the illicit diamond trade among policy makers the report was popularly known as the fowler report after the thenchairman of the security councils committee on angola sanctions ambassador robert fowler of canada it described the status of the implementation of sanctions including ban on the export and sale of angolan conflict diamonds against the former angolan rebel union for the total independence of angola unita10 multiple subsequent security council reports on angola and several other african countries in conflict have included substantial coverage of conflict diamond trade11 as the number of press reports and research studies focusing on the issue grew nongovernmental organizations ngos working on such issues as natural resource exploitation human rights and conflict resolution began to call for policies that would halt the use of diamonds in the funding of conflict to bring pressure on the diamond industry and governments to initiate such policies and to educate the broader public about the conflict diamonds issue ngos initiated series of advocacy campaigns both as individual entities and in coalitions such as the international fatal transactions international diamond campaign the us campaign to eliminate conflict diamonds12 in response to these diverse developments national governments and international governmental organizations igos undertook variety of legal diplomatic and military actions aimed at halting trade in conflict diamonds among the igos that have acted to address the problem are the united nations the european union eu the economic community of west african states ecowas and the southern african development community sadc several international conferences were held that included participation by governments multilateral organizations and variety of private groups focused on solutions to the 8 continued strategic studies july 1998 9 online

extensive coverage throughout 2000 and 2001 in the us and international press as well as in popular us electronic media several us network tv news magazines and evening news shows and at least one prime time tv drama covered the issue13 media coverage of conflict diamonds diminished somewhat in 2002 and the kimberley process increasingly became the focus of such reporting conflict diamonds public debate publicity and advocacy campaigns the majority of ngos advocating increased regulation of the diamond trade agree that the great majority of diamonds are legitimately produced and generate crucial socioeconomic benefits most have not called for general consumer boycott of diamonds they have instead urged consumers to assess the ethics of purchasing diamonds that could not be independently verified as being conflictfree and to demand such verification14 periodically beginning in 2000 activists have mounted publicity campaigns and demonstrations in which major diamond retailers have been picketed in congressional hearings press conferences and in tv and online commercials activists have used graphic images to explicitly link and contrast amputations of limbs and social disintegration human rights abuses associated with conflict diamonds with the image of diamonds as symbol of love and the social union of marriage industry concern and responses concern over increased negative publicity about conflict diamonds grew among some in the diamond industry some governments and major diamond industry groups in diamond producing and consuming nations worried that the conflict diamond issue might undermine the diamond market generally they were concerned that the diamondconsuming public cognizant of link between diamonds and conflict but lacking the means to differentiate conflict diamonds from legitimate ones might begin to associate all diamonds with conflict and human rights abuses and decrease their purchases as result such trend it was feared might undermine not only the wholesale and retail diamond industries but also the socioeconomic development of stable and prosperous democratic african states such as south africa botswana and namibia to which the legitimate production of diamonds contributes substantially 13 see for instance dateline diamonds of conflict nbc news july 1 2001 bob simon diamonds wars best friend cbs news june 14 2001

of recent james bond film die another day focuses substantially on conflict diamonds 14 minority of activists however have used the threat of such boycott which they have compared in its potential to the economically significant consumer boycotts of fur in the 1980s and 1990s to argue for the rapid implementation of diamond trading reforms crs6 to counter the threat posed by possible consumer rejection of diamonds some diamond producing countries and industry trade groups mounted their own public education and legislative lobbying campaigns they sought to ensure that the legitimate diamond industry was not tarnished by conflict diamonds and endeavored to influence the passage of conflict diamondrelated legislation that would not restrict or decrease trade in legitimate diamonds15 such efforts included the following initiatives debswana in march 2001 debswana diamond producing firm owned in equal share by the botswana government and beers reportedly hired the lobbying firm hill and knowlton to influence conflict diamondrelated legislation and to undertake public affairs programming promoting the positive role played by diamonds16 this effort was linked to public diplomacy campaign by the botswana government entitled diamonds for development diamonds account for about 79 of botswanas total export earnings just over 40 of its gross domestic product and reportedly over half of government revenues17 beersdtc in early 2000 the beersdiamond trading company dtc began to issue commercial guarantees that it would not buy or sell diamonds from conflict zones it later issued set of best practice principles these included statement of professional and ethical standards that committed the company to preventing the buying and trading of rough diamonds from areas where this would encourage or support conflict and human suffering and the use of child labor beers asserted that it was longer buying diamonds from angola guinea congo sierra leone or liberia18 recent

conflict diamonds regulatory challenges effective policing of the illicit diamond trade faces difficult challenges the world diamond trade is large diamonds are highly fungible and concentrated form of wealth and the legitimate international diamond industry is historically insular selfregulating and lacks transparency the trade in conflict diamonds takes advantage of these factors observers have concluded that conflict diamonds regularly enter into the legitimate international market through illicit trading practices and actors31 the illicit diamond trade of which conflict diamonds are part is also difficult to regulate for reasons similar to those that make illegal drugs and arms smuggling difficult to control illicit diamond trading has been linked to covert and sometimes violent business transactions and is reportedly associated with international criminal activities such as money laundering smuggling commercial fraud and arms trafficking magnitude of the global diamond market trade in conflict diamonds and regulatory proposals to end trade in such gems are associated primarily with the rough diamond market in 2001 worldwide diamond mine output that is production of rough diamonds was estimated to be worth 7885 billion compared to 786 billion in 2000 and between 6857 and 725 billion in 199932 an industry trade group has reported that world exports of rough diamonds rose by 2532 in carat terms and 208 in price in the first 8 months of 200233 in most years more rough diamonds mix of new production plus preexisting inventories are sold on world markets than are produced during given year in 2000 total of nearly 9 billion of rough diamonds was estimated to have come to market globally of which 567 billion was reportedly sold by the beers diamond

journal october 2001 and previous annual mining journal estimates these estimates based on data provided by dr dr luc rombouts are considered by many leading gemologists to be among the most authoritative but in general diamondrelated statistics should be treated as rough estimates many industry actors do not publicly reveal data about their business transaction volumes or related production and price levels 33 mining metals report world rough diamond exports up 21 september 26 2002 34 similar aggregated estimate for 2001 was unavailable in published sources there are indications however that rough diamond exports have risen in 2002 by as much as 25 continued crs12 us diamond imports and trade us market demand for diamonds is the largest in the world and the vast

independently obtained and verifiable data the current proportion of the world diamond market comprised of conflictrelated stones is difficult to reliably estimate but it may be smaller than it was in 2000 or 2001 in an april 2002 presentation rory more oferrall director public corporate affairs for the beers group of companies stated that conflict diamonds account for less than 2 of world rough diamond production39 the hypothesized decrease in the volume of trade in conflict diamonds may be attributable to the termination of wars in angola and sierra leone formerly two of the key sources of such gems in addition in the democratic republic of the congo drc an ongoing war appears to be waning and to the extent that this conflict was fueled by diamond wealth trade in conflict diamonds from the drc may also be diminishing reliability of conflict diamond statistics discussion as previously noted many aggregate diamond trade statistics are merely approximations based on assumptions about mining methods rates of extraction trade volume trends and other market factors some estimates take into account only official production figures which ordinarily reflect statereported or sales and production and which may or may not take into account or may erroneously estimate artisanal and unofficial production40 estimates of annual diamond production and trade value in countries where conflict diamonds are mined in particular vary widely because credible or detailed data during periods and in sites of conflict are often unavailable the volumes and value of unreported or unofficial trade and production from conflictaffected areas are particularly difficult to estimate and as proportion of such categories that comprised of diamonds that directly fund military or associated activities is especially difficult to measure differentiating conflict diamonds from other types of illicitlytraded diamonds is extremely difficult both varieties tend to be traded in covert manner and many of the same market actors may engage in unofficial or illicit transactions involving both conflict and nonconflict diamonds41 conflict diamonds as current policy challenge despite the paucity of current independently verifiable data about the present extent of the conflict diamond trade advocates of diamond trade regulation maintain that regulatory efforts remain necessary regardless of the current level of such trade they stress that the regions that have been affected by diamondrelated political unrest and conflict over the last decade remain volatile observers note that many of the same actors who 39 rory more oferrall conflict diamondsde beers group of companiesspeech to the israel diamond institute april 5 2002 40 estimates that do attempt to account for unofficial trade

information from traders in international diamond trading and processing centers 41 the december 2000 report of the united nations sanctions committee on sierra leone contains extensive discussions of disparities between production trade and conflict diamond statistics see particularly paragraphs 112 to 150 security council report of the panel of experts appointed pursuant to security council

extraction and marketing operations in addition they note that diamonds continue to be the source of localized conflicts over control of mining or trading rights advocates argue that bolstering states ability to regulate the diamond trade may prevent future diamondrelated conflict and in addition may enable countries to more effectively use their diamond wealth to fund national development efforts some industry representatives broadly agree with such views42 regulatory policy proposals most proposals for curtailing the trade in conflict diamonds center around implementing systems to identify the origin of diamonds to ensure that diamonds sold by illicit sellers do not enter legitimate international commerce43 such proposals provide the basis for laws and international actions such as security council sanctions that ban trade in conflict diamonds three primary approaches for determining the origin of diamonds have been proposed44 1 physical or geochemical identification of diamonds research on geochemical methods for identifying diamonds by type or as individual units focuses on the comparative analysis of trace elements and impurities within diamonds such information would be used to establish common characteristics of diamonds from similar areas or to pinpoint unique characteristics in manner analogous to fingerprinting of individual diamonds this research employs plasma mass spectrometry and related technologies related approach for purposes of tracking is to classify diamonds by their place of origin and possibly on an individual stonespecific basis by correlating surface crystalline and other structurerelated features of rough diamonds such identification would be based on visual assessments and on the use of spectral refraction methods or optical laser xray and other scanning technologies geochemical and automated physical characteristic identification technologies have not yet been perfected according to many experts many of whom also assert that such technologies are likely to remain prohibitively expensive in the short to medium term another limitation of such technologies is that some of the physical characteristics upon which identification methods depend are permanently altered or 42 rory more oferrall conflict diamonds 43 the origin of diamond refers to its physical origin or place where it was mined diamonds provenance refers to the place from where it was last imported in published accounts describing the diamond industry the two terms have sometimes been conflated 44 comprehensive treatment of technical and policy issues

diamonds are cut or polished third challenge is that alluvial surface diamonds are often carried far from their points of origin by water or movements of geologic elements this means in many cases that diamonds from particular country or subregion cannot be physically differentiated from those found in neighboring countries or regions 2 tagging of diamonds this approach seeks to use laser and focused ion beam technologies to inscribe on individual diamonds identifying information such as microscopic bar codes which can then be used to register and track stones several firms market such technology other firms offer technology that use laser scanning technologies to identify unique spectral features of individual cut diamonds the costs of tagging technology currently represent barrier to their widespread use in diamond commerce but expert opinion suggests that these prices may fall in the near to medium future critics point out that it may be possible to cut off or otherwise physically alter or obliterate identifying marks that are cut onto diamond surfaces 3 certificate of origin laws this approach seeks to create legallybinding chain of warranties from the point of mining origin to the country of importation or in some proposals to the retail level the objective is to create trade documentation that based upon verification by the authorities of an exporting country validates the legal origin of diamonds such documentation would form the basis for findings of legal fact in efforts to track and monitor the diamond trade and in determining the legitimacy of commercial diamond transactions the approach relies on diamond importing countries to implement effective administrative processes and law enforcement procedures and adhere to shared regulatory procedures this regulatory approach underlies the kimberley process certification scheme industry policy initiatives diamond high council the diamond high council hrd is formal trade organization representing the belgian diamond industry antwerp belgium where the hrd is headquartered is one of the leading international diamond cutting centers and is major destination for exports of rough

prevent trade in conflict diamonds for over 2 years through consensusbased negotiation process participants worked to create an importexport certification system designed to govern the international trade in rough diamonds these participants included representatives of the diamond industry and nongovernmental organizations secondary objective of the process is to help governments of diamondproducing countries to more effectively channel diamondrelated state revenue into national socioeconomic development efforts by improving their ability to regulate diamond production and commerce and to collect taxes related to these activities the main product of the process the kimberley process working document was finalized in november 2002 as the kimberley process certification scheme by the signing of the interlaken declaration52 named after the swiss town where the final meeting of the kimberley process was held prior to implementation of the scheme the declaration committed signatories including the united states and 47 other participating governments to the simultaneous launch of the certification scheme beginning on 1 january 200353 the certification scheme defines diamond trade control and tracking system based on the use of importexport certificates that establish the legal origin of internationally traded rough diamonds the purpose of the scheme is to curtail trade in conflict diamonds and other illegally exported diamonds in january 2003 the security council passed resolution endorsing the kimberley process and the interlaken declaration54 background first sponsored by south africa the kimberley process began as the technical forum on diamonds which met in may 2000 in kimberley south africa several technical and ministerial meetings followed in 2000 at meeting in pretoria south africa in september 2000 the forum considered the interim findings of its technical working group it determined that practical reliable and cost effective technical system for physically identifying the origin of individual diamonds did not exist as result it recommended the establishment of an international export control regime consisting of system of sealed registered diamond export 51 the report and the resolution are contained respectively in documents a56775 and ares56263 52 for online texts of the kimberley process certification scheme and the

suggested that the system might be overseen by intergovernmental authority charged with monitoring and compliance accreditation of national export regimes and standardsetting and possibly could be organized under auspices it would also require the implementation of legal sanctions and penalties for violations of nationallevel legal export controls participants noted need for flexibility in any proposed system especially visavis alluvial diamond mining and small scale production and trading it also recommended that participating nations ensure that domestic diamond marketing and production operate on the basis of open market competition governed by national system of transparency disclosure and oversight of all diamond operations several early proposals such as extensive kimberley process scheme compliance monitoring requirements and the creation of an intergovernmental authority were rejected by participants many key issues such as the definition of conflict diamond remained unsettled until the scheme was finalized55 kimberleyplus in 2001 the process dubbed the expanded kimberley process or kimberleyplus continued at meeting in windhoek namibia the initial technical and legal findings of the 2000 kimberley meetings were reviewed and roadmap defining the future focus and schedule of the process was produced and task force was created to coordinate and track the work and meetings of the process56 these objectives were pursued throughout the year with further meetings in belgium russia the united kingdom angola and botswana the findings and formal recommendations of the kimberleyplus process were presented in report to the 56th session of the general assembly which endorsed the kimberley process and requested that the kimberley process present to the general assembly progress report at the general assemblys 57th session57 further kimberley process meetings and negotiations over the proposed process scheme followed in 2002 culminating in the interlaken declaration in november 2002 kimberley process key issues the kimberley process brought together many competing commercial and political entities and the negotiations that produced the certification

provide for an adequate system of collation and dissemination for production and trade statistics58 the degree to which monitoring of process participants compliance with the scheme would be necessary topics of debate included questions over what standards if any would be used to assess compliance and whether compliance monitoring would need be necessary and if so whether it would be undertaken by an independent audit organization by governments participating in the process or by industry actors nongovernmental organizations involved in process consultations believe that the scheme adopted under the interlaken declaration does not provide an adequate system for regular independent monitoring of the diamond trade control systems of interlaken signatory nations they maintain that the overall system remains open to abuse59 the degree to which the scheme would comply with world trade organization rules and other relevant international trade law and agreements whether permanent administrative organization would need to be established to assist in the administration and implementation of the scheme implementation successful implementation of the kpcs which officially began january 1 2003 will require that individual signatory nations enforce existing or prospective regulatory processes and legislation that comply with the scheme and that private actors involved in the

johannesburg south africa from april 28 to 30 2003 key issues likely to be the subject of further negotiation or debate include whether and in what manner if at all the kimberley process would need to establish an independent monitoring system to ensure that participating states are living up to their commitments and whether the whole process is transparent and effective whether there could or should be system or basis for deciding on whether countries wishing to join the kimberley process actually qualify to do so one idea is to establish credentialing committee within the process even though it is presently open to all states that meet certain minimal qualifications some observers fear that certain applicant states might only implement in nominal fashion the basic requirements required of participants such states might meanwhile engage in prohibited practices or simply lack the resources to implement in practice the required processes that they have committed to establishing how implementation of the process as whole will work in practice and how and to what extent the national laws and authorities of participating countries are interoperable and compatible how and if uniform system of statistical reporting of rough diamond import and export figures might be established and how such statistics will be used and distributed how if and in what fashion technical assistance might be provided to states lacking the organizational financial or other resources to meet the requirements of the kimberley process us policy executive branch executive branch efforts to end trade in conflict diamonds commenced during the clinton administration its efforts centered on the creation of multilateral diamond trade regime backed by international sanctions aimed at curtailing such commerce clinton administration officials proposed regime based on formal working partnerships between legitimate diamond producing states those that import trade and consume diamonds the international diamond industry and range of nongovernmental organizations the clinton administration also sought to ensure that the industries of legitimate diamond producing african democratic states particularly namibia botswana and south africa would not be harmed by efforts to curtail the trade in conflict diamonds many of the clinton administrations crs22 policy goals were encompassed by the policy making meeting that later became known as the kimberly process which increasingly became key focal point of us efforts to combat the conflict diamonds trade international and multilateral policy both prior to and after the formal establishment of the kimberly process the clinton administration sponsored conferences focusing on the war economies of conflict diamondproducing states and held unilateral policy dialogues with these and nonconflict producing states such as botswana it also consulted with members of the american diamond industry the clinton administration used us membership on the security council to push for international sanctions banning the illicit trading of diamonds from angola and sierra leone and for the appointment of panels of experts to monitor compliance with these sanctions the security council also appointed panel of experts to examine the illicit exploitation of natural resources in the congo the clinton administration took unilateral actions to isolate and penalize governments that abet the trade in conflict diamonds or violate related resolutions these included october 10 2000 presidential proclamation denying entry into the united states of persons who assist or profit from the armed activities of the revolutionary united front ruf rebels fighting the government of sierra leone the restrictions applied to president charles taylor senior members of the liberian government their supporters and their families and represented an explicit sanction against the liberian government for its failure to end its trafficking in arms and illicit diamonds with the ruf thus fueling the sierra leonean conflict the clinton administration also participated in multilateral diplomatic and policyfocused coordination initiatives

responded to their critics by maintaining that they had actively worked to curtail the conflict diamond trade but also maintained that international consensus on how to halt the trade in conflict diamonds which it saw as prerequisite for successful policy making had not emerged testifying before the house ways and means subcommittee on trade on september 13 2000 william wood principal deputy assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs cited clinton administration us participation in the kimberley process and other policy forums such as the g8 he noted that since 1998 the clinton administration had supported sanctions to prevent the trade in conflict diamonds and described us efforts to assist sierra leone and angola to improve their diamond export certification systems he welcomed legislation expressing sense of the congress in support of administration efforts to curtail the conflict diamond trade but cautioned against legislation that would mandate specific policies which he stated might not conform with the regulatory regime that was being produced through the kimberley process clinton administration officials also highlighted their support for resolution 56 of the 55th session of the general assembly64 bush administration policy on conflict diamonds the bush administration has pursued policies to stem the flow of conflict diamonds that are broadly similar to those of the clinton administration and has participated in the kimberley process on january 25 2001 in statement to the security council during review of the

subcommittee on oversight of government management restructuring and the district of columbia on february 13 2002 conflict diamonds have also been addressed in the context of hearings on us policy on sierra leone angola the democratic republic of the congo and with regard to activities in africa and to terrorism financing during september 19 2002 hearing on terrorist financing and implementation of the usa patriot act before the house committee on financial services for instance robert mueller director of the federal bureau of investigation called for legislation that would allow for the pretrial freezing of fungible assets linked to alleged criminal offense including diamonds gold and other precious metals without requiring strict tracing to the offense67 in addition to addressing human rights and conflictrelated concerns conflict diamond hearings n the 106th and 107th congresses highlighted congressional interest in ensuring that proposals to regulate international trade in diamonds and any us legislation to implement such proposals be consistent with relevant world trade organization trade rules hearing witnesses called for legislative solutions that would not penalize legitimate producers of diamonds such as botswana and south africa some witnesses expressed concern that failure to enact legislation to curtail the conflict diamond trade and to introduce methods of separating legitimate diamonds from illicit diamonds might lead to consumerdriven decrease in market demand for all diamonds thus damaging the revenue base of legitimate diamond producing nations in the october 2001 hearing before the subcommittee on trade of the house committee on ways and means industry and nongovernmental representatives described growing consensus between their respective interest groups on the need to finalize the kimberley process legislation 107th congress as in the 106th congress several conflict diamondrelated bills were introduced in the 107th congress these included hr 918 hall hr 2500 wolf hr 2722 houghton hr 5410 kolbe hconres 410 hall s 787 gregg s 1084 durbin s 1215 hollings and s 2027 durbin among these bills hr 2506 kolbe pl 107115 was the only one in which diamondrelated provisions were included in the final version of legislation signed into law it prohibited certain opic and exim bank diamondrelated projects in countries not implementing system of rough diamond export and import controls as defined in the act it also prohibited the use of funds appropriated by the act to assist countries that the secretary of state determines according to criteria outlined in the act to have actively destabilized the democratically elected government of sierra leone or aided or abetted illicit trade in sierra leonean diamonds 108th congress the 108th congress like the past two congresses has demonstrated continuing interest in ending the conflict diamond trade 67 committee on financial services statement for the record of robert s mueller iii director federal bureau of investigation us house of representatives september 19 2002 crs27 hjres 2 several conflict diamondrelated provisions were included in hjres 2 the consolidated appropriations resolution 2003 pl 1087 these include section 570 which imposes restrictions on assistance to governments destabilizing sierra leone and section 583 which imposes conflict diamondrelated restrictions on the use of overseas private investment corporation and exportimport bank funding allocations section 583 prohibits the use of such funds in connection with any project involving the mining polishing or other processing or sale of diamonds in country that fails to implement the kimberley process recommendations obligations or requirements or fails to undertake other measures to effectively prevent and eliminate trade in conflict diamonds the resolution also recommended that 2000000 should be made available for assistance for countries to implement and enforce the kimberley process implementation scheme from allocated economic support funds the committee of conference managers joint explanatory statement for hjres 2 see conference report hrept 10810 also contains two provisions related to conflict diamonds first conferees stated their expectation that of funds provided to the council of american overseas research centers necessary funds would be granted for research to develop diamond fingerprinting technology to facilitate monitoring of the international trade in conflict diamonds second the statement reflecting the language of the joint resolution as passed recommended the 2000000 technical assistance and noted that the senate amendment to hjres 2 would have provided 3500000 for such purpose but that the house bill did not address this matter they also stated their support for the kimberley process and urged the diamond industry and nongovernmental organizations to help implement the certification scheme with financial assistance and expertise us kimberley process scheme implementation legislation in early january 2003 representative thomas chairman of the house ways and means committee announced that he would seek to enact legislation as soon as possible that meets the kimberley process goals is administrable and complies with our world trade organization wto obligations68 senator grassley also announced his intention to sponsor kimberley process implementing legislation69 representative thomas later tied the introduction of such legislation to receipt of an understanding from the european union eu that it would not oppose wto waiver for the kimberley process according to inside us trade eu policy makers did not see need for wto waiver for the kimberley process position that reflected broad interpretation of which trade restrictions require waiver from wto obligations70 an inside us trade source postulated that if broad 68 christopher s rugaber bush administration representative thomas

continued crs28 interpretation were upheld the eu would be free to invoke certain trade restrictions of its own without first getting waiver which has become increasingly difficult71 pending indications from the eu that it would not oppose us kimberley process legislation representative thomas stated that he would not move us legislation intended to bring the united states into compliance with ruling by the wto on certain provisions of us export tax laws relating to us foreign sales corporation fsc export tax benefits and related extraterritorial income replacement provisions72 the concerns raised by representative thomas appear to have been resolved by the issuance of february 26 2003 wto waiver for the kimberley process see below following which he again stated his intention to introduce supporting legislation73 in early february 2003 the steering committee of the campaign to eliminate conflict diamonds circulated on capitol hill memorandum entitled draft proposals for diamond legislation for the 108th congress that suggests range of policy issues that the group maintains should be incorporated into us kimberley implementing legislation the campaign is coalition of nonprofit groups that have advocated strong regulation of the trade in conflict diamonds and have participated in the kimberley process74 hr 1415 and hr 1584 to prevent conflict diamonds from entering or exiting the united states and to provide authority to implement the kimberley process in this country representative houghton introduced two bills hr 1415 on march 25 2003 and hr 1584 on april 3 2003 both bills were entitled the clean diamond trade act and were broadly similar but differed on certain points primarily relating to provisions specifying which agencies would have the duty and authority to administer the law if passed among other provisions both bills would have required the president to prohibit the import or export to or from the united states of any rough diamond from whatever source that has not been controlled through the kimberley process certification scheme both would have allowed waiver of such prohibition for up to year if the president determines and reports to congress that rough diamond exporting or importing country is taking effective steps to implement the kimberley process certification scheme or the president determines that such waiver is in the national interests of the united states and reports such determination and the 70 continued priorities january 31 2003 see also gary g yerkey representative thomas says 71 ibid 72 gary g yerkey

proposals for diamond legislation for the 108th congress memorandum february 6 2003 crs29 reasons for it to congress both bills also included range of enforcement provisions and policy recommendations some in sense of congress language as well as reporting requirements hr 1584 as introduced differed from hr 1415 primarily in that it specified additional reporting requirements and references the us trade representative in statement of policy it also authorized the president to direct the bureau of customs and border security among other potential agencies to assist countries seeking to export rough diamonds to the united states by providing them with technical assistance related to compliance with us trade laws on april 8 2003 an amended version of hr 1584 was passed by the house key amendments to the bill included changes to the specification of appropriate committees of jurisdiction viz section 3 of the bill and to related reporting requirements statement of policy removed reference to particular agencies and instead expressed support for the policy that the president shall take similarly another provision on potential technical assistance to third countries seeking to implement the scheme removed reference to the bureau of customs and border security expeditious senate consideration of the amended bill was expected by some observers on april 9 2003 hr 1584 as amended was received in the senate during senate consideration of the measure on april 10 senator hatch proposed substitute amendment to hr 1584 samdt 529 on behalf of senator grassley the senate then by unanimous consent passed samdt 529 which reflected the language of s 760 as reported on april 9 2003 by senator grassley see below and the measure was sent to the house the two chambers versions of hr 1584 which were largely similar differed with regard to the wording of shared provision section 11 that deals with the establishment of proposed kimberley process implementation coordinating committee on april 11 2003 representative thomas speaking in favor of the bill asked unanimous consent that the house agree to the senate amendment which was agreed to without objection the enrolled bill was signed into law by president bush on april 25 2003 and became pl 10819 when president bush signed hr 1584 into law he did so after referring to several significant caveats relating to the manner in which he stated that he will construe the duties that the law gives discretion to the president to carry out some may view these caveats as lending novel interpretation to the effective date on which the law is to take effect and the manner in which it is to be implemented president bush stated that although under this act i have discretion to issue regulations consistent with future changes to the kpcs under the constitution the president cannot be bound to accept or follow changes that might be made to the kpcs at some future date absent subsequent legislation i will construe this act accordingly if section 15 imposed mandatory duty on the president to certify to the congress whether either of the two specified events has occurred and whether either remains in effect serious question would exist as to whether section 15 unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to international bodies in order to avoid this constitutional question i will construe the certification process set forth in section 15 as conferring broad discretion on the president specifically crs30 i will construe section 15 as giving the president broad discretion whether to certify to the congress that an applicable waiver or decision is in effect similarly i will construe section 15 as imposing obligation on the president to withdraw an existing certification in response to any particular event rather i will construe section 15 as giving the president the discretion to determine when certification that an applicable waiver or decision is longer in effect is warranted75 s 760 on april 1 2003 senator grassley introduced s 760 entitled the clean diamond trade act the bill was referred to the committee on finance which on april 2 ordered it reported out favorably with an amendment srept 10836 offered by senator baucus on april 9 2003 s 760 was reported by senator grassley with amendments see srept 10836 and placed on senate legislative calendar under general orders calendar 62 s 760 appears to be companion bill to hr 1415 and hr 1584 most of its language is identical to that of the house bills particularly hr 1584 though some of its provisions are distinct and different in particular it specifically requires the secretary of state to publish in the federal register certain information pertaining to countries and foreign authorities responsible for regulating trade in rough diamonds the version of the bill passed out of the finance committee also amended section 10 c of the bill as introduced which reflected the language in hr 1584 by requiring the establishment by the president of us kimberley process interagency coordinating committee and by specifying the officials and agencies that would comprise that panel the version of hr 1584 enacted into law see discussion above is virtually identical to s 760 hconres 239 on june 26 2003 following the enactment of pl 10819 representative watson introduced hconres 239 the conflict diamonds resolution for herself representative lantos and representative payne hconres 239 proposes in sense of the congress language that the international diamond industry as represented by the world diamond council should provide transition development assistance to communities and specific groups in sierra leone angola and the democratic republic of congo specific groups that it proposes be assisted include excombatants female victims of warrelated sexual and genderbased violence warinjured amputees and african diamond industry workers it proposes that an international diamond industry fund be set up to finance initiatives in these countries to assist these groups as well as programs in support of hivaids programs economic development social service provision and political reconciliation processes in these countries it also lays out number of steps that the international diamond industry should be encouraged to continue to take in support of the development and implementation of the kimberley process these include the development and implementation of comprehensive reliable standardized and auditable chain of warranty system to support the kimberley process discussion in contrast to some bills introduced in the 107th congress hr 1415 hr 1584 and s 760 did not attempt to regulate trade in polished diamond or jewelry provisions primarily because these bills appear to be intended solely to 75 george w bush statement by the president april 25 2003 crs31 provide authority to implement the kimberley process certification scheme kpcs which pertains only to rough diamonds some groups who have sought strict and more comprehensive regulation of the international diamond trade have criticized the kpcs for not including measures to control diamonds that have been rudimentarily processed polished or made into jewelry they see the omission of such requirements in the kpcs as loophole and assert that unscrupulous diamond traders might skirt the spirit of the kpcs by superficially altering diamond to make it meet minimal standards qualifying it as polished or otherwise processed and thus not subject to kpcs regulations or setting diamond in temporary mounting for purposes of export or import thus qualifying it as jewelry to prevent the potential use of such alleged loopholes these policy advocates generally call for all rough and loose polished diamonds as well as mounted diamonds ie diamond jewelry to be accompanied by certificate of origin in order to offer consumers more robust guarantee that diamond being purchased is legitimate and not of conflictrelated origin76 some in the diamond trade have generally argued against more extensive certificate regime they assert that the financial administrative and logistical costs of such an approach would outweigh the benefits and might negate what are often described as marginal profit margins in the diamond industry generally some have also argued that the imposition of such costs might also sharply cut revenues earned by developing nations such as botswana namibia and south africa which rely significantly on diamonds to fund socioeconomic development proponents of more extensive certification approaches have generally maintained that the kinds of administrative and other overhead costs cited by the diamond industry are minimal and marginal when weighed against the social costs lost human lives mutilated limbs emotional damage and social disintegration of not enacting strong laws to end the conflict diamonds trade issues for congress kimberley process us implementation the administration signified its intent to implement the kpcs by signing on to the interlaken declaration see section on kimberley process president bushs approval of the clean diamond trade act enacted that stated intention into law the 108th and future congresses are likely to closely evaluate the relative success of us implementation of the kpcs the reporting requirements that hr 1584 imposes on the executive branch will likely play an important role in such oversight activities both the legislative and 76 examples of groups advocating such views include partnership africa canada world vision global witness oxfam amnesty international one sky catholic relief services physicians for human rights and many other groups primarily nongovernmental organizations many of which have joined together in variety of lobbying coalitions crs32 executive branch policymakers are also likely to periodically assess the efficacy of the kpcs in general wto second area of potential future congressional concern is the possibility that the kpcs might be found to conflict with world trade organization rules on trade77 that possibility had drawn substantial attention during the negotiation process that produced the kpcs and such debate had persisted after the signing of the interlaken declaration in late february 2003 the council for trade in goods of the world trade organization issued draft waiver decision for the kimberley process the issuance of the draft waiver appears to have provided adequate safeguards allowing for the establishment of the kpcs in the view of some policy makers who may have worried that the kpcs would conflict with wto rules following the release of the waiver representative thomas stated his intention to introduce us kpcs implementation legislation see above78 the waiver that was issued however contained certain caveats that could in theory provide the basis for possible future challenge to the legitimacy of the kpcs under wto rules the draft waiver gave wto members the right to bring before the wto general council for review potential future concerns related to any benefit accruing under the gatt 1994 that is impaired unduly as well as concerns related to members potential allegation that the kpcs was being applied inconsistently the waiver also noted that its issuance would not preclude the right of affected members to have recourse to articles xxii and xxiii of the gatt 1994 77 for extended discussions of these issues see tamm diamonds in peace and war and price the kimberley process both
