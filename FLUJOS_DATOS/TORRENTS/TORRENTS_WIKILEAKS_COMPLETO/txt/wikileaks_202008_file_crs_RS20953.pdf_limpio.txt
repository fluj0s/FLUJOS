reduce fees collected by the securities and exchange commission sec from sellers of corporate stock and companies active in securities and merger markets1 hr 1088 and s 143 have the common aim of reducing the amounts collected to sum more nearly equal to the secs budget and would replace the current fee structure in some cases existing fee rates would be lowered in others collections would become subject to annual caps or targets the proposed fee schedules in the two bills are not identical this report sets out the differences and relying upon forecasts of collections under current law prepared by the congressional budget office cbo presents dollar estimates of the impact on fee collections through fy2011 over fiscal years 2002 through 2011 hr 1088 would reduce fee collections by an estimated 150 billion s 143 by about 167 billion this report will be updated if legislative developments warrant there are three major securities transaction fees section 31 transaction fees payable

15094 15047 13415 16726 source calculated by crs using april 2001 baseline forecasts by the congressional budget office cbo the figures in the table above depend on cbo estimates of the future volume and value of securities market transactions which are extremely difficult to predict if the stock bond and merger markets underperform the cbo estimates fee collections under current law could be significantly lower than the cbos forecasts the estimates in table 1 for fee collections under hr 1088 and s 143 are derived by applying the fee rates and collections targets and caps contained in the bills to the cbo currentlaw estimates for simplification it is assumed that the collections targets and caps in the bills will be met exactly in practice it is likely that actual collections based on rates to be adjusted annually according to forecasts of market activity would fall short of the target figures in some fiscal yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20953crs3 2 us congress house committee on financial services investor and capital markets fee relief act hrept 10752 part 1 to accompany hr 1088 p 1319 and senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs competitive market supervision act of 2001 srept 1073 to accompany s 143 p 814figure 1 estimated securities fee collections under current law hr 1088 and s 143 source calculated by crs using congressional budget office forecasts more detailed estimates of the effects of the bills on fee collections including the impact on individual fees appear in the cbo cost estimates which are available on the cbo web site httpwwwcbogov and in the committee reports that accompanied both bills2 the estimates presented above suggest that enactment of either bill or bill combining features of the two would result in substantial reduction in fee collections using the april 2001 cbo forecast as guide crs estimates that hr 1088 would reduce fee revenue by about 150 billion per year or 50 over the period of fy2002 2011 while s 143 would reduce average annual revenues by about 167 billion or 55 the difference is attributable primarily to the treatment of 6b registration fees where s 143 sets lower rate that has more pronounced effect on forecasted collections than do the target figures set forth in hr 1088 while current law establishes fixed fee rates some of which are set to decline in fy2007 both hr 1088 and s 143 mandate the use of flexible rates for some fees to be adjusted annually in order that collections meet caps or target figures specified in the legislation an interesting possibility is that the fee rates could rise if market activity andor prices decline that is given falling volume each transaction might have to be taxed at higher rate to obtain the specified amount of revenue it is conceivable that severe market decline could result in some fee rates higher than they would be under current lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20953crs4 the table below sets out the treatment of the three
