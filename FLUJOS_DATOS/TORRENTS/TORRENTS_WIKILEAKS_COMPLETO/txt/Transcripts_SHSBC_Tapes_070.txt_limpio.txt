shsbc 70 problems lecture given on 12 october 1961 well what do you know i can see the room i just wanted that as good example i can discipline myself too smoking now of course the first one that does any smoking now gets tenthousandword infraction sheet and if its ill write ten thousand words in the next few weeks anyway so okay this is the 12th of october 61 now continuing our dissertation on the subject of the problems assessment okay now the grim part of this is that between yesterdays lecture and today we have had few mistakes now in the view of the fact that it isnt possible to make mistakes on this this is remarkable id say this was quite feat this is quite feat well it just shows you that anything is possible now the first mistake that was made is on writing down the changes on writing down changes we wrote short story when youre writing down the changes in persons life in section you are succinctly and briefly dedicated to simply putting down something that can be assessed now you cannot assess well i went down to the store and bought two pounds of sugar and this was very unusual for because i only ever buy one pound of sugar now try and assess that see so youve got more or less when it was so your assessment statement would be something on the order of 1943 sugar got the idea and if you want to get terribly long winded buying sugar you see its that brief your changes must be brief or they cannot be assessed and your assessment will go by the boards because as you read the assessment restimulative words will give you kick on the needle so thats the way that is you write that very briefly what was another one suzie female voice rock slams take precedence oh rock slam takes precedence over other needle phenomena rock slam is always greater in meaning than mere fall rock slam will develop into dialwide slam if you pursue it in almost any case if you keep pushing the fellow into it it will develop and develop and develop if you have rock slam turn on and the thing turns off again well you just ticked the edge of something and it wasnt anything there but real rock slam manifestation that really means there is something there if it goes by rock slam when you start to run it you will see yourself nice great big rock slam even if it started with little rock slam rock slams always increase in magnitude rock slam is very badly overrun flow is what it is its tremendously overrun flow fall is just slightly overrun flow but you still have the index of reality expressed by rock slam the only needle phenomena you pay attention to while doing any kind of an assessment is rise and i suppose at any moment this rise is going to rise up again on some of the new students and so forth and theyre suddenly going to say oh well that was very strong reaction because it rose and it rose and it rose my comment on something like that was i hope you provided him with parachute this is about as close as that is to scientology why dont we pay any attention to rock slam pardon rise we pay attention to rise of any kind whatsoever because you dont know what turned it on you have idea of what turned it on because it doesnt turn off and so it doesnt mean anything you see why it doesnt mean anything it is latent reaction of the needle its always latent youve said something the person thinks it over and gets there and its too much for him it exceeds his reality and he cant confront it so after on that question or in two questions or in six questions or half an hour later while you were saying something else in each case you start to get rise rise is not spontaneous start you do not spontaneously start rise so you cannot identify what began the rise so if you start to run it down on the basis of what he couldnt confront you could adjudicate this you could say the needle was rising therefore it was obvious that the pc could not confront yeah but how are you going to finish out the sentence how can the sentence be finished in the first place hes not going to confront any part of it so youre not going to find it now you could go over if you had tape recording of everything you had said and everything that had happened in the last few minutes preceding the rise and the few minutes after you noticed it and then you took this one by one item by item it might be word it might be phrase it might be this it might be that you could probably find what started the needle rising and after that you would be wiser than you were before because the needle would simply stop rising thats interesting isnt it rise is meaningful it does mean that something has occurred which the pc is not about to confront with magnitude it means something has occurred he is going to throw his vehicle into reverse and step on the accelerator straight down to the floorboard that has happened but what from what from now it is highly highly highly doubtful if you would ever be able to trace what it is from you could get near what it was from but of course you have to solve the whole case to get him to approach what he retreated from so now its not worth it because after youve resolved everything you could resolve and worked everything you could work all you would know then is that you had said something that began rise thats all you would know forcing the pc to confront something which the pc is seeking to get away from will normally cause some sort of an arc break now an auditor has to do it to some degree but when you have rising needle phenomena you are already confronting something that he is not about to go near and matter how much you pushed him overwhelmed him beat him arc broke him overwhumped him in general youre not going to get him to front up to it and thats it hell front up to something else and tell you that was it but youre asking for showers of red herrings to go across the track youre asking for all kind of things to occur so you just dont fool around with rise im just repeating that just to make sure that its on the record good and hard you just dont fool around with one it means the pc couldnt confront something but in view of the fact that tracing back the something is both time consuming and uninformative why do it now you go over series of terminals and youre going over series of terminals and all of sudden you notice the needle is rising well it means that somewhere in the last five terminals you went over you struck one that he couldnt confront well it violates the rules of auditing because he doesnt have reality on it to audit it so why are you interested in it see you couldnt audit it even if you found out what it was pc will not respond under auditing to something which causes rise now youve got something else that baffles you sometimes as youre busy doing something youll see pc all of sudden start to rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and then rise and rise and rise and rise well theres nothing wrong with rise because itll eventually wind up with high tone arm but as youre running things tone arms go high dont try to restrain the rise of tone arm so it causes high tone arm all right and you audit bit further and then the needle falls and falls and falls and falls and falls and falls well you dont change the process do you i mean just keep on doing this all tone arm rises and all tone arm falls are of course accompanied by needle rises and needle falls has to be because the two are interconnected of course unless you have meter builtt by pembry then theyre independent im merely saying that because theres just been weve just laid down the law on hpahca must have meter because were about to turn out hpas and hcas that can operate with emeters and an auditor should have the tools of his trade and they are beginning to show up already with old pieces of garbage you know that have been hoisted out and were built in 1952 by god knows who you know and theyre mainsconnected shortcircuited only put 220 volts between the hands of the pc you see and were already running into this so the hence the crack because this is the first squawk i have heard was from the gentleman mentioned now the best guarantee of case increase is the needle rises and the needle falls which causes tone arm rise and tone arm fall well so therefore rising is part of it but it is not diagnostic when youre doing something now sometimes your pc has an arc break and your rudiments are out and all the needle will do is rise and when you get all of the rudiments in and the arc break cured up why the needle doesnt rise much or it falls or something or something you get the idea i mean what you want to know from meter number one you want meter that will tell you the truth see you want meter that is good standard meter that wont give you buggy reaction wont be so sensitive you cant read things wont do this wont do that and so forth good standard meter all right given that what you want is positive reaction and your positive reactions are all needle reactions except rise rise is the unpositive reaction so it is not diagnostic and that is about all there is to it you just for fun sometime when you see pcs needle rising and youre coffee shopping somehow or another try to trace down what started it rising oh youll probably be able to do it fifteen twenty minutes half an hour something like that and youll probably find out cat walked by the auditing room window or there was lawn mower started up in the next field or you mentioned the word work all of which gave you data that you could have had anyhow or didnt need of value all right what was another one of these female voice rudiments out oh well yes pcs do not run with rudiments out goals will not assess with rudiments out and if its also true that this list this checklist when you start going over it for section p why itll also misbehave if your rudiments are out thats why the assessment has to be done in model session securely and severely so you have to get the rudiments in because any assessment will go by the boards if rudiments are out it happens on an average of once week someplace in the world that for half an hour of one session someplace in the world pc is audited with rudiments in its accidental its accidental he didnt mean it that way but they cure it up pretty quick this is snide snide and sarcastic isnt it but honest thats almost the way it begins to look to you know you know if you really want to know what rudiments in looks like run session like this shortsession the pc run model session and get the rudiments very severely in audit the pc for ten minutes on something we dont care what even the process you should be running and then put the end rudiments in and youre going to say what happened to the rudiments that i put in little while ago all right so you put the end rudiments in you give the pc little bit of break and then you start the session again and put beginning rudiments in and theyre out and you say but i just put rudiments in there hasnt been any auditing theres been break so you get the beginning rudiments in and you run ten minutes worth of process and then you put the end rudiments in and the rudiments are out whats going on and you will begin to get of the opinion that it is impossible to put rudiments in you know why you never asked the question second time you very often as common failing you say are you withholding anything and the fellow says well clank whats that ah well thats uh its nothing really but joe and i joe and i uh we were down at the cafe last night till two oclock and did nothing but discuss your auditing oh i see all right okay all right now is it all right now if i audit this process on you something or other what you yourself run sometimes run on the rudiments nonconfront get the idea you dont quite confront this and you dont repeat it you say do you have present time problem clank whats that present time problem well i had an awful fight last night with my landlady an awful fight and shes throwing out and as matter of fact right now while we are being audited why my bags are out on the front porch and the bags are all out on the front porch and so forth and its raining and so forth and so on well man of action at all would go ahead and try to run session person who thinks auditing will do everything would go ahead and try to run session person who wouldnt would say you go get in taxicab or something of that sort and you move yourself and remove yourself over to your lodgings and pick up your baggage and bring it back and then we will start the session see present time problem but whatever youve done about this present time problem we eventually get it so it doesnt knock anymore and we dont get needle reaction on it anymore so we sail along to find out if the pc has an arc break and we find out if pc is withholding anything all the way down the line well of course the next time you take swish across the rudiments we are doing what we should have done in the first place you see that was just present time problem he had twelve so every time you go over the rudiments again you will run into what you should have run into by the repetitive question you should have asked them again you see after he came back straightening up the bags or you had audited it out or something like this why you should have asked him again good just as though you had just thought of it and it was brandnew rudiment you say now do you have present time problem and it goes clang and you say whats that but your selfsatisfaction your glibness your feeling of the canarythatjustatethecat feeling you know youre feeling so good about all this that it doesnt occur to you that hes got another present time problem see or that there is also something else wrong somewhere you got the idea so each rudiment each rudiment itself is in sequence to the last rudiment now look there might be an arc break on are you withholding anything but you dont now of course clean up the arc break because it occurs before the withhold so of course when you do end rudiments you run into an arc break but it occurred in the beginning of session well thats criticism of you because it means that your rudiments were out during the whole session you must have been wasting auditing time well how could you cure such thing well theres provision in the model session for curing such thing except just asking enough and realizing that you can take up rudiment at any time you can always take up rudiment its bad practice to take them up so often that the pc gets auditing but you can always take up rudiment now just for fun sometime just for fun to enforce and show you what im talking about run somebody this way this is an experimental action run the beginning rudiments and then run the beginning rudiments and then run the beginning rudiments and then run the beginning rudiments and you will just be fascinated what happens and it will be wonderful example to you of the care you should utilize in handling rudiments and when somebody tells you your rudiments are out when somebody tells you your rudiments are out why you of course very well must realize that the rudiments you put in are still in you see nobody is saying that the rudiments you put in went out see what you straightened up on the case is still straightened up on the case if you did any kind of job at all but there were more things out than you asked for you see youve cleaned up this present time problem there was another present time problem you didnt ask for it it was there it would have knocked again there was another arc break but you didnt ask for it you see theres something else wrong with the room but you didnt ask for it that is much more difficult to achieve this room proposition because usually it takes care of everything in full sweep and weve tried to get an arc break process now which takes care of it at one full sweep so that you get all the arc breaks and were moving up there into better rudiments but one of the things that happens as your rudiments went out is after the pc got off his withholds he had another withhold but he didnt ask for it you didnt ask for it well now how could he have another withhold and you didnt ask for it and he doesnt get knock on withholds or anything of this sort thats because the withhold he gave you was damn lie you ever consider that it happens so often it happens so often so your rudiments keep going out keep going out keep going out keep going out why because the pcs withholds are not coming off youre getting something which isnt true or something that is half true and so we have this new end rudiment line which is in lieu of the withhold question in end rudiments and that is to the effect have you told any halftruths or untruths in this session or said anything just to make an impression on could be worded by the way just to influence as in some types of case you find that more workable the pc is always trying to get you on their side by complaining about somebody and that would get that well now how about this you ask pc for withhold you get knock and then the pc tells you lie of some kind or another and you ask him and you try to clean up withholds and the withholds just arent kind of cleaning up very well well they wont clean up if youre getting halftruths or untruths in fact youre going to worsen the case because it to tell an auditor an untruth of course is an overt its just throwing auditing away like crazy so you have this new end rudiment situation we still have short sessioning with us so now by beginning session doing an assessment such as the p section here and ending the session youve found it you see and by ending the session giving the pc break while you figure it out as good an excuse as any and then starting the session again why you get the pc pretty well oriented because this is about the first time you will have put him in formal session doing problems intensive if youve taken him straight off the street so that would be very very good practice extremely good practice is to finish the section get that all set you see and then put him into model session come right down get the rudiments in do the assessment out of section to fill in the first part of the p section do end rudiments give him short break note which one it is and bring him back into session again why well youre going to get double crack at this pcs rudiments now you see that double crack at the rudiments is beneficial because let us say again an arc break we have had an arc break while pulling withhold and of course you dont have another arc break question following the withhold question that sort of thing is cared for by doing beginning rudiments doing something or another which is looks like finished activity to the pc and doing an end rudiment bringing him back into session doing beginning rudiment by that time youve got this fellow pretty well grooved now you start asking him questions youre going to get much better answers now look you put the rudiments in three times if you did that now you see why it might be good thing to put the rudiments in three times because rudiment can go out while youre putting another rudiment in now that would pretty well guarantee that this pc had your had you very much his auditor at the moment you ask this burning question what problem existed immediately before and you give him the change that you have assessed now if youve got him in good session man itll shake him down to the bottom of the earth see and hell be able to recall it and hell be able to handle it and hell be in good shape doing that so it would be very good idea for you to do this in view of the fact that youre having some of this difficulty with rudiments see how you could handle rudiments now are you aware of the fact that short sessioning has in itself therapeutic value you can do the darnedest things with short sessioning everywhere pc is restive he cant keep his attention on something you are putting rudiments in normally because he cant put his attention on the session right all right childs attention span is called to your interest and attention its very short so is that of an extremely worried pc his attention span is terribly short very brief so you put the rudiments in do something handle something outrudiment the thing and give him break put the rudiments in do something something final and finished you see put the end rudiments in give him break you got the idea and if you were handling somebody like that early in an intensive short sessioning him look at all the rudiments youre going into and through now he isnt going to get very restive if every time you do this you do something and look at all the doingness youve got in this p section this is fascinating the number of things you can do as finished product or finished action well look them over you do whole assessment you can do whole assessment its not going to take you very long to do an assessment so therefore you can shortsession an assessment all right now lets look at the next point here we say what problem existed immediately before clank whatever the occurrence was you write down the problem the pc gives and now you could just turn loose and you could simply run what was unknown about that problem with whatever descriptive word it was get the tone arm action free on the thing in pretty good shape you find that this twentyminute test will get in your road sometimes on one of these things but id leave it in for class ii auditors but you could finish up that problem see just neat as package you know finish it up dust it off might not last long it also might last for three sessions but end your session give him end rudiments give him break something like that now if theyve got new auditing period coming up in the afternoon take up something else dont you see which is of course what youve got to locate the confusion before that change now i call to your attention by the way in passing and discussing this activity its the confusion before the change it is not the confusion before the problem now you must be very sure that that is what is asked the confusion before the change and you may get some entirely different period than existed that the problem existed in the problem also might have drifted out of that time area while you were running it and is longer the confusion before that change it is problem he has had for long long while now if you ask him confusion before that problem he will say well actually the soldiers of king henry viii were after because i had written brochure criticizing him for his number of wives violates the problems intensive see because that problem went long way back now to understand that fully you must realize that the only reason people move slowly get parked on the track or anything else is that problems become timeless the timelessness of problems compose the reactive mind timelessness occurs whenever you are having difficulty in dealing with companies that do business in getting them to answer your letters in getting them to dispatch any goods in getting them to this in getting them to that and you just cant seem to get anything done think of this they are slow to the degree that they have problems they cant solve they are inactive to the degree that they have problems they cant solve so most of their actions then are reactive they are not as result of thought but theyre drifting in the timelessness of problems every new action adds into the old problem and it gets to point where nothing we do will resolve the problem so it doesnt matter what we do then does it and youll find more business firms get in that frame of mind theyve had terrible problems of some kind or another and so on well ill give you better objective view the bailiffs in us the sheriff has just moved all ones goods out of the house and aunt isabel is being upset because the table was not polished that morning and she goes around and tells everybody in the house that she is very upset because they have forgotten to polish certain table its going to be sold at public auction now can you get the sort of attitude people would have toward aunt isabel well do you realize that person who is totally overwhelmed whose head is half cut off by the guillotine or something of this sort he just feels totally overwhelmed by life you come along you give him something that is so trivial compared to these enormously important problems hes worrying about see this is 1961 and hes terribly worried about having his head cut off in 1789 see hes so concerned about it that really theres nothing you can do about it and its terrible problem and that is so big in comparison of magnitude of what you want him to do which is maybe wipe his shoes before he walks in the house that anything you say is stupid do you get how this could work the other way and he has this same attitude toward other people that the whole family would have had toward aunt isabel at that particular moment he just sort of looks at them apathetically theyre talking in another world about another subject that has bearing on any reality something on the order of come to dinner let us go to the show the car has run out of gas anything that you want to say to such person matter how immediate it is maybe hes standing in the rain you know and you say well lets walk over and get under the porch the suggestion you have made is as silly you see its as silly as aunt isabel having to have the table polished and sometimes you can get these things in some kind of an order of magnitude in an attitude and you can see how some people do that or see how people react and such people react to everything in life this way everything in life that comes up such as you ought to go out and get job so that you can earn money so that people can eat you see and they are gripped in this tremendously overwhelming problem of some kind or another and their immediate response is saying oh well you go it doesnt matter really you know eat what what you see is an apparent apathy actually the person in actual apathy is really not in apathy at all hes just apathetic toward everything he himself is in fantastic foment hes in agony but his attitude demonstrates one of apathy and when people have problems of such magnitude that nothing could possibly solve them and everything is trivial compared to them then they give this response of never doing anything never communicating never acting never solving any problems and they kind of go along and they just hope itll all somehow work out somehow but they couldnt say how but of course none of that has any influence on this tremendous overwhelming problem which they have the odd part of it is is they dont know what the tremendous overwhelming problem is they cant articulate that either and you get the state of mind of people who are stumbling around in life and the ineffective where you see person being terribly ineffective about existence and so on theyve got some state of mind like this they are not easily and calmly in an apathetic serenity they volcanoes going off would be better order of magnitude to describe how they feel about things so that if you ask them to take their attention off these tremendous problems they know theyre going to get ate up so they have attention to spare you see and they know that if they get their attention off of this thing or if they get handled little bit roughly or if they get twisted around or they get an arc break or if something is wrong with the session they know whats going to happen to them their attention is going to shift and the whole world is going to fall in on them there is some tremendous problem thats about to eat them up and youve asked them to shift their attention too hard or too fast and it is painful its extremely painful all right you get person who is in this state of mind they cant spare you very much attention for auditing and you get the rudiments in and they can spare you little bit more attention and you run something thats effective it illuminates their case immediately directly on the heading of problem see like well what was unknown about that problem is what youre going to run and now youre going to assess the confusion before the change all right all of these things are right what theyre stuck in theyre very meaningful they your assessment will put them right there where they can put their attention they know you are with them they know theyre being audited because they know where their attention ought to be and their attention can be there comfortably if youve done good job of assessment you have found where their attention is stuck on what problem their attention is stuck and having found on what problem their attention is stuck you then can go ahead and audit them but they pay very little attention to your auditing unless you follow some of this stuff so you get your rudiments in make sure that the environment is as dressed up as it can be then to handle one of these badoff cases i mean case that is having trouble is getting advance not necessarily bad off but it just isnt getting advance in auditing and then handle problems and confusions within this illuminative fashion as given in this problems intensive what immediately is going to happen well the individuals attention is being traced right where his attention is the reason he cant doing anyth do anything effective with your auditing command is his attention is all tied up on something else only what little attention he has left in present time is either tied up on something else also or trying to find out what his attention is tied up on and he very often thinks that his attention is tied up on something in his environment so hes quite restive hes quite nervous now almost any pc is difficult to audit if you think pcs are easy to audit youd better change your mind because youre looking at the wrong standard and youll never asis the situation pcs are never quiet to audit unless theyre in total catatonic apathy pcs do things about auditing sometimes they are good response sometimes they are bad response but pcs respond to auditing and if you think that when you audit nothing ought to be there responding then you should change your ideas about auditing because something ought to be responding and if you dont get any response at all from pc you start worrying if theres change being registered in the pc you start worrying like mad the pc is just sitting there and the pc is just answering the auditing question yes well how have you endured poker in kings eye or something you know and how have you not endured it or something and how has king endured poker in your eye you see and the pc is saying well ive endured it so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and you say another question and he says so on and so on and you say another question he says so on and so on another question and he says so on and so on and it just goes on like that hour after hour well your rudiments arent just out theyre in the next county there is something really wrong because theres change occurring actually to audit pc in that line you are in violation of the auditors code youre in direct violation of it which says you audit pc audit process as long as it produces change well whats change well change is registration or action on the emeter but where pc has tremendously heavy problems these problems are of very very long duration and all youre getting ordinarily are harmonics on the main problem and youve got to cut him back to the main problem hell get there eventually sometimes he gets there splang and almost blows himself all over the ceiling the first time you ask certain proportion of cases i dont know what that proportion will be you put him in model session youve got their problems intensive all done right up to the point of the first assessment you put them insession you assess it and you ask them question now what problem existed immediately before that change with you know whatever the occurrence was eyaaczooo and with pale scream his brains practically spatter all over the ceiling youre going to get that every now and then pcs going to look at you with some horror he going to flinch theyre always glad to find out sometimes youre going to turn on wild somatics and theyre awful awful glad to have them oh thats what turns on these somatics they say oh youll thats what this is worried about yes the whole back of my head is off i can feel it you know its missing except for the horrible excruciating pain that is going through the middle of my head so thats whats been turning that on you know whatever it was they got the problem they didnt hardly hear themselves speaking you know and all of sudden terrific cognition youll also get totally different response you have to take the top of it off so lightly that they give you well what was the problem that existed before that change about buying sugar so lets see i guess it was how much sugar to buy ohhh im afraid i would follow that through at once with what was the confusion that existed just before that change of buying sugar well trying to figure out how much sugar to buy i would say thank you very much and go back and do right assessment this time thats just total miss but sometimes the pc is so worried about it that he cant confront it that he cant differentiate it and youll get lot of little tiny problems and your first few runs on this thing will be little tiny microscopic problems that he guesses he must have had thats as close as he can get to this area you see he guesses he must have had them now you ask him well now how did you arrive at that well i just figure it must have been so and you say was it so did you really have that problem what was the problem you really did have there oh well i really wouldnt know what problem i had actually i could just guess at what problem person in that particular circumstances might have had you see there was change i bought new car and i just guess that person who was buying new car he would have to have he would have to have some kind of an idea that he wanted to buy new car so i guess his problem would be what kind of new car to buy yeah that must have been it youre going to run into that one too and thats about as profitless as swapping pounds for chinese taels this is totally profitless what are you going to do about situation like that well handle what he gives you if he cant get any better handle what he gives you do another assessment see if you can come closer to it or take it up it might really have been problem maybe thats just the way he talks while hes having the problem but in the presence of tremendous problems you get freeze of time time is doesnt exist time just doesnt exist in problem its just something that goes on and on and on how else would you account for the fact that people still have problems they had several thousand years ago and you start tracing back one of these problems and the common run when you hit the jackpot on one of these questions the common run is saying well yes and i so on what was unknown about it well the color of the ladies hats and out of curiosity you say what ladies hats you got picture there or something so on oh yes i got picture here well what kind of hats are they thinking you know you got something in the seventeenth century you know something like that well its these these priestess ostrich hats oh yeah oh where is that you got any idea about it well priestess ostrich hats you see that was on the planet zimbo and so forth and there it was and so on and we all had that problem there everybody had the problem the funny part of it is there was nothing unknown about the problem on the planet zimbo everything was known because everybody knew what the problem was everybody knew you had this problem there wasnt any unknowns about the problem at all man have you hit the part of the track where the problem was the know you know you see problem itself can become the total knowingness can you think of any problems that are in that category the problem itself is the total knowingness let mention something to you and of course there are unknowns about the problem because everybody knows the problem well those things run way back along the track and in the normal course of running if you were to ask person on the next line all right what confusion occurred just before that problem well everybody in disagreement about buying new hats on the planet zimbo yeah there was hell of confusion well that isnt what were trying to straighten out with problems intensive youve got to ask before that change and your change has got to be very specific and you must have your rudiments in some kind of shape at the time you ask that next question because its another assessment only its just in verbal assessment you know you say what what confusion existed just before that change oh well oooh yes well that was eight years before that tha tha yeah that yup confusion and so forth and now youre going to go off onto list of persons now to get any kind of thinkingness on this subject at all you see its species of assessment so you had certainly better have your rudiments in some kind of shape so when youre sorting out pcs do the rudiments do something of this do the end rudiments give them break do the do the rudiments do something about it you know do the end rudiments give them break and youll find out if youre handling particularly wild cases that have been stalled youll really get places even though the person appears to sit perfectly happily in that chair hour after hour and say well i guess id put out kings eye yeah well the king had put out my eye yes thats right yeah lets see other people would put out the kings eye yeah thats right and so forth and hes evidently on like this and youre fooled youre fooled actually the person is just frantic and theyre sort of given up and theyre sort of asking it anyhow even though it doesnt do any good see thats their basic auditing response well you can queer that pitch by shortsessioning them well i didnt mean to overlabor the point but im trying to give you some kind of design of the thing and what happens now the problem floats but the confusion didnt so its the confusion that got them oriented the confusion wont float that confusion youre asking for that occurred and then you nailed it down to specific dramatis personnae mama papa aunt agnes uncle bill the schoolteacher george and of course mamie now when you start security checking that area of the track its sort of hey youve really got to confront this this one youve got to confront because it nails an area of track and therefore that isnt going to float anyplace its going to stay right where it is its going to have an immediate and direct influence on present time you very often will have pc who is escaping present time by being in the past and you make mistake sometimes when youre auditing pc by believing that the pc would audit better on his terminals line and you could just skip rudiments or any problems hes having in this life and just skip those things because its much more significant and you could undercut it much better if you went back on the line the pc is back on the line because its safer and one of the symptoms of that is the pc who never gets picture pictures are dangerous well when did they become dangerous you trace it back and you find out pc had some pictures at one time and then in auditing something happened on the special course which is occurring right at this moment in angeles they have responded with enormous enthusiasm to these new rudiments and one person one student on the course they were just getting the rudiments in ran into the arc break process and promptly and instantly had his pictures turn on for the first time in six years they had turned off during an auditing session theyd been off ever since and all of sudden they had turned on on that process they were good and bright and clear and he was sailing beautifully everybody is quite happy on that course apparently but there is an example there is an example of response to getting rudiment in all right how about just getting the rudiments in on somebody that never had any processing before well youd be surprised how much there is to get in on the person and what youre doing is showing him that life is solvable life is solvable life is solvable its solvable at these little finite points now its characteristic of pc who is in apathy that hes got to solve it all at once thats characteristic of pc in apathy that if hes going to solve it at all its got to be solved all at once now you very often working in central organization or running great many pcs will have pc who has got to have it solved by this afternoon or they are going to die thats going to perish the lot got to be done by this afternoon their case has got to be resolved is what im saying you see by this afternoon and that is symptom of the most severe apathy backed by terrific franticness and sometimes youll move this little gauze of apathy off and youll expose some of this franticness and then they all of sudden have got to solve all the problem right now they wont do an available auditing command they will take the auditing command you give them which is the available command and then they will make it into right now command this command has to resolve their whole case by one answer well why is that thats because the whole track has collapsed the fact that problems are timeless and problems join to problems and it all makes sort of timeless strata also makes very explosive strata and of course anything that is that explosive about which they would worry that much of course has to be solved as explosively as that they have look at it the way sometimes soldiers or something like that theyre trying to fix something and theyre all standing around trying to fix this thing you know and all of sudden one will haul out gun and shoot hell out of it or theyll kick it or theyll throw it away you know its just got to be huuugh its giving them trouble so boy are they going to give it trouble you know its just straight q and nothing to do with solving the thing it has to do with we must have desperate solution by which to get rid of it all at once now and of course we know all at once now get rid of it is going to add up exclusively to just one point we dont get rid of it we get rid of the pc if we had such thing every once in while we look for one button that just on when i say one button it is often interpreted as one command given in one unit of time one expression and that one expression is very explosive you see that we just give one command not repetitively just one order to the pc we say scaroooow see and the pc goes boom rrrrrrr goes clear have you seen this around do you recognize some of this all right now that becomes necessary to the degree that the pc cant if pc cant do any of the little things he then in desperation will have to do one of the big ones and all auditing is done by gradients all auditing is done by gradients and it depends on this kind of thing successful auditing it depends on reaching reality the pc can tolerate its getting to picture the pc can see that the pc can see at this moment of time in the auditing session its not what the pc should be willing to see or ought to be able to see its what the pc can do and what they really can do are little gradients you could possibly confront building house if you thought of it in terms i mean yourself with your own paws youu could probably confront it on the basis of the fact that well you could work on it half an hour every saturday thatd seem all right you know you could go out and scrape some mortar and bricks together and cut little grass and so forth that would seem all right im sure that you could confront building fairly large house if you thought you could do it at half an hour every saturday you can afford that much time dont you see and it wouldnt take too much exertion and the amount of bricks and things youd have to carry you see you certainly could carry them for half an hour and you start adding it up thatd seem pretty reasonable to some people other people you say all right now building house from scratch and the person gets the idea of well building house from scratch uhm oh look why cant you just put it all tthere right now you know why do we have to go through all of this this you know nonsensy little steps and all of these doodledads and so on and so on and construction of things and building things why cant we just say house you know and there it appears well theyre on lower harmonic of ot you see but the reason why they say that the reason why they say that should be of interest to you an auditor its because they cant confront spending half an hour every saturday thatd be too much oh brother now we have to carve that down and we have to get something that is real and we will eventually achieve it on the basis well what is it that if every year we go out and move one brick one half an inch could you tolerate that much action toward building house you see it carves down from the gottabehererightnow you actually carve it down you find out the pc has reality of this take money there are lot of guys running around i know some of them personally that are running around on the subject of money the like of which i never heard of their wives and they are just in some kind of wild mess on the subject because theyve got to have million dollars or million pounds now see there isnt even time for it to be carried in the door sack by sack see its got to be now and every idea and plan they get you see and that is to say well you see if we took the north pole and connected it with the south pole and put subway between them and charged the penguins eighteenmillion dollars penguin for using the subway and so forth why then our profit on the matter would be soandso and youll find them sitting around with some highly impractical stupidity of this particular character and you know they just seem to sit back in their chairs further and elevate their feet higher and smoke more slowly but these structures that are going to happen right now and the amount of money that has got to be made by tomorrow you see keeps increasing all right we take such person and we say how much money could you have oh millions is the first response millions i could just have millions and millions and millions of dollars read it on the emeter you start taking it down million by million and try to find the reality of how much money they could actually have and the first thing you know you meet the other side of the circle which is how much money they really cant have and youll find out that it is two cents or farthing or that nobody makes coin quite small enough and thats the amount of money they could really have and they could really have that and if you gave them that much money they would know they had some money but they think in terms of millions all the time you see its got to be millions and millions they get poorer and poorer and poorer you see but they the only money would be millions its very interesting im only bringing that up just one point im trying to show you something about case the case that has got to have the total change now the case which makes change now are almost the same case now the case that just sits there apathetically knows that there cannot be big enough change or big enough effect right now to solve his problems so hes given up on the idea of millions hes given up on the idea of the huge explosion hes given up that anything is going to happen at all hes cancelled all this out and hes on lower rung than that he cant have change because there is change tiny enough until you figure out what it is well now how does he get into that state well he got into that state by having problems that were so overwhelming that he must keep his attention on them all the time and he knows nothing could be done about them but theyre terribly important but you have to do something about them but theres nothing can be done about them so that everything else thats going on in life is trivia including your auditing command your auditing command has nothing to do with his problems nothing to do with his problems unless you have the exact problem if youve got the exact problem your auditing command will have something to do with his case if youve got the exact confusion which made him get that problem your auditing commands will have something to do with his case but up to the point of that even though you can find his goal even though you can find his terminal even though you can do other things to him even though you can run processes of one kind or another on him you couldnt find gradient tiny enough for him to do the case actually cannot do any of your processes except find the problem he is stuck in because he but youre not finding any problem you get the misnomer here hes sitting looking at it so all you have to do is just kind of shake it you dont have to put him back on the track because hes there you dont have to move him around you are not moving the pc anyplace youre just trying to find out whats the pc looking at and the whole of this problems intensive is just dedicated to that where is this pc stuck and what problem is this pc overwhelmed with now the trick is is he doesnt know or they wouldnt be he can tell you then lot of problems glibly but proper assessment on this thing does give you exactly what his attention is on and an improper assessment will give some offbeat so thats why he gives you such i figurefigure problems sometimes you say what problem existed immediately before that change well i it must have been i guess well one could say now how are you how are you getting that now how are you figuring that out oh well it just seems to that person in that condition would ordinarily have this type of problem you havent got it because hes asking from what he conceives to be different time band and the first clue to any of this is the problem is the time band of the pc it is the moment in time of the pc and he wouldnt be saying person who would have had problem like that way back then so on and so on because he isnt way back then he is in the problem he is in and hes in other problem and you will find him sitting square in the problems if your assessment is done properly and if your rudiments are in your assessment will get done properly you havent got any difficulties if your rudiments are in and if you keep your rudiments in your assessments and questions and that sort of thing will perforce fall right out in your lap because youve said the one magic question that attracts his attention instantly to where his attention is and then he conceives that to be instantly now and when you hit this phenomenon exactly right on the button the pcs attention is not being dragged off of anything you never drag his attention off of something to the problem well he doesnt have present time problem he doesnt have an arc break he doesnt have an immediate withhold the room is all right the session is in progress all right youre already eliminating anything that might get his attention off of this problem and youve got his attention not insession but on problem and now you say what problem existed immediately before buying sugar in 1948 what problem existed immediately before that and if youve done it very smoothly his attention will be sitting right there and he just goes off brrrrrrrrt there it is see and you will very often get an oh my god now you dont get what do you know its much more heartfelt expression now pc who is arc breaking while youre trying to do goals terminal assessment is arc breaking or getting apathetic because youre taking his attention off of what his attention should be on and it is violating his idea of whats safe the only thing that is safe is to keep his attention on this problem that is safe and nothing else is safe so youre trying to drag his attention off of the problem and he knows thats not safe so hes flying back in your teeth so hes arc breaking hes flying off this way hes making extravagant statements to you he is upset he is caving in one way or the other he is upset now exactly how does he get upset well he moves his attention just huhhuhhuhhuh youre asking him something now what goal would you like to if you think that you had when you were small child what goals you had hes saying huh huh huh do i dare look lets see lets see all right oh well its safe enough when i was small child lets see i had goal of playing with trains yes i had goal of playing with trains and he knows hes doing something pretty adventurous what is he doing hes actually putting his attention on different part of the time track and he knows thats not safe but he is doing it for your sake and if youve got the rudiments very heavily in and theyre very well in and hes very smoothed down and hes lots of confidence in the auditor you can do this you can actually get his attention off of his main problems and get an assessment and it all runs off and he doesnt get arc broke hardly at all and everything is fine and you wind up and youve got his goal and youve got his terminal and you can actually do it and its good thing to have because all of sudden he feels swell about it he feels fine marvelous hes got his goal and terminal can still have his attention on this problem he got away with something you see thats great now as we start running him level by level however we start getting into something else hes got to keep his attention on the auditor and hes got to keep his attention on this terminal and hes got to keep his attention on and do the auditing command and that is just too damn much mental doingness he goes then by hidden standards he resigns from the auditing session runs it all on circuit he tries to get by with it he vias the auditing command so that he can still put his attention properly on the problem and boy does he arc break he arc breaks and he gets upset or hes just apathetic and just grinds which is level below arc breaking pc who just sits there and grinds is very often not up to getting arc broke remember that well i see you got i guess you could put out kings eye with poker and king could put out your eye with with with an order and somebody else could pput out kings eye with i guess uh uh uh put out kings eye with ive forgotten the auditing command what was it oh how could you put out the kings eye well you could put out kings eye with oh just put it out just put it out thats all just put it out yeah just put it out thats it yeah well thank you very much for the session you watch that when pcs they dont even have to run in that tone of voice its just grind grind grind you see nothing occurring nothing much changing on the case ah pc has got his attention on some horrendous problem of some kind or another and so he gives you this little attention over here which is monotone and any time thetans attention is monotone on the lower ranges of the tone scale you can just bet your bottom kropotnik that the most of his attention is absorbed in some tremendous problem that if he looked at it squarely and if it looked at him squarely and it was all solved the whole universe would blow up attention is all absorbed over here because thats not natural action one of the things that speeds up my auditing of pcs and that sort of thing is because i look at them and i see them driftyeyed and dreamy and so forth and drifting off and getting apathetic and theyre grinding and i say very forthrightly i say all right now what are you looking at what are you doing what are you thinking about what are you worried about wheres this going and wheres the arc break and how when did the havingness start to go down and what is this and what are you looking at and what are you worried about and oh well thats what it is all right now you can tell its okay and after five or ten minutes of pleading with them they will get their attention off of the problem enough to actually say what it is see because that requires an effort too see itd be too much effort to say what the problem is so its kind of all operates as withhold you see how pc would act every time you have an arc breaky pc you would you have violated to some degree fixation of attention on problems it isnt just fixation of attention you have violated his fixation of attention on problems youve asked him to do something he doesnt consider safe it is not your auditing he is finding fault with he is actually merely finding fault with having his attention shifted and when person is in this condition you have to work like mad to make sure that you keep his attention centered where it is centered and not shifted around so therefore problems intensive is just about the hottest thing you can do with case because theres where his attention is sitting but now what weve done is add up way of getting backtrack problems not present time problems were getting backtrack problems which slide up and become present time problems of long duration but were getting the problems which underlie the hidden standards and then were getting the prior confusions which made the hidden standards and the problems necessary in other words were turning loose machine guns howitzers hedgehogs and few atom bombs loose on this same problem but all of it can be turned loose because his attention is right where his attention is his attention is right there anyhow i mean so you havent asked him to shift his attention and hell run problems intensive like lamb whereby hed blow up in your face and explode all over half the universe if you did anything else you see therefore it looks like very calm safe productive auditing which it is of course but it looks like well it looks like anybody could do it it gives that very definite appearance you know well anybody could do this its rather sloppy process rather wide and so on it actually isnt sloppy process it actually isnt wide at all youre just being assisted like mad in running it by the fact that youre running the pc only where the pcs attention is obsessively fixed and you never ask him to move his attention very much the only attention youre asking him to do is just improve his attention so that he can feel confident and not have to worry about sitting there in session he can go ahead and worry about his problem all he wants to and youll find out you dont have arc breaky pcs if you bust in on cases to this wise now we do need problems intensive that covers the whole track that doesnt just devote itself to one lifetime whether i will ever dream one of those things up or figure out way to do that and so on is neither here nor there you have this one now be happy with that i would like to say one more thing ive done lot of talking here which may or may not have assisted you it may might not be meaningful to what you are doing but auditors blame themselves because of arc breaky pcs they think they must be doing something wrong there is some selfblame of some kind or another attached and pcs blame themselves because they arc break so that if you can get certainty as an auditor on exactly why session goes wrong if you can see the exact mechanism and its exact magnitude if you can see exactly where session is detouring and why session detours just in terms of persons attention is on fixated problem of such magnitude his attention is on this problem to such degree it must be on it because of the tremendous importance of the problem that he doesnt dare have any other attention for anything so that anything else that disturbs him causes him to go into through this phenomena you know as an arc break and the only thing you have done is disturb his attention but let make one more comment on that which i think you will find of great interest you very often as this problems intensive will eventually demonstrate to you in running it on pc you very often have been running pcs with present time problems without recognizing any part of it and very often pc has unknowingly to himself and unreceivedly by you stated to you many times his problem he has stated many many times his problem and you have never heard it as problem you never hear it as problem you go ahead and solve it and yet he has told you this problem over and over and he arc breaks when youre auditing him and he gets upset and so on and yet hes actually telling you the problem in one way or another over and over and over it is actually quite vocal its quite out loud youre hearing it with both ears but its not going any deeper than the drum its fantastic problem is problem it is what the pc is worried about thats what problem is or its the problem of unresolvable longparked timelessness of conflicting forces which the pc cant do anything about or which is he feels he ought to do something about or somebody else ought to do something about but its big problem and he will sit there in the auditing chair very often and tell you over and over and over again his present time problem of long duration and you never hear it and when youre running this problems intensive youre very often going to have pc come up and give you something and something is going to go if youve been auditing before this you say go clink now wait minute this pcs been saying this all the time well dont feel silly dont feel silly about it youre going to run into problems that pcs have talked about and talked about and talked about because youve never recognized them as problems usually on the basis that everybody has them or something of that sort i wouldnt actually shouldnt actually generalize any further than that but i will give you classic example of problem that went on for very very long time and actually neither the auditor nor preclear in this particular instance recognized it as problem the problem was how the pc could get some auditing and the auditor always solved it by giving him some only it was totally goofy because the pc was basically worried about whether or not he could be audited that was the problem was he auditable at all and the auditor always just audited him to show him that he could have some auditing and they went on for long time with the problem and solving the problem and it interrupted every session and it upset every session and it went on for the longest kind of time why would it go on this long well thats just basically and flatly and positively the auditor never recognized that any problem is problem and there arent certain problems that become solvable targets there arent certain problems you should solve and certain problems you should run im sure that nearly all of you at some if youll think it over there are certain problems that you feel should be solved not should be run the pc has these problems and he doesnt recognize they are his problems and then you do something about the problem as problem now we go reductio ad absurdum the pc says i am hungry you say immediately that is problem and so instead of feeding him why you give him big rundown on it well what youve missed at this particular point you see is it isnt problem with the pc of long duration or anything else hes going through repetitive cycle and he long since has become totally submerged into the mishmash of this universe so he longer considers any of these things problems it isnt problem he gets hungry every few hours and thats just the way it is you see its not real problem to the pc so of course you wouldnt take it up as problem youd tell him well go on have something to eat but there are other ones theyre much more definite like this theyre much more positive is theres the fellow with problem of well can auditors audit you know hes an instructor in an academy and hes been teaching lot of auditors and he something of that sort and he sits there and well do you have any problems and so forth and he well tpling you know what problem was that well i was having little problem with the students and so forth and about the third session that you get pling and hes having little bit of problem with students why youd better get busy you know hes got problem hes got present time problem what is this present time problem and you start searching it out you find out by this time that its with these with students well all right and what is this problem with students now phrase this problem with students what is this problem with students now all right how would you describe that all right state that as problem all right give another version of it now what is this problem and all of sudden the fellow says oooooooh well can can the problem actually is not with students well what is it with well its why i became an instructor well why did you become an instructor well i became an instructor because i wanted to find out if people could audit and i dont think they can you know and uh its its the problem is how to get audited by people that i know cant auditincluding you you get the idea so you very often take the matteroffact problem that you think is just you should just go right ahead and solve and its actually right in there its real present time problem its real honesttogoodness dyedinthewool gotbronzestarsonit present time problem there it is and if you say this is ordinary this is usual this is natural this is like eating so therefore we dont have to take it up well ill call something to your attention problem on the subject of scientology is of the order of magnitude of withhold on the subject of scientology now youve seen withhold stop case cold havent you have you ever seen withhold stop case cold do you have any reality on that at all hm audience yes all right now can you imagine present time problem on the subject of scientology stopping case cold right well that doesnt mean that you should pay attention to every present time problem the pc has just making eight sessions out of it or something like that but watch this pc and if he starts coming up with problems about scientology then for heaven sakes get it stated measured so forth have you got present time problem cling and its something about scientology and so forth give it the same order of magnitude that youd give withhold on the subject of scientology and this fellow says well i got withhold i didnt phone my boss from the country club be and tell him i was not coming back to work on monday i had withhold from him you know thats the bing you get well man you could run the case weeks with that withhold and nothing would have happened well i made an appointment to be audited yesterday and then i didnt keep it now try to get over that one because the withhold is on the subject with which the pc is dealing at the instant hes being audited so therefore the auditing itself and the presence of the subject matter itself are restimulator to the withhold or to the problem and everything you are doing is restimulator to the withhold or the problem he can forget about his boss his boss isnt here but he cant forget about scientology hes being run on it so you give present time problems on the subject of scientology the same order of magnitude youd give withholds on the subject of scientology when youre assigning somebody to do security check always assign the last two pages of sec check form 3 the last two pages youll find there they outweigh all of the earlier pages if theres anything wrong there itll just park the case in its tracks well similarly problem and because youre an auditor and the pc says i have problem about auditors i just dont ever seem to have an auditor to have problem get him to state it for heaven sakes dont solve it by being better auditor than hes had before get the idea because youre running pc who has continuous constant present time problem and the case will behave just like case with present time problem and it will arc break and it will get very upset and it will blow all over the place and it will be very critical of the auditor and it will do all of these things why youre running case with present time problem how did you miss it well you ran case with present time problem and missed it because the present time problem is something youre solving thats the most usual course of human events you dont look at the problem the pcs got because you are doing the solution to it the solution to it is right in his hand so therefore there is particular reason to handle as problem the problem i just discussed with you just moment ago was in existence for eleven years before it was contacted now smile over that one if you want to it was in existence for eleven years could the person ever get any auditing that was the problem and it was eleven years before it was suddenly detected the pc of course had never gotten any auditing in all those years because he was being audited over present time problem of could he ever have any auditing during those eleven years how do you like that interesting isnt it so present time problem and the only thing i will give you is passing note on all of this problems intensive present time problem in rudiments present time problem in the produ in the problems intensive is not what the auditor would like to think problem is it is what the problem is to the pc and what the pc thinks the problem is and what is problem to the pc whether the auditor is solving it or not solving it or what hes doing about the problem or how intimate the problem is to an auditing session or any of these considerations have nothing to do with it problem is simply problem and it is problem to the pc if it is problem it is problem to the pc it may be problem to you but not problem to the pc you see its whats the problem to the pc the problem is yours every time you give him an auditing command he coughs in your face problem to the pc you could keep you keep running him you know you keep running him on what part of that cough could you be responsible for doesnt do anything for the cough because it isnt problem to the pc and you cant solve problems for pc who doesnt have them as problems i know ive said something that sounds terribly obvious but its true you cant run and solve and clear problems to in pc if theyre not problems to the pc it sounds an awful obvious statement but very often auditors have made up their minds whats problem to the pc dive in immediately run that because thats good hot juicy problem and its the fact that the auditor the auditor misses the fact that the reason he doesnt like well there is something about coughing he always has problem about coughing what is it well its how to wash pocket handkerchiefs well it what about coughing oh there isnt anything about coughing its handkerchiefs though my poor mother you know you know she might have had to have gone out and taken in washing to support us children well whats the problem here well there isnt any problem all right do you have present time problem he doesnt have present time problem skip it see matter while it should look to you dramatically that the thing ought to be the problem the problem is what registers on the meter and what is problem with the pc and problem is what it is matter how idiotic you think it is see dont edit problems because you can miss problems and problems that have directly to do with auditing have more weight on the case in slowing it down than any other type of problem just like withholds that had to do with scientology have more stoppage value on case than any other type of withhold okay well i hope some of this information about how you do problems intensive is valuable to you i see that you are sailing into them now and you will be doing them left and right and i think lot of fur is going to fly and youll probably have lots of questions to ask about it next week in the meanwhile thank you very much
