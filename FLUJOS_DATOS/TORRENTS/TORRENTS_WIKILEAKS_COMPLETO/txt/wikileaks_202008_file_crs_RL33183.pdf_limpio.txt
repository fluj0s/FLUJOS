majority are examined the americans with disabilities act ada overview the americans with disabilities act has often been described as the most sweeping nondiscrimination gislation since the civil rights act of 19641 as stated in the act its purpose is to provide cl ear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities2 it provides broad nondiscrimination protection for individuals with disabilities and is divided into five titles employment title i public services title ii public accommodation and services operated by private entities title iii telecommunications title iv and miscellaneous provisions title v judge alito has written or joined in numerous ada decisions while on the third circuit his decisions rely heavily on

that the limitation on major life activity by the impairment is substantialinteractive process3 however several of his decisions have been criticized as limiting the rights of individuals with disabilities4 decisions on the definition of disability statutory definition and supr eme court interpretations t h threshold issue in any ada cas is whether the individual alleging discrimination is an individual with disability and issues involving the definition have been heavily litigated the ada definition is func tional one and does not list specific disabilities it defines the term disability with respect to an individual as physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment5 the first supreme court ada case to address the definitional issue was bragdon v abbott 1998 case involving dentist who refused to treat an hiv infected individual outside of hospital6 in bragdon the court found that the plaintiffs asymptomatic hiv infection was physical impairment impacting on the major life activity of repr oduction two other supreme court cases decided in 1999 involved whether the effects of medication or assistive devices should be taken into consideration in determining whether or not an individual has disability the court in the landmark decision of sutton v united airlines7 and in murphy v united parcel service inc8 held the determination of wh ether an individual is disabled should be made with reference to m easures that mitigate the individuals impairment9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33183crs3 10 534 us 184 2002 11 confirmation of the need for strict interpretation was found by the court in the adas statement of findings and purposes where congress stated that some 43000000 americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities 42 usc 12101a1 justice oconnor observed that if congress had intende d everyone with physical impairment that precluded the performance of some isolated uni mportant or particularly difficult manual task to qualify as disabled the number of disa bled americans would surely have been much higher 12 162 f3d 778 3d cir 1998 the supreme court in the 2002 case of toyota motor manufacturing v williams10 examined whether the plaintiff was an individual with disability under the first prong of the definition of individual with disability that is whether she had physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activity justice oconnor writing for the unanimous court determined that the word substantial clearly precluded impairments that interfere in only minor way with the performance of manual tasks similarly th court found that the term major life activity refers to those activities that are of central importance to daily life finding that these terms are to be interpreted strictly11 the court held that to be substantially limited in performing manual tasks an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most peoples daily lives significantly the court also stated that the impairments impact must also be permanent or longterm decisions written and jo ined by judge alito not surprisingly given the number of judicial decisions regarding the definition of disability judge alito has written and joined in opinions on several cases on this issue generally his decisions rely heavily on the facts presented and indicate reliance on judicial precedent and regulatory interpretations in mondzelewski v pathmark stores inc12 judge alito found that butcher who had injured his back was an indivi dual with disability because he was substantially limited in the major life activity of working the plaintiff 55 year old with sixth grade education had worked at pathmark supermarket for 35 years first as bagger and then as meat cutter in march 1992 he injured his back lifting boxes of meat and was treated and restricted from lifting objects weighing more than 25 pounds he reinjured his back in december 1993 and was again treated and restricted from lifting objects weighing more than 25 pounds he claimed that when he returned to work after his second injury he was retaliated agai nst for asserting his right to reasonable accommodation under the ada by being assigned punishment shifts and being given re taliatory reprimands the district court held that mr m ondzelewski was not disabled under the ada because his back injury did not substan tially limit him in the major life activities of lifting or working and that he could not assert retaliation claim because he is not disabled in reversing this decision judge alito concluded referencing the ada regulations that court should consider an individuals training skills and abilities in determining whether the individual is substantially limited in the major life activity of working judge alito observed we accept this approach under which anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33183crs4 13 id at 784 14 385 f3d 378 3d cir 2004 15 id at 384 16 94 f3d 102 3d cir 1996 individuals training skills and abilities are taken into account in determining whether the individual is substantially limited in the major life activity of working because we owe substantial deference to the eeoc regulation in which it is set outand because it is entirely reasonable i ndeed because the effect that particular impairment will have on persons ability to work varies depending on that persons background and skills it is not easy to nvision how any other approach could be taken13 judge alito also found that the distri ct court had erred in rejecting mr mondzelewshis claim of reta liation relying on third ci rcuit opinion issued after the district courts decision judge alito f ound that persons stat us as an individual with disability was irreleva nt to assessing retaliati on claim as the ada statutory provision uses the phrase any individual and does not limit its retaliation prohibitions to individuals with disabilities in fiscus v walmart stores 14 woman with kidney fa ilure was found to be an individual with disability cathy fiscus an employee of walmart had endstage renal disease and while undergoing dial ysis requested reasonable accommodation from her employer walmart denied the request and placed ms fiscus on leave after undergoing kidney transplant she was unable to return to work for five and one half months while on leave walma rt fired ms fiscus because she had not returned to work within one year the di strict court found that ms fiscus could not bring suit under the ada since it held that she was not person with disability the third circuit court of appeals in d ecision authored by judge chertoff and joined by judge alito rejected the district courts reasoning that impaired elimination of waste and blood cleansing are nothing more than characteristics of kidney failurerather they are the effect of kidney failure in the same way that impaired thinking is the effect of organic brain disease and th fact that the effect of kidney failure is felt on an internal au tonomous organic activity is under bragdon not incompatible with finding of substantial limitation of major life activity15 in kelly v drexel university 16 the third circuit upheld the district courts grant of summary judgment to the employer fi nding that the plaintiff was not person with disability francis kelly had fractured his hip and had limp and degenerative joint disease which limited his walking and ability to climb stairs when his employer drexel university eliminated his position six years after the hip fracture mr kelly allege d

katekovich vteam rent car of pittsburgh18 an unpublished opinion written by judge barry and joined by judge alito the third circuit affirmed the district courts summary judgment findi ng that an employee with sleep disorders and depression was not an individual with disability under the ada the court found that the plaintiff had not proved th at these impairments substantially limited one or more of her major life activities the court obs erved that ms katekovichs physicians had indicated she did not have substantial limitations and that katekovichs own testimony did not monstrate that she was substantially impaired19 the third prong of the definition of disability is being regarded as having disability two cases were found where judge alito wrote or joined in opinions reversing summary judgment or ders which had rejected ar guments that an individual was regarded as having disability in polini v lucent technologies 20 an unpublished opinion by judge alito the district courts decision for summary judgment for the employer was vacated and the case was remanded the third circuit held that the rejection of recalled worker based on determination that she had failed the vision test created genuine issue concerning whether ms polini was regarded as having disability similarly in deane v pocono medical center21 an banc third circuit decision by chief judg becker joined by judge alito the court reversed and remanded the district court grant of summary judgment for the employer in deane the plaintiff nurse had been injured while lifting patient when she sought to return to light duty her employer discharged her stacy deane alleged that this was because the employer had regarded her as having disability and had failed to make reasonable accommodations the third circuit held deane has thus adduced sufficient evidence that pm c regarded her as substantially more physically impaired than she actually was22 and that she did not need to perform all the functions of her former job but only the essential job functions after parsing the legal issues and examining the eeocs inte rpretive guidance the court of appeals emphasized the need for communication between the parties and an interactive process observing that an employer who fails to engage in the interactive process runs serious risk that it will errone ously overlook an opportunity to accommodate statutorily disabled employee and thereby violate the ada23 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33183crs6 24 90 fed appx 600 3d cir 2004 25 42 usc 12112a 26 42 usc 121115 27 535 us 391 2002 28 526 us 795 1999however in parker v port authority of allegheny county24 the third circuit in an unpublished per curiam decision joined by judge alito rejected an employees claim that she was regarded as having disability that substantially limited her in the major life activity of working an employers requirement that an employee provide medical information concerning her ability to drive bus was not found to support the employees claim title i employment statutory provisions and rele vant supreme court decisions title i of the ada provides that covered entity shall discriminate against qualified individual with disability because of the disability in regard to job application procedures the hiring advancement or discharge of employees employee compensation job training and other terms conditions and privileges of employment25 the term employer is defined as person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees26 if the issue raised under the ada is employment related and the threshol d issues of meeting the definition of an individual with disability and involvi ng an employer employing over fifteen individuals are met the next step is to determine whether the individual is qualified individual with disability who with or without reasonable accommodation can perform the essential functions of the job the supreme court in us airways v barnett27 held that an employers showing that requested accommodation by an employee with disability conflicts with the rules of seniority system is or dinarily sufficient to establish that the requested accommodation is not reasona ble within the meaning of the ada however justice breyer found that there were some exceptions to this rule for special circumstances the supreme court applied two prong approach to determining whether accommodation is reasonable first the employee must show that the accommodation is type that is r easonable and if it is found reasonable then the burden shifts to the employer to show that granting the accommodation would impose an undue hardship the relationship between the receipt of ssdi benefits and the ability of an individual to pursue an ada employ ment claim was the issue in cleveland v policy management systems corp28 the supreme court unanimously held that pursuit and receipt of ssdi benefits does not automa tically stop recipient from pursuing an ada claim or even create strong presumption against ccess under the ada observing that the social security ac t and the ada both help individuals with disabilities but in different ways the c ourt found that despite the appearance of conflict that arises from the language of the two statutes the two claims do nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33183crs7 29 292 f3d 356 3d cir 2002 30 id at

the ada and the social security act decisions written and jo ined by judge alito in shapiro v township of lakewood 29 judge alito held that the fact the employee did not formally apply for vacant positions but wrote letters regardin g them did not excuse the township of lakewood from its ada obligations to engage in goodfaith interactive process to reach an accommodation howard shapiro d injured his back while employed as an emt and requested reasonable acco mmodation suggesting several vacant positions to which he could be transferred since he d not formally applied for these positions the district court grante d summary judgment to the employer however the third circuit applied the two prong approach of determining whether an accommodation is reas onable enunciated in us airways inc v barnett supra and concluded the distri ct courts decision in this case entering summary judgment against shapiro simply because he did not comply with lakewoods policy regarding transfer applications cannot be reconciled with barnett and must therefore be reversed30 qualifications for job were at i ssue in another ada employment case smith v davis 31 rodney smith was an alcoholic w ho alleged violation of the ada and title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 when he was terminated from his employment as county proba tion enforcement officer th district court granted motion for summary judgment finding that mr smith had history of absenteeism which rendered him unqua lified to perform his job the third circuit in an opinion by judge schwarzer joined by judg alito reversed and remanded the case regarding the ada claim stating the record thus raises an issue of fact as to whether smiths termination was for legitimate nondiscr iminatory reason or whether it was pretext for discrimination in violation of the ada because the explanation provided by defendants viola tions of the drug and alcohol policy apart from not being the ground on which summary judgment was granted did not tell smith what he did to bring about his termination it is not legally sufficient to entitle defendants to judgment as matter of law32 in straining v att wireless services 33 the

district cour ts decision rejecting judith dewyers ada claims the third circuit held that she failed to present sufficient evidence concerning her request for accommodation and that the evidence presented suggested that the employer attempted to accommodate her ada issues regarding essential functions and good faith interactive process for accommodations were considered in mclaughlin v city of atlantic city35 an unpublished per curiam decision in which judge alito joined in mclaughlin although the court noted that the employ ee had disability epilepsy he did not participate in good faith in the interactive process ce he ignored the employers requests for further evaluation to determine whether suitable accommodations could be made although the employer had acco mmodated the employee by allowing him to start work an hour later the record i ndicated that he repeatedly did not show up and therefore failed to perfo rm the essential functions of his job which in part required regular attendance similarly motley v new jersey state police36 an opinion by judge nygaard and joined by judge alito held that former state trooper who had been injured on the job could not perform the essential func tions of the job the state trooper had applied for an accidental disability pension and declared that he was permanently and totally incapacitated noting that the supreme court in cleveland37 had held that the receipt of social security disability insu rance benefits did not automatically bar an ada claim but that any apparent inconsistencies must be explained the third circuit

states treatment professionals have determined that community placement is appropriate community placement is not opposed by the individual with disability and the placement can be reasonably accommodated40 unjustified isolationis properly regarded as discrimination ba sed on disability41 decision joined by judge alito in complicated case involving allegations of discrimin ation under title ii of the ada and section 504 of the rehabilitation act42 as well as title vi of the civil rights act of 196443 prohibiting racial discrimination the third circuit in decision by judge fuentes joined by judge alito reversed grant of summary judgment by the district court for the defendant county the main issue in doe v county of ce ntre pennsylvania 44 concerned whether centre county had vi olated the ada section 504 and title vi by not allowing an interracial couple to b ecome foster parents because their has hiv and aids after being presented with the request the county adopted policy providing that foster families one of whose members has serious infectious disease may only care for children with the same disease unless the biological parents are informed of the potential foster parents childs condition and execute written consent releasing th county from pot ential liability the couple filed suit alleging discrimination and the district court granted summary judgment to the county finding that the policy was appr opriate under the adas exception regarding direct threat since foster children placed with the does could sexually assault adam and contract hiv45 rejecting this reasoning the third circuit found that there was not enough evidence to support summary judg ment because reas onable fact finder could not find based on the summary judgment record that an individual with hiv would always pose significant risk to foster child placed by the c ounty in that individuals home this generalization fails to address for example the placement of tenderaged and disabled foster childre n the county therefore failed to conduct the adamandated individualized determination and the district court erred in concluding that the adas dir ect threat exception

violated the ada by requiring nur sing home resident to receive care in nursing home rather than in her own home w ith attendant care the third circuit held that the ada clearly defined unnecessary gregation as illegal discrimination and reversed the district cour ts decision although judge alito took part in this decision petition for rehearing banc was filed the majority of judges voted not to rehear the case but judge alito along w ith several other judg would have voted to grant the rehearing48 there were reasons given for the votes so it cannot be determined exactly why judge alito voted fo r rehearing in addition judge alitos vote for rehearing was prior to the supreme courts determination of rights to community based services in olmstead this vote however has been seen by some disability advocates as potentially indicative of more restrictive view of title ii of the ada and since justice oconnor had voted with the majority in olmstead it could be argued that if judge alito had been presented with the issue he might have decided it differently from justice oconnor49 on the other hand it could be argued that these views are speculative since it is not known why judge alito voted to rehear the case and the facts in helen l and olmstead may have also lent themselves to differing interpretations title iii public accommodations and services operated by private

language in the access boar ds guidelines as adopted by the justice department doj requires lines of sight comparable to those for the general public judge alito read this language with the requirement for the dispersal of wheelchair locations in facilities with fixed seating plans to require that if facilitys seating plan provides members of the general public with different lines of sight to the field or stage it must also provide wheelch air users with comparable opportunity to view the field or stage from variety of angles53 this language judge alito found did not require that there be vertical lin of sight despite language in the doj technical assistance manual requiring lin of sight over spectators who stand54 judge alito rejected the entertainment centres arguments that 1 it could not provide wheelchair access to the lawn area due to structural impracticability 2 the doj standards only require wheelchair seatin g to be provided when there is fixed seating for the general public and 3 th at the centre had provided equivalent facilitation for individuals using wheelchairs with regard to the equivalent facilitation argument judge alito stated the principal problem with the centres equivalent facilitation argument is that it treats the adas requirement of equal access for people with disabilities as particular technical and scoping requirement this is simply not the case rather equal access is an explicit requirement of both the st atute itself and the general provisions of the dojs regulations55 in the same year as the caruso decision judge alito joined in decision by judge becker holding that flagging the medical licensing examination of medical student with multiple sclerosis to indicate that the student had been given an accommodation did not violate the ada the ada generally prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods services facilities privileges dvantages or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns leases or leases to or operates place of public accommodation56 more specifically the ada provides that any person that offers examinations or cour ses related to applications licensing certification or credentialing for sec ondary or postsecondary education professional or trade purposes shall offer such examinations or courses in place and manner accessible to persons with di sabilities or offer alternative accessible arrangements for such individuals57 the third circuit in doe v national board of medical examiners58 concluded that the

this score is comparable to the scores of candidates who take the exam under standa rd conditions and thus that flagging his score imposes an inequality on him60 this decision has been seen as problematic by the bazelon center for mental health law which argued that congress meant the ada to cover broad ra nge of circumstances and did not spell out each specific practice that might be prohibited by the law the doe v national board of medical examiners decision would have serious consequences for people with disabilities who experience the many types of discrimination that are not explicitly spelled out in the ada61 title v insurance statutory language title v contains an amalgam of provisions several of which generated consider able controversy during ada debate section 501

board of education v ne 73 held that the fape standard was not met by the provision of merely more th an trivial educational benefit74 although the district court was found to apply the incorr ect legal standard by not inquiring into whether the schools proposed individualiz ed educational placement iep met the standard enunciated by ridgewood the evidence on which the district court relied was seen as satisfying this more stringen t meaningful benefit test and was upheld with regard to the lre requirement judge alito examined previous third circuit decisions including oberti v board of education75 which adopted two part test to determine compliance with lre under oberti first court must determine whether education in the re gular classroom with the use of supplementary aids and services can be achieved satisfactorily76 and then must evaluate whether the school has mainstreamed the child to the maximum extent appropriate77 judge alito found that the peculiar facts of the tr case made mechanical application of the oberti test difficult78 the school district in tr ran preschool program that was half children with disabilitie s and half children without disabilities which judge alito described as under the terms of the idea more restrictive than regular fully mainstreamed preschool class would be79 this meant judge alito determined that the district court erred in not inquiring into whether re gular classroom options were available within reasonable distance to implement the childs iep and we remand so the district court may consider this question80 in another

medical student at the medical college of pennsylvania mcp and tortious interference with contract the third circuit upheld the district court s summary judgment ruling regarding the tortious interference with contract but reversed the summary judgment regarding the section 504 issue and remanded the case j udge alito agreed with the majority on upholding the summary judgment regarding tortious interference with contract but also would have upheld the summary judgme nt regarding the section 504 claim he examined the complex facts at issue and noted that in my judgment nathanson failed to provide sufficient evidence that mcp acted unreasonably during any of the three periods leading up to her second voluntary withdrawal on september 5 1986 and therefore the district court properly gr anted summary judgment in favor of mcp on nathansons section 504 claimi would affi rm the judgment of the district court in all respects mcp should not be compelle d to bear the expense and risk of further litigation in this case94 the majority for the third circuit took issue with judge alitos dissent noting that they believed he had resolved several issues of disputed fact while the issue to be dealt with was whether the plaintiff had provided sufficient evidence to raise genuine issue of materi fact to be determined on remand the third circuit majority further stated we believe however that few if any rehabilitation act cases would survive summary judgment if such an analysis were applied to each handicappe d individuals request for accommodation under the dissents approach an institution could justify rejecting an otherwise qualified applicants reasonable request by rationalizing that even if such accommodations were provided the applicant still might not be able to continue in particular program and thus would eventually withdraw95 disability advocates have criticized judge alitos dissent in nathanson finding his reasoning pecially his statement that the

congress be based on constitutional grant of power106 many of the statutes discusse d above such as section 504 and the individuals with disabilities education act are based at least in part on the spending power since they provide funds howeve r the ada and the fair housing act were enacted based on other constitutional provisi ons the ada specifically states as its constitutional authority the fourteenth amendment and the commerce clause107 the commerce power is then significant to the discussion of disability issues since it is specifically mentioned as the constituti onal basis of the ada and limitations on its reach could effect the constitutionality of the ada the eleventh amendment provides for state sovereign immunity but can be abrogated in certain circumstances by section 5 of the fourteenth amendment which states the congress shall ve the power to enforce by appropriate gislation the provisions of this article the exact circumstances where the eleventh amendment may be

he might approach such cases109 in chittister v department of co mmunity and economic development 110 judge alito was presented with the issue of whether congress had validly abrogated the states eleventh amendment immunity when it enacted the family and medical leave act of 1993 fmla111 finding valid abrogation judge alito noted that in the fmla congress identified the unconstitutional conduct as the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex therefore based on city of boerne v flores112 he reasoned there must be cong ruence and proportionality between the potential for employment discrimination of the basis of sex and the fmlas provision of 12 weeks of leave to eligible employees in order to find the eleventh amendment validly abrogated judge alito concluded it is apparent that this standard cannot be met he recongress did not find that public employers refused to permit as much sick leave as the fmla mandates with the intent of disadvantaging employees of one gendern or are we aware of any substantial evidence of such violations in the legislative record113 in united states v rybar 114 the third circuit in an opinion by chief judge sloviter upheld the constitutionality of federal law prohibiting the transfer or possession of machine gun finding that the law was within constitutional authority under the commerce clause judg alito dissented finding that united states v lopez 115 limited the federal power to impose such limitations the majoritys opinion was seen by judge alito as go ing far toward converting congresss authority to regulate

supreme court backtracked unexpectedly distinguishing different provision of the leave act from the previous cases this move gives opponents certain rhetorical ammunition against judge alito but it

tatelmanappreciable empirical support for the propos ition that the purely intrastate possession of machine guns by facilitating the commission of certain crimes has substantial effect on interstate commerce and w ithout such support i do not see how the statutory provisions at issue here can be sustained unle ss contrary to the lesson that i take from lopez the substantial effects test is to be drained of all practical significance as lopez reminded us the constitutionally mandated division of authority between the federal government and the states was adopted by the framers to ensure protection of our fundamental liberties117 however judge alito also indicated that congress could have ne gated this conclusion judge alito stated he would view this case differently if congress as whole or even one of the responsible congressional committ ees had made finding that intrastate machine gun possession by facilitating the commission of cer tain crimes has substantial effect on interstate commerce118 judge alitos record in these two cases has been described by disability groups as troubling the bazelon center for mental health law stated that judge alitos rulings demonstrate cramped views of congresss powers that would put critical disability rights laws at risk justice sandra day oconnor whose seat on the court alito is nominated to fill was frequently the pivotal vote in cases about congress power to pass the ada the fmla and othe r important laws if judge alito is confirmed there is every reason to exp ect that many important decisions about federal power would come out differently against people with disabilities his record suggests he would become the criti cal fifth vote to strike down portions of these laws as unconstitutional119 however it could also be argued that in the case of chittister judge alito was continuing in the line of supreme court cases and did not anticipate the supreme cour ts subsequent decision in nevada dept of human resources v hibbs 120 which upheld the family and medical leave act as valid exercise of congressional power pursu ant to section 5 of the fourteenth amendment121 in addition the opinion in chittister dealt with different provision of the fmla than was at issue in hibbs it could be argued that the cases could therefore be distinguished122 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33183crs23 123 httpwwwbazelonorgtakeactional

marijuana even if it did not cro ss state lines and was grown only for personal use124 like chittister v department of co mmunity and economic development judge alitos dissent was prior to the supreme courts subsequent ruling in gonzales and it could be argued that he was only following the supreme courts decision in united states v lopez and that he left open the possibility of different decision if congressional committee had made the appropriate findings however distinction could be drawn in that judge alito was dissenting in rybar which indicated that other judges di d not view the supreme courts lopez decision as restrictively
