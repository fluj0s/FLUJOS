january 8 2009 abstract the kurdishinhabited region of northern iraq has been relatively peaceful and prosperous since the fall of saddam hussein however the iraqi kurds political autonomy demands and ambitions are causing friction with christian and other minorities in the north with prime minister nuri almaliki and other arab leaders of iraq and with neighboring turkey and iran these tensions threaten to undermine the stability achieved throughout iraq in 2008 although us political inﬂuence over the kurds is likely to prevent near term destabilizing escalation of the disputes the us ability to keep these tensions contained could wane as us forces as planned draw down from iraq over the next three yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22079g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

husseins regime kurdish dissidence in iraq was initially led by the barzani clan headed by the late storied chieftain mulla mustafa barzani who founded the kurdish democratic party kdp after world war

granted asylum in the united states died in 1979 and kdp leadership passed to his masoud years earlier younger more urban and leftleaning group under jalal talabani emerged it broke with barzani in 1964 and in 1975 became the rival patriotic union of kurdistan puk the kdp and the puk remain dominant among iraqi kurds their differences have centered on leadership control over revenue and the degree to which to accommodate baghdad the kdp generally traditional is strong in the tribal mountainous northern kurdish areas bordering turkey whereas the puk is strong in southern kurdish areas bordering iran during the first few years of the 19801988 iraqiran war the iraqi government tried to accommodate the kurds in order to persuade them not to assist tehran in 1984 the puk agreed to cease fighting baghdad but the kdp remained in rebellion iraqi forces launched at least two lethal gas attacks against kurdish targets in 19 88 including at the town of halabja march 16 1988 about 5000 killed iraq claimed the chemical attacks were responses to iranian incursions during 19871989 the height of the iraniraq war nd its immediate aftermath iraq tried to set up cordon sanitaire along the border with iran and it reportedly forced kurds in many border villages to leave their homes in socalled anfal spoils campaign some organizations including human rights watch say the campaign killed as many as 100000 kurds during the 1990s usled containment of iraq following the invasion of kuwait paved the way for substantial kurdish autonomy after iraqi forces suppressed an initial

community resides in northern iraq or in baghdad without clear winner in the concurrent presidential election the two main factions agreed to joint rule in october 1992 the kurdish parliament called for the creation of federated state of kurdistan in the liberated part of the country but added that the kurds remained committed to iraqs territorial integrity this caveat did not allay fears among iraqs arab leaders that the kurds would drive for full independence concern shared by neighboring states with large kurdish populations turkey iran and syria in early 1994 the uneasy kdppuk powersharing collapsed into armed clashes over territorial control and joint revenues the nadir in pukkdp relations occurred in mid1996 when the kdp enlisted saddams regime to help it seize irbil the seat of the regional kurdish government which the puk had captured in 1994 the kurdish regional authority effectively split into kdp and puk entities however the united states spearheaded negotiations that culminated in september 1998 washington declaration between the two parties it was endorsed when the kurdish parliament reconvened on october 5 2002 by which time the kurds and other oppositionists were preparing for likely us war to overthrow saddam hussein in february 2003 opposition groups met in kurdishcontrolled territory to prepare for postsaddam iraq but these groups were disappointed by us decision to set up postsaddam occupation authority rather than immediately turn over governance to iraqis some bush administration officials have attributed the postsaddam insurgency and instability to this decision g11g150g150g142g141g146g138g157g142g561g18g152g156g157g556g21g138g141g141g138g150g561g18g142g155g146g152g141g561 there was virtually combat in northern iraq

postsaddam politicscoupled with the kurdish leaders close relations with the united stateshave given the kurds political strength to the point where iraqi minorities in the north iraqs neighbors and iraqs arab leaders perceive the kurds as asserting excessive demands and threatening iraqs integrity the bush administration has sought to acknowledge the kurds cooperation with us policy while curbing the kurds demands enough to mollify the kurds opponents and prevent any explosion of violence in the north president elect obama has not made official comments to date specifically on the iraqi kurds although some kurdish officials are said to be concerned that presidentelect obama might deemphasize iraq and thereby perhaps not support kurdish aspirations

participation in postsaddam politics in baghdad as enhancing kurdish interests the kdp and puk allied in the two national parliamentary elections in 2005 in the january 30 2005 elections their alliance won about 26 of the vote earning 75 national assembly seats out of 275 and it won 82 seats in the 111seat kurdish regional assembly partly on that strength talabani became president of iraq the alliance showing in the december 2005 elections for full term government was not as strong 53 seats largely because sunni arabs participated in the elections in the four year government then selected talabani remained president zebari stayed foreign minister and top talabani aide barham salih prime minister of the kurdish region before saddams ouster became one of two deputy prime ministers at the same time the kurds continue to develop their regional government opting to solidify his base in the kurdish region on june 12 2005 the kurdish regional assembly named barzani president of kurdistan the prime minister of the krg is masouds 49 year old nephew nechirvan of the kurdish guerrilla commander idris who was killed in battle against iraqi forces in 1987 nechrivan was slated to be replaced in early 2008 by puk official kosrat rasoul but the parties agreed to extend nechirvans termin part because of rasouls health the peshmerga primarily remain in kurdish areas to protect kurdish inhabitants there but some have joined the iraqi security forces isf and have served mostly in arab northern cities such as mosul and tal affar but also in sunni areas in the

mainstream shiite islamist parties of prime minister nuri maliki dawa party and his ally the islamic supreme council of iraq isci led by abd alaziz alhakim the support of the kurds have helped maliki survive several political challenges not only from sunni arab factions but also from within his own shiite community particularly that posed by radical young cleric moqtada sadr the kurds supported malikis decision to confront sadrs militia in basra in march 2008 which the kurds said demonstrated malikis increasing evenhandedness however by the end of 2008 the kurds had begun to break with maliki because of his failure to accede to their demands on some major issues that are discussed in subsequent sections of this paper the deterioration in the relationship had become so pronounced that krg president barzani appeared on local television program in november 2008 accusing maliki of trying to monopolize power maliki responded on november 20 2008 by saying the kurds were pursuing unconstitutional policies such as deploying peshmerga outside the krg region and opening representative offices in foreign countries press reports in late 2008 said the kurds were involved in discussions with other factions to possibly call for vote of noconfidence against maliki 4 g22g145g142g561g11g151g141g142g153g142g151g141g142g151g140g142g561g19g158g142g156g157g146g152g151g561 the question of outright kurdish independence is not an active source of friction between the iraqi kurds and the central government at this time but it remains concern of iraqs neighbors that have kurdish minorities the constitution5 not only retained substantial kurdish autonomy but also included the kurds insistence on federalismdefacto or formal creation of regions each with its own regional

the iraqi kurds vehement insistence that kirkuktamim and some cities in diyala and nineveh provinces be integrated into the krg is primary source of tension with the maliki government and with the minorities in the north particularly the christians turkomens and yazidis the kirkuk issue is considered existential by turkey which fears that krg integration of kirkuk would propel kurdish drive for independence kirkuk sits on 10 of iraqs overall oil reserves of about 112 billion barrels turkey also sees itself as protector of the turkoman minority in the city and its environs at kurdish insistence the constitution reaffirmed the process of resettling kurds displaced from kirkuk and stipulated the holding of referendum by december 31 2007article 140 process to determine whether its citizens want to formally join the krg region anticipating such referendum the kurdsreportedly using their intelligence service the asayesh reportedly have been strengthening their position in kirkuk by pressuring the citys arabs both sunni and shiite and turkomans to leave the kurds grudgingly accepted bush administration urgings to accede to delay of the referendum date is now set for it in

krg the major cities include khanaqin sinjar makhmour akre hamdaniya tal afar tilkaif mandali and shekhan june 2008 report unami leaned toward the kurds on some of these territories but with keeping other territories such as hamdaniya and mandali as part of central government controlled iraq the disputed territories have been major contributor to the growing rift between maliki and the kurds during august 2008 tensions erupted over the central governments attempt to gain control of khanaqin in diyala province arme d clashes were avoided by us military brokered compromise under which the peshmerga stayed in control of khanaqin since then the kurds have strongly opposed malikis efforts to form and place under government control tribal support councils in and near the disputed territories this effort which the kurds view as an effort by maliki to prevent the movement of more kurds into these territories was the basis of masoud barzanis november 2008 assertion of maliki

agreement on an election law needed to hold new provincial elections that us officials believed were needed to better integrate sunni arabs and the sadr faction into the postsaddam political structur the kurds firmly opposed any provincial elections in kirkuk until its status is resolved talabani vetoed the july 22 2008 corpassed election law on the grounds that it provided for an interim but equal division of power in kirkuk between kurds arabs and turkomans and for replacement of the peshmerga with the isf in the province the cor and the major blocs did not find formula acceptable to all sides before the cor adjourned for summer recess on august 6 unami broke the logjam by announcing on august 20 2008 that it would propose by late oc tober 2008 grand deal on kirkuk and other disputed
