procedure the law based on companion bills introduced by representative gallegly hr 137 and senator cantwell s 261 also makes it felony to trade in interstate and foreign commerce knives gaffs or other sharp objects designed for use in animal fighting or to use the postal service or other interstate instrumentality to trade in such devices or to promote an animal fighting venture proponents of various animal fighting bills had observed that in 2001 the house and senate had approved strong animal fighting sanctions in their respective farm bills but that conferees on the final 2002 farm bill pl 107171 removed the felony language stronger deterrents are needed because animal fighting is brutal inhumane practice that is closely associated with criminal activity endangers children where aggressive dogs are being reared and may contribute to the spread of avian influenza in the case of live birds they argued opponents have countered that such measures would violate provisions in the us constitution that protect states rights including the commerce clause and that recognize private citizens right to travel for economic reasons completely banning andor stiffening penalties for all animal fighting activities would 5 crs report 94731 brief summaries of federal animal protection statutes by henry cohen

other pending bills hr 1280 s 714 to restrict where research facilities could obtain their dogs and cats such animals were to be obtained only from licensed breeders publicly operated shelters other licensed research facilities or donors that had bred and raised the animal or that had owned it for at least the previous year additional language in the senate but not the house bill directed usda to phase out the use of random source dogs and cats from class b dealers within five years however all of these provisions were deleted by farm bill conferees the final version instead directs usda to review any independent reviews by nationally recognized panel of experts on class b use by researchers conferees said in accompanying report language that they were aware of concerns regarding use of random source animals from class b dealer s however they observed that usdas fy2008 appropriation part of the consolidated approp riations act 2008 pl 110161 had requested such an independent review which is being undertaken by the national academies of science the results expected in spring 2009 will help provide congress information regarding the value of class b dogs and cats in medical

dogs and cats from random sources including free to good home classified ads auctions and flea markets are more concerned about profit than animal welfare others contend that passage would leave

would have amended the awa to prohibit the use of animals in marketing medical devices and products and increase the penalties for animal research facilities that violate this part of the act this language was the house farm bill hr 2419 but was deleted by conferees interest in the proposal was stimulated at least in part by sales demonstration in an ohio medical facility where dog reportedly was given brain aneurysm repeatedly subjected to the medical device and later put down proponents believe the incident highlighted an inhumane practice done for profit not science or medicine opponents argue that the facility had not approved the demonstration and acted swiftly to address it and that most research facilities even go beyond federal welfare requirements to ensure that research animals do not experience pain and suffering g10g138g149g142g162g514g156g561g3g140g157g561 this bill hr 1947 would have amended the awa to make it unlawful for animal exhibitors and dealers but not accredited zoos to allow direct contact between the public and big cats such as lions and tigers the bill which also would have increased penalties for awa violations was named for teenager killed by grown siberian tiger in 2005 while having her picture taken with it at an aphislicensed facility opponents argue that the measure is unnecessary because federal regulations already ban such contacts with older cats the facility presumably was out of compliance and because zoos will gain monopoly in exhibiting younger cats g18g158g153g153g162g561g15g146g149g149g156g561 the proposed puppy uniform protection and safe ty pups act hr 6949s 3519 would have required those who breed dogs to obtain an awa license from usda if they raised more than 50 dogs in 12month period and sold directly to the public the bills also would have set some minimum daily exercise requirements for dogs held by the dealers supporters of the bills contended that the internet and other relatively recent marketing techniques have enabled importers and large commercial breeders whom they call puppy mills to sell their animals directly to the public while evading the awa licensing and humane handling requirements even though they are selling large numbers of animals wholesale breeders are already covered by the awa opponents countered that the measures would strain usda resources and newly subject thousands of relatively small inhome and hobby breeders as well as rescue organizations to burdensome licensing and regulatory requirements that were designed for large commercial businesses
