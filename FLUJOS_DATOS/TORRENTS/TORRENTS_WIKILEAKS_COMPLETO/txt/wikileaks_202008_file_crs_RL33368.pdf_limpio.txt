idea is grants and civil rights statute that authorizes federal funding to the states to help provide special education and related services for children with disabilities one of the most intricat issues of the idea statute is the provision of equitable educational services for children with disabilities enrolled in private schools child with disability may be placed in private school by the local educational agency lea as means of fulfilling the idea requirement of free appropriate public education fape for the child child with disability may also be unilaterally placed in private school by his or her parents in this situation the cost of the private school placement is not paid by the lea unless hearing officer or court makes certain findings however idea does require some services for children in private schools even if they are unilaterally placed there by their parents in the 2004 reauthorization of idea congress made changes to the requirements for providing services for parentally placed children with disabilities arguably one of the most significant changes was altering which lea is responsible for providing these services under prior law it was the lea in which the child lived that provided these services now these services are provided by the lea in which the childs private school is located this report examines possible issues related to this policy change possible issues discussed include disproportionate impacts on leas with large numbers of private schools concerns about lack of compensation for leas experiencing increased numbers of parentally placed children for whom they are responsible possible conflicts with state law and procedures for serving children with disabilities in private schools complications in identifying and evaluating parentally placed children who may be eligible for services under idea and difficulties in serving preschool children and toddlers with disabilities under new policies for parentally placed children there are comprehensive data on the impact of this policy change some argue that the impact should be minimal and temporary others maintain that the impact is significant and longterm as result it is difficult to determine what additional policy changes congress might consider or whether any policy changes are necessary this report will be updated as necessary

instituted series of approaches with regard to children with disabilities placed by their parents in private schools under the law prior to the enactment of pl 10517 in 1997 states were required to set forth policies and procedures to ensure that provision was made for the participation of children with disabilities enrolled in private schools by their parents consistent with the number and location of these children these requirements were further detailed in regulations which required that leas provide private school students an opportunity for equitable participation in program benefits and that these benefits had to be comparable in quality scope and opportunity for participation to the program benefits provided to students in the public schools 3 1 20 usc 1412a1a in addition to the requirements of idea schools must also comply with section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 29 usc 794 and the americans with disabilities act 42 usc 12101 et seq where applicable these statutes essentially prohibit discriminati on against an otherwise qualified individual with disability 2 for discussion of the 2004 idea reauthorization see crs report rl32716 individuals with

standard led to differences among the states and localities and to differences among the courts prior to pl 10517 the courts of appeals that had considered these issues had sharply divergent views some courts gave local authorities broad discretion to decide whether to provide services for children with disabilities in private schools which generally resulted in fewer services to such children4 while others attempted to equalize the costs for public and private school children5 the supreme court had granted certiorari in several of these cases but when congress rewrote the law in 1997 the court vacated and remanded these cases g22g145g142g561g343g351g351g349g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 the idea amendments of 1997 rejected the equitable participationstandard and provided that to the extent consistent with the number and location of children with disabilities in the state who were enrolled in private schools by their parents provision was made for the participation of these children in programs assisted by part b by providing them with special education and related services 6 the amounts expended for these services by an lea were to be equal to

disabilities on the premises of private schools including parochial elementary and secondary schools8 there was also requirement that the statutory provisions relating to identifying children with

education published brochure in 2002 that provided guidance on complying with the 1997 amendments11 most of these requirements are still in effect the brochure explains that the child find requirement of the law obligates seas and leas to locate identify and evaluate all children residing in the state who are suspected of having disability under pa rt b of idea so that fape can be made available to all eligible children12 child find activities for parentally placed children must be comparable to activities undertaken for child find for students in public schools13 if child is found to be eligible for idea services an iep individualized education program must be developed unless the parents make clear their intention to enroll their child at private school and that they are not interested in public program or placement for their child14 although the full range of idea special education and related services need not be provided to parentally placed children the lea must still provide services based on share of its idea grant the brochure provides an example of how th is proportional share of the grant would be calculated for hypothetical lea15 this lea receives an idea grant of 152500 it serves 300 children with disabilities in its public schools in addition 20 children residing within the boundaries of the lea have been unilaterally placed in private schools by their parents idea requires the lea to allot 20320625 of its grant that is the number of parentally placed children divided by the total public and private children with disabilities for services for parentally placed children thus the lea must use 953125 of its idea grant to provide services for these children although leas must consult with private schools throughout the process they have wide discretion on which services they provide and where those services are provided for example an lea might choose to provide speech therapy and physical therapy but not reading and math labs for children with specific learning disabilities the lea then develops service plans for those children in need of speech therapy and physical therapy service plans need be developed for parentally placed children requiring special education services that the lea does not offer g22g145g142g561g344g342g342g346g561g11g6g7g3g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 the individuals with disabilities

the participation of those children in the program assisted or carried out under this part by providing for such children special education and related services in accordance with the following requirements16 according to the senate report the general intent of changes regarding services for parentally placed children with disabilities was to clarify the responsibilities of leas to ensure that services to these children are provided in fair and equitable manner17 more specifically with regard to the responsibility for services the report noted that the intent was to protect leas from having to work with private schools located in multiple jurisdictions when students attend private schools across district lines18 in its guide to the 2004 amendments the house committee on education and the workforce provided the following explanation of this provision local educational agencies leas are requir ed to provide special education and related services for children with disabilities who are enrolled by their parents in private schools located in the school dist rict served by the lea funds for these services must be equal to proportionate amount of the federal funds made available to the lea under part b of idea as related to the number of private school students located in the lea 19 in addition to changing which leas are responsible for services pl 108446 made several additional changes to provisions with respect to pa rentally placed children with disabilities these include state and local funds if any as supplementing but not supplanting the required amount of federal funds allotted for these students services lea and sea recordkeeping and reporting requirements additional consultation requirements between the lea and private schools and private school complaint procedure if the school is dissatisfied with the lea s consultation process20 at the same time the general procedures for child find and service provision remain the same as described

language related to parentally placed children with disabilities in july 2005 memorandum ed noted that each lea must conduct child find determine the proportionate share of part b funds and provide equitable services to parentallyplaced private school children with disabilities who attend private schools located in the lea without regard to where the children reside 21 ed acknowledged that these are significant changes from prior law and related regulations since as the memorandum observed leas may not have accurate data to make new proportional funding calculations for school year 20052006 the first year in which the new provisions became effective the secretary permitted leas to use the best available data to calculate proportional funding shares for that school year only in march 2006 ed provided further guidance to states and leas in complying with the requirements of section 612a10 of the act 22 the preamble to these frequently asked questions noted that states and leas are

state on august 14 2006 ed published final idea regulations30 regarding parentally placed children with disabilities the final regulations track the statutory requirements and add provisions to address some issues raised by comments on the proposed regulations31 the regulations reiterate that it is the lea of attendance that is responsible for locating identifying and evaluating all parentally placed children in private schools within their geographic boundaries the socalled child find requirement the regulations stipulate that the lea of attendance is responsible for child find and proportional provision of services even if the child resides in another state32 the regulations clarify that children with disabilities ages 3 to 5 are considered to be parentally placed only if they attend privat schools that meet the definition of elementary school contained in the act33 the final regulations also clarify that the highly qualified teacher requirements under the elementary and secondary education act esea as amended by child left behind act nclb do not apply to private school teachers providing services to parentally placed children with disabilities34 28 ibid p 7 this

its idea grants in proportion to the number of parentally placed children with disabilities in private schools within the lea to provide equitable services for these children in addition the regulations present hypothetical example of how proportional share of an leas idea grant is to be calculated35 again following the language of the statute the regulations exclude the cost of child find from this proportional share while requiring consultation on the child find process and the provision of services as the statute requires the regulations specify that parentallyplaced private school child with disability has an individual right to receive some or all of the special education and related services that the child would receive if enrolled in public school 36 in addition the lea makes the final decisions about the nature of services and the lea is responsible for devising service plan for every parentally placed child with disability receiving special education or related services some commenters proposed that the lea where the private school is located to provide sic the district of residence the results of an evaluation and eligibility determination of the parentally placed private school child 37 the discussion in response to this comment noted eds concern that the privacy rights of the child be protected and as result the following requirement was added if child is enrolled or is going to enroll in private school that is not located in the lea of the parents residence parental consent must be obtained before any personally identifiable information about the child is released between officials in the lea where the private school is located and officials in the lea of the parents residence 38

as the us council of catholic bishops and the council for american private education cape are supportive of these changes one reason for this appears to be the argument that children with disabilities in private schools are underserved by idea education week reported that study by the us council of catholic bishops found that while 6 of students in catholic schools were students with disabilities only 1 received services under idea sister dale mcdonald the director of public policy and education research for the national catholic educational association was quoted as saying that the changed policy could lead to more provision of special education services on site at private schools she maintained that under the previous policy many private school parents have chosen not to accept services in the past because that has meant that their child had to get on bus and return to the home district missing part of the school day 39 advocates for the policy change also maintain that it would have minimal impact on public schools in the same education week article joe mctighe the executive director of cape argued that the financial impact on leas would be wash because districts would

living within their boundaries but attending private schools within the boundaries of other leas mr mctighe presented hypothetical example using the district of colu mbia as an example he said that the school system there would now have to provide special education services for students who attend private schools within washingtons city limits however it will longer have to provide services for city students whose parents send them to private schools in surrounding school districts 40 criticisms of the policy change have come most recently in comments regarding the final idea regulations some public school advocates who had hoped that ed might relax the statutory requirements continue to express concerns reggie felton director of federal relations for the national school boards association noted that it creates an additional burden for school districts that happen to have higher number of private schools physically located in their district 41 mary kunstler assistant director of government relations for the american association of school administrators aasa argued that child find costs can be extravagantly high and local taxpayers are footing the bill to find

first year of implementing the new policy on parentally placed children there are systematic data on its impact or comprehensive information on possible shortterm and long term issues one state director of special education noted that her state would not be able to collect and analyze data on parentally placed children before next september in the absence of comprehensive data this report uses information from websites such as the ed website various sea websites the websites of interest groups and from interviews with several state special education administrators 47 and advocates for children with disabilities in private schools the state directors interviewed represent diverse set of states in terms of geographic location and size several potential issues arose from consultation with these sources

expressed by some interest groups and by state directors in interviews is that the policy change disproportionally affects leas with large concentrations of private schools private schools in these leas attract students from othe r leas within the state and even from leas in other states under prior law these leas were responsible for equitable services for students residing within their boundaries but not for children from other leas attending these private schools under the new law these leas are still re sponsible for parentally placed children who reside in and attend private schools within their boundaries and in addition for children who do not reside within their boundaries but attend private schools within these leas of course these leas would longer be responsible for privat ely placed children who reside within their boundaries but attend private schools elsewhere however several state directors maintain that the change in policy results in net increases of students for those leas with concentrations of private schools for example consider two neighboring leas the first with several priv ate schools within its boundaries the second with private schools all the parentally placed children residing in the first lea attend private schools in that lea and all the parentally placed children residing in the second lea also attend private schools in the first lea under prior law each lea was responsible for providing idea services for parentally placed children residing within its boundaries under current law the first lea is now responsible for idea services for all parentally placed children from both leas the second lea is now longer responsible for idea services for any parentally placed children related issue is that many of the leas with high concentrations of private schools are in urban areas as noted above about onethird ⅓ of private schools and about 40 of private school children are located in urban areas public schools in these areas often as one state director of continued 7 of children in these schools have been diagnosed by qualified licensed trained professional as having disability at the same time less than one percent

in part because of parents exercising various choice options in the state and leaving larger school districts48 small leas can also experience disproportionate impacts state director in state with many small rural leas noted that some leas may have private school within their boundaries that enrolls more children than the lea does and has more children with disabilities than the lea serves he provided an example of worstcase scenario in which small lea bordering large city has within its boundaries large private school that enrolls three times the number of children presumably most coming from the neighboring city that the lea does in this case the proportional share of the leas idea funds is considerable 49 there is little dispute that some leas are disproportionally affected by the new policy what some question is the magnitude of the impact several state directors said that the impact on some leas is quite significant on the other hand joe mctighe of cape while admitting that some leas would be gaining students maintains that th overall impact is small one reason for his position he noted is that the number of private school students hasnt changed thus he argued the overall shifts among leas will be wash in addition he maintained that the students in question that is those living in one lea and enrolled in private school in another lea make up small subset of all privately placed students in the case of children placed in private schools in another state we are talking about even smaller subset 50

with disabilities into line with the substate formula for allocating idea funds to leas as result although some leas will be gaining parentally placed children for whom they are responsible for providing services and other leas will be losing the responsibility for some of these children the current idea substate formula will not redistribute idea funds as result of these shifts this is because the current substate formula which has been in effect since fy2000 and was not changed by the 2004 amendments distributes substantial amounts of funds based on leas proportional shares of numbers of children enrolled in public and private elementary schools and secondary schools within the local educational agencys jurisdiction 51 presumably distribution is based on private school enrollment irrespective of where private school children reside on the other hand prior law and regulations based on prior law required leas to use proportional share of their idea grants based on the number of parentally placed children residing within the lea irrespective of where they went to school as result even though some leas have gained students for whom they are responsible while others have lost students the substate formula has not increased funding for the former or decreased funding for the latter 52 of course the substate formula will increase funding for those 48 telephone

emphasis added 52 indeed one could argue that some leas were overcompensated under the previous policy because part of their idea allocation was based on private school enrollment but the proportional share of their idea grant used for private school services was based on numbers of parentally pl aced children with disabilities residing within their boundaries

school students enrolled in schools within their boundaries table 1 illustrates how the policy change might affect two hypothetical leas under prior law both leas had responsibility for serving 30

but enrolled in schools within lea b lea b had 25 children residing and enrolled in schools within its boundaries and 5 residential children enrolled in schools within lea under prior law lea would have been required to use 91 of its idea grant to provide services for parentally placed children with disabilities lea b would have been required to use 57 of its idea grant 30 divided by 330 and 30 divided by 530 respectively under current law lea is now responsible for 20 parentally placed children ie those enrolled in private schools within its boundaries and lea b is responsible for 40 such children as result lea as proportional share is reduced to 62 of its idea grant and lea bs proportional share is increased to 74 20 divided by 320 and 40 divided by 540 respectively notice that children have changed where they live or where they go to school also notice that the child counts used to determine lea as and lea bs idea grants have not changed under prior law and under current

especially personnel from the lea of residence to the lea of enrollment even though idea funds may be distributed to reflect numbers of privately placed children in leas of enrollment shifting teachers and other service providers from one lea to another is not seamless one state director noted that some leas were laying off staff because of the change in policies however collective bargaining agreements and other personnel policies make it difficult for other leas to hire these staff53 similar to the substate formula the idea formula for state allocations distributes funds based on population and poverty this raises an issue regarding students who cross state lines to attend private schools under prior law these students w ould be the responsibility of leas in the states where they lived and they would have generated funding for that state under current law as noted above in the discussion of ed guidance lea s of enrollment are responsible for parentally placed children from out of state who attend pr ivate schools within the boundaries of these leas however there is provision for redistributing funds among states that lose or gain parentally placed children as result of the policy change at least one state apparently will not require leas to use proportional share of their idea grants to provide services for parentally placed children from out of state according to massachusetts state director of special education marcia mittnacht the federal grant for massachusetts is calculated on the basis of identified students who are massachusetts residents and students who reside outside the commonwealth are not included consequently proportional share calculations can be made for these students for that reason massachusetts has determined the states public school districts arent required to serve outofstate residents who attend private school in massachusetts 54 this same issue was raised by senator judd gregg in letter to eds office of special education and rehabilitation services osers districts are frustrated with the new provisions in the idea and the requirement has created challenges for families who reside near state boarders sic and

example the state director of special education in massachusetts noted specific difficulties with this new policy in that state massachusetts law requires that each lea offer special education and related services to all private school children with disabilities residing within its boundaries regardless of where they go to school this parallels the who pays requirement under the prior federal law but is broader requirement than federal law memorandum from the sea notes that the school district must provide or arrange for evaluation determine eligibility propose an individualized education program iep and make services availa ble to all eligible students who reside in the district regardless of where they attend school 57 if child with disability resides in an lea and attends private school in that lea the new policy would make difference the lea would more than provide its proportional share of its idea funding however if the child enrolls in private school in an lea besides the one in which he or she resides the new federal policy and massachusetts law are in conflict this may result in an additional financial burden for so leas because they would have to provide proportional share of their idea grant for parentally placed children from outside their boundaries in addition to providing fape for all parentally placed children residing within their boundaries rhode island faces similar problems and is waiting for the rhode island board of regents to review and perhaps modify state regulations which will not occur until the 20062007 school year in the meantime the sea has established the following procedure for parentally placed children residing in one lea but enrolled in private school elsewhere in the state the lea of enrollment must use proportional share of its idea grant to provide services for these children based on service plans the lea of residence must continue to provide an iep and fape if additional services are required beyond those provided by the service plan 58

g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g156g561 the process by which parents decide to place their children with disabilities in private schools can be complex under prior law the parents dealt with the lea where they lived that lea was responsible for identifying and evaluating all children who potentially qualified for special education and related services under idea the lea would then offer fape to those children through the iep process if some parents decided to place their children in private schools the lea of residence would be responsible for providing service plans for these children the lea of residence would also be responsible for reevaluating these children to determine if they should remain eligible for special education for example parentally placed child who is determined to have speech or language impairment might be offered speech therapy after some time re evaluation might determine that the impairment had been remediated and that the child longer

parentally placed child attends private school in the lea of residence however if the child attends private school located in another lea that lea the lea of enrollment becomes part of the process that lea now is responsible for locating and evaluating parentally placed children potentially eligible for special education who attend private schools within its boundaries the lea of enrollment is also responsible for periodic reevaluations however as noted above in the discussion of ed guidance it is the lea of residence that is responsible for offering fape as result of this change complications could ensue especially because as one state director noted families often drift back and forth between public and private schools 59 for example parents might decide to remove their child from private school and enroll in the lea of residence however there could be significant differences in services offered by that lea and the lea of enrollment which had been providing services in an extreme case the child who was evaluated and deemed eligible for special education by the lea of enrollment might be deemed not to need special education by the lea of residence 60

issues also may arise regarding idea preschool services to children with disabilities ages 3 to 5 as noted above in the discussion of ed guidance these children fall under the parentally placed requirements if the preschool provides elementary education as determined by the state61 thus seas and leas have to determine whether preschools offer educational services or are daycare facilities in the latter case children with disabilities would not fall under the parentally placed requirements as more than one state dire ctor pointed out deciding whether preschool offers educational services eg provides kindergarten or provides only daycare services is not always clearcut as one state director noted suppose center provides kindergarten readiness is it private school or private daycare provider 62 these determinations might become more burdensome for large leas with high concentratio ns of preschools and daycare providers but less burdensome for smaller leas with few providers in addition idea part cwhich provides services to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their familiesrequires service providers to consult with leas as toddlers are preparing to transition to preschool services one state director raised the issue of which lea the part c provider should consult in the past it was the lea of residence regardless of where the child was enrolled 63 now this state is requiring that part c providers meet with both the lea of residence and the lea of enrollment also the pa rent of toddler might be considering various preschool options that might be in multiple communities under current law several leas might need to be consulted 59 telephone interview with state special education administrator march 22 2006 60 example based on telephone interview

involves the complaint procedures under the 2004 idea amendments private schools under the new law have the right to complain to the state if they believe that the lea has not followed idea requirements one state director noted that this is burden for state staff to investigate these complaints this state director noted that she has limited staff to monitor idea compliance and these new compliant procedures she worries will stretch her staff even more than they already are 64 another potential problem involves the complications with reforms in the evaluation process one state director said that his state is moving away from the discrepancy model for identifying specific learning disabilities ld the new approach response to intervention would track some children who might potentially be identified as ld before eligibility is determined and the iep process begun those children who make normal academic progress would not be identified those who did not would be identified since the discrepancy model can be implemented at one point in time or within short period of time by comparing an iq score with academic performance eligibility could easily be determin ed before or while the child was enrolled in private school the longitudinal process of the responsetointervention approach which would begin earlier than the typical discrepancy evaluation would be more difficult to carry out with child enrolled or preparing to enroll in private school for one thing this state director worries that private schools might not have the assessment resources to assess the child over time in addition would the determination of normal progress under the responsetointervention approach be made with respect to public school norms or the private school norms 65 as discussed above some advocates for the policy change believe that private school children with disabilities are underserved by idea and that the new policy could increase the number served increased numbers served could raise issues with public schools and public school advocates who believe that federal idea funds are inadequate although federal funding for the idea grantstostates program has increased significantly in recent years future substantial increases may be less likely given current federal budget constraints as result any redirection of idea funds from public schools is likely to result in concern and protests among public school advocates g18g152g156g156g146g139g149g142g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g3g149g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g159g142g156g561 there appears to be little agreement on how or whether additional policy changes are warranted with respect to parentally placed children although state directors and other advocates for public school special education expressed concerns about the policy change states and leas appear to be making goodfaith efforts to implement the new policy as one state director commented people in special education are usually willing to do the right thing when it comes to complying with processes and procedures 66 another state implemented gentlemens agreement to transfer funds from leas losing responsibility for

offered training and have tried to address leas concerns68 fairfax county in virginia is waiting for clarification of the new policy when idea regulations are finalized in the meantime the countys director of special education notes that because the policy is new we are proceeding slowly so we dont disrupt services to students and cause undue stress to parents69 for now the county is continuing to serve children who reside within its boundaries but are enrolled in private schools elsewhere until natural transition times occur such as when school officials update students service plan 70 additional policy changes may be more or less warranted depending upon the breadth and depth of the impact of the 2004 amendments and on whether burdens resulting from these impacts are temporary or more longlasting given the dearth of data on the impact of the 2004 policy changes regarding parentally placed children with disabilities it is difficult to answer these questions definitively one interviewee stated that he could not comment on possible additional policy changes or adjustments because there are data on impact if impacts turn out to be minimal or temporary few if any policy changes would be called for guidance from ed as summarized above specific problems addressed in final regulations and goodfaith efforts to implement policy at the state and local levels would likely ease transition to the new policy if impacts prove to be widespread and longlasting some believe that there is way to modify the policy to ease its implementation one state di rector noted that he sees obvious fix without basically returning to the old system in the past ed regulations have helped to soften some prescriptive aspects of congressional directives however he sees little room for such softening of this policy because it is clear what congress intended 71 others who believe that the impact is significant and longerterm suggested changes specific to their particular states concerns none of these suggestions would be acceptable to all stakeholders however for example state director of state that provides more extensive services than idea requires for parentally placed children suggested that such states be exempt from the new policy72 of course others might wonder why exceptions are made just for one group of states another state director advocated for state flexibility to decide which leas should be responsible for services for these children because the new policy cannot anticipate all the circumstances that states and leas face 73 however private school advocates probably would object to this approach over concern that many states would revert to the prior policy which some of these advocates believe results in limiting services still another state administrator who sees child find and evaluation under the new system as particularly burdensome advises that these activities be carried out by leas of residence while leas of enrollment provide the service plan and the services 74 some might object to this approach because of possible disjunctures between 67 telephone interview with state special education administrator january 30
