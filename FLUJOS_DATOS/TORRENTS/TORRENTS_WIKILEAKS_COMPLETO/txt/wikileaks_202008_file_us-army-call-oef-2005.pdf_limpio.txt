handbook iii for official use only iiichapter 1 anticoalition members acm tactics techniques and procedures section i maneuver united states and coalition forces conduct operations against anticoalition forces in afghanistan anticoalition members acms are drawn from alqaida talibanand other factions opposed to the government of afghanistan ambush tactics techniques and proceduresduring the sovietafghan war mujahedin ambushes were the most effective counter to sovietdemocratic republic of afghanistan army military activity usforces have encountered similar ambushes by acm organizations or factions ambushes are conducted for either harassment or resupply ºharassment ambushes are generally small scale as few as two tofour personnel and brief followed by rapid withdrawal oftroops ºambushes for spoils require more personnel and destroyed orabandoned vehicles are looted for weapons munitions food andanything else of value small ambush element consists of 2 to 15 personnel whereas largeambush element can include from 100 to 150 personnel ambush teams include the following elements ºobservers three to four men possibly unarmed pretending to beshepherds farmers etc children are sometimes used as observers ºfiring element the ambushs firepower ºalert element positioned along the likely direction of theambushed elements direction of retreat or maneuver to hinder hiswithdrawal ºreserve element reinforces the firing element or covers theambushing elements withdrawal these ambushes have an established chain of command and radiocommunications if radios are available communication will beaccomplished by visual signaling such as smoke grenades mirrorsflares and waving the ambush deployment consists of three lines ºfirst line the firing element of the ambush ºsecond line communications element located 20 to 25 metersbehind the first line in order to relay communications between thecommand element and the firing element ºthird line command element located 30 meters behind thesecond line for official use only 1oef handbook iiiambush sites are carefully selected they are usually set up along the entrance and exit routes through canyons and other narrow passagewaysin builtup areas the ambushes are set up behind earthen walls or inhouses or other structures ambushes usually occur in the early morning or in the eveningadditionally most convoy ambushes have been reported to occur onreturn trips typically because routes of travel are restricted once forceleaves on mission enemy forces know that they will be returning soonand usually on the same route acm forces have also become adept at setting ambushes to interceptreaction forces responding to shelling attacks on bases compounds orother fixed installations lessons lesson 1 advance reconnaissance patrols are necessary but simply driving through the suspected area does not clear it of enemy forcesor prevent an ambush on trailing convoy reconnaissance andsecurity elements have to secure the entry and exit locations ofsuspected ambush sites in addition to clearing surrounding highground lesson 2 helicopter support is crucial in preventing ambushes narrow time gap between reconnaissance flight and the pointelement of convoy will prevent or hinder the deployment of theambushing force from concealed positions recent experience hasshown that acm forces will go to ground and hide in order toavoid detection and possible engagement by unmanned aerialvehicles uavs and armed aircraft lesson 3 it is important to avoid predictable and set patterns of movement lesson 4 the mujahedin continued to use similar tactics and the same ambush sites months later when the soviets failed to informreplacement units of the mistakes that compromised route securityand likely ambush sites sniper operationsus and coalition forces experience with acm snipers has been minimal there is little evidence of welltrained and qualified snipers most engagements seem tofeature high volume fires shoot and spray as opposed to disciplined wellaimedfires where snipers have been detected they have been quickly neutralized someafghan fighters have demonstrated an ability to fire accurately the zadran tribe iswell known for producing excellent marksmen alqaida sharpshooters have alsodemonstrated excellent skills but average acm fighters appear to lack firediscipline in combat situations 2 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedraids raids usually conducted at night are common afghan tactic raiding groups attempt to gather forces covertly attack the objective seize needed supplies andretreat before the defensive forces can effectively react acm forces routinely usecover of darkness to conceal their approach to and departure from the target areataliban or alqaida fighters will resort to raids or ambushes to resupply themselveswith food ammunition and equipment nongovernment facilities are frequenttargets since they have minimal guard force and provide sources of vehicles foodand other items of importance such as batteries and radios acm forces willfrequently bring their own cargo transportation but will also attempt to stealvehicles at target sites individual and smallteam tactics individuals or small teams that contain as few as three or four fighters can infiltrate the area near an installation and use rocket propelled grenades rpgs or sniperweapons to engage personnel or equipment harassment attacks are conducted byteams that fire at the installation from distance and rapidly leave the area oncethey have fired their munitions it is most likely that while firing teams depart thearea another team or individuals are in place to assess damage to the target if anyand to assess the response to the attack from any reaction force after patterns areestablished that is strength timing and procedures followon attacks with remoteimprovised explosive devicesieds or ambushes may be attempted shelling attacks number of attacks on cities have taken place in recent times with 107mm rockets impacting seemingly at random causing civilian casualties as acmcombatants establish an organized resistance it is likely these tactics will befeatured more prominently the primary objective of shelling attack is to showthe governments inability to ensure the safety of its citizens and demonstrate thepower of acm forces and secondarily harass the enemy and destroy war materiel acm tactics mujahedin gunners construct multiple firing sites then fire and quickly displace before enemy artillery aviation or ground response forces caneffectively respond when possible mujahedin will keep water near their firing sites todampen the ground behind rockets or recoilless rifles this will limit dustraised by the back blast reducing the firing signature and makingdetection of firing positions more difficult current experience has been with individual rockets crudely aimed but asexperience is gained and aiming devices are improved firing accuracywill improve rockets set up to fire with delays ranging from minutes to hours is alsocommonplace as it allows firing party to depart its firing locationbefore the rockets fire timed firing devices range from crude mechanicaldevices to more sophisticated timers such as electronic watches or circuitboards that can initiate firing sequence of several individual rockets for official use only 3oef handbook iiimortars and multiple rocket launchers were the favored weapons to bombard airfields during the soviet occupation attackers can establishconcealed mortar positions rapidly fire several rounds into the airfieldand then rapidly leave the area rockets can be fired using improvised launchers and timedelay firingdevices this is especially true for 107mm rockets regular militaryrocket launching systems may also be employed providing greater rangeand accuracy the raid is likely to be hitandrun affair therefore withdrawal andsurvivability are important factors to deter ground pursuit the attackers may mine routes ahead of timeevade through the safe lanes in existing minefields or scatter mines asthey leave if favorable terrain and weather exist the attackers mayestablish an ambush site from which to attack pursuers fleeing attackers will also attempt to blend into local populationsdropping or hiding their weapons along the way and attempting to fit intoa local village or group cave and mountain defense and ambush techniques and proceduresafghanistans caves and irrigation tunnels have served as protection and defense from foreign invaders since the time of genghis khan coalition forces shouldrecruit reliable antitaliban afghan scouts to assist in locating caves defensivepositions and likely ambush sites prepared defenses caves trenches and spider holes are incorporated into prepared mountain defensive positions and the taliban will attempt to drawus and coalition forces into an attack on them these defensive positionsmay be networked and interconnected particularly in large cave complexesallowing the taliban forces to move unseen or withdraw from theimmediate area ambushes mountainous terrain is particularly suited to ambushes narrow passes and valleys are often the only means to travel between locationswithout using long circuitous routes acm forces are well aware of thisfact and have ambushed coalition forces when they returned on the sameroutes this is not new the vast majority of ambushes against soviet forces in afghanistan were executed as they returned using the same route note see also the earlier section on general ambush tactics techniques and procedures ttp superior air surveillance and reconnaissance available tocoalition forces will reduce the enemys capability to successfully conductlarge ambushes but the threat of smaller ambushes and snipers will beconstant especially when support aircraft are not seen or heard by acmforces lessons lesson 1 at night noise and light discipline of acm forces is generally very good both in defensive positions and for movementsreconnaissance recon by fire is often used to determine location ofkey weapons systems of coalition forces 4 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedlesson 2 acm forces use cave shuttle system to move fighters and supplies to battle positions moving in or out of caves or fromcave to cave to pick up ammunition and weapons in order to sustainthe fight caves also provide cover from aerial observation andattack and shelter for wounded fighters urban ambush and bomb trainingurban areas from small villages to large cities provide talibanalqaida and insurgent forces excellent opportunities to conduct both combat and noncombatactivities they will use the multitude of people and buildings to conceal theiractivities in order to create fear and distrust of us and coalition forces individualhomes businesses religious centers and even some government facilities may beused as cover for these operations one technique used in carbombings involves the detonation of two ieds several minutes apart small bomb is exploded with the intention of drawing securityforces and an increased crowd of onlookers to the site at this point secondlarger ied is detonated either by time delay or remote control in order to inflict agreater number of casualties coalition forces must expect second followonexplosion to any ied attack hostile houseclearing and hostagetaking when taking group of hostages the talibanalqaida team will consist of 6 to 10 terrorists armed with ak47s and akms at least one terrorist will carry handgrenade the terrorists will move from room to room shooting guards andgathering hostages finally consolidating the hostages in single location an abduction is carried out using traditional kidnaping technique vehicle will pull in front of the targeted individual and stop second or third vehicle will boxin the victims vehicle the kidnappers will exit the vehicle kill guardsdriversubdue the victim place him in the escape vehicle and exit the scene recoilless rifles acm tactics for recoilless riflesguns will be similar to those employed by talibanalqaida rpg gunners ammunition for various calibers of recoilless rifles has been found in caches throughout the country specifically large amounts of b10 rocket ammunition thefollowing systems have been encountered in afghanistan 90mm recoilless rifle note not much information is available regarding acm tactics for use of the 90mm recoilless informationcontained here is based on the m67 recoilless rifle the 90mm recoillessrifle weighs approximately 36 lbs has maximum effective range ofapproximately 450 meters and maximum range of approximately 2100meters b10 82mm recoilless rifle the b10 has maximum selfdestruction of the round range of 400 meters for highexplosive antitank rounds and4500 meters for highexplosive rounds it weighs approximately 109 lbsthe b10 has been called the talibans favorite infantry heavy weapon for official use only 5oef handbook iiiand although large amounts of ammunition have been recovered it has not been seen in engagements with us and coalition forces spg9 73mm recoilless rifle the spg9 has maximum effective range of 800 meters and maximum selfdestruction of the round rangeof 4500 meters the firing tube weighs 99 lbs often fired on theshoulder the trailer weighs 35 lbs and the tripod weighs 27 lbsammunition for the spg9 is nearly identical to the ammunition used bythe bmp1 the spg9 has maximum effective range of 1300 meterswhen mounted on the bmp1 and an improved round with maximumrange of 6500 meters is available rocketpropelled grenade rpg even though rpgs are classified as an antiarmor weapon acm forces will use rpgs against slowmoving aircraft especially helicopters rpgs are not veryaccurate against aircraft so the enemy will use high volume of fire single rpgattempts against aircraft are rare but possible rpgs have achieved some success indowning coalition aircraft rpgs display back blast and flash signature at launch most rpgs have rocket motor that ignites approximately 20 meters after the round has been fired thisrocket motor ignition leaves visible gray puff of smoke person looking in thegeneral direction of the launch should notice these indicators nightvision devicesincluding thermal imagers may help see the rpg launch and rocket while in flightunlike man portable shoulderlaunched surfacetoair missiles rpgs do notcorkscrew in flight but have relatively straight flight path with very little smoke tactics rpg gunners have been observed wetting down the ground behind firing positions to reduce back blast signature acm rpg gunners will sometimes track flight patterns and use theinformation as basis for planning their attacks acm rpg gunners will position themselves to take advantage of higherelevations in mountainous terrain this enables gunners to engage theirtarget from above the side or the rear to take advantage of blind spotsthis technique is also applicable in urban terrain where rpg gunners canfire from rooftops or highlevel windows some rpg gunners have taken advantage of the rockets selfdestructfeature to do this gunners lob rounds to the maximum rangeapproximately 900 meters to achieve an air burst to engage aircraft inflight or to engage unprotected troops on the ground rpg teams normally consist of two personnel the gunner carries therpg and two to four additional rounds the assistant helps reload afterfiring provides limited security with an ak type rifle and also carriestwo to four additional rounds larger groups may contain two or morerpg teams with additional rounds carried by other fighters within thegroup 6 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedcountermeasures understanding tactics employed by rpg gunners and capabilities of the weapon will enhance the value of countermeasures usedcountermeasures can be grouped into two categories physical and tactical physical countermeasures include actions taken to reduce or negate thedamage of an rpg or other antitanktype round once it has been firedthese measures include chain link fences berms sandbags reinforcedbunkers and other facilities that can be used in fire bases around vehiclesand aircraft parked on the ground and in prepared firing positions treesand other natural shrubbery can also provide some degree of physicalprotection but may also reduce fields of observation and fire tactical countermeasures are actions taken to reduce the ability of rpggunners to fire or to lessen the value of target suppressive fires onknown or suspected firing positions are perhaps the most effectivetechnique direct or indirect fires andor small or large caliber systemscan provide these fires aerial fire support is particularly effective speedof movement is also helpful as is varying speed of movement in order toavoid setting identifiable patterns of movement threat to coalition patrols common threats to combat patrols include ied sniper area and close ambush civil disturbances mines breakdowns human intelligence humint against usforces and rocket or indirect fire in the oef environment identification of enemyforces is difficult some enemy ttp include attempts to cause casualty to force medical evacuation medevacmission all likely helicopter landing zones hlz are then mined riggedwith ieds or overwatched by direct fire weapons that will down theaircraft and cause symbolic victory as well as mass casualty situation the enemy uses the mountainous desert terrain to establish an areaambush kill zone that is similar to baited box engagement the enemyengages unit from one direction with small two to five man elementat long range once coalition forces deploy against the contact the enemywill engage friendly forces from second or third direction to causedisruption and greater casualties enemy uses observedcommand detonated ieds and solar cells to defeatus counter measures like the acorn the solar cell is covered withdust that becomes exposed by vehicles passing by completing the circuitafter the us countermeasure has passed lessons lesson 1 use direct fire and mortars to quickly fix the enemy use close air support cas artillery andor attack aviation to finish theenemy lesson 2 once contact has been initiated likely hlz identified during planning should be cleared or disregarded in favor of anotherfarther away hlz for official use only 7oef handbook iiisection ii fire support mortars when us and coalition forces make initial contact with acm prepared defensive positions the enemy typically responds with immediate mortar fire their primaryfire support weapon when us cas approaches acm fighters seek nearby cover frequently leaving mortars set up and remain under cover until the air support leaves then thefighters will return to their fighting positions if possible control of high elevations is key to acm defensive operations higher elevation provides greater fields of observation although poor weather conditions mayreduce visibility the 82mm mortar is the primary indirectfire weapon used by acm fighters the 120mm mortar has been used but it is not the preferred system likewise 60mmmortars have been found in cache sites but have not yet been employed against usand coalition forces ammunition for both 120 and 60mm mortars is readilyavailable in country acm forces use 82mm mortars in two different methods offiring indirect fire acm fighters will fire from the reverse slope of the terrainwhen possible this requires forward observer direct observation acm forces refer to this method as disturbancefiring this method will be used when the mortar is within the line ofsight of the target it does not require forward observer since the mortarcrew can adjust fire visually acm forces have been observed displacing carrying only the tube and bipod and leaving the base plate in position for future use base plates have been foundcemented in place allowing the mortar crew to quickly occupy and set up newfiring positions achieving high accuracy with first shots mortars have beenobserved set up in the open as crews went to nearby caves to resupply ammunitionthe same practice has been noted when coalition aircraft were in the areaammunition for the 82mm mortar is readily available in afghanistan there arenumerous caches in the country many of which contain 82mm mortarammunition mortar ammunition can remain serviceable long after the expiration ofits expected shelf life rocketsacm forces do not have organized rocket units but they do use 107 and 122mm rockets rocket firing locations may be placed on high ground overlooking thetarget rockets are being rigged with timers and propped up on dirt piles andsand bags and aimed at coalition fobs and compounds without the aidof directional or elevation aids 8 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedacm forces consider harassment of enemy forces as valuable as accurate fire the use of singlelaunch tubes and timedelayed firing devicestargeted against installations is intended to disrupt operations withincidental damage to buildings enemy casualties are fortunatecoincidence cities and military bases especially airfields are prime targets forrocketfire and rocketharassment missions 107mm rocket the 107mm rocket is available in truckmounted towed and portable variations it is easy to transport by vehicle manpack or pack animaland has maximum effective range of approximately 8400 meters theweapon needs only small area of level ground for firing the 107mm rocket ammunition is readily available from number ofcountries highexplosive fragmentation rounds are the only ammunitionused the launcher uses simple mortar sights for target acquisition directobservation does not require the use of sights and eliminates the need fora firedirection center however this method exposes the crew todetection and counter battery fire since it may require multiple rocketfirings to adjust onto the target time delay may be used to reduce risk tocrews from counter battery fires acm crews will fire from the reverse slope of hill or mountain whenpossible as this gives the weapon crew additional protection fromcounterfire vehiclemounted 107mm rocket does not have to be dismounted fromthe vehicle in order to fire and can be set up and fired from the vehicle inapproximately 1 minute if towed the set up and fire time increases toapproximately 15 minutes standard towed launchers fire 12 rockets however small manportablesingletube launchers are also used acm fighters have become adept at rigging launchers to fire usingnothing more than piled rocks or crossed sticks to provide elevationalthough not always accurate this launch method can be used to conducteffective harassing fires against targets such as airfields fuel andammunition depots and garrisons or fortified areas rockets fired in thismethod can be armed with simple timedelay firing mechanisms allowingthe crew to set up the rocket for delayed launch after they leave thearea 122mm rocket the 122mm rocket comes in two versions long rocket with range of approximately 20380 meters fired by the bm21truckmounted launcher with four rows of 10 launch tubes and shortrocket fired by smaller portable systems the manportable version of the122mm rocket launcher fires shortrange rocket with range ofapproximately 14000 meters variations of the manportable launchersinclude the single double and the 12 tube manportable launchers for the122mm rocket are ideal for use in unconventional warfare where firedirection is simple each of these launchers needs three to four men for for official use only 9oef handbook iiitransport and can be used in more restrictive firing positions than the truckmounted version expedient aiming methods and platforms may beused to fire rockets from the tubes when fired at higher altitudes the rangeof the weapon increases although its accuracy decreases artillerythe acm forces will employ their artillery if available in an unconventional manner target acquisition will be mostly visual with manual fire direction andwithout the use of computers since the fall of the taliban artillery resources havecome under the control of local warlords and have not been employed againstcoalition forces 122mm d30 howitzer m1963 of the numerous weapon systems the taliban had available prior to the initial air strikes in 2001 the d30howitzer was the most plentiful and considered the most dangerous artillerysystem in their inventory there have been recent indications that acmforces are using the d30 or any other artillery pieces in afghanistan thed30 is towed closesupport howitzer it has conventional range of15300 meters and range of 1000 meters when used in the directfiremode emplacement time is approximately 15 minutes and displacementtakes approximately 3 minutes acm forces will place the weapon undertrees in heavy brush or in cave entrances to avoid detection ammunitionfor the d30 is available in numerous caches spread throughout afghanistan section iii air defense the three primary portions to the air defense threat in afghanistan are the manportable air defense systems manpads shoulderfired surfacetoairmissiles smallarms and rpgs and light antiaircraft weapons generally 127mmthrough 23 mm acm forces may possess old military or available commercialnight vision equipment and may employ it with air defense weapons manportable air defense systems manpads limited number of manpads still exist in theater the threat of manpads can come from anyplace in the theater including border areas and neighboringcountries common strategy is to have the manpads gunners work in pairs orsmall groups the first manpads operator engages the aircraft if the first missilefails to destroy the target the additional manpads operators opens fire acmmanpads gunners will try to position themselves on high ground overlookingpotential aircraft especially helicopter flight paths this allows manpadsoperators more time to locate and fire on the aircraft this tactic is more likely to beused in the warmer months since winter weather conditions limit the gunnersability to survive at high elevations common tactic used by acm soldiers is toattack aircraft at their most vulnerable moment taking off or landing when nearairports the manpads operators will choose place along the takeoff or landingflight path and wait for an appropriate moment to engage the aircraft after firinggunners move to the nearest shelter or cache and conceal the launcher 10 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedantiaircraft artillerymachine guns most largecaliber taliban

unexploded 23mm rounds present aparticularly dangerous hazard these rounds have been found throughoutafghanistan in and around cities battle areas and caches caution inhandling or disposing of these rounds must be exercised snipers snipers situated on mountainsides will target helicopters flying through mountain passes snipers will target the cockpits attempting to kill the crew snipers will for official use only 11oef handbook iiialso target aircraft during landing and take off the most effective weapons for this are highpowered rifles and machine guns fitted with optical sights even thevenerable 303 enfield can be effective against low slowflying aircraft section iv command and control c2 amateur or commercial brand very high frequency vhf radios could be used by transnational elements including alqaida and former taliban forces for tacticalc2 because these radios are line of sight the signal is degraded by high groundbetween the transmitting and receiving stations normally tactical leaders squadlevel operate vhf radios at higher levels above the equivalent of company aradio operator may be used all acm forces within afghanistan use amateur orcommercial brand high frequency hf radios hf radios with the proper antennasare used for communications over longer distances including over mountains the afghanistan wireless communications company awcc is installing global system for mobile communication gsm infrastructure there is now agsm system in five of afghanistans major cities kabul kandahar mazaresharif herat and jalalabad konduz will be the sixth city to receive all of thenecessary equipment for service awccs goal is to have gsm network installedin each provincial capital within the next four to five years each gsm base stationis paired with verysmallapertureterminal vsat communications systems thiscombination has brought limited national communications international andinternet connectivity to those cities acm forces are communications parasites onhost nations public switched telephone networks pstn cellular telephonesatellite telephone and internet communications are used in afghanistan asafghanistan slowly restores its communications backbone acm forces willincrease their use of these systems the primary satellite telephone systems thatcover afghanistan are thuraya inmarsat and asiasat alqaida leadership isprobably using communications officers for many of their communicationsincluding satellite telephones couriers are the most secure means of communication available to acm forces while secure couriers are not time sensitive the courier may not know thecontents of message if it is on paper or some electronic media if the courier hasmemorized the message it may be in brevity code when operational information ispassed between acm forces this is probably the method used couriers are taughtways of hiding information including ways to take advantage of cultural biasesacm forces will use challengeandpassword system the challenge andpassword system may be in arabic if the force is all alqaida or mixed acmforce if the force is made up of only local soldiers the challenge and passwordcould be in dari or pushtu depending on the tribal affiliations of the forceschallenges and passwords may be local sayings or proverbs intelligence and reconnaissance acm forces have very effective humint collection and dissemination capability most acm forces operate in their home areas and know the terrain andpeople there well this knowledge allows them to move in and out of areas withease often using covered routes acm forces use this capability to their advantageoften moving close enough to coalition forces to note friendly positions andsecurity operations 12 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsince acm forces have family and friends in the area they can easily use these people to collect information on the surrounding area to provide them with earlywarning of coalition activities moreover it is very possible that afghan personsemployed by coalition forces are either acm themselves or at least sympathizerstake caution in providing missionessential information to afghan governmentforces until just prior to their need to know acm forces use many commercially bought offthe shelf radios that use hf ultra high frequency uhf and vhf radio bands because radios can be used to listenas well as transmit any radio can be used to intercept radio signals that are notencrypted therefore if coalition radio is sending in the clear it is highly likelythat acm forces will be listening although most acm members do notunderstand english enough do to make this viable threat acm forces are notknown to possess the capability to monitor encrypted communications commercial radio scanners are available on the world market and acm forces are known to use them when commercial scanners are used they can quickly pick upnonsecure communications and identify the information as useful or not icomscanners are small enough to be hand held highly portable and used anywhere acm forces particularly those operating in areas where they have lived most if not all their lives are well suited for tactical reconnaissance these personnel areknown to be very patient and because they are familiar with the area the peopleand local events they are particularly adept at conducting reconnaissance missionsacm forces will patiently watch coalition force installations in order to determinestrength layout key locations daily routines and particularly reaction forcecapabilities acm forces may conduct an attack or even an ambush only to haveobservers assess responses of the attacked force it is not unreasonable to expect atleast one observer on the inside of facility that can report not only on defendersreactions but also on the attack from the defenders perspective acm forces will use any means necessary to obtain information from the local population they may pay rewards exploit religious or tribal affiliations orthreaten locals with various forms of punishment or death the same techniquesmay also be used to feed false information to coalition forces the localafghanistan population can be potent source of information tribal chiefs andvillage elders are typically the ones receiving the most information and can pass itto acm forces as easily as they can pass it to coalition forces consider the sourceof information and motivation of the source when acting on information obtainedfrom the local population checkpointsthe traditional fundraising function of the checkpoints declined under the taliban rule although it continued to use them for the same purpose the talibancheckpoints were more accepted since they were more systematic in nature thanthe ones operated by the warlords while tribal leaders or warlords may attempt to keep the imposition of unofficial tolls to minimum undisciplined and poorly paid afghan militia force amfmembers may demand payment from travelers unofficial checkpoints usually donot hamper coalition operations for official use only 13oef handbook iiisection v mobility and countermobility mine threat afghanistan

onlycenter for army lessons learnedconvoys move almost exclusively at night to avoid detection by aircraft convoys traveling during daylight hours are usually decoys and rarelycarry militaryrelated materials during the day convoys stop inwellconcealed places such as canyons caves dry river beds greenzones vegetated areas near oases and rivers destroyed villages or anyother available form of cover convoys usually have their own air defense including manpadsurfacetoair missiles sams and vehiclemounted machine guns bothvehicle and animal convoys depend on advance observation teams orpatrols to determine the safety of the route vehicle convoy typical convoy deployment consists of three elements advance observation team personnel on horseback or motorcycle compose the advance team and precede the convoy by several milesthey often fire their weapons in order to provoke return fire from asuspected enemy or threat decoy team small portion of the convoy follows 15 to 45 minutes behind the observation team this group is loaded with foodstuffsclothing or other nonmilitary material and serves as decoy to draw outenemy troops main element the significant part of the convoy accompanied by armed mujahedin fighters follows as much as an hour or more behind thedecoy team if either the observation team or the decoy team areinterdicted the main element disperses and hides in available coveredareas animal convoy advance observation team teenager an old man or couple of men with donkey will lead the convoy by two to three km as rule they donot carry weapons or radio and use small signal mirror to inform thenext element about route security decoy team the decoy team follows the observation team at distance of 500 to 800 meters the distance is adjusted to maintain line of sight toobserve the mirror signals from the advance team this element usuallyconsists of 10 to 20 armed men equipped with radio to communicatewith the main element they will often have two or three animals loadedwith less valuable supplies to allay suspicion if stopped if they comeunder attack their mission is to offer sufficient resistance to allow themain element to turn back or take an alternate route main element the main element follows one to two km behind the decoy team and disperses if either forward unit encounters threat forcesthe most valuable items are usually carried in the middle of the convoyand are heavily guarded when fighting the soviets false deceptiveconvoys were often used in this case real convoy does not followforward patrols instead the main element consists of 5 to

target deception and signature management may be employed against coalition forces acm forces havedemonstrated basic and sometimes effective knowledge of dd measures tocounter coalition force capabilities some acm forces especially alqaida trainedfighters understand the principles of thermal and radar imagers and nightvisionequipment and have disseminated plans for countering these sensors the author ofa document found in afghanistan makes this distinction quite clear by sayingnightvision devices see in the dark whereas thermal imager is heat detector countermeasures while few acm fighters have comprehensive knowledge of modern sensors most fighters have learned the importance of countermeasures to degrade or defeatthese sensors some of the following countermeasures are quite simple butnonetheless effective spider holes acm fighters use various signaturecontrol techniques to avoid being targeted by thermal sights and sensors these techniquesinvolve the use of spider hole fighting positions and vehicle coveringsthe spider hole consists of digging mansized hole or finding crack inrocks which can be covered for concealment once the hole is prepared itis covered by brush blankets andor tarps the coverings may also have alayer of snow soil or ice on top or they may be wet vehicles may beconcealed by covering them with tarp that supports snow or soil in amanner similar to the spider hole 18 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsensor savvy acm soldiers used covering tarps to attempt to defeat infrared sensors and other means of detection they put tarps over vehiclesand blankets over themselves when they note an unarmed aerial vehicleoverhead employed in combination with spider holes and placed beneathtrees or bushes tarps and blankets proved quite effective they may be usedbecause of lack of purposemade camouflage nets or coverings they arealso readily available since many afghans use them as tents or sleepingbags reliable information indicates that acm forces understand thetechnical concept of reducing their signatures to blend with the ambienttemperature of the terrain around them thermal decoys among the documents recovered from alqaida associated sites in afghanistan was document in arabic titledinformation to my afghani mujahideen brothers that outlined the basicsof nightvision equipment and thermal imagers it described technique tocounter thermal imagers that consists of creating thermal decoys withsmoldering wood fires built in shallow pits to make the pilot launch hismissiles at the pit it discussed how to build and place these decoys withthe intention of creating false heatemitting targets subtle differences will differentiate between this form of heatemittingfalse target and the heat signatures of real targets ºthe decoy targets will appear somewhat brighter than clothedfighter ºthe decoy signature will also differ from that of vehicle exhaustin that other parts of the vehicle that are normally present in thethermal image would be absent in the case of the deceptionhowever an observer unaware of possible deception may notrecognize these clues among the documents recovered from alqaidaassociated sites inafghanistan was document that provided insight into how one mightdeceive radar with decoy built from available materials ºthe method described using pieces of metal including tin cansinterspersed with pile of rocks approximating the size of thevehicle or other asset such as crewserved weapon that thedecoy depicts ºthis decoy in combination with thermal decoys and signaturemanagement could prove effective in target denial and deception ºoperationally these methods could be used to simulate thepresence of acm troops in an area where they are not deceptionto

of blasts preventing fire from reaching the driver and providing protection fromsmall arms fire and fragmentation sandbags are usually readily availableand do not permanently impair the flexibility of vehicles sandbags caneasily be added or removed from the vehicle as the situation dictates onedrawback to using sandbags is that their weight limits the vehicles capability to haul cargo for official use only 43oef handbook iiiexperience shows that using sandbags to harden vehicle cabs for protection against mine blasts saves lives normally the cabs of all vehicles subject todetonating mines are hardened certain cautions however must always beobserved sandbags should be placed so that they ºdo not restrict the movement of foot pedals levers or controls ºdo not interfere with the normal functions performed by thedriver ºdo not restrict driver vision to reduce the sandblast effect when mine is detonated near the vehicle various materials may be placed on top of the floorboard sandbags rubbermats light metal plates plywood or scraps of runway membrane materialwetting down the sandbags is also effective but contributes to deteriorationof the metal to properly prepare the vehicle cab

firepower for convoy unitsdeveloped the gun truck the purposes of hardened gun truck are to provide base of fire help counter enemy attacks increase survivability of the convoy the gun truck is equipped with crewserved weapons system preferably in protective position in vietnam this principle worked well andprovided convoys means of selfdefense deploy the gun truck in the convoy where it can best provide the needed firepower if adequate communications assets are available they should belocated with the gun truck and the convoy commander this enables theconvoy commander to call the gun

adequate pyrotechnics may be used to signalthe gun truck to move forward for official use only 47oef handbook iii the gun truck should not be maneuvered right on top of the enemy location the crewserved weapons on the gun truck can cover significant distancetherefore the vehicle should be situated where it has clear field of fire toengage the enemy with the maximum effective range of the weapon ifnecessary and if available multiple gun trucks can be used when usingmultiple gun trucks in convoy overlapping fields of fire greatly increasesthe convoys chance of survival based on availability types of weapon systems and size of the convoy the placement and number of gun trucks may vary with companysize andlarger convoys minimum of two gun trucks should be used to

weapons headquarters complexes and protection against air strikes and artillery fire has beencharacteristic of the nature of the war in afghanistan and other desertenvironments extensive cave systems containing conference storage and hidingrooms as well as interconnected fighting points have frequently been encountered figure 224 these complexes present formidable and dangerous obstacle to current operationsthat must be dealt with in systematic careful and professional manner once thecave complex is cleared it is usually destroyed or at least the entrance isdestroyed to deny future use by the

adequate time for thorough searchof the area to locate all caves complete exploitation and destruction ofcave complexes is very time consuming and operational plans must bemade accordingly to ensure success the presence of cave complex within or near an area of operationsposes continuing threat to all personnel in the area area containingcave complexes should ever be considered completely cleared for official use only 89oef handbook iiiin some areas the combat situation will permit hasty search for hidden tunnel entrances but either lack of time or enemy occupation of thetunnel will not permit searches by tunnel team dangersdangers inherent in cave operations fall generally into the following categories and should be taken into account by all personnel connected with these operations presence of mines and booby traps in the entranceexit area presence of small but dangerous concentrations of carbon monoxide produced by burningtype smoke grenades after caves are smoked note protective masks will prevent inhalation of smoke particles but will notprotect against carbon monoxide possible shortage of oxygen as in any confined or poorly ventilated space enemy still in the cave who pose danger to friendly personnel both above and below ground note in some instances dogs can successfully detect enemy hiding in caves section xi operations in highaltitude environment soldiers deploying to afghanistan must understand the simple rules of soldiering at high altitudes including some significant health problems that they otherwise maynever encounter highaltitude operations increase energy requirements by as muchas 50 percent and coupled with cold temperatures and increased physical activityhave the potential of making the mission secondary to just surviving the increasein physical activity is only offset by thorough acclimatization conditioning specialskills and training and using equipment designed for the conditions highaltitude sickness acute mountain sickness ams may begin at 8000 feet above sea level many factors influence who becomes ill and who does not however the followingsymptoms are typically linked to high rate of ascent headache and possible dizziness sleep disturbance fatigue more serious high altitude sickness hypoxia has lifethreatening implications and the potential for disrupting military operations hypoxia occurs when thetissues of the body are starved for oxygen the body reacts to this loss of oxygen byincreased breathing to get more air the physical activity of the body increases theheart rate and can cloud judgment symptoms of hypoxia include dizzinessgiddiness tingling sensation euphoria blurred andor tunnel vision lack ofmuscle coordination and slow reaction time the condition affects every soldierdifferently depending on the soldiers age general health physical conditioningand training 90 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedthe results of hypoxia can have minimal effect on an individual at 10000 feet but effects increase as the individual increases altitude loss of consciousness andpossible death can occur above 35000 feet operations above this level require anoxygen supply highaltitude weight loss weight loss is characteristic of operations at high altitude the average weight loss for special forces team living on pakistani rations and working with thehighaltitude mountain school in 1994 was 20 to 25 pounds working at highaltitudes requires more energy and soldiers will lose weight but weight loss mustbe controlled so it does not become incapacitating weight loss leads to fatigueloss of strength and psychological changes such as decreased mental capacityalertness and low morale all of these conditions can contribute to accidents and afailure to accomplish the mission soldiers should eat and drink the following while operating at highaltitudes highcomplex carbohydrates portions of the complete ration verses one item or the other at least one hot meal day using whatever heat source is available that is chemical heat packs in meals ready to eat mres variety of foods and nutritious snacks four to six 46 quarts of noncaffeinated beverages day soldiers should not do the following while operating at highaltitudes skip meals although you will not feel like eating consume little of everything in your ration eat high fat snacks or fatty foods or consume alcohol of any type force yourself to eat this will result in vomiting and make the situationmuch more hazardous drink unpurified water or melted snow that is not properly treated restrict water intake to save it for later or attempt to avoid urinating altitude sickness in most forms is preventable leaders must take precautions to protect their soldiers at moderate altitudes to avoid illness successful strategies toprevent altitude sickness are simple and inexpensive spend night at anintermediate altitude before moving higher take it easy one day at each succeedingaltitude level drink plenty of fluids eat full diet and avoid all alcohol tactical considerations during highaltitude operations initial observations received from afghanistan provide some interesting interpretations as to how soldiers are performing in the theater in most cases theseobservations include soldiers that have been in training already for mountainousoperations either as conventional infantry or sof the real test of longtermoperations may depend on followon light infantry forces that have to this pointrarely trained for this type of operation there is still time to prepare soldiers for for official use only 91oef handbook iiithe rigor of highaltitude operations but the training and equipping of these soldiers must begin now doctrine organizations training materiel leadership andeducation personnel and facilities dotmlpf provide the basis for examiningthese initial observations and how the army can begin reacting to the needs ofsoldiers in theater these operations are unique they were made in specifiedregion of the world where many of these conditions may never be duplicated theobservations are relatively concise many offer simple and easy solutions to aproblem few others will take some considerable effort time and resources toresolve section xii operations in cold weather to win in cold weather soldiers must also overcome an additional enemy the extreme and unforgiving cold weather environment this means preventing anddefeating cold injuries such as hypothermia and frostbite if allowed to developcold injuries become debilitating or possibly fatal in the case of hypothermia tothe soldier and threaten the units ability to defeat an enemy force in cold weatheroperations the four essential requirements for survival in cold environments are warmth food water shelter keeping the soldier warm and nourished are essential factors in preventing cold injuries and sustaining the combat power of the fighting force shelter isparticularly important because without it it is difficult to provide warmth andnutrition to soldiers in cold environment heat production the bodys three main physiological means for producing heat are metabolism exercise and shivering metabolism biochemical reactions which keep us alive produce heat as byproduct our basal metabolic rate is constant internal furnacehowever when we are exposed to cold wintry conditions for long periodsmetabolism by itself does not produce enough heat to satisfy our bodysentire heat requirements exercise exercise is an important method of heat production muscles which make up 50 percent of our body weight produce most of our heatduring work short bursts of hard physical effort generate tremendousamounts of heat moderate levels of exercise can be sustained for relativelylonger periods there are limitations however physical conditioningstrength stamina and fuel in the form of food and water are necessary to sustain activity shivering shivering is random inefficient quivering of our muscles it produces heat at rate five times greater than our basal metabolic rate it is 92 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedour first defense against cold shivering occurs when temperature receptors in the skin and brain sense decrease in body temperature and trigger theshivering response as with work and exercise the price of shivering is fuelhow long and how effectively we shiver is limited by the amount ofcarbohydrates stored in muscles and by the amount of water and oxygenavailable heat lossthe primary means of heat loss is through the skin there are five mechanisms by which our bodies lose heat conduction is the transfer of heat through direct contact between relatively hot and relatively cold object heat moves from the warmer tothe colder object we lose heat when we lie on snow ice and cold or wetfrozen ground foxholes or sit or lean against floors and bulkheads inunheated interiors of armored mechanized or wheeled vehicles convection is the transfer of heat by the circulation or movement of relatively colder ambient environment air or water around the body evaporation is heat loss in the form of vapor heat is necessary to the evaporation of perspiration from the skins surface evaporative heat lossaccounts for 20 percent of the bodys normal total heat loss when webecome overheated through physical exertion evaporation becomes ourmajor mechanism for heat loss sweating accounts for roughly two thirdsof our evaporative heat loss the remaining one third is lost throughbreathing respiration also cools the body as soldier breathes in cold dry air it is warmed and humidified in the lungs as it is exhaled as much as 25percent of the bodys heat can be lost placing wool scarf or mask overthe mouth and nose warms inhaled air and assists in keeping the bodywarm radiation is the emission of heat energy in the form of particles or waves energy is emitted by one body transmitted through an interveningmedium and absorbed by another body infrared or heat radiation istransferred from relatively hot to relatively cold object in winter welose heat to the environment through radiation we can receive radiativeheat input from fires from the sun or from reflection off snow water orlightcolored rocks when exposed to the environment the skin serves as radiator unlike the rest of the body the blood vessels in the head do not constrict and reduce the blood supplyflowing to the scalp the head is therefore an excellent radiator of heateliminating from 35 to 50 percent of our total heat production in cold weatheroperations dry insulation especially on the head is essential in minimizing heatloss the right approach to winning in the winter keeps soldiers healthy and focused on the mission there are four basic rules to remember keep soldiers in shape cold weather clothing is heavy and presents an additional burden to soldiers normal equipment the additional for official use only 93oef handbook iiiequipment coupled with the difficulty of trudging through the snow causes soldiers to expend extra energy the importance of maintaining ahigh level of physical conditioning cannot be overemphasized eat to keep fit regular satisfying hot food is essential for sustained performance even if soldiers are not hungry they must eat or they willlose physical conditioning they will also lower their threshold ofresistance to cold stress because their bodies will not have the fuel itneeds to sustain heat production and protect against lowering of the corebody temperature drink plenty of water normally in cold climates soldiers drink only when they are thirsty this will not give them the water needed to avoiddehydration drinking plenty of water avoids dehydration and the fatiguethat comes with it irritability is often an early sign of dehydrationsoldiers should not eat snow as water substitute the moisture content ofsnow is relatively low and eating it will lower the bodys coretemperature also there is danger of illness from bacteria howevermelted snow can be consumed after treatment with water purificationtablets maintain positive attitude in cold weather operations soldiers will face many new challenges but none that they cannot overcomeleadership will be reflected in soldiers attitudes and performanceleaders must watch for early signs of cold stress in their soldiers such asfatigue lethargy apathy irritability withdrawal loss of dexterity ordecisionmaking ability decreased group cooperation disorientation orslurred speech common cold weather injuries hypothermia moderate hypothermia when hypothermia is detected in its early stage soldier may respond well to the removal of the cold stressin the absence of serious underlying medical condition thechances for successful rewarming are good while we cannotchange the air temperature we can replace wet clothing with dryprotect the soldier from the wind add layers of insulation and applyheat keep in mind that rewarmed soldier should not return to thecold until his energy and fluid reserves have been replenished afterrewarming from the early stage of hypothermia the soldier shouldbe given good hot meal several quarts of liquids and adequate restbefore returning to duty fatigued or dehydrated soldier is strongcandidate for another episode of hypothermia advanced hypothermia symptoms if chilled or cold soldier does not respond immediately to basic rewarming efforts or if he continues toexhibit symptoms of hypothermia the soldier may be in amore advanced stage of hypothermia than initially thoughtand the leader should immediately initiate action to evacuate the soldier to medical facility 94 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedtreatment move

iiiby blood circulation and is compounded by intense cold and inactivity the extremities fingers toes and ears and face are affected first damp handsand feet may freeze quickly since moisture conducts heat away from thebody and destroys the insulating value of clothing the extent of frostbitedepends on temperature and duration of exposure frostbite is one of themajor nonfatal coldweather injuries encountered in military operations the categories of frostbite are superficial frostbite mild ºinvolves only the skin ºskin usually appears white or gray ºsurface will feel very stiff or hard but underlying tissue will be soft deep frostbite severe ºextends beyond the first layer of skin and may include the bone ºjoint movement may be absent or restricted depending on the extent of the injury ºdiscoloration is the same as for superficial frostbite but theunderlying tissue is hard ºlarge areas such as foot or hand may appear purple as the resultof sludging of blood within the vessels blackened appearancewill be noticed after the injury has thawed this category offrostbite requires immediate evacuation to medical facility factors contributing to frostbite ºdehydration ºbelowfreezing temperatures and wind chill ºskin contact with supercooled metals or liquids ºuse of caffeine tobacco or alcohol ºconstriction of an extremity caused by tight boots gloves gaiters

or three days sunburn sunburn often associated with summer day at the beach can also become debilitating cold weather injury both first andseconddegree burns are possible in cold weather operations symptoms firstdegree burns involve reddening of the skin seconddegree burns are characterized by the formation of blistersmountain climbers are especially vulnerable to sunburn because theyoften operate at highaltitude environments covered with highlyreflective snow fields the relatively thinner air allows more of theburning rays of the sun to penetrate the atmosphere and reflect offthe snow because the air temperature seems relatively coldsoldiers may miscalculate the intensity of the sun or simply be tooweary to take preventive action treatment sunburn usually is treated on first notice by further applications of sunburn preventive sun screensblocks should beused rather than the more common cosmetic suntan preparations inmild cases sunburned soldiers can continue their duties even thoughthey may suffer significant discomfort for few days in more severe 98 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedcases such as seconddegree sunburn with blister formation soldiers should be treated by medical personnel if there is muchswelling cold compresses should be applied aspirin may be takenfor pain and warm liquids should be administered to replenish bodyfluids salty

state dehydration symptoms in addition to irritability other signs of dehydration include darkening urine decreased amounts of urine being produceddry mouth tiredness mental sluggishness lack of appetite increasedor rapid heartbeat dizziness and even unconsciousness treatment the most important consideration is prevention leaders should ensure that soldiers consume four to six quarts of fluid perday coffee and liquids containing caffeine tea cocoa soft drinksshould not be considered adequate sources for replenishing bodyfluids because they act as diuretic removing fluids from the bodydrinks containing caffeine should only be consumed in moderationnot as the primary means of hydration if the soldier is consciousadminister fluids by mouth if improvement is not obvious in anhour

ventilation tent eye tent eye is caused by fumes emanating from stoves and lanterns operated in poorly ventilated shelter it can be prevented by using properlyfunctioning stoves and lanterns and adequately ventilating the shelter firstaid for tent eye is fresh air leadership in cold weather operations the process of developing soldiers into cold weather fighters requires positive leadership leaders must understand the environmental threat and include plans forcountering this threat in their operational plans or tsops initially the coldenvironment may be alarming even frightening to soldiers unaccustomed tooperating in wintry conditions especially when deployed to unfamiliar remoteareas some soldiers will find themselves confronted with challenges they have notencountered before the cold becomes constant reminder to the soldier of hisvulnerability in the extreme environment and the likelihood that he may become acasualty should he make mistake as soldiers gain experience they developconfidence in themselves their clothing and their equipment and learn they canfight and win in the winter defeating both the cold and the enemy before them aggressive cheerful leadership is essential in helping soldiers overcome the challenges of the cold environment to defeat the enemy soldiers must firstovercome the cold by learning how to live and survive the elements so they canfocus on the enemy leaders must maintain positive attitude toward the missiontheir soldiers and the equipment they have to carry out the tasks at hand 100 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedintense cold affects the mind as well as the body essential tasks take longer to perform and require more effort than in temperate climates this should beconsidered when planning operations and giving orders even for such routine tasksas vehicle maintenance and making or striking camp the time it takes toaccomplish tasks varies with differing conditions state of training and degree ofacclimatization of the troops however the extra time required to accomplish tasksshould not be used as an excuse for getting troops ready too early or leaving themstanding in the open unnecessarily after striking camp not only will they sufferphysically but their morale will ebb possibly at times when it should be at highpitch tips for leaders in cold weather operations leaders need to be aware of the symptoms that characterize unit having difficulty coping with the cold environment the following tips will helpcombat the effects of the cold when it begins to affect the minds of soldiers tip 1 if soldiers find it hard to remember things they have been taught show patience review orders and drills get them to think through thechallenges of the environment and the mission encourage them to ask questions keep their minds busy tip 2 be alert for soldiers who tend to withdraw from the groups focus keep them involved soldiers who withdraw into themselves should bepaired in buddy system with soldiers who are well acclimatized to thecold environment remind them that everyone is in the same situationincluding the enemy tip 3 if soldiers get depressed moody or blue and do not want to talk encourage them to chat with each other circulate among the troops in theirduty areas keep them talking and interacting tip 4 if soldiers become irritable and get on each others nerves keep in mind that this is likely to happen maintain your sense of humor and show patience vary their duties tip 5 be aware that soldiers may tend to shirk from some tasks to keep themselves warm remind them that their job is to fight and that weaponsand equipment must be kept in fighting order during winter training do notlet the training become camping trip this is common trap tip 6 do not accept the cold as an excuse for not carrying out orders or routine tasks cold may be the reason for taking longer but it is not reasonfor letting things slide remember that although the cold may make tasksmore difficult to accomplish it does not make them impossible withknowledge equipment and proper training leaders and soldiers can defeatthe cold and be successful in combat tip 7 plan the frequent rotation of soldiers into warming tentsareas to provide relief from the cold tip 8 provide warm liquids non caffeine at frequent intervals especially when rotating soldiers into warming tentsareas for official use only 101oef handbook iiitip 9 plan and provide extra insulating material for individuals when available the cold weather clothing system leaders should understand the design principles of the military cold weather clothing system these principles are insulate layer ventilate insulation allows the creation of microclimate around the body through which the amount of body heat lost to the environment can be regulated by varying theamount of insulation soldier can regulate the amount of heat lost or retained several layers of clothing provide more insulation and flexibility than one heavy garment even if the heavy garment is as thick as the combined layers by adding orremoving layers of clothing insulation the soldier can regulate the amount of heatlost or retained ventilation helps maintain comfortable microclimate around the body thereby helping control body temperature by ventilating the soldier can release excessheat and minimize sweating which can lower body temperature later as itevaporates there are four ways to apply the principles in the military cold weather clothing system keep clothing clean dirt and grease clog the air spaces in clothing and reduce the insulating effect dirty clothes are cold clothes avoid overheating select the clothing needed to stay comfortable or even little cool leaders should ensure that their soldiers are notoverdressed for the job they are performing wear it loose all items of the cold weather uniform are sized to allow wearing of the appropriate number of layers this means for examplethat the field jacket may appear too large when worn without all of thelayers designed to fit under it if the uniform items do not fit loosely theinsulation will be substantially reduced keep it dry it is vital that all layers of clothing be kept dry because wet clothing conducts heat away from the body compromising themicroclimate around the body and making it difficult to regulate bodytemperature moisture soaks into clothing from two directions frommelting snow and frost that has collected on the outside of the clothingand from perspiration leaders should ensure that soldiers brush snowand frost from clothing before entering heated shelters or vehicles 102 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsection xiii food and water food and waterborne diseases sanitation is extremely poor

byauthorized food service organizations food considerationsfood can dehydrate and kill if there isnt sufficient water in the body for sweat and digestion the body will give priority to food digestion by robbing the rest of thesystem of needed moisture soldier should eat only if he can find enough water toreplenish his supply regularly if there is choice of food eat carbohydrates theyuse the least amount of water to digest fats and proteins use the most militaryemergency rations are mostly carbohydrates for this reason waterlakes rivers streams or other surface water in rural areas may be contaminated with leptospirosis regionally large leptospirosis outbreaks have been reportedassociated with contact with contaminated water sources operations or activitiesthat involve extensive water contact may result in personnel being temporarilydebilitated with leptospirosis if unapproved water must be used in an emergencythe water may be disinfected by adding calcium hypochlorite at 50 ppm

reducing eating if water is not available refraining from smoking tobacco dries out the mouth locating surface water locating water in desert areas requires keen observation surface water is usually found after rare rainstorms in the formof intermittent streams and pools of water or waterfilled cracks in rockswater may take few weeks to couple of months to dry up by looking forlogical water collection area indicators soldiers might be able to locate asurface source lush green or flowering plants indicate recent rainfall in the area look in low spots between hills or dunes and at the base of cliffs rocky places may hold large pools for long time especially underoverhangs or in cracks in the rock pools of water may be standing in drystream beds fog in the morning could be another indicator of recent rain signs of animals indicate the presence of water the v formed by the intersection of two animal trails usually pointstoward water flight direction of birds at dusk and dawn can indicate water large quantities of bird dung at the surface of crack in rock may meanwater in the crack the sound of frogs at night can guide soldier to water the presence of bees andor other insects may indicate water is nearby brush piles in low spots are sometimes used by local people to slowevaporation and keep animals out of pools of water 104for official use onlycenter for army lessons

plan of action development survival on the ground andrecovery should take this capability into consideration the sun may be used along with plastic to obtain water vegetation bag this is large plastic bag in which cut vegetation is placed the bag is then tied shut and left in the sun during the hottestpart of the day the plant emits water which is trapped and condensed inthe bag this is the preferred method for soldiers because vegetationbag can be left on the ground or in sunny hole in the ground where therisks of it being noticed are reduced transpiration bag this is plastic bag placed over the leafy portion of branch and then tied this is not preferred method to be used in anevasion situation since there is risk the bags will be noticed solar still this is the least preferable choice and should be used only in survival situation and only if expected to be in the area for more thanone day the effort to construct this device will expend more water than itproduces on the first day ground subsurface water springs and underground rivers sometimes come to the surface and then disappear into the desert these areas areusually inhabited oases the depth of subsurface water can vary widely itmay be just under the surface or over 100 feet deep water near the surfacemight by obtainable by digging in likely spots such as areas with mud or moist sand mud can be wrapped in cloth and wrungout the lowest spot between hills or dunes low spots at the base of cliffs or in narrow rock valleys low spots at the outside curve of dry stream bed low spots with rich green vegetation places where animals havescratched at the surface or flies hover over the ground manmade structures such as wells cisterns and karez irrigation tunnels are another potential source of water for official use only 105oef handbook iiiwells are the major source of water to desert people they may be 10 to over 100 feet deep well users bring their own rope and bucket thesewells are usually located in low places such as dry rivers valleys or atthe base of dunes or cliffs cisterns catch and hold water from intermittent streams or runoff fromstorms soldiers encountering ruins can look for old irrigation ditches andfollow them uphill from flat places that might have been planted fields atone time cisterns are likely to be at the bottom of dry river bed orcanyon and are usually nothing more than brick or rocklined storagetanks all of these manmade subsurface water sources require long line and some form of bucket to get to the water wells in the desert are usually foundalong trails and can be from 2030 miles apart permanent camps may be23 miles from wells although nomads sometimes camp very close to awell watch for worn paths leading away from camp areas they may lead toa well look for old wells uphill from abandoned homes farms or otherdwellings if animal dung and remains of old campfires are noticed theremay be well nearby some people stack animal dung near the wells to dryfor use as fuel at later date well openings may be covered to prevent sand and debris from filling them in look for doughnutshaped mounds brush or sandfilled depressionsthey may have to be dug out be careful not to allow sand or debris to falldown the hole the water may be very shallow in the bottom of the well finding water is not the only problem facing soldiers once found it must be obtained without being detected scout the area and observe the wellfrom distance if the enemy knows soldier is in the area they may trysetting up an ambush at the well they know the soldier needs water lookcarefully for vehicle tracks carefully scan any high ground for enemyobservers or dust water source should be approached during darknesswhen escape chances are increased if the enemy has set trap when soldier uses well he should get as much water as he can carry and move away from the area as soon as possible the volume of water carriedgoverns the soldiers range of travel and ability to hide

from freezing onwinter nights when expanding ice may burst the containers keep themclose to the body be sure rodents cannot gnaw on them section xiv field sanitation and personal hygiene throughout history disease and nonbattle injuries have been the largest cause of military casualties personal hygiene is difficult at best in cold weather operationsthe role of field sanitation is to aid the unit in protecting the health of troops fieldsanitation concerns itself with the basic responsibilities of field sanitation establish garbage pits whenever possible dispose of all garbage in pits burn or bury it prior to departure there should be pit for each platoon garbage must be buried at least 100 feet from any water source patrols should never leave behind any evidence of their presence in anarea all waste should be carried until it can be disposed of properly toavoid giving away potential intelligence to the enemy about patrol orcampsite locations or activities during training bag all trash and garbage and haul it to the rear fordisposal establish latrines normally central latrine should be established if dispersion within the camp is not too great one latrine will usually serve the needs of three tofour shelters or unit of platoon size chemical toilets are the preferred latrine devices use cathole latrine for marches straddle trench for one to three daybivouac sites deep pit latrine for temporary camps burnout latrines andsoakage pits for urinals the latrine must be placed downwind of the campsite but not so far fromthe shelters that the placement encourages individuals to break sanitarydiscipline it should be windproofed by branches snow blocks ponchos or otheravailable materials and should be camouflaged for training an empty mre box lined with trash bag can suffice fullbags can be sealed left in the box and then hauled to the rearoef handbook iii for official use only 107plan to take lime with you locate latrines at least 100 meters from the unit mess and at least 100 meters from any water source waste management all types of waste are generated each day in the field always bury your waste immediately to prevent flies from spreading germsfrom waste to your food also burying your waste helps keep unwantedanimals out of your bivouac area if waste is not disposed of properly thecamp will quickly become an ideal breeding area for flies rats and othervermin diseases such as dysentery typhoid cholera dengue and plaguecould compromise the integrity of the unit to combat this problem unitmedical personnel should provide technical assistance in the fabricationlocation and maintenance of field wastedisposal facilities they alsoinspect these facilities before their initial use to ensure their proper construction and location and then reinspect on daily basis personal hygiene the following techniques and procedures can be used to maintain minimal personal hygiene in the field especially if laundry and bath support is not readily available cleanliness shave if necessary at night in the shelter so that facial oils stripped during shaving will be replenished overnight before the face is againexposed to the elements brush teeth daily if toothbrush is not available chew the end of twiginto makeshift brush if twig is not available salt on fingertip cansuffice if applied gently change underwear as frequently as practical at least twice weeklychange socks as often as needed to keep the feet dry use foot powder asa dry rub to clean the feet foot care trim toenails straight across at approximately 90degree angle with the edges of the nails this relieves pressure at the edges of the nailspermitting the nail to arch in the middle so that the corners wont cutdiginto the skin below use foot powder to dry feet apply powder on feet and between toesremove excess do not put foot powder in socks extra powder may cakeand hasten the onset of blisters blisters can become problem unless they are treated at the first sign ofirritation before blister actually forms tape over developing hot spotthe bandage should be sufficiently large enough so that the tape touchesonly nonirritated skin once blister has formed apply doughnuttypebandage to relieve pressure on the blister again the doughnut andbandage should be large enough to encircle the blister and avoid furtherirritation of the blistered area use tincture of benzoin to help the tapeadhere to the skin it also helps toughen the skin never lance or drainblisters unless they are surrounded by redness or they are oozing purulent 108 for official use onlycenter

skin care bathe frequently take full bath at least once every week if showers or baths are not available use washcloth daily to wash genital area armpits feet other areas where you sweat or that become wet such as between thighsor for females under the breasts potable water safe potable water is essential to the army water that is not properly treated can transmit such diseases as typhoid and paratyphoid fevers bacillary dysenterycholera poliomyelitis and common diarrhea in some areas water may also be themeans of transmitting infectious hepatitis schistosomiasis and amoebic dysenterylessons from operation desert shield and operation desert storm showed thatunits should use planning factor of at least seven gallons of water per soldier per24hour period treat the individual water supply with one iodine tablet per quartsize canteen if the water is clear two tablets if the water is cloudy let stand for five minutes withthe cap loosened and shake to permit leakage to rinse the thread around the necktighten cap and let stand for 20 minutes calcium hypochlorite maybe used addone ampule in onehalf canteen cup of water dissolve then pour one canteen cap ofthe solution in the canteen shake and let stand for 30 minutes the best containers for small quantities of water five gallons are plastic water cans water in plastic cans will be good up to 72 hours compared to metal that willonly be good for 24 hours however you should change the water in your canteenat least every 24 hours water in trailers if kept in the shade will last up to fivedays if the temperature outside exceeds 100 of the temperature of your water must be monitored and when it exceeds 92of it should be changed as bacteria will multiply if not changed you will end up with case of diarrhea ice in containerswill keep water cool if ice is put in the water trailers the ice in it must be removedbefore the trailer is moved as the floating ice may destroy the inner protection of the

prior to consumptionoef handbook iii for official use only 109chapter 3 an introduction to afghanistan figure 1 section i historical review us in operation enduring freedom osama bin muhammad bin awad bin laden was born in 1955 the youngest of twenty surviving sons of one of saudi arabias wealthiest and most prominentfamilies he is part feudal saudi an aristocrat who from time to time would retreatwith his father to the desert and live in tent he came of age during the rise oforganization of petroleum exporting countries opec and the extraordinarywealth that accompanied it he is of saudi generation whose religious fervor orpolitical zeal led thousands to fight war in the distant muslim land ofafghanistan osama bin laden has been involved in establishing two very important organizations mak maktabu lkhidamat in 1979 and alqaida in 1988 thepurpose of mak was to drive the soviet troops out of afghanistan and alqaidagrew out of mak bin laden was able to recruit troops from all over the arabworld but especially from saudi arabia algeria and egypt more than 10000 arebelieved to have been trained by mak to participate in the war against the soviet for official use only 111oef handbook iii union large numbers of mak troops lost their lives in the war but the survivors became exceptionally skilled soldiers the ideology of alqaida is to cleanse muslim countries of corrupt and secular leadership and fight against the powers that threaten muslim states and the holyplaces of islam the powers they believe to be threatening muslim states areprincipally the us and israel the us for interfering in numerous areas in themuslim world politically and military and israel for occupying palestine theideology has three goals 1 radicalize existing islamic groups and create islamicgroups where none exist 2 advocate destruction of the us which is seen as thechief obstacle to reform in muslim societies and 3 support muslim fighters inafghanistan algeria bosnia chechnya eritera kosovo pakistan somaliatajikistan the philippines and yemen when bin laden arrived in afghanistan the government that had assumed power after the departure of the soviets was being besieged by fundamentalist studentfaction known as the taliban its leader was mullah muhammad omar who likebin laden had fought in the jihad the two men had similar ideology andcomplementary needs bin laden needed refuge and the fledgling taliban neededcash bin laden gave the mullah an initial payment of three million dollars for thecause and the taliban was able to capture the key center of jalalabad in septemberof 1996 ten days later the capital kabul fell sometime after that according tous officials bin laden through the marriage of one of his daughters becamemullah omars fatherinlaw the taliban first drew the worlds attention in 1994 when pakistan recruited them to protect their trade convoys they grew in popularity because they foughtcorruption and lawlessness and because they like most of the afghan people areethnic pashtuns while the leaders at the time were tajiks and uzbeks by 1998 thetaliban had virtually eliminated the opposing northern alliance the talibans popularity with many afghans initially surprised the countrys warring mujahedin factions but it was not purely question of ethnicity ordinaryafghans weary of the prevailing lawlessness in many parts of the country wereoften delighted by taliban successes in stamping out corruption restoring peaceand allowing commerce to flourish again their refusal to deal with the existingwarlords whose rivalries had caused so much killing and destruction also earnedthem respect the taliban said their aim was to set up the worlds most pure islamic state banning frivolities like television music and cinema their attempts to eradicatecrime were reinforced by the introduction of islamic law including publicexecutions and amputations flurry of regulations forbidding girls from going toschool and women from working quickly brought them into conflict with theinternational community such issues along with restrictions on womens access tohealth care also caused some resentment among ordinary afghans from the mid1990s the taliban provided sanctuary to osama bin laden and provided base for his and other terrorist organizations bin laden provided bothfinancial and political support to the taliban bin laden and his alqaida groupwere charged with the bombing of the us embassies in nairobi and dar essalaam in 1998 in august 1998 the united states launched cruise missile attackagainst bin

north of the hindu kush to the amu darya river andeventually to the russian steppes in the east the mountains are indistinguishablefrom those of pakistan afghanistan is approximately the size of texas section iii topography about onethird of afghanistan in the southwest and north is arid plain the southwestern plain is the larger of the two and is barren desert with large areas ofdrifting sand scattered hill belts and few low mountains small villages along afew intermittent streams small settlements and narrow band of cultivation alongthe helmand river are the only features that break desolation the helmand is oneof the few perennial streams in the region the northern plains are actually steppeswith seasonal grasslands supporting small nomadic population permanentsettlements are located along the margin of the steppes and on the flood plain of theamu darya river the mountains that comprise the other twothirds of the country are the perennially snowcapped hindu kush in the northeast and progressively lower mountains in thewest the hindu kush have sharpcrested ridges and towering peaks while thelower western mountains are generally rounded or flattopped afghanistan can bebroken down into three military operational zones the northern steppe the afghanhighlands and the southwestern desert basins section iv drainage afghanistan has four major river systems that originate in the hindu kush the kabul the helmand the amu darya and the harirud of the four only theeastward flowing kabul ever reaches the ocean the other three eventuallydisappear into salt marshes or desert wastes only the amu darya also known asthe oxus has significant navigable reaches the rest are fordable for the greaterpart of the year throughout their courses the amu darya also serves as thenorthern border of afghanistan the helmand is the largest in flow and volume and for official use only 113oef handbook iiiruns southward across the southern desert into the salt marsh wastes found along the afghaniranian border the harirud runs westward past herat then turnsnorthward forming the border between afghanistan and iran all the afghan rivers and their tributaries are used for irrigation supplementing the stream irrigation is the karez system of underground channels with verticalaccess and maintenance shafts carrying water from the base of the mountain slopesto oases on valley floors the signature of karez qanat in iran particularlynoticeable from the air is the row of evenly spaced openings shafts surrounded bymounds of earth that define the course of the underground channels section v vegetation what little natural vegetation there is in afghanistan consists mainly of bunch grasses trees are scarce and mostly limited to planted poplars and willows

includes many different ethnic groups the pashtuns pushtuns who make up more than half the population have traditionally been thedominant ethnic group their homeland lies south of the hindu kush but pashtungroups live in all parts of the country many pashtuns also live in northwesternpakistan where they are called pathans pashtuns are usually farmers though alarge number of them are nomads living in tents made of black goat hair malepashtuns live by ancient tribal code called pashtunwali which stresses couragepersonal honor resolution selfreliance and hospitality the pashtuns speakpashto which is an indoeuropean language and one of the two official languagesof afghanistan the tajiks tadzhiks are the second largest ethnic group in afghanistan they live in the valleys north of kabul and in badakhshan they are farmers artisansand merchants the tajiks speak dari afghan persian also an indoeuropeanlanguage and the other official language of afghanistan dari is more widelyspoken than pashto

were mostly driven out by the soviet invasion andlargely emigrated to turkey all of these groups are settled farmers merchants andseminomadic sheep herders the nomads live in yurts or round feltcovered tentsof the mongolian or central asian type prior to the war important political positions were distributed almost equally among ethnic groups this kept ethnic tensions and violence to minimum though thepashtuns in kabul were always the politically dominant group in the mid1990sattempts have been made to reestablish shared rule however many of the ethnicgroups have sought greater share of power than they had before the war andviolence is common result of the disputes section viii key cities kandahar is located is southern afghanistan approximately 500 kilometers 310 miles

composed of many distinct ethnic groups certain elements of their way of life are much the same characteristically thefamily is the mainstay of afghan society extremely close bonds exist within thefamily which consists of the members of several generations the family is headedby the oldest man or patriarch whose word is law for the whole family familyhonor pride and respect toward other members are highly prized qualities amongboth villagers and nomads the family lives together and forms selfsufficientgroup in the villages each family generally occupies either one mudbrick house ora walled compound containing mudbrick or stonewalled houses the same patternprevails among the nomads except that tents replace the houses 116 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsettlements in afghanistan with less than 100 houses number over 10000 and those with 100 to 250 houses number about 1000 there are 53 urban centers thatrange in size from 2500 to 25000 people in the smaller villages there are noschools stores nor any representative of the government each village has threesources of authority the malik village headman the mirab master of the waterdistribution and the mullah teacher of islamic laws commonly khan largelandowner will control the whole village by assuming the role of both malik andmirab baggy cotton trousers are standard part of the afghan villagers costume the men wear long cotton shirts which hang over their trousers and wide sashesaround their waists they also wear skullcap and over that turban which theytake off when working in the fields the women wear long loose shirt or ahighbodice dress with swirling skirt over their trousers they drape wide shawlabout their heads many women wear jewelry which is collected as form offamily wealth when urban women leave their houses they usually wear burka orshadier long tentlike veil that covers them from head to foot women in villagesseldom wear the burka and educated urban women discarded the customespecially under soviet domination where it was regarded as backward the diet of most afghan villagers consists mainly of unleavened flat bread called nan soups kind of yogurt called mast vegetables fruit and occasionally rice andmeat tea is the favorite drink village men work in the fields joined by the women during the harvest older children tend the flocks and look after the smaller children the village mosque isthe center of religious life and is often used as the village guest house twice year groups of nomads may pass through villages on their routes from summer highland grazing grounds to the lowlands where they camp during thewinter the villagers traditionally permit the nomads to graze their animals over theharvested fields which the flocks fertilize by depositing manure the nomads buysupplies such as tea wheat and kerosene from the villagers the villagers buy wooland milk products from the nomads for food and clothing the nomads depend onthe milk products meat wool and skins of their flocks for transportation theydepend on their camels nomadic women are freer and less secluded than thevillage women favorite sport in northern afghanistan is game called buzkashi in which teams of horsemen compete to deposit the carcass of large headless calf in goal circleafghans also play polo and ghosai team sport similar to wrestling the

the 82d airborne in firebase shkin by david l buffaloe reprinted with permission from ausas institute of land warfare no042 october 2004 introduction in may 2003 i was given remarkable opportunity i had always wanted to take command of an airborne infantry company and subsequently to lead them incombat but what ensued over the next three months went beyond my expectationsi took command of unique company team composed of assets that i never thoughti would command i conducted numerous civil military operations cmos alongwith intense combat operations over the next six weeks soldiers under mycommand engaged in six firefights with qaeda forces and none of my soldierssustained injury when we left firebase shkin i knew i had just partaken in theexperience of lifetime i was given an opportunity that other captain in thearmy was given to fight his own combinedarms coalition joint multiagencyfight in his own area of operations ao but in addition to my own thankfulnessfor being given this opportunity i realized that what we accomplished could andshould be accomplished by young company commanders throughout the world insupport of the global war on terrorism gwot after the highintensity warfareis complete and we begin fighting an insurgency operation the best way to find fixand finish an enemy waging guerilla war is to give leaders at the smallunit levelenough leeway enough specialized assets and enough firepower to engage theirpopulation develop their own intelligence and be able to crush the enemy the enemy we routinely face in the gwot blends into the population he might or might not have the support of the locals but the same can be said for thecoalition forces relationships with the locals we need to earn local support on apersonal level only then will they assist us in fighting insurgency in writing this i have three goals the first is to get our army and national security leaders to recognize that we have within our existing forces remarkableasset for fighting and winning the war on terrorism our companysized elementsthe way ahead is simple focus some of our doctrine and training to prepare youngcompany commanders to lead combinedarms warfare to conduct cmo operationsand to develop and exploit their own intelligence this leads into my second goalto provide short lessons learned to my fellow company commanders who arecurrently or will soon be in position like mine where they can conduct these typesof operations finally i want to share our story the 200 american and coalitionsoldiers and the 180 afghan militia who served with in the bermel valleyrisked their lives every day and came out with tremendous sense ofaccomplishment we took the bermel valley from the enemy and we won our ownbattles in this global war on terrorism in way do i claim to be an expert ineither conventional or unconventional warfare i simply wish to share theexperiences of unit that was successful for official use only 135oef handbook iiithe bermel valley in the bermel valley dubbed the evilest place by the xviii airborne corps commander b company 3d battalion 504th parachute infantry regiment82d airborne division did what had not been done before and did it verysuccessfully we fought joint combinedarms coalition interagency fight at thecompany level soldiers under my command fought in six smallarms firefightswith qaeda in addition to fighting however we conducted numerous cmoswe met with elders from every village in the bermel valley drank chai tea and discussed village problems and how to arrive at joint solutions we providedhumanitarian assistance and diminimus health care defined as smallscale medicalassistance operations using available excess medical supplies to the populationwe laid the groundwork to build wells hospitals and schools including the firstever girls school in the region we met routinely with the regional governor todiscuss security issues we met monthly with the pakistani border guardcommander across the border to discuss crossborder issues and cooperation wetrained equipped and employed 180 afghan militia fighters and conducted jointoperations with the afghan national army ana best of all we did it well notone soldier under my command got scratch from enemy fire intelligence reportsclaimed that we killed about two dozen seasoned foreign qaeda fighters andthe unified effort of engaging the population in cmos led directly to most of theintelligence we collected intelligence that saved my life and my soldiers liveswe applied special operations tactics but with the conventionalforce firepower andsurvivability that special forces operational detachment alpha teams ateamsdo not possess throughout this lowintensity war with the qaeda and the remaining hostile taliban forces conventional forces routinely had difficulty finding andfixing enemy forces conventional force usually went into an area with so muchstrength and firepower that the enemy forces would simply blend into the populaceand wait for the battalion to leave the region hoping we would not stumble upontheir weapons cache ateams had much more success finding the enemy whiledriving around the countryside in convoys of four government motor vehicles butthey did not have the firepower armor or backup to fight their way through anambush and come out victorious we did have that firepower we were able toprovide just enough of signature to lure out the enemy forces but with enoughfirepower and support to destroy them as an infantry company commander my role my autonomy my distance from my higher headquarters my engagement with the local populace wassomething that up until then was only done by special forces ateamcommanders my task organization and the assets under my command mimicked asmall battalion task force never had i envisioned that i would be thrown into sucha situation none of my formal military training focused on such scenarioshowever with our nation engaged in longterm lowintensity war while trying toconduct stability operations in both afghanistan and iraq and with our specialforces spread so thin bravo company proved not only that conventional forces canbe ultimately successful in this fight but that we are actually very well adapted toaccomplish this mission our operations and our way of doing things should be adapted for the future of lowintensity conflict our approach was to give company commander acombinedarms team make them mobile two antitank at platoons and enough 136 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedcargo highmobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles hmmwvs to move and give them enough infantrymen we had six squads local reactive accurate fire support we had two 60mm mortar tubes 2x 105mm howitzers and q36 fire finder radar system plenty of intelligence assets we had human intelligence humintteam signal intelligence sigint team remote battlefield sensorsystem rembass longrange reconnaissance detachment lrsdand scouts with some access to nationallevel intelligence assets todevelop their own intelligence while feeding intelligence to the higherheadquarters engineers andor explosive ordnance disposal eod personnel to blowup stuff and to disarm improvised explosive devices ieds when theyfind them civil affairs ca assets so they can engage the population tactical air control parties tacps medical assets enough to treat masscasualty scenario and also to usefor cmo operations psychological operations psyop assets to help convey the coalitionmessage their own cooks and mechanics as well as augmenting them with localhires miniature battalion staff i had fulltime battle captain lieutenant junior captain or e7 an e5 intelligence analyst as my s2 intelligenceand s4 logistics i had lieutenant who was serving as the battalionsassistant s4 and s5 civil affairs i had ca e5 plenty of interpreters and local militia force to train and utilize field grade officers were used as well in one rifle battalion they could easily split among three locations the battalion commander at one location theexecutive officer at second location and the s3 operations at third this wouldallow every firebase to be commanded by field grade officer while each wouldhave company commander as the commander on the ground for any action thattook place when we had all that we were allowed to engage the population and to plan our own missions we controlled our own ao and our field grade officer couldclear fires we had enough assets to protect the firebase provide quickreactionforce qrf and still conduct goodsized operation either cmo or offensive tactics in lowintensity conflict the essence and focus of lowintensity conflict is different from that of highintensity conflict the commanders goal is to find fix and finish the enemythe difference lies in the specific tasks the enemy does not wear uniform heblends into the population often he invokes fear in the local populace sometimes for official use only 137oef handbook iiihe can rally them to his cause in this instance he had pseudohaven across the border in pakistan where we could not pursue him unless we maintained positiveidentification finding him was the most difficult task we used mixture of scoutssnipers lrsd unmanned aerial vehicles uavs rembass motion sensorsq36 fire finder radar big brother joint land attack cruise missile defenseelevated netted sensor jlens forwardlooking infrared system infantry squadsin ambush positions and observation posts ops tactical humint team andhumint sources such as village elders pakistanis the bermel police and theregional governor and the least preferred method making accidental directcontact with the enemy sometimes on his terms but sometimes on our own fixing the enemy usually involved indirect fires these are most effective when shot beyond the enemy to seal off their suspected escape route fixing theenemy could also involve maintaining direct contact with him by the force such asa mounted antitank patrol that made initial contact finishing the enemy always involved crushing him with an overwhelming qrf defeating him with directfire weapon systems and claiming the ground heonce held or engaging him in pursuit these principles of findfixandfinish are what helped us defeat the qaeda and anticoalition militants acms in the bermel valley but what won onthe larger and longterm level was getting out and engaging the local populationthis was done through various cmos and local projects completed by members ofthe coalition joint civil military task force cjcmotf and other governmentagencies ogas as well as with the support of some nongovernment organizationsngos you only truly know your ao when you get out and engage thepopulation they only come to trust you when you do so finally we relied mostly on our own intelligence we had numerous intelligencegathering assets the gathering and analysis of intelligence in our aowas the single piece that helped ensure our success only very rarely did we receivenationallevel intelligence leads the intelligence we developed was much morereliable command and control structureunity of command the different regions of afghanistan were divided up into areas of operations each belonging to different task force each task force had differentfunctions eg the coalition joint special operations task force cjsotfconducted special operations missions and the coalition joint civil military taskforce cjcmotf focused on civil military operations cmo my own taskforce task force devil focused mainly on offensive combat operations taskforce might or might not have personnel stationed within another task forces aofor instance task force devil personnel were often stationed at cjsotf andcjcmotf firebases to provide force protection and qrf in support of thecjsotf and cjcmotf missions to streamline operations and make battletracking easier one group has to own any given ao unity of command is essentialwhen clearing fires ultimately however it is essential in creating unified effortto pacify an area prior to my assumption of command cjsotf controlled firebase shkin and the ao encompassing the bermel valley while task force devil personnel 138 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedwere simply there providing force protection and limited patrolling when cjsotf pulled out of the ao task force devil assumed control of the firebase and the ao the battalion executive officer xo served as the overall firebase and ao commander i was the only company commander even though the lines betweenwhat fell under his command and what fell under my command were very blurrythis command structure actually worked out perfectly the battalion xo couldalways be the overall firebase commander while i could always be the commanderon the ground he would clear fires in the tactical operations center toc as irequested them he would send reports higher request assets such as army aviationand close air support cas he could coordinate qrfs to reinforce in pinchour lines of command blurred but never clashed we had great workingrelationship i highly recommend this as model for future firebases combat operationsfirebase defense defending the firebase is paramount but in lowintensity conflict it is somewhat different because the enemy is very unlikely to conduct afull frontal attack or penetration firebase shkin had three main defensiveperimeters the outer perimeter the inner perimeter and the wall at any given time one squad rotated on firebase defense this squad would man the inner perimeter gate and the two eastern towers which had the largestfields of fire and most activity since they overlooked the bermel valley and couldsee all the way to pakistan the squad leader would serve as the firebase sergeantof the guard responsible to the toc for overall firebase defense and conduct of theguards one of the other two towers was manned by at platoons since we hadonly six uparmored hmmwvs this provided one at section that at any giventime was not either patrolling or standing by on qrf and the other was manned asa shared responsibility by the other soldiers in the firebase such as the mortars airdefense artillery and field artillery we also always maintained qrf the fire support officer fso produced an awesome plan for overall firebase defense integrating direct and indirect fire support and considering thedead space we executed blackjack drills exercises of our battle drill in theevent of direct attack on the firebase these drills helped in number of waysfirst they ironed out problems that we could face if we did receive direct attacksecond they showed the enemy what our capabilities were should they ever thinkto launch direct attack and most important they showed the soldiers that theywere safe that nothing could penetrate our firebase and that they were part of thedefensive plan in each blackjack drill we would exercise all assets whether it wasa livefire drill or not everyone would don helmets and body armor and seek coverwithin the protective walls and structures of the twofootthick mudbuilt firebasethe squad and section leaders would come to the firebase toc for their briefingand we would reinforce one or two of the walls with soldiers ready to engage withdirect fire at times we would even emplace targets in the fields for the soldiers toengage we usually would include mass casualty exercise drills to get the advancedtrauma life support atls team involved and prepared along with preparing thesquads to exercise buddy aid evacuation and reinforcement of weak section of thewall and we would exercise resupplying all soldiers with ammunition that wasprepositioned on the walls and at the base of the towers the firebase was surrounded by wadis that provided avenues of approach about 100 200 meters outside the firebase and in some places right up to the outer for official use only 139oef handbook iiiamf perimeter prior to my arrival the infantry squads conducted routine dismounted patrols of these wadi systems and other dead space such as that on theother side of the hills to our west these patrols could be conducted entirelydismounted entering and leaving the firebase on foot even though they fit in withthe standard thought of planning for defense i put stop to these types of patrolsfor two reasons the first was the drain on resources vs the payoff these patrols usually took one squad per day i had only six rifle squads at the firebase i used myweapons squad as rifle squad and usually left their m204b machine guns mountedon the towers for firebase defense among these six three squads rotated ondefense which consisted of qrf guard and compensation time or training timethe other three rotated on offense which consisted of all operations outside ofthe firebase giving up one of these three precious rifle squads for lowpayoffdismounted patrols to clear firebase dead space was not an option instead i usedother assets at my disposal avengers and other soldiers the avenger missiletrucks were very handy for clearing dead space since there was aerial threatfrom the enemy we refocused the avengers to provide mobile eyes that could seeextremely well any movement in the dead space although much louder than adismounted patrol they were also much quicker and could identify movement atnight anywhere in the wadi system the second and more important reason for ending the strictly dismounted patrols around the firebase was recognition of the way the enemy fights in alowintensity conflict the enemy whether qaeda hostile taliban amf or somesimilar group will not be so bold as to attempt deliberate attack on an establisheddefended structure they fight by conducting indirect fire attacks using mortars androckets and by ambushing patrols when they are out and exposed during thegwot there have been remarkably few direct smallarms attacks on firebasesforward operating bases fobs and larger established structures even in theattacks that are on record many can be attributed to small attack on one remoteguard post probably with the intent of killing only those guards rather thanpenetrating the firebase by looking at the points of origin of the rockets andmissiles fired and the locations of the ambushes i determined that the enemy wasfighting from between six and 15 kilometers outside the firebase and mostly nearthe pakistani border rather than close in to the firebase since they were fighting usfrom there that is where our operations needed to be rather than close in to thefirebase i was able to focus my efforts there because we did have strong defenseas demonstrated during livefire blackjack drills and could rely on our closeinsafety one last topic of great importance to firebase defense is operational security opsec opsec must be maintained we knew that the enemy collectedintelligence on us we always operated on the assumption that whenever patrolleft the firebase it was seen and reported in some fashion even if only by means asprimitive as signal fire mirror or flashlight also we had to be careful what wassaid around the local workers and amf we had to prevent talk about anyoperations even routine patrols among the locals noncommissioned officersncos monitored weekly calls home to ensure that information was passed onthe satellite phone that might be picked up by the enemy major operations we identified major operation as anything greater than routine patrol these operations could range in size from platoon to company plus 140 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedin every event we used every available asset to plan for every conceivable contingency whether the mission was raid sensitivesite exploitation sse acordonandsearch or cmo the task organization looked pretty much the samewe always planned for an outer cordon an inner cordon search team teamvillage with security intelligencegathering assets demolition team medicalteam and responsive fire support if the operation fell within the standard range ofour 105mm howitzers we left it at that with preplanned targets if it fell only withinrocketassisted propellant rap range i displaced the 60mm mortars because i didnot trust the variance that rap produced if the operation fell outside rap rangewe displaced howitzer we also always requested deliberate cas on any plannedoperation even on cmos cas was very helpful our outer cordon usually consisted of afghan militia forces the inner cordon usually consisted of elements of my antitank platoon both were used forthe cordon because they were very quick to establish blocking positionsoccasionally i would also use infantry squads to help establish the inner cordon inlocations where using an at vehicle was unnecessary the cordon or teamsecure would always fall under the command and control of the at platoonleader this ensured that one leader was focused solely on securing the objectivethey would initially lock down the objective and then at my command wouldallow both personnel and vehicular traffic to flow in controlled fashion after athorough search inside i would task one platoon with search most of our missions raid sse or otherwise involved major search of the premises in any event we had tobe prepared to search anything if we found an intelligence lead one of the infantryplatoon leaders was always assigned as the search platoon leader he usually had anengineer or eod team at his disposal to search anything that looked suspicious orto destroy any caches we always took along team village this encompassed all of our squishy elements security force and usually myself squishy term coinedby the battalion commander roughly meant forces whose primary mission did notinvolve killing the enemy it usually applied to civil affairs and psyop forceswho went in to meet with the village elders i usually used my weapons squadwithout their machine guns or javelins as team village personal securitydetachment team village was always led by the head cmo person either my owns5 or the civil affairs team cata commander falling under the team villagefor command and control c2 but usually operating independently were the tacticalhumint team tht they were best at working the outskirts during meetingwith village elders the team village leader and i could debrief the s2 on anyintelligence that came out of the meeting but the tht had good success workingintelligence from the crowd and the younger members of the village who were notinvited into the meeting many operations also included team overwatch this was usually simply my fire support officer or nco along with the air force forward aircontrollers or tacps and sometimes sniper they would take twoman infantrysecurity element also if need be along with the cordon they would establish an opon the highest ground available where they could provide overwatch andcoordinate all indirect fire support finally we always took medical team usually full atls team this would consist of medical provider either doctor or physician assistant and two for official use only 141oef handbook iiimedics on call on most major operations for any casualties sustained they were also great cmo asset the main effort in diminimus health care for trying togain the favor of local elders with children who could use medical attention mounted presence patrols these patrols were some of our most effective every day we conducted two mounted daytime presence patrols and one mountednighttime presence patrol these could coincide with other patrols or operationsbut many of them were simply patrols in and of themselves during daylight weran two at vehicles uparmored hmmwvs with one mk19 automatic grenadelauncher and one m2 50caliber machine gun these patrols showed the populationthat we were present and had control of their valley while also providing plentyof eyes on my ao it also allowed the young at leaders section leaders platoonleaders and platoon sergeants chance to plan and lead their own patrols theyplanned fires and shifted priority targets stopped and searched suspicious vehiclesand provided intelligence in their debriefings that helped us plan future operations we learned at night to roll an entire platoon because two vehicles simply did not provide enough firepower if two vehicles get split in an ambush theybecome completely ineffective we learned this lesson the hard way on 1 june2003 one twotruck section of at2 was conducting night presence toward thebermel bazaar when their two vehicles drove into near ambush the enemyinitiated with rocketpropelled grenades rpgs and pk machine guns the atsection returned fire as each vehicle drove out of the kill zone on the fastest routepossible unfortunately the fastest route for the lead vehicle was to drive forwardand the fastest route for the trailing vehicle was to back up once out of the killzone neither vehicle could effectively fire upon the enemy location because theyfeared stray 50caliber and mk19 rounds might hit the other at truck worse yetone of the trucks had two tires damaged and assistance from anyone else wewound up bringing the damaged truck back to the firebase and marrying up the leadtruck with qrf force the strongest lesson we learned that night was to roll aminimum of four gun trucks during the hours of darkness so they can providemutual support this lesson paid huge dividends eight days later on the night of 9 june 2003 the four guntruck patrol by at2 moving out to exfiltrate dismountedambush identified movement in an area near recent enemy activity one of thegunners identified weapons the platoon formed themselves into an lshape bysending the lead section along the wadi that started route saturn while the trailsection remained on route chevy the platoon made simultaneous contact with theal qaeda one 50caliber gunner initiated fire at the same time an qaedaoperative fired his rpg after the firefight what remained on the battlefield werefour dead qaeda who had been camping in listening postobservation postlpop with eyes on the firebase and equipment such as antitank mines anddetonation cord to set up an iedinitiated ambush this night we were entirelysuccessful because at2 had enough assets to surround and overwhelm the enemy ambush the ambush is simple standard infantry operation that proved very effective we usually executed these with one rifle squad often augmented withone m240b machine gun and forward observer fo with platoon leader incharge when conducting these patrols we cut corners executing them exactlythe way we were taught in ranger school and the infantry officer basic coursethese patrols would usually take up full night for clandestine infiltrationestablishment breakdown and exfiltration there are two keys to conducting 142 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedambush patrols during lowintensity conflict the first is the trickiness of the rules of engagement roe and the second is effectively infiltrating without being seen the roe in afghanistan and especially in the bermel valley allowed us to shoot first if we could clearly identify hostile intent therefore ambush patrols wereeffective the platoon leader would be required to make the call based on hisknowledge of the people terrain past enemy activity and traffic patterns platoonleader was used on every squadsized mission such as this because there might be adifficult call to be made about whether or not to engage obviously not everyvehicle or person moving at night was hostile this was proven by searchingnumerous vehicles stopped by nighttime at patrols therefore positivelyidentifying vehicles transporting enemy personnel was nearly impossible the onlyhypothetical situation where permission could be granted to open fire would be ifarmed qaeda operatives were seen brandishing weapons from the backs oftrucks or if highly suspicious highend blackedout sportutility vehicle suvconvoy was moving through the area this reinforces the need for unified c2 in theao so other government agencies special operations forces amf and anapersonnel would not move through the valley without squad on an ambush lineknowing of their movement to avoid fratricide most qaeda we faced howeverinfiltrated and operated on foot making positive identification at night much easierhowever depending on terrain enemy activity and ability to positively identifyhostile intent an ambush patrol might become nothing more than largesizedovernight op clandestine infiltration is extremely difficult for squadplus element in this environment the bermel valley offers limited cover and concealment alsogiven the unconventional warfare waged by the enemy we had to contend withenemy sympathizers identifying our movement and communicating it we alwaysassumed that when patrol rolled out of the firebase gate someone would count thenumber of vehicles estimate the number of personnel and send the message out toour enemies working under this assumption we planned our infiltrations verymeticulously this included rolling with two squads at night along with the atplatoon the squad that would actually be conducting the ambush would be spreadout among the two cargo hmmwvs and the empty seats of the at vehicles thisway enemy sympathizers would only be able to communicate and confirm that fourgun trucks and two cargo trucks full of soldiers exited the firebase on patrol andwere still patrolling around the valley this also allowed for much more reactiverolling qrf that could act as the finishing force once the ambush squad fixed theenemy rolling insertions false insertions and insertions in concealed terrain werealso key to clandestine infiltration specific intelligence from higher that an enemy convoy was moving on specific route at specific time never came these patrols were better for simplykeeping eyes and firepower out to deny the enemy freedom of maneuver in the aoeven when an ambush was seen by watchful enemy eye it let them know wemeant business and probably made them think twice about infiltrating on keyroutes clearing missions there are two types of clearing systematically clearing group of compounds and simply clearing empty terrain although we cleared number ofcompounds these were always major operations and usually intelligencedrivenclearing empty terrain is very simple to plan but tiresome to execute suchoperations do however often yield very good intelligence these were dismounted for official use only 143oef handbook iiimissions to walk patch of ground looking for clues of enemy activity as for any mission we had to plan for fire support casualty evacuation and qrf the chanceof actually finding any enemy on these missions was slim as we could be easilyseen as we entered the area and as we approached however in an attempt to getaway quickly the enemy could leave behind equipment or evidence of theirpresence in addition when we cleared areas that were frequently used by theenemy it familiarized the soldiers and leaders with ground that they might have tofight on one day and like any other show of force it denies the enemy that piece ofterrain we quickly learned why nobody lived or trafficked the mountains leadinginto pakistan one trip up them in body armor was plenty static observation postssnipers these were among the most effective operations we conducted the best way to find the enemy is to physically seethem moving when they believe they are not being watched by the end of ourtenure at shkin we had largesized scout and lrsd element that we rotatedevery 72 hours to maintain continuous coverage on our two most used areas aroundlosano ridge and in the vicinity of route saturn we also used infantry squads in48hour operations on one occasion i even had the privilege of employing anitalian target acquisition detachment tad each had its strengths and weaknesses using rifle squad was effective especially when scout or lrs assets are not available but that approach had its weaknesses sustainability was usually nomore than 48 hours also the squad was cumbersome and had tendency toreceive asoft compromise discovery by neutral force such as child villageror farmer they were also difficult to infiltrate clandestinely due to the size of therifle squad however it could usually cover more ground by splitting up into threeseparate elements each fire team would occupy its own op and the squad leaderfo radiotelephone operator and platoon leader would occupy separate c2 opthe individual fire teams would maintain shortrange communications with thesquad and platoon leaders while the c2 op would maintain communications withthe firebase one of the most effective uses of the squad lpop was thestaybehind lpop whenever we conducted major operation in village either cmo mission or clearing operation we would try to leave astaybehind it is much easier to infiltrate small force when rolling in with such alarge fighting force besides many villages say they dont want to accept your helpbecause the qaeda would come after them staybehind ops could find out whoif anybody did the qaeda are curious about why we come to the village andthey want to gather intelligence about us even if the squad receives softcompromise and everyone knows covert lpop was in place all is not lostbecause it makes the enemy feel we are always watching and it makes the villagersfeel either safe or reluctant to assist the enemy battalion scouts and snipers were smaller more adept element they were able to effectively stay out for 72 hours at time and could infiltrate much betterlocations additionally in our battalion the sniper teams are intermixed with thebattalion scouts so often i could send out team to conduct reconnaissance andthey would also have the additional capability to take precision shot using an m24or barrett 50caliber sniper rifle of course precision shots are crucial during alowintensity conflict due to the requirement to minimize collateral damage scoutsand snipers are usually better at planning for the missions and better atbackbriefing than the rifle squads the drawback is that they are not an effectivefighting force by themselves so we made up for that with responsive indirect firepriority targets and with dedicated qrf 144 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedlrsds effectively able to sustain themselves for 96 120 hours were even better suited than the battalion scouts continuous coverage became necessaryin one particularly volatile area so i used my lrsd team much more like scoutteam they split their sixman team the sixth man was their medic into twothreeman teams one led by the team leader and the other by the assistant teamleader their planning methods and backbriefs were even better than those of thescouts they were able to send photos back to us using tactical satellite datamessages while the team was in the hidesite and they made extensive use of adigital camera for backbriefs similar to the scouts however they are not aneffective fighting force by themselves the only compromise to either the scout orlrsd teams came on 29 june 2003 when the lrs team received hardcompromise they were engaged by the enemy using an automatic weapon fromabout 600 meters out of course we had priority 105mm artillery target laid onfor protection and although it was not accurate the enemy stopped shooting andevacuated back to pakistan once the artillery began landing in their vicinity wewere easily able to extract the lrsd team with the qrf and sustained usinjuries for short period of time i also had the opportunity to employ an italian target acquisition team very similar to lrsd they were able to sustain themselvesfor much longer period of time than the assets at our battalion level they alsohad amazing optics and camera capability their thermal sites were much clearerthan ours and with much greater magnification they had digital cameras that couldtake what looked like closeup photo from over kilometer away we were gladto use to the fullest any advanced reconnaissance asset we were given sensitivesite exploitations many sensitivesite exploitation missions are required some are intelligencedriven others result from contact that requires alater search of the surrounding area still others come from need to denysanctuary or discovery of compound that looks suspicious the sse or cordonand knock as i heard the 4th infantry division call them in operation iraqifreedom has its own art form it must be planned as though it is the last strongholdof the qaeda osama bin ladin is inside and they will fight to the death thecompound must be entirely surrounded so one can escape we always used themajoroperation template discussed earlier outer cordon of amf inner cordonusing at vehicles and some infantry fotacp team on the highest observationpoint engineers working for team search and the ca the tht and i ready to dothe talking we expected to do soft breach meaning we knock on the door andthey let us in but we planned hard or deliberate breach meaning we eitherbreak or blow the door off its hinges if necessary we found that the best method was to knock on the door and ask for the man of the house bring him outside and explain to him that we were going tosearch his quarters we would tell him to bring all of the men outside and move allwomen and children into one room thus showing respect for the women we madesure he understood that our soldiers would assume the rooms were empty and if achild was left in the room he or she risked getting shot we gave him just enoughtime to accomplish this task and then the search team searched the men first toensure they were not threat when documenting the mens names we didnt askan individual just for his own name we took him aside and asked him for the othermens names as well in country like afghanistan where identification is easilyforged this is crucial for finding blacklist personnel who are blending into thepopulation then we searched the first empty room and marked it we moved all of for official use only 145oef handbook iiithe women and children from the room where they first gathered into this newly searched room acm sympathizers or anyone with something to hide mightattempt to put it into the women and childrens room thinking that room will not besearched when all the women and children were in their new location the searchteam went back into the room where they gathered first and the female searcherbegan searching the women and children we always ensured that she had two largemen as sentries standing outside the room to give her backup mainly to leteveryone know that if they interfered with the female searcher the other two wouldcome in buttstroking or shooting if necessary also if man was attempting tohide in burka womens clothing covering the whole body including the face we dealt harshly with him everything was searched very thoroughly we used theengineers or eods metal detector to search for false walls and floors we searchedon the roofs and down wells eod robots are great for this now here is the key piece dealing with this family based on what was found if we found nothing and it was routine search we brought in teamvillage we told the man we wanted to talk to him about things going on in theregion and apologized for the search of his compound but reassure him that it isstandard us army procedure before sitting down to talk to the head of ahousehold if we had ca package such as blankets school supplies psyopradios or halal meals food prepared following muslim religious guidelines tooffer now this was great time to distribute them the locals would not mindgetting searched and might invite us to search them again if they receive somethingfor it it is best to leave on very good terms making the head of the compound feelhe was selected not because we wanted to search his compound but because i whowas in effect the local warlord wanted to talk to him and seek his opinion thiswould place him in position of honor amongst his village rather than one ofdishonor for having his compound searched of course if we did find something the situation was different we had to judge based on their cooperation we definitely confiscated any contraband wealways allowed one ak47 or enfield rifle and one magazine per man in thecompound excess weapons weapons larger than an ak47 and excess ammunitionwere usually confiscated with nothing further sometimes with promise to returnthe ak if they brought proper documentation or better yet information about the alqaeda to the firebase this is why it was so important to tag all confiscatedequipment to ensure that it would get back to its proper owner if that promise wasmade items such as armorpiercing ammunition routinely used and distributed bythe qaeda rpgs and any iedmaking material immediately aroused suspicionand usually meant placing under custody the head of the house and bringing himback for further questioning if they were uncooperative and had contraband teamvillage did not get involved and the village would receive nothing vehicle checkpoints vehicle checkpoints vcps are an excellent way to prevent the acms and qaeda freedom of movement throughout the ao they can bevery elaborate with pashtun signs cones and concertina wire but we relied on avery simple vcp that could be established and broken down easily locals andacms alike knew what we were doing and respected the rules we established thekey to remember is that within 30 minutes of establishing vcp the acms knewit was there and any highvalue targets hvts moving through the ao would finda bypass within 90 minutes of our being there everyone would know we werethere and would have found bypass we were better off establishing for shortperiods of time and then moving to an alternate location when we had the assets 146 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedwe established our primary vcp and then established secondary vcp on an alternate route when we had recon assets such as scouts lrs or predator uavwe used them to see what was happening on the route prior to vehiclesapproaching we found that vehicles in the outgoing lane would often warn thoseapproaching of our existence as when conducting an sse we searched everyperson and every compartment of every vehicle if large commercial truck had abig cargo we sometimes went so far as to have them download if we could notdetermine that nothing was being smuggled here it was crucial that our lowestprivate knew our blackgrey list and could identify hvts on site or upon hearingtheir names here also we used the technique of not only asking the males theirnames but also asking them to identify the others by name to see if someone istrying to hide his identity when we had female searchers we used them acmsare more likely to hide in burkas when traveling then when stationary we alwaysplanned for pursuit force in case suspicious vehicle saw our vcp and attemptedto escape i will elaborate more under the section use of amf why we usuallyrelied on amf for our pursuit force but the bottom line is that if someone isobviously trying to get your attention he might be trying to lure you away so thetrue hvt whether person or munitions stock can use the route you are blockingor to lure you into an ambush use of quickreaction force qrf is absolutely essential we found that our own qrf force along with aerial qrf and xcas airborne nondedicated casproviding protection in the theater rather than simply being reactionary force inthe event of an emergency became our finishing force in the standard scenario afinding force locates the enemy they fix them with artillery or direct fires so theycan be finished by the qrf force that arrives at any given moment we had oneinfantry squad one lieutenant one fo and one at section available to launch fromthe firebase in five minutes we also usually had second qrf force ready tolaunch within 20 to 30 minutes if lucky enough to have the c2 relationship ienjoyed the company commander should always launch with qrf because thesituation could develop so that commander on the ground is needed to makedecisions on every mission we calculated the length of time for reaction if contact was made and then prepositioned the qrf or other force in the bermel valley weoften prepositioned the qrf force at the amf border checkpoint next to angoradda this not only helped to shorten the amount of time it would take for the qrfto reinforce forwardpositioned troops but it also helped show force forward andsupport for our amf the position was hard and reinforced with good observationwhere our soldiers could use their night observation equipment to identifymovement use of afghan militia forces i have the utmost respect for the afghan people as fighting force i look forward to future where we can fight alongside the afghannational army as coalition force having grown up knowing nothing but conflictthese men have become some of the bravest and most hardened fighters imaginablewith stunning sense of pride they took great pride in leading all joint patrolsalthough they wore helmets or body armor and drove softskin vehicles toyota hilux 4x4s they would take other position than the lead earning thejoking title from many of my soldiers of afghan mine finders the afghanmilitia knew the risks they were taking and they took them willingly i once sawmy border guard commander stomp his foot on suspected mines and then get in histoyota 4x4 and drive very fast across the suspected mined patch of road for official use only 147oef handbook iiipresumably in the hopes that he would outrun the blast like all other forces we used them for their strengths but knew their limitations amf led every joint mounted patrol and most major operations they did this of course to fulfill their role as mine finders they also knew the ground betterand could more easily spot something that was out of place or suspicious havingthem lead became very tricky at times because to maintain opsec we would givethem only brief versions of our operations orders at the last possible moment andthe lead driver usually did not know our destination we developed standardoperating procedure in which the lead american vehicle maintainedcommunications with the amf lead vehicle through radio and an interpreteralso the amf did not have night vision equipment so an amfled night patrolwas nightmare as they kept turning on their headlights giving away our positionand blinding our night observation devices the amf were raised in society where conquering forces are expected to take loot so when we could help it we did not use amf to search if we had nochoice we ensured that the search took place under the direct supervision of ourown soldiers had we used amf alone the locals would have complained that theystole property disrespected the women and elders etc member of rival tribecould have made claims against our amf of thieving or disrespect and we wouldhave had way to disprove it and even if the amf were to do everything rightthe locals would rather submit to americans than to what they identify as rivaltribe when we rolled into town we used the amf for our outer cordon they would quickly surround the village and stop anyone from escaping our amf weregreat at climbing mountains quickly we would roll onto group of compoundssurrounded by hills and after one word to my amf commander i could look upand see one amf soldier standing on each hilltop i would never dream of sendingmy own troops up there without communications by themselves with heavy bodyarmor to climb up those hills but the amf were great for it also if we had arunner ie if we went into village and saw someone leaving quickly in the otherdirection i would send amf out to chase them they would chase them down andbring them back from wherever i would not do that with americans withoutcommunications supporting fires etc and by the time i put the complex americanpatrol together for the chase the guy would be long gone and blended into thecrowd this alone provided an amazing capability to the battlefield that could notbe had with strictly coalition forces training the amf was key task difficult at times but very rewarding my smallunit leaders and young soldiers really enjoyed training these hardened foreignfighters on the rifle range or on smallunit operations the mutual respect and trustforged in training and proven sidebyside in battle was awesome similar to the amf but much better however was the afghan national army in my opinion this is one of the greatest programs going on in afghanistanone issue with the amf or any indigenous militia force that commanderneeds to recognize is that they have local and tribal loyalties afghanistan ingeneral is conglomeration of tribes and warlords who constantly fight oneanother in their history they have banded together only to oppose outside invadingforces like the russians almost every afghan has much stronger allegiance tofamily tribe region or warlord than to the country of afghanistan my amf wereall tajic or orgune this helped because they were not from my ao and had 148 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedgreat distrust for almost all tribes in the bermel valley especially the wasiris harote and karote prior to my arrival all of the wasiri amf quit at the commandof their tribal elder using tajic afm however resulted in many complaints fromthe locals the ana however were enlisted from all over afghanistan and trainedand employed in various regions they had group loyalty to anything butafghanistan and president karzai when they came into town cleanshaven andwellequipped the locals thought they were foreign fighters they could be trustedto search locals and there would not be the complaints we heard about the tajicamf the only difficulty we met was degree of jealousy between the amf andana when we had chance to employ both forces civil military operations team village concept and operations team village was an expression we learned from our predecessors the red devils of 1504 parachute infantryregiment it usually referred to group of personnel tasked with conducting acmo function within larger operation many times team village was the maineffort as many missions were executed solely for cmo purposes often teamvillage was mix of civil affairs and psychological operations at minimumusually the senior infantry commander would also participate in the cmo functionof the operation but always focused on the security and the overall operation otherassets within team village could be but were not limited to medics with healthcare provider to administer diminimus health care military intelligenceprofessionals and security personnel classifying forces by function made it easy for everyone to understand their task and purpose and where they fit into the operation we usually had teamsecure under the leadership of the at platoon leader team clear or team searchunder the leadership of the rifle platoon leader team overwatch under the fso orfsnco and team village under the c2 of the head civil affairs or psyoppersonnel also team fires when we displaced mortar although both ca andpsyop vehemently claimed to be highly specialized each can do the others jobsand they work well together we really never knew exactly which way mission would take us there were missions where we planned to search suspected acm compound ready toconduct deliberate breach blow the door off and come in shooting but then wefound the occupants to be hospitable and friendly and the compound to be cleanhere shifting the focus from an aggressive mission to cmo opportunity acting asthough the purpose of our mission was to seek the counsel of the head of thecompound and also to provide humanitarian assistance package helped win usallies in the bermel valley being able to shift focus and win friends ultimatelyhelped us pacify the region also once while we were conducting diminimushealth care operation the villagers probably pleased with the health care that theyhad just received gave us information about an acm we were looking for wesearched his compound took him prisoner and sent him up to bagrahm and on toguantanamo in every case having the flexibility to go either way to have afriendly mission go hostile or to make friends out of hostile mission wascrucial even in strictly friendly cmo operations the combat arms guys always had to set the conditions first the team village commander who often outranked mewhen we had cata at the firebase had to understand that he was waiting in the for official use only 149oef handbook iiiwings for the goahead from the infantry platoon leader that all is secure and he was cleared to proceed with team village operations also depending on themission an infantry squad might be tasked to provide security for team village ifwe planned to distribute large humanitarian assistance package or providediminimus health care we made sure the locals lined up in an orderly fashion anddid not become unruly simply throwing box of blankets into crowd could havegotten someone injured or killed and then we would have lost the favor of thatpersons family by the way it is amazing the respect afghans have for whiteengineer tape by simply laying out do not cross lines of white engineer tape onthe ground we could achieve an orderly line in time meetings with the elders working with foreign culture requires working within that cultures norms in afghanistan the tribal elders are in charge each villageand each compound has at least one patriarch who is the recognized head of thehousehold these people have lot of influence within their tribe if they tell thevillage to aid the qaeda the village will likewise if they tell the village to aidthe coalition they will all do that as well when going to the village we alwaysasked to speak to the elders they would usually ask us to sit down to shura or meeting they might offer little food or at least drink of chai but seldom full meal here we had to simply grin and bear the camels milk in our tea afghanchai by the way has so much sugar in it that it is almost like syrup on one occasion the elders even brought out blanket for us to sit on picnic style oursnack was provided by boy who climbed up the apricot tree we were sitting underand shook it until apricots landed all around us as with major operations we began by showing force for all we knew village might be hiding osama bin ladin so we were prepared to fight we sealedoff the village quickly if our sole purpose is to meet with the elders as newcommanderwarlord in the region it is important to take time to go to each villagewithin the ao to get feel for each of the elders there once we had the villagesecured we simply started asking around for the elders telling them we wished tohave meeting and before we knew it they would have meeting room clearedthere are chairs in afghanistan outside the firebase so we usually sat onblankets they respected the force we brought to their village and were usually bevery happy to learn that we came only to talk to them rather than to search througheverybodys home showing that we wished to meet with them reinforced theirstatus as the heads of the village we could further reinforce the elders status bydistributing packages through them to the needy members of their village once everything was set we started the introductions letting them know that i was the one in charge of all of the security of the valley while the civilaffairs guy was there to find out what projects they needed help with we usuallyengaged in good dialogue starting off with talk of future cmo projects such asbuilding wells schools and hospitals we found out their concerns and then at theend asked if they have seen any qaeda or if they knew of any qaedamovement through the ao we made them understand that ngos and otherhumanitarian assistance would not arrive if they deemed the area to be unsafe if wehad asked those questions first they would have initially denied everything wefirst had to earn their trust we seldom gathered much intelligence from the eldersat first meeting but when we followed through they were likely to come at laterdate to the firebase to give us information oneonone we were always careful toextend them that invitation 150 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedduring the meetings it did help to show our muscle we had security personnel waiting either behind us or just outside the room where they can be seenor at least make their presence felt they do not let anyone in unless they hadsearched them and then looked to for nod of approval other acts of bothstrength and kindness were helpful once during meeting my at platoon leadercalled in on the radio that they had stopped vehicle that had two men with twoak47s attempting to enter the village while we were there i asked the villageelders whether the men should be allowed in or seized this showed the elders thati had strong hand but that i would trust their judgment help their friends andhurt their enemies also i usually used preplanned cas for major operationshaving the cas conduct low pass usually scared the hell out of everyone in thevillage the elders would beg not to let them continue i would then call mytacp on the radio and tell him not to let the cas conduct any more low passesonce again this showed that i had the power to command the airplanes but alsothat i would heed the elders request and call them off while the meeting was going on one squad with some engineers would roam around looking simply for anything suspicious or anything that looked like itwas recently dug in when the village received early warning of our arrival theinfantry platoon leader would conduct some minor winning hearts and mindsoutside the big meeting by passing out candy and other small things to the kidsthe best presents we could ever give afghan children were polaroid photo ofthemselves they had probably never seen their own pictures let alone owned onewhile he was working the crowd outside the humint guys were working rightalongside him all the intelligence that came out of the elders meeting would beprovided later to the firebase officerincharge in the backbrief the team villagecommander and i would attend the professional humint guys were much betterused outside talking to the younger men who were not important enough to go tothe village elders meeting but wanted to make themselves feel important by talkingto the americans while the elders were not watching often the picture painted bythem was much different from the story we got from the elders meetings with the regional governors we usually had sitdown meeting once month with the regional governor this reinforced his status as the legitimate headof the region working under president karzai these were often tricky because tomeet with him we had to go into the bermel bazaar where we would besurrounded not only by my men but also by his bermel police the regionalgovernor managed and controlled his own police force all of them appeared to beabout 17 years old and all were very thin although we didnt feel very safe withthem around carrying ak47s we knew they would never challenge our forces inthe valley and they looked to us to be their ally so we showed we had the powerwe would seal off the place and have our security personnel stop anyone whoentered the room and look for nod of approval from we could then showgood faith by letting the young bermel policeman serve us chai and peanuts with his ak47 strapped to him showing that we trusted the governor and his men butcould disarm his police force with only word often the focus of these meetings was request from the governor for arms ammunition and other assistance i was very limited in my ability to provideanything to him the governor saw as his direct link to the us militarycommand in afghanistan but most of his concerns were with matters that involvedthe support he received from the afghan central government for official use only 151oef handbook iiione issue with this regional governor is that although his region included the entire bermel valley his only secure stronghold was at the bermel bazaar thiswas not to say he could not exert influence throughout the valley as much of thecommerce of the region centered around the bermel bazaar and many tribal andvillage elders often went to the bermel bazaar to meet and discuss issues hosting shura our overall cmo operation within the valley depended on coordination among all villages and tribes since many of the benefits of us orngo assistance would go to aid the entire population of the valley this couldbecome very difficult when the karote dont trust the wasiris and vice versaour repeated theme was that ngos were afraid to work in the bermel valleybecause there was too much qaeda activity one of the best methods of pacifyingthe entire valley was to host shura meeting of all the tribal elders weconducted these both at the governors headquarters and at our own firebase conducting shura at the governors quarters helped to establish the hierarchy from the regional governor to the tribal elders the biggest problem wasthat we would get more participation from the governors tribe than from the othertribes we were more successful hosting the event at our own firebase because itrepresented neutral ground for all elders involved another technique was to hostthe shura with all the elders and not invite the governor that way we were likely toget much more candid talk from the various elders it was also good technique forfinding out if the governors actions matched his talk or if there were problems withcorruption among the governors police force shuras were always dicey as the rival tribes would want to begin by sending accusations back and forth against one another sometimes it was hard to rememberthat my team village commander and i were in charge of the meeting and thatworking together for the mutual benefit of all was the goal shuras were always necessary step because the last thing we wanted in our cmo campaign was to makeone tribe or village feel that we favored their rivals we had to use such rivalry toour advantage making each tribe or village feel that they would receive the mosthumanitarian assistance by working the most with us and by providing us with thebest information leading to captured or more likely killed qaeda meetings with the pakistanis in the bermel valley the greatest threat came from qaeda who seemed to have both sanctuary in pakistan and freedom ofmovement along the borders there were actually three different borders identifiedthe nima line the durrand line and the line the pakistanis claimed all of themwere within one or two hundred meters of one another in general the border wasnot clearly marked with anything manmade but was distinguished by largemountainous region the pakistanis of course claimed the high ground of theborder and manned outposts along key overwatch positions many of the localsactually had little concept of either afghanistan or pakistan or of borders theybelieved they all lived in wasiristan since wasiris lived on both sides of theborder and if they were willing to hike the mountains could move back and forthfreely within the entire valley the only major crossing not blocked by naturalmountain barrier was at the main pakistani bazaar in angor adda angor adda wasso well known for its qaeda activity that time magazine published story about it entitled qaeda town prior to my arrival the pakis left security of the entire region to their frontier troops the local southwasiri scouts sws like many of the amf and 152 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedother regional militia forces these troops had more loyalty to the local leaders than to pakistan as country we always assumed that many members of the sws wereopenly supporting the qaeda when i was in afghanistan in december 2002learning the ropes under our sister brigade the 505 pir panther brigade lost theirfirst paratrooper to qaeda right there in the bermel valley shortly after thatincident another american soldier was shot in the head by south wasiri scoutafter meeting with them the sws had excellent observation throughout thebermel valley advanced optics including night vision and communications gear itseemed that whenever one of our night patrols left the firebase fires would springup along the border at the sws outposts my first formal meeting with the pakistani border guard commanders occurred within minutes of my arrival to assume command the battalion xorushed up to and began cutting off my name tapes you will be known ascaptain dave i wont let you make the same mistake your predecessor and i madeand let them know your full name apparently after the first few of thesemeetings nationallevel intelligence assets reported that the qaeda knew thenames of the xo and the previous bravo company commander and the xo didntwant to live in fear of retaliation against my family back home arriving at the angor adda border checkpoint was always very checkpoint charleyish as we pulled up with plenty of us military and amf toassume security overwatching the pakistani positions as our small delegationwalked the demilitarized zone up to the gates of pakistan and only we walked in apparently before my arrival these meetings had been very tense as was the relationship with the sws luckily things started to change from withinpakistan starting near the time of my arrival the sws commander was removedwe were told at first he was unable to attend the meeting and later that he wastransferred pakistani regular army commanders arrived to take over operationsand many paki regular troops began to assist the sws with manning the bordercheckpoints meetings were always cordial it was obvious that the pakistanis were more advanced and westernized as we sat on chairs and ate excellent food especially thecurry the key is to work together but not to share too much information wealways talked about our mortars as we didnt want them to know that we hadreplaced them with artillery our mortars came up frequently as many outpostsclaimed that we shot harassing fires into pakistan we exchanged maps so theycould identify what we recognized as the nima line for the border and they wouldshare the locations of their new border outposts so we would not bump into themwith patrol we also had specific thurya cell phones that we would use to contacteach other to give cordial alert when we were in firefight or if we were shootingartillery near the border as much as i did not trust the sws i did trust the pakistani regulars their arrival was much needed very recently they have proven their resolve against theal qaeda by conducting numerous raids in the area against qaeda strongholdsand capturing hvts such as nik mohammed unfortunately as in other cases ofunconventional warfare and lowintensity conflict we never knew if we were beingwatched by an outpost manned by pakistani regulars who were loyal to generalmusharrif or by the sws who might have other loyalties but pakistan is definitelymoving in the right direction in the bermel valley for official use only 153oef handbook iiiconducting diminimus health care operations these operations were awesome for winning the hearts and minds of the locals the doctors medics andphysician assistants enjoyed the contribution they made to the locals like othercmo operations these were always accomplished first by securing the village andthen telling the village elders of our intent we always had line of patients foreverything from mild bumps bruises and stuffy noses to more serious injuries andillnesses these could be treated from the backs of the hmmwvs but they werebetter done in secure compound arranged by the elders also it was key to have afemale medic available to treat the women and children otherwise they would beeither reluctant or forbidden to seek medical help and they were usually the oneswho needed it most as always we respected the local pecking order ie an elderwith minor injury would expect to be seen before child with malaria if we didset up station for females and children we ensured that it was behind closed doorsfor their privacy also we always made sure our security squad was present andthat all patients were kept orderly and were searched prior to entering although ibelieve the villagers would be able to spot terrorist act long before we could andwould either tell us about it or act very scared and suspicious and then leave these operations were great for generating intelligence for later use many people were so happy to receive health care from us that they became very willingto assist in our fight against the qaeda also we had oneonone privateopportunities to communicate with people who were very grateful for our helpingthem or literally saving their lives running firebase clinic this proved very effective as well and was not nearly as difficult or as dangerous as going out to conduct diminimus health careoperations we ran clinic twice week in the mornings inside the amf perimeterbut not within the firebase this also proved to demonstrate our help and supportfor the local population and helped bring us intelligence as people could comeunder the guise of seeking health care also they felt that having come to us forhelp information was their only means to pay us back using civil military operations to help gather intelligence anyone who is strictly combat arms soldier and doesnt see or feel the need for cmo or howcmo can help is unbelievably mistaken even those not convinced of the mantra ofwinning the hearts and minds must appreciate the most effective use of cmointelligence gathering many ca psyop and intelligence soldier will contendthat cmo personnel are not intelligence gatherers that intelligence gathering isnot their mission and they are 100 percent correct but tactical commander cangreatly benefit by gathering intelligence while helping cmo soldiers accomplishtheir mission while tactical humint team or an intelligence analyst must not beconfused with cmo personnel cmo operations do greatly assist in commandersintelligencegathering campaign by providing allies ca and psyop personnel dotheir respective jobs and humint folks and analysts do theirs if the combatarmscommander secures the cmo operations works with the team village commandertoward the overall cmo campaign and works with analysts to help develop theintelligence preparation of the battlefield he can arrive at the same success weachieved at firebase shkin and the bermel valley cmo helps develop intelligence in various ways first and foremost cmo operations are ripe with opportunity for intelligence gathering whether theintelligence comes in the form of humint sigint or clandestine observationwhenever we conducted major operation into village the enemy and the local 154center for army lessons learnedpopulation were interested during our movement and operation sigint could spike while in the village once we had secured it and established the friendlyoperation many villagers were willing to provide humint the team villagecommander and i would simply take notes and provide debrief to the analystafterwards on the content of the village elders meeting our tactical humint team tht would work the crowd outside to gather intelligence from the young men who were not invited to the elders meetingduring diminimus health care operations locals would be willing to provideintelligence in private during or after receiving care also during our earlyoperations we received the line that the village would not want any humanitarianassistance because the qaeda would retaliate if they accepted help from theamericans here hidden staybehind observation post would prove effective forseeing exactly who went into the village after our departure the second and more longterm impact of cmo on intelligence gathering is that of developing friendly relations with all the inhabitants of the region so theywould come to the firebase and provide unsolicited information setting up venuefor them to come or an excuse as was sometimes needed if someone wanted toprovide intelligence without letting his acquaintances know provided an excellentsource of humint collection this is why elders and others were always welcometo come to the firebase to discuss current and potential future cmo operationsand also why we ran firebase clinic the dividends of our combined combat arms and cmo campaign in the bermel valley were obvious on 22 june 2003 when local who had come to thefirebase for shura told us about qaedaemplaced mines in the road we followed him to the location dismounting before we reached the suspected minesite we found the qaeda ambush unprepared and initiated an attack killing orwounding the entire patrol gathering more intelligence about the qaedastechniques and walking away with friendly casualties instead of driving into acoordinated iedrpg ambush as qaeda had intended conclusion the conclusion of this paper is simple we broke the mold and proved effective i hope others can learn from our success our special forces have done an amazing job in the global war on terrorism i dont know if anyone truly appreciates exactly what the 5th specialforces group sfg actually accomplished during the liberation of afghanistanthe afghans are fierce violent warring people who fight amongst themselvesand their tribes and band together only to oppose an outside invader like therussians in 10 years the russians were unable to defeat afghanistan the 5thspecial forces group was able to take afghanistan in matter of weeks becausethey gave the victory to the people rather that being seen as an outside invaderthey were seen as big brother liberating force helping the northern alliancebuilding on past assistance given to the mujahadden during the russian resistanceand showing our support for them had we gone in with lot of strength ratherthan with the finesse shown by the 5th sfg we would have taken many morecasualtiesoef handbook iii for official use only 155however our special forces are small element and they are spread thin their traditional role of foreign internal defense has been assumed by conventionalforces throughout iraq training the iraqi civil defense corps now it is time tomove lowintensity conflict and unconventional warfare over to the conventionalside not only because there are not enough special forces to go around but alsobecause conventional forces have more assets to find fix and finish the enemy fighting lowintensity conflict at the smallunitcompanysized level has proved to be very effective company commander much like an ateamcommander can really get to know personalities terrain and enemy in an area hecan engage the population and have much better lasting effect than that of abattalion that air assaults in clears compounds for few days and then leaveswhat i have provided is only brief and very rough lessons learned for futurecompany operations such as these by refocusing our efforts at the company levelwith these types of assets and these types of operations we can make tremendousimpact in the global war on terror as an epilogue note my company was later tasked with securing the enormous 15000man logistical supply area anaconda in iraq here onnumerous occasions soldiers under my command while guarding the entry controlpoints ecps watched and recorded on our forward looking infra red or bigbrother system enemy forces conducting operations launching rockets or mortarsor setting up ieds it burned us that we did not have the assets or availability toengage these forces our mission was to guard the ecps the tank unit colocatedwith us owned the ground outside if that area were the bermel valley we couldhave fixed them with our artillery and finished them with our qrf cas and aerialqrf we could have engaged the elders of the villages and the compoundssurrounding the enemy activity to help us stop the militants we could have done somuch but there was not one company commander with that kind of responsibilityand those kinds of assets to deal with that kind of situation there on the ground iniraq the overall mission was so cumbersome that it was ineffective usually theoutcome was report higher passing off of the dvd recording of the enemyactivity and report of compound clearing with nothing found later the tacticsthat we b3504 pir employed at firebase shkin should be the model for winningthis war in afghanistan iraq and wherever else we may go once the conflictreaches the lowintensity phase 156 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedannex ii introduction tragically and all too often soldiers die or are critically injured as result of the negligent discharge of weapons compounding this tragedy is the fact that many ofthese deaths and injuries are preventible invariably the unintentional or negligentdischarge is result of failure to exercise the degree of care considered reasonableunder the circumstances soldiers who know and are trained to standard fail to follow the standard because of attitude overconfidence andor haste leaders who know the standard do notenforce it deficiencies in direct unit command and higher command supervisiontechniques all contribute to the problem leaders must be ready willing and able toenforce army standards training shortcomings also add to the problem soldiers are often not trained to standard because of insufficient incorrect or nonexistent training on given taskunclear impractical or nonexistent standards and procedures can be blamed formany negligent discharge incidents as the following article points out there is simple solution to this problem except through direct involvement of the chain of command starting at the first linesupervisor leaders must ensure strict adherence to the proper unloading andclearing procedures lawrence h saul col fadirector center for army lessons learned accidental or negligent discharge by sergeant first class raymond hamilton ground accident investigator us army safety center thousands of our soldiers have been and continue to be deployed to iraq afghanistan bosnia and kosovo not to mention korea and other locationsthroughout the world this being said i wonder how we as fighting force havemissed out on combat soldiering combat soldiering is defined as using or developing skills peculiar to combat including receiving instructions or training in such skills this excludes classroomtraining i am taking great leap of faith and placing weapons handlingprocedures to include loading unloading weapons firing muzzle awareness andweapons maintenance all under combat soldiering in 17 years of combat arms training and deployments i have been bombarded with training on weapons handling from the moment you sign your weapon out of theunit arms room until you sign it back in youthe individual soldierareresponsible for your weapon and its proper use the first thing i was taught andoef handbook iii for official use only 157which i now pass on to others is that when you receive weapon you ensure the weapon is unloaded ie cleared you pay attention to where the muzzle ispointed situational awareness and make sure the selector is always set onsafe what sets the standard for cleared weapon you guessed itthetechnical manual 10 for that particular type of weapon clearing procedures arenothing more than the weapons unloading procedures why then do soldiers inadvertently discharge weapons damaging equipment and injuring or killing others i have heard the following comments concerning thisissue since my return from operation iraqi freedom soldiers dont handle loaded weapons enough in training to becomfortable with ammunition on deployments the experience level and maturity of individual soldiers and leaders is atits lowest at the section and squadron levelssometimes even the platoonlevelbecause of rapid promotions we do not train as we fight lack of leadership in both the commissioned and noncommissionedofficer corps soldiers are put into qualificationrange mentality as far as weaponssafety these are few of the comments that stand out in my mind not excuses mind you but concerns expressed by deployed soldiers and their leadersleaders whoare responsible for bringing them home safely as an army how do we address these issues remember that todays army is based on the total force concept which hinges on combining activedutysoldiers and army reservists and guardsmen to provide complete combatpackage while soldier mentality might be the key leadership experience is thecornerstone and selfdiscipline is must the moment you are issued ammunition you instantly assume higher level of personal responsibility i have noticed the change in my own mentality and thementality of others you suddenly realize the outcome of any mistake could meandeath to yourself or those around you or perhaps you are concerned only withbeing able to account for all of your ammunition come turnin time either waythere is usually some change in your thinking ammunition then can be equatedto an emotional stress inducer training is factor in this because you have moreconfidence in your ability if you actually have learned and used the properprocedures for your weapon different units have different levels of training and weapons unique to their mission ncos must be trained thoroughly on all weapons under their control orthose their unit has in its inventory ncos are taught to educate themselvesthrough research and selfmotivation lack of leader supervision often shows alack of knowledge on the subject leaders who are knowledgeable are alwaysready and willing to correct soldier or peer who is improperly performing acertain task reviewing the appropriate technical and field manuals will providethe knowledge to train soldiers and rigidly enforce standards as leader can youproperly function check load and unload all of your soldiers weapons officers 158 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedncos and soldiers must be familiar with weapons handling to spot check and ensure compliance with orders and guidance maturity and experience are not always one and the same we have young leaders in positions of responsibility who are technically and tactically proficient yet stilllack maturity it is hard for soldiers to take these ncos seriously when they do nottake their own positions seriously the army also is running into leaders whothrough fault of their own are promoted in their career fields while performingadditional duty requirements such as recruiter or drill sergeant these individualsare then placed in leadership positions without having the needed practicalexperience when they go back to working in their primary mos they are oftentasksaturated with the current optempo and have to learn some hard lessons our training centers do not provide realistic training for current base camp operations we dress the part in miles gear put magazine of blanks in ourweapons and roll into the box we do not address weapons clearing procedureswhen entering base camps or unit tactical operations centers tocs to includeclearing areas and procedures for crewserved weapons mounted on vehicles ourunits are left to come up with standard solution based on their leadershipsexperience level the qualificationrange mentality says that most personnel handle ammunition and weapons only well enough to meet military qualification requirementsandeven then only under strict supervision because of that they have more mishapsin realworld scenarios is weapons discharge an act of negligence or an accident i guess the answer depends on whether youre on the muzzle end or the trigger end when the weaponfires i have looked at all of these hypotheses and can see two sides to each storyyet as an nco i cannot ride the fence and point fingers i have to give advice anddirection when and if required i request your input and suggestions to help solveone of the leading safety issues in our army today contact the author at 334 2552933 dsn 5582933 or
