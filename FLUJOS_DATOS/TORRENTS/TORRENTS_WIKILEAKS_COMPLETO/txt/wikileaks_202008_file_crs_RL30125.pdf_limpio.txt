20 1999 hr 1540 has not receive d floor action pros and cons of limiting the esf the argument in favor of restricting the use of the esf is that the congress and ultimately the taxpayer should have voice in whether and how billions of dollars are spent since appropriations are not required for th esf the congress does not under current law have an opportunity to debate or vote on potential loans to foreign governments it is argued t hat since the congress openly debates authorizations and appropriations of far smaller amounts congress should have the chance to do s when esf funds to foreign governments are committed the argument against imposing restrictions is that the esf provides the us treasur department with rapid and flexible tool to respond to internationa l financial crises in recent years technological change and large increases i nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30125crs9 c randall henning the exchange stabilization fund slush money or war chest 10 institute for international

potential crises there is evidence to suggest that the esf has abused it s authority previous esf loans to foreign governments were all repaid in timely way recent study which examined the history legal bases and financial operations of the esf focused on the basic question how can the united states maintai n democratic accountability for executive branch officials engaged in internationa l financial rescues and at the same time preserve capacity to respond to financia l crises with speed flexibility and effectiveness the study concluded that sinc e10 financial markets are imperfect the united states should maintain the exchang stabilization fund under the sole authority of the department of the treasury however the study also concluded that the secretary of t he treasury should continue to manage the esf conservatively and should increase the transparency of the esf while the congress should maintain oversight over the secretarys administration of the esf
