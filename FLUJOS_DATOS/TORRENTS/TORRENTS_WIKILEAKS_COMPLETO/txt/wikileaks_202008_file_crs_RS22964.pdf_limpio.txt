offset refers to any action that reduces or mitigates ghg emissions usually from an unrelated source eg increased carbon storag on forest or farmlands to offset emissions from automobiles the term offsets may also be used to refer to approved carbon reduction or sequestration projects under specific regulatory or voluntary ghg reduction programs see crs report rl34560 forest carbon markets

landuse change and forestry projects winrock international 2005purpose of measuring forest and agricultural carbon farm and forest activities can be both source and sink of ghgs releasing ghgs through plant and animal respirati on and decomposition and removing co2 through photosynthesis storing it in vegetation and so ils process known as sequestration range of land management agricultural c onservation and other farmland practices can reduce or abate emissions andor sequester carbon these include tree planting soil conservation manure and grazing manageme nt and land retirement conversion and restoration3 many of these activities however may be impracticable for an emission trading program because they might not meet credible standards for quantifying monitoring and verifying emi ssion reduction or carbon storage reliable tools and techniques are needed for carbon inventories and carbon change on forests and agricultural lands the ability to measure carbon levels allows countries that have committed to reducing ghg emissions to measure their current nnual emissions and carbon storage and changes in carbon stocks4 current estimates show that forests account for significant share of estimated existing carbon stocks globally agricultural lands account for small share of stored car bon also the ability to measure carbon levels provides the means to estimate the mitigation potential of forest or agriculture activities that sequester additional carbon in soils or vegetation ie resu lt in net reduction compared to estimated baseline conditions or current sequestration this may allow farm or forestry activity to be recognized as way to mitigate or offset5 emissions through voluntary action an emissions trad ing market or regulatory program for an emissions trading program to be credible participating entity is usually required to meet series of established prot ocols that specify what when where and how to measure changes in carbon protocols provide technical guidelines or standardized rules for quantifying monitoring and verifying the mitigation of an activity they specify requirements on project eligibility scale and baseline measurements measurement frequency and verification the difficulty is developing credible protocols that are quantitatively defensible and readily applicable across areas with differing land uses weather and other sitespecifi c conditions protocols also address to varying degrees concerns about the validity of activities such as additionality leakage and permanence6 protocols may be eith er

narrower set of offs et projects from the agricultural and forestry sectors providing for afforestation and methane reduction from livestock operations8 individual requirements of curre nt protocols and standards can vary widely by program decisions needed in setti ng measurement requirements numerous methods exist to measure fore st and agricultural carbon the appropriate measure to use in specific circumstances pends on several variab including the purpose for measuring the carbon the scale and ba sis to be measured the frequency of the measurement and how the meas urement is to be verified scale and baseline two geographic scales are commonly used for measuring ghg emissions the nationalreg ional level to report ghg missions and participate in broad efforts to reduce emissions and the localsitespecific level for projects to offset emissions regardless of scale the emission reduction or carbon sequestration is compared to baseline the historic ghg emissions or carbon stocks at specified point in time the scale and baseline timing are typically specified in the protocol of the reporting marketing or re gulating organization sometime s for projects with multiple land uses the land is stratified into the vari ous land uses eg cropl and pasture sapling forest mature forest with different baseline established for each use9 periodicity protocols typically identify when ghg emissions must be measured an initial measurement is needed to establish th baseline this must be done prior to the onset of project to allow for measuring the change that results from the action occasionally historic baseline is specified for example the kyoto protocol identified 1990 emissions as the baseline for measuring emission reductions other options include current level or other level whereby project is compared to business as usual the protocols also identify the frequency and timing of measurements for example ccx contracts for agricultural project s require annual measurements to assure that the emission reduction or carbon sequestrati on is actually occurring frequency of measurement also depends on the rate of change in carbon storage some carbon pools such as forest soils chan ge relatively slowly unless the forest is disturbed and measurement once decade may be sufficient for other carbon pools such as pastures or managed lands differences within and across years can be substantial and may require more frequent measurement timing can be critical and alternative measurements may vary widely the amount of carbon stored in vege tation in particular varies over the course of year with car bon being sequestered during the spring carbon stored in foliage at its maximum in late summer and carbon being released during

timing for annual measures is an important element for agri cultural and forestry carbon projects verification verifying the emission reduction or carbon sequestration is critical in efforts to mitigate climate change it is particularly important for agriculture and forestry projects as these activities are harder to measure reliably than other types of ghg offsets one question is who will be res ponsible for verifying changes in carbon which raises questions about the role of regula tory agency for accrediting claimed changes in carbon levels from an activity existing programs typically recommend or re quire that the carbon offset be verified by an independent entity i ndependent verificati on may be an auditing function to assure the reality and accuracy of the carbon offset for markets buyers nd sellers regulations emitters and regulators and reports emitters and reporting organizations10 one source has prescribed several qualities for independent verification an independent qualified thirdparty verifier using approved thodologies and regulations and whose compensation is not in any way dependent on the outcomes of their decisions and who follows set procedures to void conflicts of interest11 as voluntary and regulated markets for ghg emissions offsets develop qualified independent organizations to verify carbon offsets will be neede d entities qualified to verify agriculture and forest carbon offset s must be proven to be knowledgeable about carbon measurement one source notes to provide good quality and trustworthy oversight sufficiently rigorous accreditation pr ocess will be necessary to ensure that the verifiers have the needed expertise12 this process could pa rallel the development of independent auditors for certifying sustainable forestry programs13 measurement techniques basic approaches for measuring agricultural and forest carbon inventories and change include onsite measurement indirect measurement from offsite tools and estimation using process models or inferences hybrid approach involving combination of approaches eg combining modeling with onsite sampling and independent verifi cation might improve the accuracy enough to be useful while still containing costs because of the inherent cha llenges associated with balancing the cost of measuring carbon and the accuracy of these m easurements any practicable system for measuring forest and agricultural carbon might require mix of these different methods and approaches rather th an single approach httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22964crs5 14 for examples of the latter see harnessing forest and farm carbon ghg project accounting and sourcebook for lulucf projects onsite measurement direct measurement of th carbon content of agricultural and forestry soils and vegetation through field sampling and sitespecific laboratory estimates is perhaps the most accurate wa to measure carbon levels and changes however this is timeconsuming costly and often requires c ontinuous sampling and replication via census of soil and vegeta tion carbon for all agriculture and forestry projects and may be infeasible also it ca nnot cover large areas samples can be taken and the results extrapolated based on soil survey land cover climate and other spatial data sampling patterns eg grid random or stratified random intensity eg the area to be sampled and frequency ar likely to be specified in th protocols and many sources discuss sampling methods for agri culture and forestry projects14 the more intensive and frequent the sampling the greater the cost but the higher the likely accuracy of the data most experts suggest some sampling to ensure the accuracy of models or offsite measures especially performed consistently over time as with verification the entity that measur the onsite carbon can affect perceptions of the accuracy of the measurement landowne rs or other offset llers can perform the measurement both at the outset of the proj ect for the baseline and periodically during the life of the project this could reduce costs because they are commonly on the site but raises questions of credibility since they ve an interest in th reported carbon levels ensuring that verification is conducted by independent verifiers might be sufficient to assuage market concerns over credibility but c ould involve high proj ect verification costs indirect measurement with offsite tools tools exist to calculate carbon content without actually being on the site remote sensing using photographic and other images from aircraft or satellites can be used to measure carbonrelated factors for example infrared imagery can detect live biomass with variations in the image reflecting variations in the type and level of biomass remote sensing has long been used in forestry for calculating commercial timber volumes of forest stands the principal advantage of remote sensing is coverage given its ability to assess wide area relatively quickly another advantage is that the remote sensing and the analysis of the results are generally performed by experts improving the credibility of the results and probably lowering the cost of verification it can provide highly accurate information for some types of carbonrelated measures such as activities with readily visible results eg deforestation and affo restation or measurable carbon pools eg live aboveground biomass one disadvantage is the high fixed cost of providing remote coverage satellites are very expensive to launch nd maintain aircraft may be less expensive but may cover less area once the satellites are in place ex tending satellite covera ge to additional areas is relatively inexpensive for some carbonrelated measures such as activities with less visible impacts eg sustaina ble forestry or less readily measurable carbon pools eg soil carbon remote sensing is problematic also in some areas cloud cover can interrupt regular measurements methods for consiste ntly and reliably inte rpreting remote imagery are still under development nd are usually recommended to be used in conjunction with other techniqueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22964crs6 15 james smith et methods for

voluntary reporting of greenhouse gases 1605b program march 2006 parts h and iestimation using process models or inferences another indirect approach is to estimate agricultural and forestry car bon with models or other analytical tools models are available to estimate variety of ecosystem processes and are used to depict sitespecific conditions models especially computer models are typically built from extensive research and data sets and provide average or archetypical estimates of physical area temperature precipitation forest or soil type slope plant diversity and microbial activity the accuracy of the results depends in large part on the validity and measurement of the input variables for the model data may be presented in ta bular form called look up tables because estimates can be looked up in the table based on few key variables such as forest type and tree age or soil type15 related simpler approach might use inferences or generalized input data scaled up to the size of the farm or forested area to approximate the sequestration for an activity16 such an approach may reduce costs but provide relatively low vel of precision and possibl high verification costs the advantage of modeling approach is that it is relatively simple and lowcost and often provides consistent estimates however it may not reflect actual differences within and across sites and ac tivities since it relies on archetyp ical or average carbon estimates and not sitespecific carbon measurements model proponents often suggest using occasional sitespecific sampling to assure th validity of the model chosen for the project and site and some suggest adjusting the timates based on the samp this introduces the potential for bias in reporting carbon nd significantly increases the difficulty of verification in addition for most situations and project types numerous models exist these competing models may yield quite diffe rent estimates for the same site because of the different data sets and ssumptions used in constructing the models one model may yield the most accurate estimates in certain circumstances while nother model may yield more accurate estimates in other circumstances considerations for congress congress has already taken step s to address some of the challenges associated with measuring carbon changes from forested and agricultural lands and practices the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 the food conserva tion and energy act of 2008 includes provision sec 2709 directing usda to blish technical guidelines that outline sciencebased methods to meas ure the environmental services benefits including carbon storage from forests and agricultural activities this includes developing measurement procedures and reporting prot ocol and registry the ener gy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 sec 712 directs the secretary of the interior to develop methodology to assess carbon sequestration and emissions from ecosystems this methodology is to cover measuring mon itoring and quantifying ghg emissions and reductions and provide estimates of sequestration capacity and the mitigation potential of different ecosystem management practices congress continues to face the question of whether its current authorized activities provide adequate and sufficient guidelines for accurately measuring carbon levels from forest and agricultural activities
