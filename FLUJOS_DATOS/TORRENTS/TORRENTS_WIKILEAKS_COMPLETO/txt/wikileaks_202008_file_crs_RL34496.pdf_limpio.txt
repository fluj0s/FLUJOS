recommendations the sdfsca advisory committee was creat ed in june 2006 by ed secretary margaret spellings17 the committee is made up of representatives from several federal agencies state and local governme nt representatives and individuals with relevant expertise the committee was asked by the secretary to examine the sdfsca state grants program the nc lb unsafe school choice option discussed briefly below and the collection of safety data following the virginia tech tragedy the secretary asked the committee to also examine three additional issues trauma nonpublic schools and urbanrural challengeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34496crs10 18 us department of education safe and drugfree schools and communities advisory committee enhancing achi evement and proficiency through safe and

held six meetings conducted si x conference calls and heard testimony from 38 witnesses the committees recommendations are summarized below by issue recommendations on trauma nonpublic sc hools and urbanrural challenges are incorporated within the discussion of the other issues state grant issues according to the committees report underlying all of the committees recommendations is the need for clearer standards for all recipients of grant f unds including the gove rnors portion of the program19 the committee expressed support with some reservations for allowing states to use larger share of sdfsca state grants for state purposes in particular to provide technical assistance and help with data collection to leas there was also support for making changes to the gover nors funds proposals included making the funds contingent on the collection of data on school safety and drug abuse or shifting the funds back to the states the committee noted that presently there is consensus at the federal or state level on the definition of safe ty and drug and alcohol probl ems and as consequence consensus on desired outcomes or measures of effectiveness the committee report stated at ll levels the current implementation of the state grants program has not required the use of data to termine needs it recommended that ed provide states and leas with clear measurable outcomes of success encourage improved program assessment and provide clear guidelines on effective prevention programs these changes would require co llection of uniform data on key indicators of safety and drug and alcohol abuse from all schools and leas because of limited federal funding fo r the sdfsca program the committee recommended that there be more incentives incorporated into the program to foster local partnerships possibly including re quirement for local matching funds in addition there was significant support among the committee members for changing the program from the current system of allo cating funds to all leas by formula to system in which funds are controlled by states and grants are awarded competitively to leas to fund priority needs the committee recommended increased emphasis be placed on program compliance with the sdfsca principles of effectiveness and on the identification and testing of promising innova tive programs it encourag ed ed to develop separate guidelines for rural and ur ban schools appropriate to the unique challenges faced by each in implementing drug and alcohol preven tion programs and safe ty efforts and it recommended the development of explicit guidelines on the requirements leashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34496crs11 must meet in working with nonpublic schools in addition the committee recommended that cooperation among the fe deral agencies providing support for drug and alcohol prevention and increas ed safety be impr oved and enhanced unsafe school choice option usco usco is authorized by the esea title ixe2 section 9532 not as part of the sdfsca it requires states to establish statewide policies under which any student who attends persistently dangerous public elementary or sec ondary school or who becomes vic tim of violent crime

usco see crs report rl33371 k12 education implementation status of the child left behind act of 2001 pl 107 110 the committee found the usco has not been as effective as the need it addresses requires the committee made several recommendations for improvements including the following allowing in addition to considera tion of violent incidents other indicators such as substance abuse bullying gang activity racism of school safety to be factored into the determination of whether school is safe the provision by ed of training for administrators teachers and other school personnel on how best to assist students who are victims or victimizers including transfer options reexamination of the term persistently dangerous the committeefelt that this terminology s tigmatizes schools and unduly penalizes schools that accurately report violen t incidents it recommended using more neutral terminology fo r example schools might be put on watch list and given priority for sdfsca state grant funding the committee also recommended assi stance be provided to schools experiencing significant safety problems the provision by ed of guidelines for schools with safety problems on ways to improve safety includi ng information on best practices ed could also provide support nd technical assistance to these schools improving the ability of schools to cope with potential tragedies by educating school personnel on how th events can affect students and on how to identify warning signs that student needs intervention such as counseling ed could provide assistance by distributing information on best practices nd providing training on how to identify and refer students at risk for assistance early on data requirements the committee recommended that serious consideration should be given to what data are most im portant and whether it is possible for states and leas to collect it data collection c ould be coordinated by agencies working on alcohol and drug abuse and safety to minimize the burden on states and leas ed could play an important role in coordinating data collection by federal agencies so that only one set of data are bein g collected coordination between federal agencies and state and local governments would also be useful consideration should be given to formulating uniform set of questions fo r states and leas to use for program evaluationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34496crs12 20 michael leavitt margaret spellings and alberto gonzales report to the president on issues raised by the virginia tech tragedy june 13 2007the

the group issued its report that included the following findings regarding importa nt issues in need of local state and federal action information sharing is critical in instances such as the virginia tech tragedy however there is conf usion among education public safety and mental health staff regarding what information can be shared on individuals who are threat to themselves or others information regarding individuals who may not legally own gun is crucial but currently is not always accurate and complete prevention of future tragedies requires improved awareness andcommunication people with mental illnesses must get the services they need currently some feel that there ar insufficient resources available to meet this need especially at colleges and universities make better

senate draft house reauthorization bill was circ ulated for public comment but bill has not yet been introduced some of the majo r sdfsca reauthorization issues that may to be considered by congress include the following whether absent significant increas in appropriations the funding level for the program is sufficien t to support the allocation of funds to all leas by formula currently more than half of leas receive sdfsca grants of less than 10000 questions have been raised regarding whether such small grants can support effective programs although the last reauthorization adjusted the formula to put more emphasis on awarding grants on the basis of poverty some argue that switching to competitively awarded lea grants would allow for better targeting of school districts most in need of sdfsca funds strengthened data collection and reporting requirements currently uniform management informati on and reporting system umirs data is collected by each stat relying upon state

manage ment information and reporting system it would require states to report some required data items using these definitions to the extent feasible ed may accelerate these efforts once the data require ments adopted in reauthorized program are known during reauthor ization the issue of uniform data standards may be cons idered reauthorization legislation may require annual reporting of these data to ed as well as to the public an increased emphasis on programs to prevent bullying and harassment believed to be key to violence prevention bullying is serious problem at many school s in 2005 approximately 28 of 12 to 18 year old students reported th at they were bullied at school in the last six months21 provision of comprehensive mental health programs the virginia tech tragedy and similar events heightened awareness that access to mental health services is an important component of preventing school violence how to improve performance measures for the program ed iscurrently collecting data on the extent to which leas are implementing research based programs and if the implementation of those programs is consistent with the research based model ed has collected data for

school property dur ing the past 12 months or 4 carried weapon on sc hool property one or more times during the past 30 days these data are fro m the cdcs youth risk behavior surveillance survey which is based on nationally representative biennial sample of students in gr ades 912 however given the scope of sdfsca programs under current funding levels only small percentage of students in grades 912
