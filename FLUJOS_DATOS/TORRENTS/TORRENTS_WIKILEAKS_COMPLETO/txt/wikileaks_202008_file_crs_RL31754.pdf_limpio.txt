including federal funds and trust funds in several of the ensuing fiscal years3 when various proposed spending increases and tax cuts were taken into account the projections indicated annual deficits fo r the foreseeable future for example omb projected that if president bushs fy2004 budget policy proposals were enacted annual unified budget deficits ranging from 178 billion to 307 billion would continue through fy2008 in addition the soft economy continue d to put damper on federal revenues also the spending for the war on terrorism and homeland security for military operations in iraq and for other legislative initiatives increased the scarcity of current and future federal government resources such factors potentially could worsen the already unfavorable budget outlook4 overview of the congressional budget process the congressional budget process consists of the consideration and adoption of spending revenue and debt limit legislation within th framework of an annual concurrent resolution on the budget congress begins its budget process once the president submits his budget the president is required by law to submit comprehensive federal budget later than the first monday in february the pres idents budget includes estimates of direct spending and revenues under existing laws as well as requests for discretionary spending ie funds contro lled through the appropriations process for the upcoming fiscal year in addition the president frequently proposes new initiatives in his budget submission to congress although congress is not bound by the presidents budget

centered around the adoption of an annual concurre nt resolution on the budget the budget resolution sets forth aggregate spending nd revenue levels and spending levels by major functional area for at least five fis cal years because the budget resolution is concurrent resolution it is not presented to the president for his signature and thus does not become law instead it is an agreement between the house and senate on congressional budget plan providing frame work for subsequent legislative action on the budget during each congressional session table 1 the congressional budget process

category at other times it was divided into two or more broad categories such as defense and nondefe nse spending currently adjustable discretionary spending limits still exist for highway and mass transit spending for fy2003 and conservation spending divided into six subcategories through fy2006 but the sequestration process to enfo rce them expired on september 30 2002 under the paygo
