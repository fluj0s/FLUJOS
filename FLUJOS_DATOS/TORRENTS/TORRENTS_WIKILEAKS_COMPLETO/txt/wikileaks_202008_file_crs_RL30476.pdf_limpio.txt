during the 106th congress during the 106th congress the president submitted 76 nominations1 to full time positions on regulatory boards and commissions fortytwo of the nominations were confirmed seven withdrawn and 27 returned the large number of failed nominations reflects the fact that in presidential election year the senate when controlled by the opposition party is reluctant to confirm nominees to fixedterm positions in which they may serve for several years the reluctance is based on the hope that its own presidential candidate would win the election and make appointments to the positions table 1 presents the appointment action in the 106th congress 1 appointment action during the 106th congress 1999 2000 positions 147 nominations submitted to senate 76 nominations confirmed

sessions 112999 012400 if nomination was pending during those periods 3for example two democratic nominees were nominated one in march and the other in april continuedaverage time to confirm nomination the average time the senate took to confirm nomination to an independent regulatory board or commission as well as the average time the president took to submit nomination may not be as meaningful when considering independent regulatory boards or commissions as it is when considering executive departments and singleheaded independent agencies nearly all positions on boards and commissions are for fixed term of office and when term expires in most instances the incumbent may remain in office until he or she is replaced by successor moreover nomination is frequently submitted before an incumbents term expires consequently the average time taken to confirm nomination generally is not as crucial for independent regulatory boards and commission as it is for executive departments and singleheaded independent agencies where nomination is generally made to position that is vacant during the 106th congress the senate took an average of 83 days to confirm nomination to an independent regulatory board or commission after it was received2 durin g the 105th congress the senate took an average of 79 days to confirm nomination to independent regulatory boards and commissions information is readily available on how long the president took to submit nomination when term expired or position became vacant of the 42 nominations confirmed 29 were confirmed in less time than the 83day average while the remaining 13 took longer to confirm the number of days to confirm individual nominations varied widely while 10 nominations were confirmed in less than month two took over six months another two took over eight months and one took over twelve months the fact that most of the independent regulatory boards and commissions require political balance among their members ie more than simple majority may be from the same political party means that the president must negotiate over nominations with leaders of the opposition party in congress these negotiations involve questions not only of patronage but also of policy especially when the board or commission is involved in areas that may at the time be particularly sensitive this often results in packaging process whereby the president submits several nominations together for positions in particul ar agency and the senate then confirms that group of nominations as package sometimes however only one or two nominations are submitted when three or four positions may be available when this occurs nomination may remain before the senate for many months until one or two additional nominations are submitted generally all are then quickly confirmed3 variation of this packaging process appears to have been the casehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30476crs3 3continued to positions on the federal maritime

appointment process the president and the senate share the power to appoint the principal officers of the united states4 the constitution article ii section 2 empowers the president to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint the principal officers of the united states three distinct stages mark the appointment process nomination confirmation and appointment in the nomination or first stage the president selects the nominee and sends his or her name to the senate for positions that are located within state us attorney us marshal and us district judge the president by custom normally nominates an individual recommended by the senator or senators if they are from the same party as the president from that state if neither senator is from the same party the president normally defers to the recommendations of party leaders from that state occasionally the president solicits recommendations from senators from the opposition party because of their positions in the senate before making nomination to federal position at the national or state level the president must consider how it will fare in the confirmation process nomination to position does not give the nominee legal authority to assume the duties and responsibilities of the position that authority comes only after the nominee is confirmed and appointed while awaiting confirmation nominee often is hired as consultant and may act only in an advisory capacity in the confirmation or second stage the senate alone determines whether to approve or disapprove nomination how the senate acts on nomination depends largely on the importance of the position involved existing political circumstances and policy implications generally the senate shows particular interest in the nominees views and how he or she is likely to affect public policy5 how closely the nominees personal and professional qualities are examined may depend on the importance of the position the nominees possible or likely effect on constituent interests and his or her possible or likely influence on public policy although the senate confirms most nominations president can safely assume that all of his nominees to fulltime positions will be approved routinely this ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30476crs4 6us library of congress congressional research service senate action on nominations to policy positions in the executive branch 19811992 by rogelio garcia crs report 93 464 gov washington april 28 1993 the study did not include nominations submitted by presidents carter and reagan in the last month of their administration s or nominations submitted within month of the senates adjournment at the end of session it also excluded nominations to the judiciary military services foreign service national oceanic and atmospheric administration officer corps and public health service officer corps as well as nominations to all ambassadorial us attorney us marshal and parttime positions 7for additional information on recess appointments see us library of congress congressional research service recess appointments legal overview by richard c continuedespeci ally true of nominations to regulatory and other collegial boards and commissio ns between 1981 and 1992 22 of the nominations to boards and commissions failed during the same period 11 of the nominations to independent agencies and 9 of the nominations to executive departments also failed6 the full senate seldom rejects nomination nearly all rejections occur in committee either by committee vote or by committee inaction nominations fail for many reasons including opposition to the nomination insufficient time for consideration of the nominatio n or political conflict between the president and the senate or individual senators that may have nothing to do with the nomination the first two stages of the appointment process may be summarized by the view that while the president proposes the senate disposes in the third or final stage the confirmed nominee is given commission signed by the president with the seal of the united states affixed thereto and is sworn into office at that point he or she has full authority to carry out the responsibilities of the office recess appointments the president may also make appointments without senate confirmation when the senate is in recess article ii section ii of the constitution either during session intrasession recess appointment or between sessions intersession recess appointment recess appointments expire at the end of the next session of congress presidents have occasionally used the recess appointment power to circumvent the confirmation process in response congress has placed additional restrictions on the presidents authority to make recess appointment under 5 usc 5503a if the position to which the president makes recess appointment falls vacant while the senate is in session the appointee may not be paid from the treasury until he or she is confirmed by the senate the salary prohibition does not apply 1 if the vacancy arose within 30 days before the end of the session 2 if nomination for the office other than the nomination of some one given recess appointment during the preceding recess was pending when the senate recessed or 3 if nomination was rejected within 30 days before the end of the session and another individual was given the recess appointment recess appointee falling under any one of these three exceptions must be nominated not later than 40 days after the beginning of the next session of the senate7 for

other collegial bodies federal executive boards and commissions share the following characteristics 1 they are independent executive bodies located outside executive departments8 2 several members head each entity 3 the members are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate and 4 the members serve fixed terms of office and except in few bodies canno t be removed by the president except for cause presidential appointees to federal regulatory boards and commissions with few exceptions serve for staggered fixed terms and are removable only for cause sometimes the time between confirmation and the termexpiration date is less than the fixed term of office this results from the fact that nominee generally is nominat ed and confirmed either long after term has expired and new term has begun or to complete an unexpired term occasionally if the unexpired term is for very short period two nominations of the same person are submitted simultaneously the first to complete the unexpired term and the second to complete regular term of office on some commissions the chair is subject to senate confirmation and must be appointed from among the incumbent commissioners if the president wishes to appoint as chair someone who is not on the commission two nominations are submitted simultaneously for the nominee the first for member and the second for chair on 24 of the regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions more than simple majority of the appointed members eg two of three or three of five may belong to the same political party finally three boards and commissions each have an inspector general and three others each have general counsel appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate organization of the
