northern pakistan and india killing at least 74000 people and injuring over 70000 more the earthquake damaged the homes of millions of people fo rcing more than 28 million to search for alternative means of shelter the full extent of the destruction is now being revealed as government authorities nd relief organizations are ab to access some of the remote locations the united states government usg has pledged 510 million toward the relief effort almost all of it to assisting pakistan which remains key us ally in the war against terror because of the heavy usg military and development presence in neighboring afghanistan the logistics of bringing resources into pakistan have been relatively st raightforward the usg government of pakistan and nato among ot hers operated daily relief flights to ferry supplies personnel and victims to and from the region the earthquake struck region that lie s along the southern reaches of the himalayan mountains while delivering humanitarian assistance and gaining full access was critical one of the main humanitari an priorities early on was ensuring that the estimated three million people who lost their homes had adequate protection from winter weather and diseases extensive preparation nd coordinated relief efforts helped greatly to mitigate against the impact of winter aid agencies continue to provide much needed assistance and are now planning for the transition from relief to reconstruction which is sche duled to take place in april november public poll suggests that the usgs aid effort has improved ordinary pakistanis opinions of the unite d states although apparent us missile attacks on pakistani territory in decem ber 2005 and january 2006 and anger over the february publication in european newspa pers of cartoons deemed offensive to muslims reinvigorated antiwestern and antiamerican sentiments among some segments of the pakistani populace some experts have raised concerns that the economic burden of the disaster could contribute toward longterm instability in an area perceived to be of critical importance to the united states in the war on terror it remains to be seen what progress is ma in the recovery and reconstruction phase and what impact this may have on public opinion immediately following the disaster legislative activity included the introduction of several resolutions expr essing sympathy for those affected by the earthquake pledging american support for the victims and lauding the relief efforts of us personnel additional funds were not added to the regular fy2006 foreign

unfold but more indepth assessments now provide clearer indicators of the overall disaster although its toll in human lives appears to be less than third of that of the december 2004 indian ocean

principally on the emergency events database emdat maintained by the world health organizations who centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters cred although cred makes efforts to sure the reliability of its data it must be cautioned that obtaining precise and accurate informa tion about natural disasters many of which occurred decades ago and in areas where political and environmental conditions made data collec tion difficult is not possible thus casualty figures stemming from for instance the series of deadly floods in china that took place halfcentury ago must all be taken as ve ry rough approximations even the figures for the recent tsunami vary to some degree from source to source and must be considered estimates on the whole how ever the emdat because of its explicit definitions and uniform cr iteria for event inclusion provides the best means of comparing data across different disasters4 table 1 deadliest natural disasters since 1900 date location eventestimated

which have been relatively more localized the tsunami struck thousands of miles of populous coastline in nearly dozen countries affecting millions of people also the deaths of thousands of tourists from the industrialized world vacationing in southern thailand and sri lanka mostly europeans but also many americans and japanese may have given the indian ocean tsunami higher profile than the more recent south asian earthquake indeed there has been some concern that donors who contribut ed to the tsunami relief effort may be less enthusiastic about assisting victims of the second major south asian natural disaster to strike in less than year the pakistan federal relief commission frc also provides comparison of the two natural disasters and specifically focuses on the number of people

speculative undertaking authority definitions and categories of services are not necessarily equivalent across events each agency has its own budget with its own criteria accounting detail and regional specificity the fact that an urgent response to humanitarian crises is often required only compounds th problem budgets may reflect regional support certain area speci fic countries or combin ation thereof over time and with changing events even if we accept that usg aid is comparable across disasters the disasters themselves are not equivalent the areas in which they occur differ dramatically in terrain underlying economic c onditions and governmental capacity it thus makes little sense to compare for example the amount of usg aid delivered per casualty even the decision to look at fatalities as th measure of disasters severity can be questioned in part because of the difficulty of obtaining accurate figures in assessing the amount of aid provided to di sasters it may make more sense to look at the economic damage each has caused measured in this way the seven greatest international natural disasters of the last ten year s are 1 the 1995 earthquake in kobe japan 95 billion in damage 2 the 1998 flood in china 30 billion 3 the 2004 earthquake in niigata japan 24 billion 4 the 1997 wildfires in indonesia 17 b illion 5 the 1995 flood in north korea 15 billion 6 the

damage81 once again however such comparison may conceal more than it reveals major factor affecting the economic severity of natural disaster is clearly the economic prosperity of the area in which it occurs the kobe earthquake was expensive because japan was so well off furthermore obtaining reliable and consistent figures for the cost of recove ring from natural disaster is notoriously difficult estimates range tremendously depending upon the criteria used for instance replacement cost vs auction cost vs assessed value of damaged property and the organization doing the estimate comparing usg and international aid is even more difficult because of the often dramatically different forms the ssistance takes inkind contributions vs cash for instance finally it is not always evident whether figures represent pledges of support or more specific obligationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33196crs22 82 for background information see crs report rl32714 international disasters and humanitarian

breakdown of the appeal by receiving organization is provided in appendix b according to the united nations the usg has so far contributed approximately 288 million toward the appeal see table 3 the disparity between overall funding of the relief effort and contributions toward the appeal is due to several factors many countri including the usg are providing assistance in the form of direct contributions of items such as blankets food and tents or through th operation of relief flights and logistics support much of this assistance is coordinated directly with the gop or the pakistani military in addition to direct bilateral assistance good deal of funding has been provided to ngos operating outside of the appeal while the flash appeal focuses on early recovery efforts in the

congress us image in pakistan effects on war against terror there has been some discussion in the dia about the effects of the us relief effort on pakistani perceptions of the ited states and more specifically the us government this issue is seen as important because president musharrafs government is key us ally in th global war on terror many highranking members of qaeda and the taliban are believed to remain in the rugged regions of northwest pakistan and the ability of the united states to locate and capture them likely depends on pakistans cooperation at the same time mush arrafs relationship with the united states is not supported by large portion of the pakistani population widelycited survey taken by the pew ce nter before the earthquake found that 23 of the pakistani public had favorable view of the ited states while 51 had favorable impression of osama bin laden96 more recent systematic public polling of pakistani opinion on this issue by terror free tomorrows survey conducte d between november 1428 2005 showed significant shift in public opinion favorab views of the united states jumped to 46 and support for osama bin laden dr opped to 33 those conducting the poll believe the shift is direct result of th provision of us humanitarian assistance to earthquake victims97 some argue that sustaining relief and reconstruction assistance may prove to be impor tant in creating support for the united states while at the same time undermining support for gl obal terrorists the degree to which the united states receives positive press for its contribu tions to the earthquake relief effort may also make it easier for musharraf to suppor t us antiterror activity in the region however apparent us missile attack s on pakistani territory in december 2005 and

states aros in march with widespread perception among pakistanis that president bushs vi sit to the region made stark their countrys subordinate position to india with regard to us policy making98 late in 2005 several reporte rs presented anecdotal ev idence suggesting that the united states is reaping something of public relations dividend because of its involvement it was reporte d that us relief efforts in pakistan had been quite visible on pakistani television news broadcas ts and thus reached fairly broad cross section of the population99 reporters encounters with pakistanis living and working in affected areas also support this seve ral individuals made point of telling the journalist that they were grateful for western aid100 academics and commentators as well reported perceptible change in pakistani attitudes toward the united states101 there were some positive reports in pakistani media as well although they are perhaps thinner than in the american press the nation for instance printed an opinion piece praising the united states for its efforts in saving pakistani lives and excoriating critics of the united states102 this latter sentiment however appeared to indicate that sizable number of pakistanis remained critical of the united states indeed pakistani officials and political analysts cautioned that any change in perceptions might be limited to moderate urban pakistanis and unlikely to sway the countrys small core of milita nts who support qaeda103 as noted earlier some commentators have speculated that the pace of pakistans response could by implication affect public opinion about the united states which is widely seen as supporting the rule of generalcumpresiden t pervez musharraf the greatest criticism of us involvement appears to come from the pakistani political opposition especially from islamist pa rties one of whose leaders has said that pakistan does not need any fore ign including american and nato support104 similar

saying that nato poses security threat they are here to help us even if they ar in uniform it should not be cause of concern106 other experts focus on objections to president musharrafs decision to authorize natos relief mission without cons ultation or approval by the parliament this may have led opposition groups to di sagree with natos involvement even if they might otherwise have supported it107 burdensharing and donor fatigue although the united states is the world s largest provider of foreign assistance in absolute terms it is often one of th lowest contributors when measured as percentage of its economic capacity according to the organization for economic cooperation and developmen t oecd the united states provided 016 of its gross national income gni in 2004 for ov erseas disaster assistance oda by comparison the average of major donors is 025 the percentages for other major donors are as follows japan 019 the united kingdom 036 france 042 and germany 028 in previous disasters pledges made by governments have not always resulted in actual contributions the earthquake of december 2003 in bam iran is but one example raised by the united nations concerning the billions of dollars pledged to help the victims of the tsunami disaster there is skepticism whether all these pledges will be honored it also ca nnot be assumed that the f unds committed to relief actually represent new contributions since the m oney may previously have been allocated elsewhere it will take time for more complete picture to reveal how the actual costs of the tsunami disaster will be shared among international donors108 in the case of the october south asia earthquake amir abdulla wfp regional director for the middle east central asia and eastern europe commented early on that it is extremely worrying that the international community which was so generous after the indian ocean tsunami has so far faile d to come up with an adequate response to this crisis after slow start as of midfebruary the united nations had received twothirds of its flash appeal of 550 million109 some experts are concerne d about f unding prio rities and resources for other disaster areas

question was raised at the world summit in september key donor countries pledged 150 million for an emergency fund to allow the united nations to respond more quickly to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies the central emergency response fund cerf is seen by proponents as way to enable the united nations to respond more efficiently effectively and consistently to humanitarian crises worldwide competing aid and budget priorities110 amid efforts to tackle rising budget deficits by among other measur slowing or reducing discretionary spending finding the resources to sustain us aid pledges may be difficult after the tsunami disaster some members of congress publicly expressed concern that funding for tsunami relief nd reconstruction which depleted most worldwide disaster contingency accounts could jeopardize resources for subsequent international disasters or for other aid priorities from which tsunami emergency aid had been transferred111 these accounts were fully restored through supplemental appropriations at the time others noted the substantial size of american private donations for tsunami victims and argued that because of other budget pressures the united states did not need to transfer dditional aid the point remains however that when disasters require immediate emergency relief the administration may fund pledges by depleting most worldwide disast er accounts in order to respond to future humanitarian crises however these resources would need to be replenished or it could curtail us capacity to respond to other emergencies from relief to recovery the cost of rebuilding the earthquakes effect on pakistans economy remains to be seen the majority of the countrys industry is located in the south well away from the earthquake zone for this reason some observers believe that the disaster will not have serious impact on the pakistani economys impressive growth ra the world bank for instance has slightly revised its prediction for paki stans fy2006 growth in gross domestic product gdp from 65 to 61112 nevertheless the costs of rebuilding the damaged infrastructure in the north as well as caring for the millions of affected pakistanis are expected to seriously strain the pakistan governments capacity some observers have cautioned against overly optimistic projections113 transparency some members of congress ve also

organizations which could raise the same questions about transparency requirements moreover while earmarks and time limits may ensure greater accountability they can also add pressure for organizations to spend contributed funds sometimes leading to unnecessary spending waste and duplicated effo rts restrictions on funds also often do not allow flexibility to adapt projects to better meet the changing needs on the ground114 assessing performance as noted above the united nations fl ash appeal for earthquake relief and reconstruction remains seri ously underfunded by st an international donors conference in islamabad garnered more pledges than expected to certain extent this reflects some donors preference for pr oviding bilateral rath er than multilateral funding according to some reports howev er the initial respon of some united nations agencies to the earthquake was confused and inade quate prompting donors to commit their resources to other agencies more recent reporting indicated that many agencies greatly improved their performance and that the overall relief operation was success the usaid dart has been critical of so agencies for an inadequate initial response to the earthquake some of the criticism s been structural it is not clear dart members say that the unite d nations cluster approach see above is the most effective method of disaster management problem may stem from the sometimes competing demands placed on the cl uster leaders liaising with the host government and gathering and dissemin ating data as well as responding to immediate needs and coordinating relief activity there has been some question about the ability of individual agencies to fulfill all of these functions with limited staffing under emergency conditions115 the cluster system is being discussed at the united nations some of the darts criticism however reflected more specific concern that several agencies were inadequate in their response to the earthquake prompting usaid in some cases to look to ngos instead of the system to carry out relief activities according to the dart some agencies were slow to realize the severity of the disaster and to allocate fficient human and financial resources to the relief effort the dart singled out unh cr the wfp unjlc and iom not part of the system but close collaborator for particular criticism the

role116 the dart team spoke more favorably of unicef and the who both of which despite rocky starts quickly built up capacity and assumed leadership of their respective clusters both agencies were singled out for effective coordination and implementation117 the dart itself points out that some of its concerns cannot be attributed to underperformance to begin with the dart notes that the bestperforming agencies are also the betterf unded ones nd states that better funding of the other agencies might positively aff ect their performance beyond this some concerns have reflected the constraints of the united na tions particular opera tional mandate rather than failure on its part unlike some ngos which may operate mo re informally the united nations must carefully coordinate all of its activities with the pakistani government thus to the extent that th gops initial response to the earthquake was slow and confused this may have affected performance as well118 sources familiar with operations including members of the dart later reported that the united nations performance improved mark edly demonstrated in part by the success of relief efforts over the winter there does not appear to have been much public criticism of the united nations response in the media the darts concerns have largely aired within the usg perhaps for this reason the united nations has not issued any public response to such charges privately however unhcr officials have acknowledged some missteps especially in the early days of the relief effort they were slow to mobilize some assets and reorganize their staff in the field they have pointed out however that most organizations operating in paki stan faced difficulties at that time the gops initial disorganization had ripple effect
