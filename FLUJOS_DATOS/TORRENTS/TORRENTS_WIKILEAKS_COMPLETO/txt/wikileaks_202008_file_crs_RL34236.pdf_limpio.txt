costs and benefits of the fannie maes and freddie macs retained portfolios while th ey remain under conservatorship increasing numbers of homeowners are th reatened with foreclosure because of interest rate resets on subpr ime mortgages combined with stagnant or falling home prices congress responded to this situ ation by passing the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 hr 3221 pl 110289 which uses the congressionally chartered stockholderowned governments ponsored enterp rises gses fannie mae and freddie mac to lead the market in providing more affordable mortgages the gses have retained mortgage portfolios with combined value of more than 14 trillion the size of the portfolios past management problems risks to the financial system and potential cost to the ta xpayer led in part to provisions of the housing and economic recovery act that changed the rules governing the activities and regulation of fannie mae and freddie mac the bill created the federal housing finance agency fhfa and authorized it to regulate the size of the gses retained mortgage portfolios it also raised the conforming loan limit in certain highcost areas thereby allowing the gses to purchase larger mortgages in these areas previous regulatory actions have ffected the gses portfolios in 2006 following discovery of accounting and mana gement problems the gses agreed to restrictions on their retained portfolios in 2007 the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo now the federal housing finance agency fhfa denied requests from both fannie and freddie to raise or eliminate the caps but these restrictions were relaxed shortly afterwards on ptember 6 2008 the gses were placed in conservatorship government management one condition of the conservatorship set the tfolio limit to 850 billion as of december 2009 with 10 yearly decline until the portfolios reach 250 billion the gses portfolios include mortgages and mortgagebacked securities mbs that are subject to financial risks when these risks are not managed properly or if market movements turn dramatically against the gses the government faces two unsatisfactory alternatives either let the gses go into default and work to control the financial repercussions or step in and assume payments on the gses debt at significant cost to taxpayers the gses and their supporters argue that the profits generated by the investment portfolio s enhanced the gses ability to support affordable housing programs and reduce mortgage interest rates this report will be update d as warranted by significant

is the risk that the borrowers mortgagors will not repay their loans on time when fannie and freddie buy mortgages and combine them into mbs they guarantee that the loans will be repaid on time in 2005 according to media reports standard poors and most other major observers concluded that because of the different matu rity dates loantovalue ratios private mortgage insurance and geographic divers ification credit risk was not serious problem15 in hindsight default rates on loans in creased in many places in the country at the same time for many classes of mortgages so geographic diversification proved to be less of protection for the gs than many assumed it would be16 prepayment risk prepayment risk is the risk to an investor that mortgage will be paid before its full term is concluded leaving the investor to find another investment perhaps when interest rate s have decreased prior to the current housing cycle prepayment risk was consider ed more likely to be serious than credit risk homeowners prepay for two majo r reasons moving and to obtain more favorable terms many subprime borrowe rs took out their mo rtgages anticipating prepaying prepayment risk falls on the ultimate holder of mortgage or mbs since 1986 the gses have offered multicla ss mbs which divide prepayment risk among the different classes they are customized for investors to match their tolerance and preference for prepayment risk versus anticipated yield when gses keep the mbs they also keep this risk interest rate risk interest rate risk comes from financing the mbs portfolios by borrowing money issuing bonds and is related to prepayment risk the gses face much higher interest rate risk for mortgages held in portfolio than for mortgages that they issue as mbs to finance the longterm loans held in their portfolios the gses use shortterm bonds and financial derivatives when interest rates increase the gses must roll over their bonds with higherrate ones when interest rates decrease homeowners prepay their mortgages and the gses buy new ones at lower rates between july 2007 and july 2008 fannie maes gross mortgage portfolio rose from 730 billion to 758 billion fannie maes

decline delinquency rates on mortgages steadily increased between july 2007 and august 2008 some might conclude from this that in response to financial market conditions the gses were both trying to limit or reduce their portfolio sizes one advantage of reducing portfolio size is that it both raises capital and reduces the need for capital as cushion against deli nquency and sses the governments financial support and the elimination of capital requirements allow each of the gses to increase its mortgage portfolio by approximately 90 billion very inexpensively it can also sell new mbs without

because of the prepayments the gses could benefit because the new mortgages might be profitable and the increase in their mort gage portfolios coul d provide additional profit subprime mortgage can

of subprime borrower whose mortgage interest rate will increase in 2008 from 82 to 14 the monthly payment will increase from 3700 to 800023 the idea is that many subprime homeowners who cannot afford the subprime mortgage afte r the reset could afford the monthly payments of traditional 30year mortgage for calendar year 2007 even before changes to ofheos policy the gses could purchase and retain

might include mortgages forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34236crs10 26 in the secondary market investors bid on mort gages taking the contracted interest rates as given if investors want higher yield they offer lower price for mortgages investors might demand higher yield because the interest rates on alternative investments have increased or because risk has increased 27 this relationship breaks down after 2001 the reason appears to be in part due to the restatement of earnings by the gses and in part to net interest income almost doubling between 2001 and 2002 data source office of federal housing enterprise oversight mortgage markets and the enterprises in 2006 higherrisk lowincome borrowers jumbo mortgages energy efficient mortgages elderly reverse mortgages or mortgages ta rgeted to other populations often these policy goals involve mortgage instrument w ithout long track record or with which the gses or the investors who buy the gs mbs have little experience the gses historically have kept some types of nontraditiona l loans in their portfolios because they apparently are hard to package and to sell in mbs at price that the gses find attractive the gses with their experience have found them more profitable to retain than to sell allowing the gses to retain loans related to another policy goal in their portfolios would then result in lower interest rates to borrowers who meet the policys criteria26 also the gses might be willing to pur chase nontraditional mortgages related to another policy goal if there were ot her provisions that w ould make the overall change profitable after adjusting for risk and increased goodwill for example statistical analysis of combined enterpri profitability reveals that between 1983 and 2001 each 1 million of mbs outstanding dded 2200 to net income profit but each 1 million in retained mortgages or mbs added 5300 to net income27 in other words dollar in their retained portfolios generated more than twice as much profit as dollar of mbs sold to other inve stors arguably this increased profit from retaining mortgage in portfolio might be sufficient to induce the gses to buy nontraditional mortgages but only if the nontraditional mortgage s could be retained in portfolio allowing the gses to retain these mortgages would benefit nontraditional borrowers the gses would either ex pand existing lending programs such as nontraditional mortgages targeted to fu lfil their housing goals or create new programs the interest rates on these loan s would be higher than on prime mortgages the higher rate would compensate for th higher risk of default but the rates would be less than on mortgages financed out side the gses structure even so not every nontraditional borrower would qualify under the gses underwriting standards in light of fhfas statements detailing the reasons for placing fannie mae and freddie mac under conservatorship the future of the gses policy oriented mortgage purchases housing goals and contributi ons to the housing trust fund and capital magnet fund is unclear with the need to conserve capital to survive one could argue that these programs should be suspe nded one could also argue however that with the federal governments backing the need for capital is reduced and that the amount of capital that would be expende d for these programs is relatively insignificanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34236crs11 28 crs report rs22307 limiting fannie maes and fre ddie macs portfolio size by n eric weiss covers the risks from the gses portfolios in more detailrisk elements prior to conservatorship the costs of increasing the gse portfolio caps were mainly the costs of increased risk to the financial system28 it is difficult to compare potential costs against concrete benefits of increasing portfolio caps the gses manage many risks common to many businesse s in the financial sector these risks can affect the companies stockholde rs employees bondholders and business partners and because of their size the gses risks can also affect the nations financial system and the economy thes risks can be analyzed using the four categories discussed previously under conservatorship any losses in excess of the gses capital will be direct cost to the treasury while treasury states that it anticipates that the shortterm gse credit facility loans and mbs purchases will be profitable there is way to guarantee this suspension of dividends s saved funds for the gses at the cost of the stockholders who woul d have received them conclusion the gses portfolios include mortgages and mortgagebacked securities that are subject to credit risk prepayme nt risk interest rate risk and operational risk if these risks are mismanaged or if market movements turn unexpectedly against the gses the government faces two unsatisfactory alternatives either let the gses go into default and try to control the financial repe rcussions or step in and assume payments on the gses debt at taxpayer expense on september 7 2008 the government chose to assume gse obligations at taxpayer expense the issue of portfolio size will likely continue to be debated as policymakers consider what form the gses should take when they emerge from conservatorship
