releases and clears lecture given on 16 august 1966 well this is whats the date audience its the sixteenth august ad 16 so everything is moving up you know i think they told there were about 240 students on the clearing course there are 240 clears moving right straight on up the line and im i have bit of problem i have bit of problem with my own clearing i had 24 clears who were screaming for their ot course and i had to put together the first part of the ot course and i slipped and at the middle of session and so forth why my ta went to 3 and the needle went loose and then of course i started moving up to check up the bank to find out if anything was there so that i could get started on the ot course and what you did with the bank and there it went but i will try and get this condition remedied so that i can go out to qual and go backwards and get checked out thank you i lead terrible life actually i was an umpteenth stage release with completely floating needle one night two or three years ago about grade vi or something like that and i had time just time to drink cocacola before mary sue came back and started the overrun i was vi stage release for one cocacola what terrible life but people get to walking on your heels you know and you push along well anyway im going to give you lecture today about releases and clears because the probability is is maybe nobodys heard it yet you see because we found out that there were some people in the hgc that didnt know that so if there were some people in the hgc that didnt know it lord forbid why i imagine theres person or two on the saint hill course that doesnt know it i think that has probability and in view of the fact that this data is highly modern data very very modernized as data it probably is to some slight degree new data we have very bad problem as you know with the subject of releasing and it is problem of overrun and it has gone on for many many many years its gone on for so long that it practically obliterated all the results of dianetics and scientology and is the direct course of people walking around and saying dianetics and scientology doesnt work do you follow its that serious an error so it just held us up endlessly and there were certain phenomena which existed that one was not totally familiar with now i wasnt totally familiar with it because i wasnt familiar with the entire extent of the bank how much this bank was how big this bank is and so forth and i know that the queens counselor down in melbourne where theyve just had bad fire dont imagine that will be their last bad fire the queens counselor down there said he couldnt accept the idea of past lives because it meant he wouldnt go to heaven i got news for anything any man that dishonest just thinking about heaven is making mistake so you run into such phenomena we knew about those but how far back did it go what was the total extent of it in the early days we knew nothing about things like implantation there was tremendous quantities of data that was unknown and it was very easy to make this mistake now were not in bad company in making this mistake because about 2500 years ago exactly on this same line of research the identical mistake was made the identical mistake was made by gautama siddhartha buddha less and he did not appreciate the existence of bank at all and that work does not take into account that there is such thing as the mind or the bank thats whats missing out of that larry of work now there was another blunder made 10000 years ago along the line of philosophic research and there was chap called dharma and he was monk legendary and so forth and oddly enough his name today means fate in the more esoteric eastern philosophies and so on they speak of somebodys dharma and it gets perverted into karma and so forth but he is so legendary that his name now means something else but i think you can still find it recorded and the mistake there was believing that you had to you want to know how i know so much about this well ill tell you some day the mistake there was believing that you didnt have to do anything but become wise all you had to do was become wise and you would instantly become nine feet tall do you see now its from dharma that you get the tradition which most philosophers follow which is that if you became wise you would become free now theres almost anybody there is around is grooved in to that basic philosophy that is part of the woof and warp rug terms thats how you fix up rug dont want to give you any misunderstood words the its in the woof and warp of the entire culture that you become wise you become free and thats been going on for 10000 years on this planet started by dharma now that work has been totally assimilated now that one can exteriorize and that exteriorization brings about freedom is the premise of gautama siddhartha buddha and thats only 2500 years ago theyve got 7500 years yet to go before they assimilate that into the culture the way the philosophy of dharma was which means you poor bloke that youve got about 10000 less sixteen years to go before scientology is totally assimilated as the basic thing called philosophy or culture see so dont feel that youre going to catch up to this very rapidly if it took dharma 10000 years to get the point across that if you become wise you became free and if people still dont know about exteriorization 2500 years after the most popular and most numerous religion on the planet buddhism youve got 7500 years to go so sit it out you know were slightly ahead of our time in other zones of the universe the existence of the mind was known and in the i hate to have to bring these data out because lawyers when they listen to these tapes in order to condemn us you see say of course this is terrible to say things like this but i just hate to be on withhold all the time anyway in other parts of the universe in the galactic confederation they have psychotherapy which consists of recognition of the fact that at moment of fatal accident to thetan picture was made they know that that is but they dont really think it is picture they think it is location and they take picture of the location where he was injured and communicate to him in his unconscious state by snapping together thing that looks like movie clapboard you see they take this picture of the location and then they slap this movie clapboard in front of it and the thetan is supposed to do something to by shock or something to his concept of that location as an injurious location and so in some way blow the consequences of his injury that is that is therapy by the way that is administered to the releases in that society which go as ots ot releases and now that is their psychotherapy and that comes as close to anything were doing as anything else i know of in the universe of course there are many things could go on in the universe that i dont know anything about theres lots of things that could happen that one wouldnt have any trace of naturally but knowledge has tendency to get around and youll find out that if one being in one quarter of the universe is advancing along some certain premise why you will find out that it tends to advance in other parts of the universe i dont know but i dont think scientology will be contained very long on this planet i dont think it will be contained on this planet even this decade see itll be that that swift so anyway these were new thoughts particularly for this very backward and barbaric planet they if you dont think things were barbarous you should have had something to do and maybe you did with india of 10000 years ago there was slightest vestige of civilization it was really wild and howling amongst the wogs as they leaped up and down you know and to get point across that if you became wise you somehow became bit superior that was hard one to do so that was terrific advance its almost like trying to teach animals or something you know you cant even talk their language so that was big jump and eventually practically everybody on the planet agrees with that we have now some fantastic percentage of the taxation of this planet we thats whats left over from military appropriations is devoted to education the scarcity of universities here in england now is represented by the fact that one university which can accept 850 students this next term has 10000 applications and it is college of which i have never heard so you can imagine what some of the more popular ones have in terms of numbers well theres this terrific demand for education or selfimprovement now that you might not look at it first you see because it seems so banal so commonplace to you but the fact that man at this time is actually willing to invest time effort and money in the subject of making people wiser so as to make them freer is great testimony to this fellow dharma took him 10000 years to get one point across all right that was almost the totality of it there were other ramifications such as one could get free enough to ascend to very superior station you know like heaven or something you know there was connotation with regard to that but that wasnt directly attributable to dharma but by fellows who interpreted him afterwards he knew you knew that you could become free individual in other words there was freedom which was attainable but technology at all now 7500 years after that gautama siddhartha buddha discovered exteriorization and of course the term buddha comes from the bodhi tree since it was under bodhi tree that he first exteriorized now he thought you exteriorized by becoming wise following in the pattern of dharma now that religion has gone now into the majority of the areas of asia and did itself really civilize threequarters of asia that wasnt much information but he introduced several ideas along with it and one was that you should be civilized shocker nobody ever heard of that before you see just be polite and so forth you know very novel ideas well man has not yet accepted the idea that he should be polite but hes getting there in some areas of the world they have overdone it bit so as they cut each others livers out they say i withhold my foul breath from your face you see so this action of exteriorization was not in actual fact doable to any great degree the lama the lamaists came along afterwards and tried to develop some sort of technology and an explanation for all of this and so forth and you get squirrel buddhism which is lamaism thats right thats all it is and what buddha didnt cook up they thought they could and of course they were moving into zone where there was plenty to be found out but the big strike had been made by buddha which is that somebody can exteriorize now of course we are then gainers to the degree that there is some longevity to the idea of the soul that there is such thing as soul this has some longevity lot of people accept this where it goes what it does what it consists of they havent clue but that there is something called soul which goes someplace has actually dominated greek roman thought for very long period of time now its about 2000 years or something like that it also dominates various portions of africa and the middle east under another prophets name and so on but it is the same the same channel of thought that there is such thing called soul socrates is the primary originator of this in this hes the primary forwarder of the idea in our present philosophic history he said there was such thing as demon and so forth you see if youre not in greece youd never know the story of socrates you only get told the story of socrates in greece you dont read it out of philosophic textbooks quite interesting because theres sort of verbal tradition vocal tradition in greece concerning socrates which never gets into the philosophic textbooks so of course the thing which i have added is that philosopher should know something about life thats so novel that it has practically never been done before now socrates was holding forth for the existence of personal being or as we would say thetan and the religious ah bigots ah bums ah tramp ah the religious hierarchy excuse i was looking for that word having an awful time there they disagreed with this and they disagreed with this so thoroughly that they slipped him the hemlock and he was so henpecked at home that they couldnt even get him to escape from jail he went ahead and drank the hemlock just to make them good and guilty and he made them guilty man they still preserve his jail but then some time later sometime later the nicene creed was developed which we now have in the form of the dead sea scrolls and which was then put forward about hundred years after its original development by jesus of nazareth now he this church is having an awful embarrassing time with that but i dont see why they should have an embarrassing time of it so the guy was powerhouse and he had philosophy which had already kicking around and so forth that was pretty good but they have to acknowledge the existence of the dead sea scrolls dont you see and they date one hundred years before christ and they contain the new testament you didnt know about that there are some pocketbooks out on it and you should read them its very funny and the arabs get ahold of these things there are lots of them they find them all over the place now if they know where to look and the arabs get hold of them because they can get something like five pounds for little centimeter square scrap of one of these scrolls they tear em all up and then some high muckymuck some supersultan potentategodhelpus he figured out he was going to make real real grab out of it so he by force and other means managed to collect tremendous collection of these bits and he unfortunately let them be copied photographically and so he was never able to sell his collection hes still got it but these dead sea scrolls are terrific embarrassment to the christian church at this particular time i dont see why they should be but they are and all of this is simply the advance of buddhism as an idea into western culture and its easily traceable theres even the tradition of christ having studied in the east you know where did he disappear to for thirty years or whatever it was you know theres lot of these traditions and this doesnt make less out of some fellow who went through all that you know but it was pushing wisdom into the west and the west has been very very hard to push wisdom into the early monks of christianity tried to push wisdom into these areas up here and over there in scandahoovia scandinavia i didnt mean to use it as verb and into ireland into these chilly northern climes and they uniformly were spitted on stakes and chewed up and so forth the monks would come in and they would say that they were going to cure them up with some relics and so forth they were healers basically and they moved in and they were going to help the community and so forth and the answer was to skin them alive or some thing other delicate process so trying to push well the way paganism fought against the basic ideas of christianity and so forth is very gory chapter and the way the christians then fought against the nonchristians during the days of the spanish inquisition is also gory but by that time theyd lost most of the philosophy man had soul it was over there and it belonged to god and he was nothing and they had things pretty well scrambled up by the time buddhism had been transported in other words from india through the middle east to greece to spain to scandinavia to ireland or the north pole or something it was almost an unrecognizable idea now just giving you the scouted background history of this thing now the most that was ever achieved by any of these was type of release and since the beginning of the universe so far as we know there has never been anything but release there has never been clear there has never been cleared anything so that these are all forms of release dharma is release by wisdom buddhism that was release by exteriorization christianity release by repentance and being good and you have in actual fact then the total background history if you want to read about these chaps and know more about these chaps in fact it might make good fun but its those things which are there to understand in the light of what were doing today there are more complexions or complexities than that to understand about these i would be accused by any scholar of these works of considerable oversimplification but i could answer from the very interesting height of saying yes it took twenty years to make bodhi but we can make one in about twenty seconds and we can at far higher percentage it is so easy to do it is totally neglected we dont even do it theres point on this gradation scale somewhere which should contain thetan exterior or bodhi he could be almost anyplace but we in actual sober fact let it happen if its going to happen we let it happen and it could happen at zero i ii iii iv v vi it could happen in any of these areas and that it almost immediately unhappens does not then qualify it as stable release it isnt good lasting state as matter of fact after youve done it to somebody two or three times he becomes very anxious he thinks youre going to cost him his body or something of the sort you can pop him out of his head and after youve done it two or three times he begins to tell you that he isnt and he wants nothing more really to do with this because he thinks youre going to foul him up and he becomes anxious about holding on to the body people have bad experience after youve made somebody theta release youve just banged somebody out of their head theyre longer in their body thats all the psychiatrist looks on this with the greatest of askance because he occasionally in institutions finds as an inverse or an inverted exteriorization fellow who cannot get into his body and is going frantic and therefore he thinks anything in connection with exteriorization is insanity but then of course hes branding three quarters of asia insane but then naturally he is insufficiently cultured to know anything about asia so that would be it now this state of thetan exterior occurs and it just occurs and it can occur almost any time and anybody processing anybody sooner or later is going to get thetan exterior on his hands and what you do about it is shut up you say well thats it and you knock it off its the same as floating needle its visual manifestation which is different than what occurs with floating needle theyre not the same thing at all but its something you do not go beyond you dont go beyond floating needle on pc on the meter and you do not go beyond an exterior state dont say one more command or order of that level on which you are working or whatever you are working on shut up because if you go on any distance at all you will walk him right straight back into his bank and he will be very cross and justifiably so because youve unreleased him now after youve made one of these fellows you will find out that within the hour three days week he will have tangled up with more reality than he is prepared to confront in his somewhat tremulous uncleared state hes just release you see and hes been asked to walk in this big broad world barefooted and hes still got the anxiety and problem holding on to his body he doesnt know quite what to do about this hes afraid hell forget his body on the past track its happened to him before many times because you see it happens to him every time he dies and is associated in his mind with death and hes had unfortunate experiences when he could do it at will somewhere way back on the track leaving his body in the inn to pop off and do something of the sort and then coming back and find out theyd buried the body you see and hes lost his body and his possessions and so forth and he didnt like that it has very sour connotations with it because he is not competent to cope with the state at all hes way in advance of himself hes in actual fact on harmonic of ot an ot could care for it he cant care for it down here when he is dianetic release and maybe not even that you know and ill give you an actual typical experiences and so on im not making nothing out of buddha this was considerable advance this was something very remarkable indeed and it must have been remarkable if socrates copied it and then it became traditional thereafter which it did youll find by the way there are some here and there there are some primitive races who believe man has soul but scattered pieces of stuff its piece of truth that isnt easily camouflaged but for it to actually be worked on or admitted or something could be done about it something like that in culture was quite new so buddha when he exteriorized people and when he brought about exteriorization he brought it about through wisdom so the fellow had some kind of philosophy at least to back him up but as far as were concerned in scientology there is one little string of words that you take almost any human being out here anyplace and set him down in chair get him in some quiet place and say this little string of words to him and its going to happen in large percentage of cases its going to happen sixty seventy eighty percent some such percentage hes going to exteriorize man and certain number of them are going to exteriorize be total total reality looking around you know and certain number of them are going to be totally real outside the second they come back inside they say its unreal and didnt happen scared see and certain percentage of them will go out and back in without knowing anything ever happened except weirdly enough total change of personality takes place in front of your face and you find this amongst the insane there was so much about the insane the psychiatrist could have known about and could know about today if hed care to listen i have ive had an insane person sitting in front of not psychiatrist necessarily ive had an insane person sitting in front of and ive said the magic words had the person go totally sane backed out there to several feet back of their head totally sane able to reason solve their problem set it all up all squared around very happy to talk to about it totally rational and then back in insane but not quite as crazy this is remarkable well there is one notable scientologist in new york who said it over the air to several million people one time i often wondered what really happened when he did that that program since then has been very friendly to scientology its an allnight program long john but here is piece of technology which simply forces what is going to happen naturally sooner or later and you dont have to know trick ways to exteriorize somebody you see ill give you the magic words you might as well put them on tape put it on record someplace or another its try not to be three feet back of your head man is on such an inversion on the subject that he goes clang now the road of philosophy has been very very difficult and it has taken long time for basic philosophic idea to manifest itself in the society in which it has been expressed whats particularly notable about buddhism is that it was such clearcut truth that he advanced that it spread like wildfire within his lifetime and in the few succeeding lifetimes very short period of time he had almost well he had about threequarters of asia right there bang for instance he brought the first civil his people brought the first civilization to japan and those were within living memory of buddha and that is an awful long ways for that modes of travel of that day from northern india japan is quite far cry they brought the first shreds of culture to japan they brought writing and to this day the japanese use chinese writing pronounced with japanese vocabulary and that was brought to them by the first buddhist monks who came there but those fellows were very industrious and they got it fast but they had moved from state of man is meat to he is spiritual being and they had manifestations of this and they had rather powerful leader and there it went now this is and can be considered only sort of state of release through wisdom because they didnt have any command to tell anybody to back out of his head the fellow would simply become wise and they find out that when he became wise enough he would exteriorize they hoped they had lot of failures along this line its very difficult to do this because its boobytrapped by the bank now in one fell swoop with pause for breath we have capitalized upon the idea that man who is improved becomes free we have brought about twentyyear effort to exteriorize down to point where it can be done in about twenty seconds we have found what prevented the efforts of dharma from being perfect we have found the totality of what barriered buddhism here we are in society which in actual fact is only bolstered in its culture by dharma and buddha with the problem wrapped up now dont be amazed that youre having trouble carrying the word dont be amazed at all because the fate of missionaries and so forth carrying the word that there is man is spiritual being and that sort of thing has been rather grim but notice that the missionary was many vias departed from the truth notice this notice that he had some bank connected with his action very thoroughly it wasnt very clean truth its not condemnation of christianity anybody clear knows what i am talking about they went around they went around telling people they had to do this and do that and the other thing and they were using bank words now these chaps didnt have sufficiently pure version of it to do more than take over the society that is about the limitation of it they have civilized it to very very marked extent theyve done terrific job of it and so on but to bring society up that is more cultured than this one and as far as mans treatment of man is concerned this culture is about as high as cat fight it is scientific barbarism i assure you now the reason they didnt get any further than that is they were little bit too far from the truth there were too many vias you see there was the via of buddhism to socrates to christianity to organized christianity to the various arguments of christianity to you see and they were weak to that degree now compare this compare this with the buddhist spread within living memory threequarters of asia very fast but he was close to home on the subject of dharma you see he was capitalizing on dharma that wisdom would make you free this carries with it some interesting implications it carries with it the implication that there is possibility to be free you see that itself is terribly hard thing to teach men but asia knew it asia already had then spiritualism and religious background and he capitalized on that and threequarters of it zoom bang threequarters of asia thats on exteriorization which is an incidental but the final result of scientology now perhaps the speech in which all this was given was little more flowery perhaps there was wisdom perhaps lot of things but the truth of the general situation is that matter how information is conveyed if it is conveyed at all and it is truth it will take root so i dont look for you to go for the next 10000 years before scientology bites you see i dont look for you to have to wait that long i would say that the largest scope possible one could imagine for this particular society and so on basing it on other things and not giving anybody any pats on the back including the absolute outside will be something on the order of half century you see if buddhism could go that far in that span of short span of time on the limited result producible by buddhism and the rather barbaric atmosphere in which buddhism was spread was actually little more barbaric than the atmosphere in which we exist today and i would say that if you take half century to get scientology around youre really slow man you notice i said you now what are you then attempting and what are you achieving with being youre capitalizing in the first place as you first address this being youre capitalizing on the past indoctrination and belief of the being thats important for you to recognize because you will very often get terrible shock that in your inability to communicate any part of scientology recognize what youre communicating up against it was like it was like scientologist we had down in central africa the government was engaging on some groundnut program or something of the sort theres some of their wisdom but they were teaching soil erosion to the african scientologist went in on the project they were in despair they couldnt teach the african to you know prevent his soil from eroding they thought that was terrible and scientologist went in on it and he found out what they werent teaching him they werent teaching him the basic fact that soil should be preserved as soon as they started utilizing that as an idea why then the program made some progress well youre going to walk into people who have not heard the teaching of dharma now of course youre going to walk into everybody you meet practically and they never heard of dharma but somehow or other the wisdom of dharma has not come up through the line you run into them every once in awhile well what do you want to teach the people for theres one zone where theres horrible revolution going on right at the moment its not battle its just an underground cat fight going on in the middle of south america where the ricos in that immediate area who have been used to hiring the peasants for nothing and letting them live and die like pigs you see that these ricos have been walked in on sideways by the philosophy of dharma and it came from someplace and the peasants all of sudden have got the idea that they ought to become educated so they could become free and all hell is breaking loose because the ricos are trying to keep them from learning anything now and their economy is all going to pot and theyre going through the entire convulsion that old yeaandnay plantagenet went through in his days and so forth when the monks would get around and make certain people into clerks and this was not really thought well of amongst the feudal barony god knows what would happen if and it sure as hell happened and fast the philosophy of dharma got to them and there sat king john signing his name on the magna carta that is direct direct dissemination of that information its interesting its that one piece of philosophy you become educated youll become free the church had come in here they had educated people to read and write they had introduced manuscripts you couldnt say they had introduced books and theyd been chipping around at the edges here for some time and all of sudden why not only had people become more educated but people became free we have an example of it horrible backfire of this in 1936 in the spanish revolution now the spanish revolution was really begun by the philosophy of dharma you say oh heavens how you can possibly connect those up very easy the paperback was imported into spain in the decade previous to that revolution for the first time and cheap literature and the translations of the works of all the great french and english writers had occurred in spain and up to that time there was the ricos and the pobres the rich and the poor and there wasnt any other strata of society and as soon as the poor started assimilating and were able actually to buy books out of their pay you see before never before could they do this before sometime in the twenties and they could actually buy books and they started reading balzac and they started reading spinoza and and where were these fellows you know and they said we know something we should now become free they instantly boom and that was mostly because they had considerable resistance to their freedom thats the philosophy of dharma see thats thats fact you notice that it is fact well that was dharmas discovery now where you are going to fail is that somebody doesnt know soil should be preserved they dont know that wisdom sets anybody free and of course when youre dealing with somewhat fascistic governmental hierarchy the last thing in the world they want is free people or an educated people and when you see education being skimped and frowned upon and so forth then you know what type of government youre dealing with its government which has not yet reached the state where it has heard of dharma or its suspicious having maybe heard of it its suspicious that the phenomenon will occur and people will become freer they dont want anything to do with this they dont want anything to do with the philosophy and they are suppressive to the philosophy of dharma that people should become wise and therefore can become free now youre just cutting in too high now youre talking in the main here in the west to christian people who have heard of the soul but unfortunately it is an owned commodity that one should not play with and when they speak of their soul they are not speaking of themselves and therefore theres bit of counterphilosophy to the situation but these are the points you have to solve they are stunned at the idea that somebody could exteriorize so they are really not up to buddha they have gone past dharma but have not arrived at buddha and it is to those people that you are teaching scientology so you have to be careful not to go in over their heads now fortunately fortunately they do agree with the gradation scale of release and when you talk to them about exteriorization youre actually talking to them about something that doesnt make any sense to them on the subject of ot now you mustnt talk to them about ot now you can talk to them about clear they understand clear although they dont know anything about clear thats very peculiar thing but they understand that fellow does not have barriers to his thinking they understand that and they think that would be great so all you have to do is teach them that man shouldnt have barriers to his freedom in the form of his mind and that technology exists to move him up from that but do you know there are so many undercuts to that that you could teach him many undercuts and the first one actually it isnt factual that dianetics is the first undercut the public will accept dianetics but its relatively enlightened public that would accept dianetics dianetic processing actually belongs below zero and the old dianetic coauditor type rating and the hubbard dianetic auditor actually belong below the what we now call hubbard recognized scientologist and the degree is by the way being revived just for that purpose but youre already talking at very enlightened level the levels of scientology will be more easily assimilated by the public at large if we speak of grade 0 as recognition ah pardon communication process communication communication release just to put that little more distinct they can get the idea that itd be perfectly all right to have somebody communicate better now thats easily expressed and hes released from an inability to communicate now they immediately want you to apply that to stammerers and backwards children and people who cant talk and so forth and this gives you some difficulty because they themselves are standing there about as tonguetied with noncommunication as they can get telling you that would be fine for backward children and stammerers or something and youre not quite up to that dont you see man could communicate more freely now our next level here level i they could understand that man does better if he doesnt have problems perhaps they could understand that and so you could go on up the line and theres high probability there of the of making communication or connection with the situation comprehension trying to get people to comprehend what youre talking about but i stress to you again the fact that wisdom brought about freedom is the basic idea on this chain now do you see what i am getting at now that releases man from imprisonment by ignorance and that is your first form of release you teach person that if he learns something he would be freer and when he has learned that he is then released from the idea that he cant know so that is really your earliest stage of release and i would thoroughly advise your trying to argue with people on the basis of the first premise which is that of dharma and which is the direct and immediate ancestor of scientology you see theres your fundamental now of course you couldnt tell fellow named smitty that he ought to teach all of his africans population anything because he would instantly sense something would be very wrong with all this and he would start to feel very hunted he would be feel hunted in the extreme and so we find in that country there is free education anywhere anywhere it is all very expensive there is one little school it has two hundred and some children in it most of them africans and its taught by an american named howitz down there and theyve even had him up before the high court for daring to teach africans for nothing you see so they dimly feel that there might be such an idea that wisdom makes one free but if that idea exists theyre agin against it do you see they dont want anything to do with that idea not even the idea of it so that is your first level of release that is meaningful to you now of course there is lower level of release that if youre going to work with animals or something like that youre going to find out that theres lower level of release it is simply getting the idea its sort of lower harmonic of communication release it is simply getting the idea that one animal could in actual fact express an idea to another animal and i dare say youre going to find some races at some time or another someplace who do not yet have that idea so that would be lower level of release but it isnt common now so im neglecting it now you have to know youre in something before you can get out of it and that is the main difficulty in communicating levels of release thats its very interesting i mean you do you have to know youre in something before you can get out of it and people are not aware of the mind they see another bloke they dont see any mind the psychiatrist goes scratching his ribs up to the person and cuts out big section of his skull and sees brain so he says there is such thing as mind he does he says this bang because all he can see is brain well the brain is just neural shock absorber it has very little to do with thinking the number of maps i have seen of the various things which are found in various parts of the brain are only amusing by their numerousness because theyre all different the way the research was done originally was silly they took wounded soldiers who had lost certain portions of their faculties or expressions and so on and found out where the head wound was and then you know one case at time just one case for each thing you see if they were shot in the left side of the head then they would say well speech is contained in the left side of the brain you see because the fellow was wounded there and he couldnt talk i know lot of fellows whove simply been kicked in the pants that cant talk now your basic sweeping agreement then is something the society has already accepted and that is that person can become release or become more free or become released from some of his travail on the idea of becoming wiser now thats why you find philosophy is such an agreeable statement to people when you try to try to tell them about scientology as philosophy because youre simply telling them of the philosophy of dharma now your next level of release that was acceptable to the world at large that man is spiritual being now that is in decay that has been known and has been suppressed and has been suppressed since 1879 professor wundt leipzig germany i always like to remember the mans name man was an animal and he was nothing but an animal and therefore it was all right to kill him maim him shoot him do anything you possibly could to him because he was nyaa good see now this is something like some of the christian philosophy that was advanced in the second or third century ad that man was conceived in evil and was evil so it was perfectly all right to kill him maim him harm him do anything you wanted to do you see these things as justifications justifications for overts more than that so you have the entire what is laughingly called field of philosophy it is field too out there in the rain man you have what is laughingly called field of philosophy embracing now uniformly the idea that theyre dealing with rats or something well theyre not going to make very much progress and they could get themselves into one awful bloody revolution im not using that as swear word i mean bleeding revolution they could they could be cut down in the streets man because the christian has not yet found out that the psychologist is an atheist and there is atheism being taught right in the colleges and theres bunch of bigoted christians going to find out about that someday and theyre going to get mad fortunately for psych for psychology it is such an inarticulate subject that it hasnt made itself sufficiently plain to be understood that its an atheistic subject but if your psychologist were ever to succeed he would have to come closer to the truth than the brain is all that is there and man is dead forever because its very unpopular very unpopular but suppressives would like it and so psychology psychiatry and things like that tend to be supported by governments rather than by the populace the populace think anything is better they think psychology is silly but governments employ it so you see suppressives employ these nontruthful subjects or subjects which prevent philosophic advances or subjects which prevent releasing so your actual youd be surprised how far you could go just doing this you actually could move in to the whole subject on the subject convincing somebody that man was spiritual being see hes already halfway agreed with it well youre christian arent you oh yes yes yes you know he knows better than to say hes not christian he gets an autodafé well you find even in christianity you know the whole subject of reincarnation was barred very recently by the roman catholic church very recently only in the last few hundred years they carried reincarnation right along with them pocketypock they said the guy who hadnt been good enough had to come back and live it all over again and somehow or another they dropped that they had an edict of scrantes or something i dont know some stupid edict by which they abolished wisdom now therefore that man is spiritual being and not an animal you could become very involved with as an argument but if somebody bought the idea if somebody bought the idea that he was spiritual being rather than an animal you have then got state of release hes released from an untruth that could trap him now very possibly very possibly this is where you could use exteriorization but i do not advise it whats useful at this point is dianetics because person goes rapidly back but its little bit ahead of itself dont you see there isnt perfect answer to this ah guy goes back and only runs so many engrams and there he is sitting on the parapets of the castle you know watching the enemy march across the plain and he says what am i doing here this is obviously and he makes it up out of his own head that he must be an immortal being because he has lived before quite obviously dianetics will bring people up to that point but this is release from this lifetime person is released from the very narrow span of just one lifetime and that is terrific release because the death of the terrible consequences of death fall away he stands around and laughs as the funerals go by you know i mean i remember long time ago i was i had to pull off the road i had to pull off the road down in arizona to let funeral go by and boy peoples eyes were streaming so that it looked like rain falling out behind that funeral and boy everybody was real sad and i sat there and watched this you know and i just got through gauging on some researches into the immortal nature of man you know but it suddenly looked so silly to that i sat there and laughed like fool for about ten minutes i couldnt get the car going again i didnt dare drive it just suddenly seemed so funny all of this action with regard to this one thing you see such production and of course it was very big funeral and very sad one for banker of course they i knew hed never get to heaven i know he would be back there stirring it up again anyhow you in that fashion would take people out of the one lifetime idea and that is your tremendous breakthrough that is available to you because its release from the idea of one lifetime there is breakthrough for concentration which is quite acceptable to the society in which we exist now people do know fortunately there is such thing as mind theyve been told there is such thing as mind and they havent been taught well enough to know the psychologist is defining the brain as the mind so you catch the philosophy which has been put forward to them that men have minds and things go wrong with their minds that there are mental things about existence and just redefine it before it takes root you see what they mean theyre putting forward this philosophy is that people have brains which get their neurons crossed and you give them biochemical and electrostimuli of some kind or another or surgical stuff why you can do something with this brain mass you see well you move in just move in ahead of this and you say the mind well yes theyre speaking of mental image pictures what well have you ever had picture now you see looking at b never sees bs mind so it doesnt come through to him that b has mind see if hes very very wog why he thinks b only has brain see thats getting pretty wog now the only thing you have to put across is that because this fellow has mind that fellow has mind thats just different new observation now right on the heels of that will follow that hes immortal with little dianetic auditing he cant help but find it out do you see now youve released him from the idea that man is matter youve released him from the idea that he only has one life and these are stages of release now when youre teaching people realize that you are working in the field of releasing people realize that that you can in actual fact by talking to people release them but you start crawling up the line here very far and youre going to run into far more mass mental mass than you can easily talk them out of by the time you get to here skip it by the time you get to vi it would be fatal to try to talk them out of it and if you tried to talk them out at class well thats thats not all youve got to do is pass despatch with vii materials on it through the lines and you have wheres janie oh shes in the hospital what happened to her she came down with appendicitis yesterday well what happened thats right im not kidding i theres too much too much horsepower now the funny part of it is theres technology up here that the clear doesnt notice lot of clears go suddenly what whats this interest but you should recognize that an ultimate in release would be release from the universe true you say whos going to fool around with the things that makes the universe is somebody going to fool around with whats making the universe and so forth somebodys going to fool around youll be glad to know that we have now got policy letter out which forbids destructive actions you see so you see you can very rapidly go outside of peoples head what they did in melbourne during that inquiry down there this guy peter williams just cons insisted on spinning people with past lives he just all he would talk about was was grade v stuff you see all the way up the line and hed let them get subjective reality on it and it spun them that was what upset that whole thing he wouldnt follow any order i gave him hes had himself ball now recognize then that when we use the word release we mean freeing now we can free somebody of an idea which enslaves him or entraps him and recognize that all traps are basically ideas and if man can be talked or persuaded out of certain idea you have freed him to that extent so the word release is best understood on the basis of freeing somebody from something now as we progress from grade 0 up see ive already shown you there are many grades of release below zero we are now getting extremely sophisticated when we get to grade 0 this is very sophisticated level of release we are actually starting to free him from his selfmanufactured trap called mind and were starting to free him directly and intimately as spiritual being and were working on it right at that point just as surely as though were digging ditch and we release him from ideas that he cant communicate and we make communications release now the funny part of it is to do that weve got to actually pull him out of little bit of mass that he is in that tells him he cant communicate do you see so from here on were not only pulling him out of ideas but were also starting to pull him out of his own mental mass now at this level class vii we dont pull him out of any more mental mass we turn around and eat the tiger we eradicate mental mass erase it now that of course is again form of release that we call clear it means hes cleared the being of his reactive mind but we note hes still in the universe hes still associated with body hes still in the universe and still this and still that in other words there are some grades of release above this but in actual fact that is such triumphant level for man to attain that you find not many people below it look any higher its quite adequate its big its quite absolute very nearly absolute now when you see on this meter this needle somewhere between 19 and 325 we will allow for the slight vagaries of your setting the trim knob and you see this needle get floppy and its little bit hard to set this for moment shut up because you released him from something now of course you probably have to know why to get him through qual that is really too bad but you would best do it from your auditing notes not from the pc now accidentally anywhere from the moment that the guy hears about the fact that wisdom will make him free on up to some idea that he is spiritual being on up through to grade 0 or i or ii or somewhere up the line the guy at any time may blow out of his skull you may even find somebody that isnt in one hes very surprised why other people are in their heads horrors ive actually run into one or two youll actually run into this thing called an exteriorization now that is relatively premature manifestation which will remain very unstable now most states of release have certain degree of stability and those which we have listed and those that im talking to you about have stability of sort of sort the guys ideas get invalidated he gets invalidated that hes spiritual being somebody chops him up somehow or another he gets suppressed something like that and he gets over the idea and so on and he ceases to manifest as release but wait minute he is actually not as bad off as he was before release never unreleases to the same degree of stygian dark that they were in before they got released now this then this then is what we mean by release what we mean by clear is an erasure of the mental mass which inhibits their thinking postulating and so on you should see clear postulate on meter its very interesting ive got couple of clears right now that are doing little bit of fooling about with the first part of the ot course and theyve skipped couple of steps in the ot course and now they are finding various banks its very interesting its very interesting because they really have not discovered that theyre quite capable of postulating bank so after they postulated it they havent bothered to blow it thats very silly i received almost hilarity report two reports from two of them and i obediently checked them out it was quite obvious what they were they have not realized they are very skilled people they can make bank now this is what you are doing with human beings these are the states you are attempting to achieve with human being these are the manifestations of having achieved it the emeter in the early days i used ahh kidding hey and that would be release and in the early days this was so good that dianetic clear were making them now were making dianetic clears again ive gotten two or three thankyou despatches and things like that were making dianetic clears but of course dianetic clear is actually merely release and unfortunate but they strangely enough have approximately the same manifestations that are described in book one and the way we started making them again is we stopped overauditing man was making his releases too well its something on the order of you make release this guy becomes let talk at about it at lower level the guy got the idea completely hes got it now hey you know gee thats true that if i knew more i would be freer gosh that is right you know and you start teaching him that if he knew more he would be freer now at the moment he realized that and you had him on this meter his needle would have floated and his needle would have floated quite handsomely but if youd continued to teach him his needle would have ceased to float almost right away now what fools you is that release lower level releases now let get this mystery explained for you lower level release is released at the level theyre released at and there are higher levels of release to be attained and they dont so much relapse as go into the sticky plaster of the next level that they are going to have to climb to get all the way out do you see so they in actual fact in auditing very rapidly unless you just suppress them by continuing to audit the same gain which they already have which is sort of an arc break not acknowledgment or so forth but when they walk out of that session and come back in the next morning and they havent got floating needle realize they have simply moved up into the mass of the next strata they should be released in they havent unreleased you understand that so dont overrun them and dont get worried that they fold up awful fast as matter of fact ive considered it sort of sort of like the indian you know he has several different types of pony and youve noticed all the indians horses along hitch rack and these indians horses will be tied with different knots of greater and greater complication until you finally get to knot which is very complicated thats tying up this one pony well this one at the end the other end you see hes just dunce because he can he cant even untie just dropping the reins across the hitch rack you see but this other one up at the other end hes such clever pony that he can untie any kind of knot anybody could dream up so they have to tie the most complicated knots anybody ever heard of to get the pony to stand there you see and they call him an enterprising pony now if you have release who for some reason best known to man or beast insists on staying there with floating needle for days and days and weeks and months and if you were to pick him up year from then and still find his needle floating i would tell you you had very unenterprising pony hes become smarter so he should become speculative at that point because its quite natural sequence these sequences of release and if he was able to think or act to look around at all of course he would dive into the next level very promptly now does this make the whole subject of release seem little clearer to you i hope it does because the next audience i have to tell when needle floats and goes free you stop the process and that is proper end phenomena for any conversation or any process anyplace up to grade vi im going to collect dollar piece from them be watch it dont be part of that audience but thats what barriered the way not knocking it off and not acknowledging the fact that such states existed now in this lecture you could probably also find ways and means of dissemination you could probably spot your errors of dissemination i dont say that there arent additional methods of dissemination but im just pointing out those that have been startlingly successful and which in actual fact are the dominant points of philosophy in our society today where they are lacking the society is barbarous and where they are present the society is advanced therefore you could fully expect society to get very barbarous on psychology since it has yet to assimilate the principles of buddhism that tells you how backward any race is is how far have they moved up that line now the other the other thing that is interesting to note before i close is that releases seem to want other people to be released and clears want other people to be cleared and all of this is very heartening if that fact which is quite accidental did not exist and so forth why the whole of the race would be hopelessly lost and if man were not basically good it would be extremely dangerous to improve him improve his abilities would be very dangerous but he happens to be basically good anybody who tells you basically man is basically evil of course is fixing you up so that you then will be afraid to make somebody good now you can have great many qualms about clearing or releasing even somebody who is benighted villain should i release him well dont dont worry about his activities after hes released because these will be better his abilities will be better but so will the nature of his activities dont worry about that worry about it on the basis of has he got good enough statistic that im going to do him this much favor and dont release people to make them better for other peoples sake it is something which is reward it is not something which has to be done and that is why i always object to dianetics and scientology being used only on backwards children classes because i think the geniuses in the class are really the ones who need it now therefore i hope this will be of some small use to you when you find yourself sitting there looking at somebody and he has just asked you this embarrassing question what is scientology maybe if you remember this lecture it will help you know where to chip in at what moment and what to tell him about thank you very much thank you
