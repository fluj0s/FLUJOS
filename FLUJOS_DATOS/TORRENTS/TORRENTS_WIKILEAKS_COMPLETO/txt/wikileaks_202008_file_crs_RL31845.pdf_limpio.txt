identification of information to be released pursuant to these laws may be discretionary subject to agency interpreta tion and risk analysis the white house and the department of justice recently widened the applicability of sbu critics say the lack of clear sbu definition complicates designing policies to safeguard such information and that if in formation needs to be safeguarded it should be classified others say that wider controls will deny access to information needed for oversight and scientif ic communication pl 107 296 required the president to issue guidance on safeguarding sbu

which were expect ed to be released during 2003 federal controls on privately generated scientific and technical information several laws permit the federal government to classify privatelygenerated scientific and technical information that could harm national security even when it is not held by federal agencies these laws deal with patent law secrecy and atomic energy restricted data patent law secrecy pursuant to 35 usc 181188 the us patent commissioner has the right to issue patent secrecy orders to prevent disc losure of information about an invention if disclosure by granting of patent woul d be detrimental to the national security this provision is applicable to patent for which the government has property interest and those privately developed inventions which the government does not own thus if federal government agency has property interest in the invention the agency head will notify the patent commissioner who is to withhold the publication of the application or the granting of patent if the government does not have property interest in the patent and the commissioner decides that the granting of patent or publication of an applica tion would be detriment to the

invention be kept secret and shall withhold the grant of patent for such period as the national interest requires the owner of the application may appeal the decision to the secretary of commerce the invention may be kept secret for one year but the commerce secretary may renew the secrecy order for additional periods as instructed by the agency head who initially determined the need for secrecy1

policy was to be applicable to all federal executive departments and agencies including their contractors which electronically transferred stored processed or communicated sensitive but unclassified information43 during 19861987 criticisms about ntissp 2 focused on both the scope of information to be restricted and th responsibility given to the intelligence community over civilian information activities these led to the withdrawal of both ntissp 2 in 1987 attendant to passage of the computer security act of 1987 and to official use of this definition of sensitive but unclassified44 however as will be noted below some agencies notably the department of energy still use this broad conceptualization of sbu the computer security act of 1987 pl 100235 in the computer security act of 1987 pl 100235 101 stat 17241730 40 usc 1441 congress declared improving the security and pr ivacy of sensitive information in federal computer systems is in the public interest and hereby creates means for

protected and are responsible for protecting such sensitive information46 in 1992 the national institute of sta ndards and technology nist issued guidance about agency implementation of systems to protect sensitive information pursuant to pl 100235 it reiterated that interpretation of the computer security acts definition of sensitive is ultimately an agency responsibility ty pically protecting sensitive information means providing for one or more of the following confidentiality disclosure of the information must be restricted to designated parties integrity the information must be protected from errors or unauthorized modification availability the information must be available within some given time frame ie protected against destruction47 the nist document urged agency informati on owners to use riskbased approach to determine harm of inadequate protec tion of information in defining this discretionary process it emphasized information owners not system opera tors should determine what protection their information requires the type and amount of protection needed depends on the nature of the information and the environment in which it is processed the controls to be used will depend on the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from the loss misuse or unauthor ized access to or modification of the information contained in the system48 because pl 100235 applied to sensitive information that is not classified some say in effect it defined sensitive but unclassified computer security in relation to the freedom of information act the freedom of information act of 1966 f oia was enacted to ensure public access to certain types of information held by federal agencies however it permits agencies to exempt from public disclo sure nine types of

itive also the report accompanying the legislation said specifically the designation of information as sensitive or as subject to protection under th computer security act is not determination that the information is not subject to public disclosure52 however major federal agencies started to apply the label sbu to information defined as sensitive in the computer security act and to information

foia memorandum the ashcroft foia memorandum establishes new sound legal basis standard governing the department of justices d ecisions on whether to defend agency actions under the foia when they are challenged in court this differs from the foreseeable harm standard that was employed under the predecessor memorandum under the new standard agencies should reach the judgment that their use of foia exemption is on sound footing both factually and legally whenever they withhold requested information in the predecessor memorandum issued by attorney general janet reno in 1993 agencies were encouraged to release doc uments even if the law provided way to withhold information if there was foreseeable harm from doing do the october 2001 memo underscored the need to ensure that information about agency deliberations not be made public and encouraged agencies to make disclosure determinations under foia only after full and deliber ate consideration of the institutional commercial and personal privacy interests that could be implicated by disclosure of the information78 also referring to the need for height ened sensitivity after the september 2001 terrorist attacks the oc tober 2001 memo instructed agencies to utilize foia exemptions when making an agency assessment of or statement regarding the vulnerability of critical asset 79 or the need to protect critical infrastructure information referenced in the memo as cr itical systems facilities stockpiles and other assets from security breaches and harm and in some instances from their potential uses weapons of

freedom of information act it is sometim difficult for foia officers to immediately recognize the sensitivity of information warra nting protection under the acts exemptions one type of record for which that should not be so however is record in which an agency specifically assesses its vulnerability or that of another institution or installation to some form of outside interference or other wrongfu l harm indeed vulnerability assessments can be among the most sensitive records maintained by federal agencies vulnerability assessments generally are signed to ensure the security of an institution or installation by safeguarding ag ainst possible interference circumvention or unlawful action by outsiders typically vulnerability assessment first seeks to identify an institutions assets programs or systems that are deemed to be most sensitive in so doing it usually pays particular attention to the ones that are believed to be for one reason or another especially vulnerable to extern harm further in analyzing an item of identified vulnerability such an assessment co mmonly will describe the specific security measures as well as possible countermeasures that can be employed to combat that vulnerability thus by its very nature vulnerability assessment necessarily consists of sensitive information that in the wrong hands can itsel f do great harm oip guidance protecting

regarding implementation of this guidance in 35 agencies indicated that while few agencies such as nasa epa and the depa rtments of the interi or and navy had to undertook significant activities to

change with regard to the likelihood of their agencies making discretionary disclosures about one third of the foia officers reported decreased likelihood of these officers 75 percent cite the new policy as top factor influencing the change111 in contrast others have c oncluded that the effects are serious for instance the lawyers committee for human rights in 2003 report described as an example dod refusal to release an unclassified c onference report on lessons learned from the 2001 anthrax attacks and conc luded the homeland secur ity information provision represents sweeping new

research reporting should not be restrict ed and that vague and poorly defined categories of research information such as sensitive but unclassified should not be used experience shows that vague

national security working group composed of sc ientific and security leaders which will hold continuing discussions to try to develop workable publications policy125 other groups some scientists including dr ronald atlas president of the american society for microbiology126 have suggested that the scientific community should come together to discuss the issu of balancing secrecy in science and scientific publication in move similar to the 1975 asilomar conference which helped to develop guidelines for information communication and institutional review boards to monitor and control the developm ent of genetically modified organisms some suggest that perhaps the national academy of sciences or committee of relevant professi onal society be established to eval uate whether parts of methodology of especially sensitive re search should be published127 reportedly dr anthony fauci director of the nih national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid which is receiving the bulk of funds allocated to nih for counterterrorism rd said on october 3 2002 that while tr ansparency in publication should be the norm consideration should be given to developing s pecially appointed committee to determine whether publicati on is appropriate he ggested the formation of panel to determine whether it is appropria to pursue certain types of biomedical research similar to the asilomar conference128 others have suggested that only certain kinds of sensitive research be restricted or classified such as research relating to the weaponization of biological and toxin agents129httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31845crs36 130 icsu is nongovernmental organization founded in 1931 to bring together natural scientists in international sc ientific endeavour it comprises 101

unclassified information introduction as explained above some federal agenci use the definition of sensitive in the computer security act of 1987 as the ba sis for identifying information to label sbu other agencies have expanded the definition of sensitive in various ways with some agencies including information ex empt from release under foia and others including other kinds of information determined to be sensitive to particular agencys activities following the rrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the administration instructed agencies to w ithhold more information when undertaking discretionary disclosure liberations under foia agen cies were instructed to balance access to information with the n eeds to protect criti cal infrastructure information national security law enforcem ent effectiveness agency deliberations and decisionmaking and rela ted values and interests and to use specifically foia exemptions 2 and 4 when making such deliberations they were also told to consider on case by case basis benefits that result from the open and efficient exchange of scientific tec hnical and like information these actions have raised significant policy issues such as allegations that the terms sensitive and sbu are ambiguous because they are subject to agency interpretation this some sa makes it difficult to identify and safeguard such information while raising questi ons about the need for unifor mity in standards some say expanded interpre tation of foia exemptions 2 and 4 to identify sbu divides those who want increased secur ity of information from those who want public access to the information now exempted in order to protect public and community oversight civil liberties nd accountability to promote the conduct of science or to monitor private sector activ ities the procedures mandated in pl 107 296 are intended to guide agencies toward th use of similar procedures to identify share and safeguard sens itive but unclassifed homeland security

1997 op cithistorical controversy about sensitive but unclassified even before the terrorist attacks of 2001 there had been considerable controversy about the meaning and use of the term sbu one position is that agencies should interpret the term more broadly to categorize and safeguard more information as sbu alternatively others say that this category is often imprecise and leads to indiscriminate withholding of information from the public for instance february 28 1994 report redefining security by the joint security commission prepared for the director of the cia and the secretary of defense which according to the federation of american scientists fas was the first significant postcold war examination of government security policies and practices142 estimated that as much as 75 of all governmentheld information may be sensitive and unclassi fied it recommended that more attention should be paid to protecting such information and labeling it as sbu within the defense intelligence and other sectors of government as we ll as information that while neither classified nor governmentheld is crucial to us secur ity in its broadest sense continuing it said we have in mind information about and contained in our air traffic control system the social security system the ba nking credit and stock market systems the telephone and communications networks and the power grids and pipeline networks all of these are highly automated systems that require appropriate security measures to protect confidentiality integrity and availability143 in contrasting position the aforem entioned moynihan commission report entitled report of the commission on protec ting and reducing government secrecy 1997 noted that agencies ofte n use different types of ma ndates to justify protecting unclassified information and these range from the very broad to specific this causes problems because virtually any agency employee can decide which information is to be so regulated there is oversight of th is categorization and agencies control access though needto know process and the very lack of consistency from one agency to another contributes to confusion about why this information is to be protected and how it is to be handled these designations sometimes are mistaken for fourth classification leve ls causing unclassified information with these markings to be treated like classified information144 as result the commission concluded that more information is protected than is warranted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31845crs40 145 chap v information age

develop policy to address sensitive but unclassified information but it met with great resistance by both the civilian side of the government and industry b ecause the process was controlled by the security policy board which dealt largely with classified information and was contro lled by the defense and intelligence community145 the report also found that overzealous labeling of information as

find it extremely difficult to measure laboratory performance yet the department tends to treat this information as if subject to security measures not unlike those for classified information it is considered when developing background checks for foreign visitors and when reviewing presentations that may involve sensitive unclassified information the lack of management discipline around sensitive unclassified information both hinders the scientific enterprise and reduces the ability of security and counterintelligence professionals to control information where necessary147 the csis commission recommended that doe avoid using the definition and label sbu by avoiding these labels it said the depar tment can depart from treating unclassified information as if subject to national

during the 107th congress congressional interest in this topic was reflected in recommendation made by th congressional joint inquiry into september 11 which among other things recommended review encompassing the concepts of sensitive or classified information congress should also review the statutes policies and procedures that govern the national security classification of intelligence information and its protection from unauthorized disclosure among other matters congress should consider the degree to which excessive classification has been used in the past and the extent to which the emerging threat environm ent has greatly increased the need for realtime sharing of sensitive information the director of national intelligence in consultation with the secretary of defense the secretary of state the secretary of homeland security and the attorney general should review and report to the house and senate intelligence committees on proposals for new and more realistic approach to the processes and structures that have governed the designation of sensitive and classified information the report should include proposals to protect against the use of the classification process as shield to protect agency selfinterest151 critiques of the white house card memorandum while many observers agree with the objectives and implementation of the march 2002 card memorandum in order to

contrary to information management policy prescribed in presidential directives or agency regulations the supremacy of stat utory law would seemingly prevail one critic of the march 2002 white house memo cautioned that the term sensitive but unclassified may be the most danger ous level of secrecy because it was not defined in the past and there were channels of appeal153 similarly others say that administrative mechanisms ve been developed to allow those who disagree with the decision to withhold info rmation to challenge the decision or to seek some remedy to the decision to ma ke this policy work the federal government needs to develop procedures that will allow citizens the ability to disagree with the conclusions of the agency denyin g or withholding the information154 policy options for sensitive but unclassified information some who seek to clarify policies for controlling public or private scientific information that is not classified believe that scientific pr ogress and innovation and even the fight against terrorism will be harmed by limiting information flow yet these critics share the goal of trying to keep potential terrorists from obtaining information that could be used to threaten the united states some have called for closer cooperation between the scientif ic and intelligence community to draft guidelines relating to safeguarding scientific information that might be useful to potential terrorists155 these conflicting objectives raise perplexing dilemmas for policymakers and scientists alike polic options discussed be low focus on several parts of this debate including establishing uniformity in definitions and implementing guidelines establishing an appeals process for sbu information and the potential to classify or label as sbu more research information considerations related to uniform definition of sbu since agencies define the term sbu differently various interpretations could lead to the possibility that information that should not be released to the public because of its potential value to terrorists might be released that agencies might not release sbu information to other agencies or to state or local officials or that the public may be denied access to information whose rel ease might be permitted questions abouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31845crs43 156 for an assessment of these issues see sensitive but

that is beyond information not routinely released to the public such as law enforcement data personnel information and information on computer vulnerabilities to include also conceptualization of sbu

above ag encies have discretion to identify and withhold from the public as sensitive or as sensitive but unclassified information which they determine is subject to nondisclosure pursuant to both the computer security act of 1987 and the administration s interpretation of foia since the basis of these determinations is subject to interpretation both agency program managers and the public who might seek access to such information may confront ambiguity in definitions and different kinds of balancing tests there are questions about the uniformity of definitions used by different agencies and

implementing them and appealing adverse decisions with the ppeals procedure outside the originating agency176 they said that the guiding principles could be formulated as set of questions such as is the information otherwise available in public domain or can it be readily deduced from first principles if the answ er is yes then there is valid reason to withhold it and doing so would undercut the credibility of fficial information policy is there specific reason to believe the information could be used by terrorists are there countervailing considerations that would militate in favor of disclosure ie could it be used for beneficial purpos documents that describe in detail how anthrax spores could be milled and coated so as to maximize their dissemination presumptively pose threat to national security and should be withdrawn from the public domain but not every document that has the word anthrax in the title is sensitive and even documents that are in some ways sensitive might

applies the prohibition to fundamental or what it defines as basic and app lied research during 2001 nd 2002 the heads of several federal agencies with subs tantial research responsibil ities who did not have classification authority under executive order 12958 the prevailing executive order on classifying information177 were given original cla ssification authority these include the secretaries of health and human services178 and of agriculture179 and also the administrator of the environmental protection agency180 some of the agencies with new classification authority especially health and human services and agriculture support substantial amounts of counterterrorism research as well as of fundamental research in variety of scie ntific and technical areas often performed on an extramural basis by researchers in colleges and universities181 new executive order 13292 issued on march 25 2003 amends executive order 12958 on classified nati onal security information the amendment permits classification of scientific technological or economic matters relating to the national security which includes defense agai nst transnational terrorism new clause in italics sec 14 the ame ndment appears to highlight that national securityrelated scientific technological and economic information dealing with defense against international terrorism may be classified given that the definitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31845crs49 182 the definition of national security is the same in both executive orders it reads national security means the national defense or foreign relations of the united states 183 aaucogrnasulgc letter to ostp director on scientific openness jan 31 2003 from president association of american universities president national association of state universities and landgrant colleges and president council on governmental relations httpwwwaaueduresearchltr13103htmlof national security in the two executive orders is not changed and that definition could have encompassed matters related to transnational terrorism it is unclear if the amended order widens the scope of scientific technological and economic information to be classified182 in addition the department of defense reportedly plans to reissue its guidelines relating to prepublication revi ew of extramural research that it funds outside of its own laboratories recently several univers ity groups wrote letter to the director of the office of science and technolog policy complaining that more agency program officials are inserting prepublication review clauses into contracts including for fundamental research without ex planation as to their justification this has pernicious effects they said not only with regard to the freedom to publish but also with regard to employment of foreignborn students and researchers on federally funded research projects if the contract clauses requi re blanket screening of any and all foreignborn scientists universities will object183 agencies which were given original classification authority in the last few years are now developing impleme nting guidelines and appointing security officers in operating units given the longstanding fe deral policy embodied in executive order 12598 and in nsdd 189 of not classifying basic scientific research except if release would threaten national security the balan ce between science and security in agency guidelines will remain topic of interest and concern interest in this topic may be heightened because of the recent changes made in executive order 13292 to the definition of the kinds of scientific chnological and economic information that may be classified the scientific and academic communities are expected to pay close attention to these issues among the questi ons that may be raised are will new controls be placed on fe derally funded research including both intramural research conducted in an agencys laboratories and on extramural research that might be federally f unded but conducted in nonfederal academic and indus trial research laboratories will controls encompass both classification levels and use of designations such as sensitive and sensitive but unclassified will designation of controlled research project be made before theaward of funds and the start of project or after project is completed and during pre publication review phase what kinds of requirements will be placed upon nonfederal researchers to safeguard research information how will such controls affect th conduct of academic research for the federal government

with original classification authority modify their longstanding policies of encouraging publication and dissemination of fe derally funded research results under the expanded definition of scientific and technological information subject to classifi cation in executive order 13292 will agencies classify information that might have otherwise been categorized as sbu appeals process for sbu information another continuing issue is expected to be an appeals process for designating information as sbu stephen aftergood with the federation of american scientists fas suggested that an appeals panel that is outside of the originating agency and that therefore does not have the same bureaucratic interests at stake would significantly enhance the credibility of the deliberative process th efficacy of such an appeals process has been repeatedly demonstrated by an ex ecutive branch body called the interagency security classification appeals panel iscap184 another suggested approach is that to solve disputes that develop out of the new category of sensitive but unclassified information one could allow the information security oversight office part of the executive branch to receive appeals to review disputes and challenges to executive agency decisions regarding the release of documents and reports the office would oversee the appeals it would have another set of eyes that would examine the requested information and review it in different context that the executive agency the isoo might be able to work with both the agency involved and those requesting the information to reach compromise that everyone could accept it would also have the effect of keeping the oversight of the information in the hands of the executive branch185 determination of tiered access to sbu information some agencies have discussed developing procedures to permit tiered or selective access to qualified and prescreened indi viduals for some scientific and technical information that could be categorized as sbu or shsi reportedly epa re quires researchers to obtain sponsorship from senior epa fficial have their requests approved in advance and register before us ing the envirofacts database186 epa also has issued instructions to utilities to submit threat or vulnerability assessments to the agency using protocol issued in december 2002 reportedly epa will keep sensitive

restricted data controls were explained in document prepared in 1989 by arvin s quist classification officer at the oak ridge gaseous diffusion plant oak ridge national laboratory which is operated on contract for the department of energy192 excerpts below from the quist document explain the releva nt provisions of these laws in the atomic energy act of 1946 congress established special category of information called restricted data restricted data was defined to encompass all data concerning the manufacture or utilization of atomic weapons the pr oduction of fissionable material or the use of fissionable material in the production of power193 thus by operation of law nearly all atomic nuclear energy information fe ll within the definition of rd the atomic energy act authorized the aec to control the dissemination of rd specifying as prerequisite to access to this information that an individual must have security clearance two particularly unique and signifi cant aspects of rd warrant emphasis first positive action is not required to put information into the rd category if information falls within the acts defi nition of rd it is in this category from the moment of its origination that is it is born classified the government has power to determine that information is rd only the power to declassify rd in practice the government dep artment of energy determines whether information falls within the definition of restricted data the born classified concept is unique with rd this concept assumes that newly discovered atomic energy information might be so significant with respect to the nations security that it requires immedi ate and absolute control national security information is not so designat ed until an original classifier makes positive determination that the informati on falls within the definition of nsi although rd is said to be born cla ssified the atomic energy act does not specifically designate it as classified information the act defines rd and prescribes very strict methods for its cont rol without stating th at it is classified information however the act does desc ribe declassificati on of rd therefore by implication rd is classified second unique aspect of rd is that information does not have to be owned or controlled by the government to be classified as rd the circumstance could even arise in which an individual could originate rd and then not be allowed to possess it because of lack of security clearance or need to know the atomic energy act does not forbid an individual to generate rd but once rd is generated the act prohibits its communication to persons not authorized to receive it httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31845crs53 in 1951 congress amended the atomic energy act of 1946 to make certain atomic energy information available to other countries for purposes of weapons development but the national security council had to approve these information flows the atomic energy act of 1954 amended the 1946 act to include an increased emphasis on wider dissemination of atomic energy information to make more of it accessible to us industry nd to the world in order to permit the development of nuclear reactors for co mmercial production of electric power as consequence of president eisenhowers 1953 atoms for peace initiative the quist document says with respect to the control of information the 1954 act stated it shall be the policy of the commission to control the dissemination and declassification of restricted data in such manner as to assure the common defense and security consiste nt with such policy the commission shall be guided by the following principles until effective and enforceable inte rnational safeguards against the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes have been established by an international arrangement there sha ll be exchange of restricted data with other nations except as authorized by section 2164 of this title and b the dissemination of scientific and technical information relating to atomic energy should be permitted and encouraged so as to provide that free interchange of ideas and criticism wh ich is essential to scientific and industrial progress and public understanding and to enlarge the fund of technical information 42 usc sec 2161 the 1954 act added industrial progress public understanding and enlarge the fund of technical information as reasons to disseminate atomic energy information those additions provided the basis for the subsequent declassification or downgrading of much atomic energy information the 1946 act had permitted declassification of rd only when the aec determined that it could be published without adversely affecting the common defense and security the 1954 act changed adversely affecting to undue risk thereby shifting the balancing test towards declassification of more information the increased emphasis of the 1954 act in disseminating atomic energy information is further exemplifie d by continuous review requirement prior to the atomic energy act of 1954 private persons could not have access to rd for commercial purposes eg velopment of commercial nuclear power reactors the only reason for allowing private persons to have access to such data was on needto know basis in connection with national defense work although the 1954 act envisioned the commercial development of nuclear energy the act contained express provisions permitting access to rd for commercial purposes this hurdle was overcome in 1956 when the aec used its administrative powers to establish an access permit program under this program permitted is able to have access to rd applicable to civil uses of atomic energy for use in his business trade or professionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31845crs54 194 source is
