on iran offers assurances on gtmo returnees and security ref kuwait 137 classified by dcm tom williams for reasons 14 b and d 1 snf summary interior minister jaber alkhaled sabah told ambassador february 16 that he is deeply concerned about iranian actions particularly in yemen with the houthis security hardliner whose views do not always reflect those of the rest of the gok shaykh jaber suggested iran is intent upon exporting its revolution and can only be deterred by force from achieving its nuclear ambitions he characterized iran as the beating heart of islamic extremism adding that even palestinians now aspire to be shia because they have bought iranian stories about shia being more prepared to fight to the end and stand up to israel now iran is trying to infiltrate egypt exploiting poverty there ambassador emphasized usg effort to pursue pressure track with iran on yemen she suggested many of yemens problems were homegrown and required economic and social solutions at least as much as military ones shaykh jaber concurred calling president saleh leader with an nco mentality who thinks he can buy loyalty when what is needed is strong honest government and firmer security measures ambassador sought gok assurances on legality and intent to ensure monitoring and withholding of travel documents for any future gtmo returnees noting that without those firm commitments the cases of the remaining two kuwaitis in gtmo may prove difficult to resolve the minister promised more formal response but offered his personal assurances that travel documents would not be issued and said monitoring of the last two returnees was constant and ongoing ambassador also raised the need for gok outreach to the parliament to prioritize passage of pending legislation to criminalize terror financing shaykh jaber said politics was hindering progress on this issue and on many other important bills including one to criminalize cyber crimes but said his ministry was committed to pursuing radical extremists and ensuring the safety of americans in kuwait with or without new laws end summary iran on my mind 2 snf the blunt and outspoken minister of interior shaykh jaber alkhaled sabah told ambassador and dcm february 16 that iran is his major concern iran is intent upon exporting its revolution and shiism has gameplan and will only be deterred from achieving its objectives including nuclear weapons capability by force the us will not be able to avoid military conflict with iran if it is serious in its intention to prevent tehran from achieving nuclear weapons capability in yemen the houthis have shown remarkable resilience where is their power coming from yemeni extremists are making money from the drug trade moving narcotics into saudi arabia the gok has been able to block some of the flow of these drugs from saudi into kuwait but remains very concerned about this iran is involved clearly as producer of drugs and facilitator of transit along the afghanistaniransomaliayemen pipeline now iran is trying to expand its influence in egypt seeking to exploit poverty there and infiltrate the security services iranian mythology resonates 3 snf shaykh jaber said that the sunnishia balance in the region is at risk and chaos could ensue iran is calling the shots in iraq and has so convinced the region of its stories that shia and iran will fight to the end where others will not that only the shia and iran really stand up to israel that now many palestinians want to convert to shiism as consequence iran has become the beating heart of islamic extremism the minister apologized for speaking so frankly but said he wanted to clearly convey what is of greatest concern to the gok 4 snf note the interior ministers concern about iran may have been informed by couple of recent incidents briefed february 17 to the us navy lno at the kuwait navy base see iir septel for details in one incident on february 6 irgc navy speedboats harassed kuwaiti fishermen in more serious incident on february 15 and again on february 16 three irgc navy speedboats approached joint kuwaitsaudi oil terminal in international waters located in the alhout field off mina azzour approached as close as fifty meters and lingered for fortyfive minutes on the first occasion but only fifteen minutes the second time perhaps kuwait 00000142 002 of 003 as result of the presence of the kuwaiti patrol boat istiqlal that was dispatched to the terminal to hold station after the first incident end note pressure track and yemen clarification 5 snf ambassador took issue with the ministers characterization of irans role in iraq and then moved to review us efforts along the pressure track with iran in yemen iran may doubt try to exploit the situation with the houthis but the causes of the conflict were largely internal and would require yemeni president saleh to pursue political and social effort as well as military campaign as was noted in the recent london conference many of yemens challenges are ones of governance shaykh jaber agreed characterizing saleh as having an ncos mentality that you can win everything with money when what is needed is less corruption and more proactive security posture the minister noted that kuwaiti salafists are sympathetic to the cause of the southern secessionists in yemen and are being watched by the gok he stated however that kuwaitis are actively involved in the fighting ambassador noted that some in the us intelligence community believe that considerable number of kuwaitis are involved with alqaeda particularly in the afpak theater shaykh jaber said kuwaitis tend more to be sympathizers than practitioners but said they all were being watched closely gtmo assurancesclarifications needed 6 snf the ambassador raised the issue of the remaining two kuwaiti gtmo detainees and sought the ministers confirmation that the commitments outlined in the latest draft diplomatic note on oversight of returnees particularly with reference to constant monitoring and withholding of passports were both legal and accurately reflected gok intent clarification of the pending assurances would likely be necessary given the greater seriousness of the cases against the remaining two the minister promised more formal response later and made clear that he could not interfere with the activities of the judiciary but said he was sure the two most recent returnees did not have passports and characterized their level of monitoring by the security service as so close they can smell us and feel our breath on the back of their necks need for passage of aml law 7 snf the ambassador as she had earlier with the foreign minister reftel noted that kuwait is now the only country on the arabian peninsula not to have criminalized terror financing pending law is before parliament but speaker jassem alkhorafi had commented privately to the ambassador that the government had not made its passage priority for the current legislative session shaykh jaber responded that politics was getting in the way of much needed legislation not just tf but also bill to define cyber crime the minister offered his assurances that the gok is very serious on the matter of terror financing and facilitation with or without the law and was committed to this and to protecting americans in kuwait at the close of the meeting the ambassador provided shaykh jaber with drop copies of two previous requests for information on alleged antiamerican plotters in kuwait acknowledging that these could be poison pen cases but requesting formal response from the ministry to ensure appropriate due diligence had been done comment 8 snf shaykh jaber survived noconfidence vote in parliament late last fall but the gok expended only enough effort to ensure his victory by relatively narrow margin the reported cost of that governmental support arranged by prime minister from whom shaykh jaber is estranged was shaykh jabers acceptance that kss chief athbi alfahad sabah would report directly to the pm not to the interior minister as has traditionally been the case the interior ministers tough and candid talk on iran consequently while it offers useful insight into the private worries likely shared by many of kuwaits seniormost leadership should not necessarily be seen as an articulation likely to result in any meaningful gok policy initiatives kuwait 00000142 003 of 003 for more reporting from embassy kuwait visit visit kuwaits classified website at httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalkuwa it jones
