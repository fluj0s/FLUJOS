expansion of the alliance has triggere d broad debate about natos purpose and future since the end of the cold war natos missions have been evolving the clinton administration believes that enlargement will enhance natos ability to strengthen those new missions and build stability in europe during the cold war natos overridi ng objective was to deter or defend against an attack on western europe by the soviet union and its allies collective defense has been the cornerstone of the alliance expressed in article v of the north atlantic treaty where each member pledges to assist another unde r attack with such action as it deems necessary including the use of armed force to restore and maintain the security of the treaty area1 today russian conventional forces are in disarray and russia could not become thr eat to its neighbors for at least decade however most allied states continue to emphasize natos traditional core mission of collective defense in the event that russia one day again adopts threatening posture officials in candidate states privately emphasize that they view collective defense under article v as the principal reason for their desire to join nato in the 1990s in the absence of russian threat the alliance has taken on new missions such as peacekeeping peaceenforcing crisis management and humanitarian assistance according to natos strategic concept of 1991 endorsed by all members of the alliance risks to allied security are less likely to result from calculated aggression against the territory of the allies but rather from the adverse consequences of instabilities that may ar ise from the serious economic social and political difficulties arising from ethnic and territorial disputes in central europe2 allied force posture reflects this change the positional defense characterized by heavy armored divisions of the cold war has gradually changed into lighter more mobile forces for projection into areas beyond natos current borders

related to natos missions is influencing the selection of candidate states current members do not wish to see enlargement dilute the political likemindedness and military capability of the alliance at the same time most member states recognize that stability in central europe could be enhanced by admitting states with demonstrated record of building democratic structures settling longstanding disputes with ne ighbors and opening their markets to competition and investment even if the path to these objectives is not yet fully travelled candidate states must be ab to contribute to natos missions that contribution however may not be immedi ate in the view of the clinton administration and the european allies fe w if any of the prospective candidate states could today contribute meaningfully to countering an article v threat nato members reason that since there is ch threat for the foreseeable future candidate states could firs t be admitted then develop capacity over the next decade to contribute to collective defense and participate in the nearer term in other less demanding missions3 current members are evaluating candidate states therefore with several considerations in mind in the effort to maintain public support one concern is that nato develop coherent purpose in an era when not easily defined risks such as nuclear proliferation have replaced the once readily identifiable threat of the soviet union concern about possible nationalist backlash in russia against enlargement has led to the negotiation of the founding act between nato and russia as well as prospective initial enlarg ement that will not include c ountries once part of the soviet union4 lingering concerns remain among many current members about the political stability of prospective members and about their capacity to contribute concretely to the alliances defense posture and to the costs of enlargement some current members are reluctant players in the enlargement process and have other concerns with priority over enlargement the future course of the european union eu key to stability on the continen t european monetary union emu and attendant budgetary

in 1952 germany in 1955 and spain in 1982 in each instance one protocol wa s submitted to member states for approval ie there was one protocol in 1952 that named both greece and turkey and not separate protocol for each state th accessions ccurred during the cold war and the admission of these four states was not controversial in the united states the admissions of greece and turkey and th germany were approved by wide margins in the senate and spains by voice vote the senate and the executive branch viewed the admission of these count ries as contributing to the strategic weight of the alliance against the soviet union there has not been an occasion in which an accession agreement was negotiated with an aspiring member and that aspirant was then rejected the senate foreign relations committee in considering the north atlantic treaty in 1949 commented in its report th at the admission of new members might radically alter our obligati ons under the pact the committee therefore sought and received commitment from president truman that president would consider any admission of new member to constitute new treaty requiring the advice and consent of the senate this practice s been followed in admitting each new state twothirds of all senators present in the chamber must vote to consent to ratification of the protocol admitting state the protoc ol enters into force when the president signs it5 brief history of the current enlargement debate the clinton administration backed above all by germ any proposed expansion of the alliance at the january 1994 nato summit at that summit some allies wished to explore the issue before committing themselves to admit new members the allies established the partners hip for peace pfp program at the 1994 summit pfp provides framework

more candidate states to begin accession negotiations it noted that the alliance will remain open to the accession of further members the communiqué stat ed the goal is to admit new members by the time of natos 50th anniversary in april 19998 most european allies wished to establish relations with russia on firmer footing before proceeding with enlargement in 1996 france proposed negotiation of natorussia charter that would outlin cooperative framework in security matters the clinton administration wa s at first doubtful bout the proposal but allied support for the idea ultima tely led to negotiations in which the united states played key role on may 27 1997 the ne gotiations resulted in document called the founding act it touched upon wide range of issues nato reiterated that it had intention plan and reason in the fores eeable future to station nuclear weapons on new members soil but that it may do so should the need arise nato further stated that military infrastructure adequate to assure new members security under article v of the north atla ntic treaty would be maintained on their territory the alliance pledged not to place substantial combat forces in the current and foreseeable security environment on new members territory but underscored an intention to increase inter operability integrati on and reinforcement capabilities with the new states the foundi ng

issues such as agreement over new alliance command structure enhancing partnership for peace and further refinement of the combined joint task forces concept will be pursued as well11 on june 12 1997 president clinton announced that the united states would support the candidacies of poland the cz ech republic and hungary for admission to nato administration officials believe that these three states have made the most progress in reforming their militaries developing democratic institutions and free market and ensuring civilian control of the military they also believe that there is consensus in favor of these three countri but not over additional countries in this view pursuing smaller enlargement of three rather than larger one of five states promises greater chance of success when the issue is before member state legislatures several additional c onsiderations contributed to the administrations decision to support only three countries an enlarg ement of three countries would presumably be less costly given the expenses likely for current members in supporting the modernization and restructuring of new states militaries in addition decisionmaking in the alliance is already cumbersome and smaller enlargement would be easier to assimilate the adminis tration also wishes to underscore that enlargement is an open process effort s by romania and slovenia to qualify for entry and the two countries support within the alliance make them possible future candidates should first enlargement in fact take place and the new members prove to be productive allies admin istration officials have sa id for approximately year that the baltic states militaries are not sufficiently strong to contribute meaningfully to collective defense some us and allied officials

romanian military and the intelligence service slovenia has small defense force able to make only minimal military contribution to nato some allied states contest such an evaluation and have vowed to pursue invitations to romania and slovenia at madrid12 officials of several allies may concede that civilian control of the military in romania is insufficient but argue that it is at least the equal of poland furthe r they believe that excluding romania in particular after significant strides forw ard in building democracy could be political setback for reformers in strategically key balkan country negotiations for accession if in fact candidate states are selected at the madrid summit negotiations for accession will begin almost immediately us and allied officials wish to complete the

officials will discuss several issues with candidate states one issue will be the process of integration into natos command structure nato has been in the process of streamlining the command structure and has adopted gene ral commitment to give european officers more commands another issue will be costsharing arrangements in natos three budgets the strategic investment progra m covering fixed installations such as airfields fuel pipelines and telecommunications installations used in common by all members in the deployment and operation of forces the civil budget for paying natos international civilia n staff and the military budget for paying the international military staff at nato h eadquarters and the alliances major commands each member state pays an agreed proportion of these budgets the proportion being decided on the basis of gross domestic produc t and other economic factors upon completion of these discu ssions the governments of candidate states will write to the nato secretary general to indicate that they will abide by the north atlantic treaty and that th ey understand their commitments under the integrated command structure and the alliances budgets15 another issue has been quietly raised with prospective ca ndidates several current allied governments ve told prospective candida tes that should they enter the alliance they must not veto future candidate states such commitment can only be informal since the treaty provides every state once member with veto over prospective member the discussions have centered upon countries that have experienced historical animosity towards their neighbors for example there have been longstanding disputes between pola nd and ukraine and between hungary and romania over issues such as borders and ethnic minorities series of bilateral treaties addressing most of these issues is now in place for the most likely prospective candidates the intention of these discussions is to warn candidate state upon becoming member against usin g its position to addr ess bilateral issues in manner detrimental to the alliance16 all candidate states under serious consideration have public ly pledged not to veto future candidacies allied views on enlargement member states have different concer ns and perceptions about enlargement some governments of nato members have expressed little enthusiasm for

belgium also has some concerns that additional nato members may complicate the alliances decisionmaking process britain the labour government of prime minister tony blair supports smaller rather than

said that those new members that come in are democracies and have the military capability to make contribution as well as to demand guarantee from nato he declined to name britains candidates for entry but stated that the baltic states would not be invited in first round of invitations19 reportedly however britain most strongly supports poland the czech republic and hungary and some officials have indicated that slovenias candidacy is also acceptable the british government wishes to see the alliance rema in open to future expansion in the debate about sharing the costs of enlargement both labour and conservative party officials believe that brita ins efforts to restructure and modernize its forces for power projection as agreed under the alliances strategic concept of 1991 must be

specific candidates for nato membership have emerged in the context of their thinking over the proper roles of nato and the european union france s endorsed eu enlargement but wishes to pro ceed

volker rühe was an early advocate of nato enlargement in 1993 chancellor kohls s upport has been more guarded largely due to the importance of maintaining german ys good relations with russia because

view to admit hungary alone would be setback for those in romania who have worked to resolve controversial bilateral issues with hungary at the same time some dutch officials acknowledge th at romania has not yet established effective civilian control of the military the baltic states in the dutch view cannot be readily defended an enhanced pfp regime is thus appropriate for the baltics and there can be firm timetable for their entry into nato until the alliances relations with russia improve significantly as in many allied governments officials of the netherlands are divided over the issue of enlargement costs many officials emphasize the importance of nato being able to act under article v for th em costs will be key factor in the enlargement debate because they desire adequate funding for collective defense other officials believe that due to the current absence of threat enlargement costs should be modest the nether lands constitutional process is expected to produce an evaluation

not follow the same provisions for revision of treaty for the most part however the practice is similar to that of the united states when new member is to be admitted the treaty is viewed as new

in the senate chamber is required to consent to ratification and admit new member and most other allied states require some form of legislative approval with the notable exceptions of britain and
