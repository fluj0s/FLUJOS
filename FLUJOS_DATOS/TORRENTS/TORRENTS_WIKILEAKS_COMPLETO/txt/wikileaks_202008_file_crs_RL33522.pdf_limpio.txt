house reports as well as investigations conducted by the g overnment accountab ility office and the inspector general of dhs laid the groundwork for the consideration of alternative organizati onal

committees house of representatives report on september 15 2005 the house of representatives approved hres 437 whic h established the select bipartisan committee to investigate the preparation for and response to hurricane katrina referred to as the select committee the activities of the committee were summarized in its final report as follows the select committee held nine hearings over the course of approximately three months select committee members and staff simultaneously conducted scores of interviews and received dozens of briefings from local state and federal officials nongovernmental organizati ons private companies and individuals who provided or offered external suppor t after katrina and hurricane victims select committee members and staff traveled numerous times to the gulf coast the select committee also requested and received more than 500000 pages of documents from wide array of sources5 the committee report presented findings but did not include recommendations it noted successes such as national weather service forecasts efforts of search and rescue operations and implementation of interstate mutual aid agreements the majority of the reports findings howev er identified shortcomings and failures although none of the findings specifically addressed organizati onal issues some of the findings arguably indicate that failures may have been associated with problems involving implementation of agency missi ons questionable aspects of leadershiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33522crs3 inappropriate interage ncy coordination mechanisms or lack of clarity about shared responsibilities the committees findings that appear particularly relevant to the pending legislation include the following with the text presented verbatim from the report it does not appear the president received adequate advice and counsel from senior disaster professional the secretary of dhs should have convened the interagency incident management group on saturday two days prior to landfall or earlier to analyze katrinas potential consequences and antic ipate what the federal response would need to accomplish the secretary of dhs should have desi gnated the principal federal official pfo on saturday two days prior to landf all from the roster of pfos who had successfully completed the required training unlike thenfema director michael brown considerable confusi on was caused by the secretarys pfo decisions the homeland security operations center failed to provide valuable situational information to the white house and key operational officials during the disaster federal agencies including dhs had varying degrees of unfamiliarity with their roles and responsibilities under the national response plan and national incident management system earlier presidential involvement might have resulted in more effective response lack of communications and situational awareness paralyzed command and control dod department of defensedhs coordination was not effective during hurricane katrina dod fema and the state of louisiana had difficulty coordinating with each other which slowed the response national guard and dod response operations were comprehensive but perceived as slow the coast guards response saved many lives but coordination with other responders could improve dod has not yet incorporated or implemented lessons learned from joint exercises in military assistance to civil authorities that would have allowed for more effective response to katrina northern command within dod does not have adequate insight into state response capabilities or adequate interface with governors which contributed to lack of mutual understanding and trust during the katrina responsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33522crs4 6 ibid pp 25dod lacked an information sharing protocol that would have enhanced joint situational awareness and communications between all military components search and rescue operations were tr emendous success but coordination and integration between the military services the national guard the coast guard and other rescue organizations was lacking top officials at the department of hea lth and human services and the national disaster medical system do not share common understanding of who controls the national disaster medical syst em under emergency support function8 deployment confusion uncertainty about mission assignments and government red tape delayed medical care contributions by charitable organizati ons assisted many in need but the american red cross and others faced challenges due to the size of the mission inadequate logistics capacity and disorganized shelter process6 in addition to the hearings and inte rviews conducted by the select committee oversight hearings before nine other house

national security homeland security and counterterrorism professional development programs of federal departments and agencies to identify opportunities for further integration overview of findings and recommendations the house senate and white house reports include common elements that appear pertinent to s 3595 hr 5316 and hr 5351 all conclude that failures of leadership and initiative compromised efforts to provide necessary assistance to victims and communities coordination problems and failu res to fully integrate response procedures plans and systems among federal agencies were also common findings with particular attention given to the role of the principal federal officer pfo the homeland security operations center and dhs dod and hhs fficials in addition to these failures the reports noted the critical role of regional offices in building relationships with state and local governments one significant difference between the congressional reports and the white house report concerns examinations of the qualifications of the leadership in fema and dhs notably the experience and training expected of leaders both the househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33522crs10 11 the statutory authorities amended by the h ouse bill reflect committee jurisdictions the house transportation and infrastructure committ ee exercises jurisdiction over the stafford act whereas the house homeland security committee has jurisdiction over the hsa 12 incidents of national significance include but are not limited to presidential major disaster and emergency declarations as well as events that require the involvement of multiple federal agencies and situations that re quire federal involvement at the secretarys discretion see us depart ment of homeland security national response plan as amended washington 2005 p 4and senate reports c oncluded that problems stemmed at least in part from leadership shortcomings on the other hand the white house report focused on failures of process systems and planning not the ex perience or qualificati ons of top officials comparison of pending legislation the house bills that have been acted upon during the 109th congress adopt different approaches to the issues iden tified in the congressi onal and white house reports some of the more significant differences between the two house bills are the following organizational location hr

authority hr 5316 would amend the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act 42 usc 5121 et seq hr 5351 would am end the homeland security act or hsa 6 usc 101 et seq11
