these requirements2 chamber offices of security and security manuals the chambers have approached their security program differently although each now has an office of security the senate estab lished an office of sena security over two decades ago in 1987 as the result of bipar tisan effort over two congresses it is charged with consolidating info rmation and personnel security3 located in the office of the secretary of the senate the security office sets and implements uniform standards for handling and safeguarding classified and other sensitive information in the senates possession the security offices standards procedures and re quirements detailed in its senate security manual initially issued in 1988 are binding upon all employees of the senate4 these cover committee and member

investigations of suspected security violations by employees the house put its own security office in place under the jurisdiction of the sergeant at arms in 2005 following approval of the chambers committee on house administration5 the new office similar to the senate predecessor is charged with developing an operations security program for the house its responsibilities and jurisdiction

information7 comparable acrosstheboard requirements for security clearances or secrecy agreements yet exist for all house employees but these could be applied by the new office of secur ity when it becomes fully operational secrecy oath for members and staff the house and senate differ with regard to secrecy oaths for members and staff beginning with the 104th congress the house adopted secrecy oath for all members officers and employees of the chamber before any such person may have access to classified information he or she must solemnly swear or ffirm that i will not disclose any classified information received in the course of my service with the house of representatives except as authorized by th house of representatives or in accordance with its rules house rule xxiii cl 13 110th cong previously similar oath was required for only members and staff of the house permanent select committee on intelligence its requirement had been added in the 102nd congress as part of the select committees internal rules following abortive attempts toestablish it in public law 8 it is still in effect for members and staff i do solemnly swear or affirm that i will not disclose or cause to be disclosed any classified information in the course of my service on the committee except when authorized to do so by the committee or the houses of repres entatives committee rule 14d 110th cong other adoptions have occurred under committee rules the house committee on homeland security for instance requires an oath from each member officer and employee of the committee or nonmember seeking access similar to one developed by the house intelligence committee each must affirm that i will not disclose any classified information r eceived in the course of my service on the committee on

security breaches the senate office of security and th house counterpart are charged with investigating or coordi nating investigations of suspected security violations by employees in addition investiga tions by the house and senate ethics committees of suspected breaches of security are authorized by each ch ambers rules directly and indirectly the senate ethics committee for instance has the broad duty to r eceive complaints and investigate allegations of improper conduct which may refl ect upon the senate violations of law violations of the nate code of official conduct and violations of rules and regulations of the senate sres 338 88th cong the panel is also directed to investigate any unauthorized disclosure of intelligence information from the senate intelligence committee by member officer or employee of the senate sres 400 94th congress the house in creating its permanent select committee on intelligence issued similar instructions hres 658 95th cong ordered the committee on standards of official conduct to investigate any unauthorized disclosure of intelligence or intelligencerelated information from the house intelligence committee by member officer or employee of the house sharing information with noncommittee members procedures controlling access to classified information held by committees exist throughout congress these committee and cham ber rules set conditions for sharing such information with other panels and members determining who is eligible for access to committees classified holdings directly or who can be given relevant information the most exacting requirements along all of these lines have been developed by the house permanent select committee on inte lligence the rules are based on its 1977 establishing authority hres 658 95th cong and reinforced by intelligence oversight provisions in public law such as the 1991 intelligence authorization act pl 10288 105 stat 441 the panels controls appl to committee members sharing classified information outside the committee itself9 as well as to noncommittee representatives seeking access to the panels holdings in this case the requester must go through multistage process committee rule 10 110th cong thus it is possible for non member to be denied attendance at its executive sessions or access to its classified holdings when the house intelligence committee releases classified information to another panel or nonme mber moreover the recipient must comply with the same rules and procedures that govern the intelligence committees control and disclosure requirements by comparison rules of the house armed services committee committee rule 20 110th cong ensure access to information by any member of the committee or any other member delegate or resident commissioner of the house of representatives who has requested the opportunity to review such material proposals for change variety of proposals coming from cong ressional bodies government commissions and other groups have called for changes in the current procedures for handling andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20748crs5 safeguarding classified information in the custody of congress these plans some of which might be controversia l or costly focus on setting uniform standards for congressional offices and employees and he ightening the access eligibility requirements mandate that members of congress hold security clearances to be eligible for access to classified information this would mark significant departure from the past members of congre ss as with the president and vice president justices of the supreme court or other federal court judges have never been required to hold security clearances most of the proposal s along this line appeared in the late 1980s recent one however was introduced in 2006 by representative steve buyer hres 747 109th cong would have required secur ity clearance for members serving on the house permanent select committee on intelligence and on the subcommittee on defense of the house appropriations committee the resolution does not specify which entity legislative or executive branch would c onduct the background investigation or which officer in congress or in the executive would adjudicate the clearances the broad mandate for such clearances could be applied to four different groups 1 all senators and representatives thus in effect becoming condition for serving in congress 2 only members seeking access to classified informati on including those on panels receiving it 3 only members on committees which receive classified information or 4 only those seeking access to classified information held by panels where they are not members under security clearance requirement background investigations might be conducted by an executive branch agency ch as the office of personnel management or federal bureau of investigation by legislative branch entity such as the house or senate office of security or the governme nt accountability office or possibly by private investigative firm under contract po ssible adjudicators that is the officials who would judge based on the background i nvestigation whether applicants would be trustworthy and therefore eligible for acce ss to classified information could extend to the majority or minority leaders speci panel in each chamber chamber officer or even an executive branch officer if congress so directed the main goals behind this proposed ch ange are to tighten and make uniform standards governing eligibility for access for members pr oponents maintain that it would help safeguard classified information by ensuring access only by members deemed trustworthy and thereby limit the possibility of leaks and inadvertent disclosures in addition the clearance process itself might ma ke recipients more conscious of and conscientious about the need to safeguard th is information as well as the significance attached to it as corollary supporters might argue that mandating clearance to serve on panel possessing classified information could increase its members appreciation of the informations importance and its protections priority th is in turn might help the committee members gain the access to inform ation that the executive is otherwise reluctant to share and improve comity between the branches opponents by contrast contend that security clearance requirements would compromise the independence of the legislatur if an executive branch agency conducted the background investigation had access to th information it generated or adjudicated the clearance even if the process was fu lly under legislative control concerns might arise over its fairness impartiality objectivity and correctness if determined by

resident commissioner officer or employee of the houseinexperienced person the effects of negative judgement on member both inside and outside congress and the availa bility of information gathered in the investigation which may not be accurate or substa ntiated to other members or to another body such as the chambers ethics committee or justice department if it is seen as incriminating in matters of ethics or crimina lity opponents might contend moreover that adding this new criterion could have an adverse impact on individual members and the full legislature in other ways opponents also mainta in that it might impose an unnecessary unprecedented and unique among elected fede ral officials and court judges demand on legislators create two classes of legislator s those with or wit hout clearance affect current requirements for nonmember acce ss to holdings of committees whose own members might need clearances possibly je opardize participati on by members without clearances in floor or committee proceedings even secret sessions and retard the legislative process while investigations adjudications and appeals are conducted direct senators or senate employees to take or sign secrecy oath to be eligible for access this proposal would require secrecy oath for senators and staffers similar to the cu rrent requirement for their h ouse counterparts an earlier attempt to mandate such an oath for all members and employees of both chambers of congress seeking access to classified information occurred in 1993 but it was unsuccessful if approved it would have prohibited intelligence entities from providing classified information to members of congress and their staff as well as officers and employees of the executive branch unless the recipients had signed nondisclosure agreement pledging that he or she will not willfully directly or indirectly disclose to any unauthorized person any classified inform ation and the oath had been published in the congressional record 10 direct all cleared staff or just those cleared for the highest levels to file financial discl osure statements annually this demand might make it easier to detect and investigate possible misconduct instigated for financial reasons and many staff with clearances may already file financial disclosure statements because of their employment rank or salary level conse quently few new cost s would be added nonetheless objections might arise becau the proposal would impose yet another burden on staff and result in additional recordkeeping and costs this requirements effectiveness in preventing leaks or espi onage might also be questioned by opponents require polygraph examinations ndor drug tests for staff to be eligible for access to classified information under such proposals tests could be imposed as condition of employment for personnel in offices holding classified information only on staff seeking access to such information or for both employment and access11 objections have been expressed to such tests however because of their cost and questionable reliability
