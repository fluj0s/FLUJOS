and would have provided for expeditious habeas review of cases where child public safety oﬃcer or state judge was killed the 110th congress may consider similar issues at issue for congress is whether it should further restrict state prisoners access to federal habeas relief by limiting the federal role in policing constitutional violations in the states criminal justice systems two issues have emerged as congress considers such legislation trial ﬁnality and adequate representation proponents contend that restricting state prisoners access to federal habeas relief is necessary due to many prisoners ﬁling excessive and frivolous claims that result in backlog in the system and substantial delays in the processing of these cases critics contend however that many states criminal justice systems are ﬂawed with many indigent defendants lacking proper representation throughout all stages of the criminal justice system they ar gue that for many defendants the writ of habeas corpus plays key role in restoring justice when the system failshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33259 order code rl33259 federal habeas corpus relief background legislation and issues updated january 12 2007 lisa m

relief background legislation and issues summary federal habeas corpus is the statutor procedure under which state and federal prisoners may petition the fede ral courts to review thei r convictions and sentences to determine whether they are being held contrary to the laws or the constitution of the united states in 1996 congress passed gislation that rest ricted prisoners ability to seek relief through the writ of habeas corpus the 109th congress considered legislation that would have further restricted state prisoners access to federal habeas relief and would have provided for expeditious habeas review of cases where child public safety officer or state judge was killed the 110th congress may consider similar issues at issue for congress is whether it should further re strict state prisoners access to federal habeas relief by limiting the federal role in policing constitutional violations in the states criminal justice systems two issues have emerge d as congress considers such

frivolous claims that result in backlog in the system and substantial delays in the processing of these cases critics contend however that many states criminal justice systems are flawed with many indigent defendants lacking proper representation throughout all stages of the criminal justice system they argue that for many defendants the writ of habeas cor pus plays key role in restoring justice when the system fails the current debate over whether to refo rm the federal habeas corpus law is centered around state capital cases these cases experience some of the lengthier delays that have been highlighted in congressional testimony the issue of trial finality becomes apparent in these cases because the mandated outcome execution is suspended pending the outcome of the habeas proceeding an analysis of the administrative office of the us cour ts aousc data however does not fully support the claim that state capital habeas cases take excessively long to process the data reveals that although the median time for state capital cases to make their way through federal habeas proceeding is twice as long as state noncapital cases the rate of filing for habeas relief for both types of cases has remained constant since 1988 prisoners serving federal capital sentence are entitled to counsel during all postconviction proceedings unlike the federal criminal justice system most states do not afford prisoners the same right critics contend that by not having mandatory system of post conviction representation many states ignore the reality that indigent death row prisoners are not able to competently engage in post conviction litigation study that was c onducted over 23year period raised the question of whether the delays commonly associated with federal habeas corpus review are necessary to make sure that justice is administered fairly the research also raised the possibility that the errors found in capital cases may be the result of poor representation until the issue of ade quate representation is fully addressed in the states criminal justice systems habeas corpus reform efforts will continue to be debated this report will be

courts to review thei r convictions and sentences to determine whether they are being held contrary to the laws or the constitution of the united states2 the authority of federal court to issue writ of habeas corpus has been part of legal procedure since 17893 in 1867 the writ was extended by congress to prisoners in state custody4 however although th federal writ of habeas corpus was extended to prisoners in st ate custody in 1867 it did not become fully available as means to challenge an unl awful conviction or sentence until the 1940s5 in 1996 congress passed legislation that restricted prisoners ability to seek relief through the writ of habeas corpus since its passage the courts have been interpreting the meaning of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa6 at issue

they contend that for many defendants the writ of habeas corpus plays key role in restoring justice when the system fails8 this report examines the issues surroundi ng the debate on whether to further restrict state prisone rs access to federal habeas cor pus filings this report does not discuss issues related to federalism and the proper role of the federal court system in overseeing the actions of state courts pertaining to prisoners constitutional rights the report opens with discussion of commission that was established in 1988 to study and make recommendations of the thencurrent federal habeas corpus system and the 1996 law that restricted prisoners access to federal habeas corpus relief it then provides an analysis of federal beas corpus petition data since 1990 the report examines whether the number of federal habeas corpus petitions and the time it takes for the federal court system to pro cess these claims have increased since the enactment of the aedpa it then discusses legislation introduced in the 109th congress that would further restrict stat prisoners access to federal habeas corpus relief the report concludes with an analysis of two dominant issues that are at the center of this debate delays caused by habeas corpus petitions and postconviction representation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33259crs3 9 for additional information on the writ of federal habeas

second pocket ed bryan garner editor in chief 12 see the powell commission reportbackground9 beginning in the 1970s the us supreme court issued set of rulings that gradually restricted prisoners access to federal habeas corpus relief and in the late 1980s commission was formed that woul d set the stage for congressional action following is discussion of early effort s to reform the writ of habeas corpus the powell committee in 1988 chief justice rehnquist formed an ad hoc committee on federal habeas corpus in capital cases aka the powell committee10 the powell committee analyzed the necessity and desirability of legislation directed toward avoiding delay and the lack of finality in capital cas the committee found that the current system at that time of collateral review 11 is fraught with unnecessary delay and repetition the inadequacies of the system are due to the following 1 lack of coordination between federal and state legal systems resulting in prisoners moving back and forth between the two systems before exhausting state remedies 2 prisoners filing excessive last minute motions for stays of execution nd 3 the absence of statute of limitation allows for prisoners to file multiple petitions at any point during their incarceration lacks competent and adequately compensated representation permits lastminute litigation where claims are meritless and are conducted amidst pending executi on which leads to the abuse of judicial resources and justices12 as result of its findings the powell committee made several recommendations some of which we re adopted in aedpa including establishing separate statutory procedure for federal habeas corpus proceedings in capital cases for states to optin if they meet certain requirements that pertain to the appointment of competent counsel and compensation of reasonable litigation expenses for indigent prisoners the optin system w ould provide shorter statute ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33259crs4 13

powell committee findings in series of rulings that began in the 1970s the us supreme court rest ricted prisoners access to federal habeas corpus relief the reason for this is in part due to the number of reported cases of abuse by inmates ie repeat and frivolous filing of petitions although the issue was most often associated with death penalty cases eg inmates using the writ of habeas corpus as means to delay thei r executions prisoners sentenced in non capital cases were reportedly also availing themselves of such petitions15 the us supreme court developed rest rictive procedural doctrines to govern federal habeas corpus proceedings16 and in 1996 congress passed gislation that limited federal court adjudication of prisoners habeas cor pus claims particularly in capital cases

appointment of representation and compensation for related litigation in post conviction proceedings prohibiting federal evidentiary hearing of claims in most cases and requiring appellate court approval for repetitious habeas corpus petitions federal habeas corpus and capital cases as discussed below one of the issues that is at the center of reforming the writ of habeas corpus is the perceived delay in processing these petitions many proponents of amending the cu rrent federal habeas corpus law point to the amount of time it takes from the initia l filing of habeas corpus petition to disposition they assert that the current system is abused by inmates who use the writ to delay the final outcome of their sentences they further contend that such lay only benefits one category of habeas corpus petitioners ccording to congressional testimony unlike the noncapital defendant who is serving his sentence during the habeas corpus process and has every incentive to proceed as quickly as possible to have federal court vindicate constitutional claim that the state courts wrongly decided the capital defendant is not serving hi s sentence he is avoiding it18 although it may be true that some death row prisoners use the writ to avoid death it is also important to note that the overall number of habeas corpus petitions filed by death row inmates pales in comparison to the number of petitions filed by nondeath row inmates at less than 1 in one study done in 199519httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33259crs6 20 us doj bjs bulletin capital punishment 2004 nov 2005 ncj 211349 according to

delays that have been highlight ed in congressional testimony and for many this is where the concern rests the issue of trial finality becomes apparent in these cases due to the mandated outcome ex ecution being suspended pending the outcome of the habeas corpus proceeding federal habeas corpus petition data 1995 department of justice bureau of justice bjs study examined the time it takes for state capital case to make its way through the federal habeas corpus appeal process21 the study looked at federal hab eas corpus petitions in 18 federal district courts located in nine different states22 bjs found that federal habeas corpus cases require range of time for disposition for example 25 of federal habeas corpus cases were processed in 83 days or less whereas 50 of the cases reached disposition in 175 days or less however bjs also found that 10 of the cases took 761 days or more to reach disposition bj s found that the amount of time it took for federal habeas corpus petition to reach disposition was based on the complexity of the case cases that failed to meet basi c procedural requireme nts were dismissed quickly however the time for federal habeas corpus case to reach disposition increased as the number and seriousness of issues raised in the petition increased23 the following section analyzes data fro m various federal sources and is meant to provide context in which to discuss the effect of aedpa on the filing of federal habeas corpus petitions by state prisoners the discussion of the data however is limited to the number of federal habeas corpus petitions filed by state prisoners and the median time it took the cases to reach disposition the data presented in this report do not take into consider ation whether there were any unwarranted delays in the current system in letter to congress the judicial conference of the united states urged that analysis be undertaken to evaluate whether there is unwarranted delay occurring in the application of current law in resolving habeas corpus petitions filed in federal cour ts by state prisoners and if so the causes for such delay24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33259crs7 25 the data provided by the aouc only shows the median time it take for case to reach disposition after it is filed and not the mean or average the median time is not as likely to be effected by cases that take an ex

in the time for state capital federal habeas corpus case to reach disposition in 2004 the median time peaked to 253 months but there were six times as many federal habeas corpus cases filed during this period in summary state capital federal habeas corpus generally cases take longer to reach disposition preaedpa state capital federal habeas corpus cases on average took three additional months to reach dis position when compared to state noncapital federal habeas corpus cases since the actment of aedpa on average it has taken an additional nine months for state capita l federal habeas

cases federal habeas corpus fili ngs and prison population t w h t extent does the increased prison population have an effect on the number of habeas corpus petition filings as shown in figure 4 in 1995 the total state prison population in the united states was 989004 by 2000 the state prison population had increased by 19 to 1176269 by 2004 the state prison population had increased by another 6 since 2000 to 1244311 figures 1 and 2 show that the total number of habeas corpus petitions f iled by state prisoners increased from 1990 to 2000 with more people in prison it fo llows that more habeas corpus petitions would be filed simply because there are mo re sentences to be challenged however while there has been significant incr ease in the state prison population over the years the rate of state noncapital habeas corpus filings has remained somewhat constant see figure 5 the rate of state noncapital habeas cor pus filings began to increase in 1996 the year aedpa was enacted see figure 5 in 2000 however there was noticeable decline in the rate of stat noncapital habeas corpus filin g which continues to the present day see figure 5 according to bjs aedpa had delayed effect on the filing of habeas corpus petitions by state prisoners27 bjs stated that aedpa resulted in approximately one additional habeas cor pus petition being filed each month for every 3400 state

escalates two major themes have emerged trial finality and adequate representation both of these issues are relevant when disc ussing state capital and noncapital post conviction proceedings following is discussion of these two issues trial finality critics on both sides of the debate often point to the length of time it takes for federal habeas corpus case to make its way through the system on the one hand those who are in favor of further refor ming the body of law that governs federal habeas corpus appeals contend that prisone rs abuse the current system as means to keep their cases in litigation which delays closure for many victims57 they argue that the increased delays in resolving hab eas corpus cases have decreased the publics confidence in the criminal justice system58 moreover such delays associated with lengthy habeas corpus appeals cause many problems including victims paying heavy emotional price states having to pay the cost of the litigation the dilution of the effectiveness of the criminal justice system and some cases that have been overturned due to the tampering of witnesses reluctance of victims to testify or evidence being lost59 proponents of further reforming the federa l habeas corpus system also contend that the only way to reduce existing delays in the system is to streamline federal habeas corpus proceedings by limiting the ability of state prisoners to petition federal courts for habeas corpus relief and by limiting claims federal courts can consider in habeas corpus petitions60 by streamlining the process they argue delays in processing these cases would be diminished61 opponents argue however that limiting the claims federal courts can consider in habeas corpus petitions would effectively prevent the federal courts from exercising judicial review62 they note that under current law prisoners are already required to exhaust state court remedies be fore advancing claim in federal court they contend that federal courts

weber 125 sct 1528 2005 that federal petition can be stayed while petitioner returns to state court but only if there is good cause for the failure to exhaust all claims in the applica tion the claim is potentially meritorious there is indication that the petitioner intentionally gaged in tactics to delay proceedings and the court places reasonable time limit on the petitioners return to federal court for adjudication 65 testimony of ruth friedman the 1 figure was first mentioned in doj bjs 1995 discussion paper titled federal habeas corpus review challenging state court criminal convictions

reasonable rate of hourly compensationthat reflect the extraordinary re sponsibilities inherent in death penalty litigation attorneys should also be prov ided with the time and funding necessary for proper investigations expert witnesses and other support services continuedrepresentation which makes it likely that many petitioners will have unexhausted claims dismissed because they did not have

authors defined serious error as error that substantially undermines the reliability of the outcome according to the au thors the error must be serious in three respects 1 the error must be prejudicial either because the defendant shows it potentially affected the outcome of the case or because it is the kind of error that almost always has such an effect 2 the error generally must ve been properly reserved by way of timely objection at trial reiteration in timely new tr ial motion at the end of the trial and timely and proper assertion on appeal and 3 the error results in reversal

provide postconviction re presentation then the petitioner must file the petition himself or hope to find an ttorney that will take the case pro bono effectiveness of representation the effectiveness of defense counsel can have an effect on the length of postconviction proceedings some have attributed the excessive length of postc onviction review to the lack of adequate representation for indigent defendants74 in report published in 1990 the american bar association aba concluded that inad equate counsel greatly increases the risk of convictions that are flawed by fundame ntal factual legal or constitutional error75 hence great deal of time during state nd federal postconvicti on review especially in capital case is used to determine whether or not defendant received adequate representation the importance of effective representation is further buttressed by research conducted by liebman fagan west and lloyd76 the authors conducted study of death sentences over 23year period from 1973 to 1995 according to the authors there were approximately 5760 death sentences handed down in the united states during the 23year period that was studied of these sentences 79 were reviewed on direct appeal and 41 were re versed due to serious error77 with respect to the death sentences that were not overturned after direct review 40 were overturned on postconviction review due

cases to title 28 of the united states code judiciary and judicial procedurethat among the most common errors that were cited during state postconviction review egregiously incompetent defense lawyers accounted for 37 of reversals79 the research concluded that during the period examined majority of the death sentences with reversible rror were overturned by state courts in 40 of the cases where reversible error was found it took an average of 76 years after the defendant was sentenced to death for the case to comp lete all stages of review it took an average of nine years for cases in whic h reversible error was found to complete all stages of review however the aut hors results led them to conclude that indeed it may be that capital sentences spend so much time under judicial review precisely because they are persistently and systematically fraught with alarming amounts of error and that the expandi ng production of death sentences may compound the production of error80 not all states however have public defense system with similar records for example arizona appoints postconviction re presentation to all indigent defendants and requires the appointed attorney to be different from the one that represented the defendant at trial81 arizona has also established mandatory competency standards for any attorney that wishes to be placed on the list of eligible attorneys for appointment in capital postc onviction cases the standard s evaluate the attorneys bar status continuing legal education nd years of experience in the practice of criminal law or postconviction proceedings according to congressional testimony since 2002 arizona has spent more than 1million for postconvic tion representation in 21 cases82 attorney general determination of aedpa optin for states the issue of postconviction representa tion is highlighted in the debate of further limiting state prisoners access to appeal to the federal courts for habeas relief under current law states have the opportunity to optin to an expedited review process for federal habeas corpus proceedings in capital cases if they meet certain conditions83 the optin provision only applies to capital cases

of state court decisions in deciding wh ether state can optin the attorney general must determine whether the state has develope d sufficient system for appointing and funding qualified counsels during th state postconviction process under the current system fe deral courts must rule on whether state has met the requirements to optin if state has successfully met ch requirements then the federal district court would be subjected to the limitations set forth by aedpa as discussed above proponent s contend that such syst em produces reluctance on the courts part to determine whether states have met the criteria85 this is evident in the fact that out of the 38 states that have the death penalty only thirteen have petitioned the courts to optin to the expedited review process since its enactment and only one of those stat was successful arizona opponents contend however that it w ould eliminate the chance for federal courts to ensure reliable c onvictions in state capital cas the only exception would be for claims of actual innocence86 moreover opponents contend that by placing this authority with the attorney general who is law enforcement official it will disturb the existing allocation of the separation of powers87 conclusion the issue of what is the proper scope of federal habeas corpus relief resurfaced in the 109th congress although trial finality is often cited by proponents who favor further restricting federal beas corpus relief to state prisoners as desirable goal when discussing the scope of such relief the question of prisoners constitutional rights is often cited by those holding an opposing viewpoint as equally paramount to the discussion of the proper scope of beas corpus relief the question of what is the purpose of constitutional rights in the criminal justice system however can be supported by both views for example do ch rights exist primarily to protect the innocent and ensure that only those who actually committed crime will be convicted or does the litigation of rights serve other purposes such as controlling police and prosecutorial behavior and pr otecting individual privacy and dignity regardless of the question there appears to be consensus among legislatures that adequate representation arguably at all stages of the criminal justice system is critical to ensure that an individuals constitutional rights are not violatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33259crs23 88 arizona successfully met the criteria set fo rth in aedpa after several failed attemptsas early as 1989 the powell committee st udied the federal habeas corpus system although the committee found that prisoners abuses of the system were rampant it also found that many states l acked representation for indigent prisoners in postconviction proceedings as result of the committees study as well as several us supreme court rulings that addressed some of the issues with the system congress passed aedpa among other provisions aedpa created two tier system for states with respect to fe deral habeas corpus proceedings although there was already an existing system for the processing of federal habeas corpus cases aedpa created second expedited syst em for capital cases fo r states that met certain requirements as was the case with the committee congress in passing aedpa recognized the need to provide an incentive to states to have system in place that would call for the ppointment of adequate counsel as well as provide compensation for the litigation of postconvic tion cases the need for such system was more apparent in capital cases where prisoners were facing death sentence although arizona is the only state that s successfully optedin to the expedited system88 12 additional states have attempted to do the same to avail once again congress recognized the need for effective representation in post conviction proceedings especially in capita l cases when it passed the justice for all act pl 108405 title iv of the act the innocence protection act of 2004 permits the attorney general to make grants to states so they can improve the quality of legal representation provided to indige nt defendants in state capital cases the research of liebman fagan west and lloyd discussed previously raised the question of whether the delays commonly associated with federal habeas corpus review are necessary to make sure that justice is administered fairly moreover the research raised the possibility that the errors f ound in capital cases may be the result of poor representation til the issue of adequate representation is fully addressed in the nations criminal justice system reform efforts will continue to be debated
