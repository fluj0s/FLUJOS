2787 introduced by request does not include these exemptions introduction over time congress has included exemptions in many federal environmental laws to ensure that requirements of those statutes would not restrict military training to the point that national security would be comp romised these exemptions provide authority for suspending compliance requirements for actions at federal facilities on casebycase basis some exemptions are specific to military installations rather than all federal facilities most of the exemptions only can be granted by the president rather than by the head of the department or agency that admin isters the activity in question further most of the exemptions are authoriz ed for activities that are in the paramount interest of the united states whereas some are specifically for national security or national defense none of the statutory authorities for these exemptions provide criteria for determininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22149crs2 1

the disc retion to make this termination most of the exemptions are limited to one or two years but can be renewed1 whether broader exemptions are needed to ensure military readiness has been subject to much debate the departme nt of defense dod argues that obtaining exemptions on casebycase basis is onerous because of the vast number of training exercises it routinely conducts on hundreds of military inst allations dod also argues that the time limits placed on most exemptions are not compa tible with ongoing or recurring training activities instead dod has s ought broader exemptions fro m certain requirements that it argues could restrict or delay training in fy2003 dod issued readiness and range preservation initiative requesting certain exemptions from six environmental laws migratory bird treaty act endangered species act marine mammal protection act clean air act solid waste disposal act and cercla dods request for broader exemptions s been contentious in congress some members have asserted that such exemptions are necessary to provide greater flexibility for combat training and other readiness activities other members states environmental organizations and communitie s have opposed broader exemptions raising questions about the degree to which environmental requirements have compromised readiness overall they have argued that expanding exemption authority without clear national security need could unnecessarily weaken environmental protection in response to dods request the 107th congress enacted an exemption from the migratory bird treaty act and the 108th congress enacted exemptions from the marine mammal protection act and from designation of military lands as critical habitat under the endangered species act if certain cond itions are satisfied these exemptions were contentious among those concerned about prot ections for animal and plant species there has been greater opposition to exemptions dod requested from the clean air act solid waste disposal act and cercla opponent s to exemptions from these latter statutes have expressed concern about human health risks from potential exposure to air pollution and hazardous substances congress has not enacted these exemptions to date dod requested them in the administrations defense authorization proposals from fy2003 through fy2008 the administrations fy 2009 defense

although one provision would appear to prohibit exemptions from envi ronmental requirement s another provision acknowledges the possibility of future exem ptions and would limit their duration to six

administration proposals for additional exemptions fro m air quality and cl eanup requirements impact of environmental requirements on readiness assessing the military need for broader ex emptions has been challenging because of the lack of data confirming whether environmental requirements have impaired military readiness overall in its report on the na tional defense authorization act for fy2008 hr 1585 hrept 110146 the house arme d services committee noted the often competing requirements for maintaining military readiness and protecting the environment the committee di rected the government accountability office gao to study the extent to which environmental requirements have affected military readiness gao issued its findings in march 2008 statin g that environmenta l requirements caused some training activities to be cancelled delayed or altered but gao noted that readiness data did not indicate those actions had hampered military readiness overall2 gao issued similar findings in prior work on this issue in 20023 and 20034 the committee also directed gao to examin the effect of military exemptions on the environment based on information from regulatory officials gaos march 2008 report did not identify any instances in which the use of recent exemptions from the migratory bird treaty act and endangered species had adversely affected the environment but stated that the

107th congress enacted an exemption for military readiness activities from the migratory bird treaty act the 108th congress enacted broad exemption from the marine mammal protection act for national defense and narrower exemption from designation of military lands as critical habitat under the endangered species act if certain conditions are satisfied in the debate over these exemptions there was disagreement about the military need for them in light of the lack of data on the effect of these statutes on readiness overall and the potential impact of the exemptions on animal and plant species these exemptions and their use to date are discussed below migratory bird treaty act section 315 of the nati onal defense authorization act for fy2003 pl 107314 directed the s ecretary of the interior to develop regulations to authorize incidental takings of migratory birds during military readiness activities and authorized blanket exemption from the migratory bird treaty act while these regulations were drafted prior to enac tment us district court had ruled in 2002 that federal agencies including dod must obtain permits for incidental takings6 subsequently dod requested an exemption fro m congress arguing that critical training could be delayed or constrai ned otherwise with the au thority provided in pl 107314 the fish and wildlife service finalized regulations on february 28 2007 broadly authorizing incidental takings of migratory birds during military readiness activities7 these regulations allow incidental taking s if dod implements cons ervation measures to minimize or mitigate significant adverse effects on migratory bird species the regulations allow the secretary of the inte rior to suspend or withdraw the takings authorization for individual activities if these conditions are not satisfied endangered species act section 318a of the na tional defense authorization act for fy2004 pl 108136 authorized the s ecretary of the interior to exempt military lands from designation as critical habitat under the endangered species act if the secretary determines in writing that an integrated natural resource management plan inrmp for such lands provides benefit to the species for which critical habitat is proposed for designation in many instances the fish and wildlife service had allowed these plans to substitute for critical habitat designation dod argued that clarification of the authority for this practice was needed to avoid future designations that in its view could restrict the use of military lands for tr aining section 318b also directed the secretary of the interior to consider impacts on national security when deciding whether to designate critical habitat since the enactment of these provisions the fish and wildlife service has routinely excluded military lands from critical habitat designations either because an inrmp was deemed to offer adequate protection or because of potential impacts on national security dod re mains subject to all other endangered species act protections on its lands such as the takings prohibition in section 9 and consultation requireme nts in section 7 marine mammal protection act section 319

2002secretary of defense may invoke in consulta tion with the secretary of commerce the secretary of the interior or both as appropr iate section 319 also amended the definition of harassment of marine mammals as it applies to military readiness activities to require greater scientific evidence of harm and required the cons ideration of impacts on military readiness in the issuance of permits for incidental takings at the time dod argued that these amendments were n eeded to allow the use of the navys lowfrequency active sonar environmental advocates had ch allenged the use of this type of sonar arguing that it harmed marine mammals and thus violated the marine mammal protection act and other environmental statutes8 the navys use of midfrequency active sonar also has been an issue since 2006 the secretary of defense twice has invoked th authority in pl 108136 to exempt the use of midfrequency active sonar from th marine mammal protection act during certain training exercises nd operations the secretary invoked the first exemption in june 2006 for six months and the second one in january 2007 for two years the navy stated that the longer twoyear exemption would allow it to continue critical training while preparing comprehensive environmen tal compliance plan for its ranges and operating areas in its report on the nati onal defense authorization act for fy2008 hr 1585 hrept 110146 the house arme d services committee expressed concern about the exemption the co mmittee directed the navy to assess the increase in military readiness over the twoyear period as resu lt of the exemption estimate the number and species of marine mammals injured and killed and report on its efforts to comply fully with the marine mammal protection act upon the expiration of the exemption although the secretary of defense s invoked exemptions from the marine mammal protection act environmental organizations have challenged the navys use of midfrequency active sonar base d on potential violations of other federal statutes including the endangered species act co astal zone management act and national environmental policy act nepa in ja nuary 2008 president bush exempted the navys training exercises from the coastal zone management act with authorities under that statute to exempt federal actions that are in the paramount interest of the united states the council on environmental qu ality ceq also used its emergency regulatory authorities under nepa to identif alternative arrangements that the navy could pursue to allow its training exercises to continue these acti ons have been subject to further legal review and challenge to termine under what conditions the navy could continue its training exercises while ensuri ng adequate protections for marine mammals past administration proposals although congress has enacted the above st atutory authorities for exemptions from the migratory bird treaty act endangered species act and the marine mammal protection act congress has not acted on th exemptions from the solid waste disposal act cercla and the clean air act that dod has requested dod included these three latter exemptions in the administration s defense authorization proposals from fy2003 through fy2008 the administrations fy 2009 defense authorization bill hr 5658 and s 2787 introduced by request does not include these exemptions the following sections discuss past administra tion proposals and related issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22149crs6 9 40 cfr part 266 subpart m military munitions rule solid waste disposal act and cercla dod had proposed to amend the definition of solid waste in the solid wa ste disposal act and release or threatened release in cercla to exclude military m unitions on an operational range opponents asserted that this exemption would have placed military munitions on such ranges beyond the reach of these two statutes allowing m unitions and resulting c ontamination to remain and present potential health risks as the exemption would long er have applied once range ceased to be operational it presumab ly would not have extended to ranges on closed bases after the land is transferred out of military jurisdiction dod asserted its proposal would have cl arified existing regulations that the environmental protection agency finaliz ed in 1997 with authorities under the solid waste disposal act9 for regulatory purposes used or fired munitions on range are considered solid waste only when they are removed from their landing spot until dod removes them and they become solid waste they are not subject to disposal or cleanup requirements under the solid waste disposal act dod stated that this clarification was needed in statute to eliminate the possibility of legal challenges that could require cleanup of range each time munition is deposited which could make tr aining impractical some members of congress states and environmental organi zations expressed concern that the proposed amendments coul d have had broader implications first amending the definition of re lease would exceed the scope of the above regulations and place military ranges beyond cerclas reach second such an exemption could result in removing state authority under both statut to monitor military ranges to determine whether contamination may migrate offsite and present health risk to nearby populations further the proposed language could have circumvent ed the authority under both statutes to file citizen suits to compel cleanup of military ranges clean air act dod also had proposed to exempt military readiness activities from air quality conformity requirements for three years under current law emissions must conform to limits in state implementation plans sips to achieve federal air quality standards unless offsetting reductions from other sources are made dod asserted that its proposed exemption was needed to allow more time for military ope rations transferred to areas with poor air quality to conform to emissions limits although dod stated that these operations would have had small shortterm impact on air quality some members of congress states and environmental or ganizations questioned whether the emissions would be great enough to present health risk past proposals also included provisions th at would have altered clean air act requirements for nonattainment areas in viola tion of federal air quality standards states would have been required to exclude emissions from military readiness activities in these areas when determining whether they are in compliance in effect states could not have imposed more stringent pollution control requirements in these areas if the failure to meet air quality standards would have been the result of emissions from military readiness activities some questioned whether these provisions consequently would have weakened public health protections that federal air quality standards are intended to provide
