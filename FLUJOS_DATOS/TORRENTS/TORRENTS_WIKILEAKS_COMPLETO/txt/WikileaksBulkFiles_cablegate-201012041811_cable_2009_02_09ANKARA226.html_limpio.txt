iran classified by dcmdoug silliman for reasons 14bd 1 c summary american citizen hossein ghanbarzadeh vahedi appeared in the ankara consular section around noon on january 9 2009 mr vahedi age 75 told conoff he had paid smugglers 7500 to take him across the iranianturkish border after having been held against his will in iran for seven months although suffering some aches and pains he appeared to be in good health after harrowing threeday journey from tehran to ankara that included 14hour mountain climb on horseback in freezing temperatures embassy staff provided immediate consular assistance and worked with turkish authorities to prevent his deportation back to iran consular officers escorted vahedi to the ankara airport where he departed on january 13 end summary background 2 sbu on january 7 embassy bern alerted posts in the region that american citizen hossein ghanbarzadeh vahedi dpob xxxx1933 was trying to escape from iran and could possibly surface in iraq vahedi dentist from angeles instead appeared at the ankara consular section around noon on january 9 2009 although visibly shakenvahedi said he had major physical problems but he did break down few times when explaining his ordeal he told conoff that he had enough medication and declined local medical attention preferring to wait until he was back in the united states 3 sbu vahedi has been resident then citizen of the united states since the islamic revolution in 1979 aside from this trip he has only returned to iran once about ten years ago and did not encounter any problems on that visit at his wifes urging to visit his parents gravesite in iran he traveled to tehran in early may 2008 where he spent four weeks with family and friends without incident however after clearing customs at tehran airport on june 6 he heard his name called on the public address system with instructions to report to separate office at this office goi authorities confiscated his passport and told him he would not be leaving iran when vahedi pressed as to the reason he was dismissed with instructions to followup at the islamic revolution court sevenmonth house arrest 4 sbu thus began sevenmonth ordeal in which vahedi appeared almost daily at the court to request that his passport be returned during this facto house arrest vahedi did contact elizabeth bucher the deputy head of the foreign interest section at the embassy of switzerland in tehran he reported that ms bucher was very kind and helped him get his heart medications but was unable to help him depart the country he lived with friends and relatives staying only few days with each to avoid them being implicated in his problems 5 sbu vahedi believed his passport was confiscated for two reasons the first being simple extortion it was made clear to him informally by the authorities at the court that if he paid 150000 fine the process would move more quickly secondly he was told by goi officials that he should use his influence to pressure his american citizen sons to terminate one of their business ventures vahedis sons are the owners of concertino productions angelesbased entertainment company that promotes among other things the popular persian pop singers kamran and hooman in addition to american performances the duet has performed in dubai and other middleeastern venues according to vahedi while the singers are simply persian pop singers they have gotten crowds riled up with occasional antiregime rhetoric also included in these performances are female dancers whose costumes would not raise an eyebrow in most countries but are perceived as immoral by the conservative elements inside iran 6 sbu vahedi did not trust that paying the fine would expedite the return of his passport unless he also convinced his sons to cancel the next dubai performance of kamran and hooman vahedi spoke of third party who was pulling the strings within the iranian government particularly in regard to his business he repeatedly told the officials of the islamic revolution court that his children had lived in america all of their lives and as such he exerted control over their strong typically american independent behavior empty spoons 7 c vahedi spoke bitterly about his former country especially its lack of fair judicial system and widespread corruption he told conoff that all government employees receive free sugar rice and cooking oil to ensure their loyalty to the regime he also said anyone with any authority lives by the why should i put an empty spoon into my mouth philosophy vahedi reported that regime spies were omnipresent including taxi drivers hotel clerks and restaurant workers he also said it was common knowledge that all new iranianmade cars had khamenei tax in the amount of 3100 that was earmarked for fund for south lebanon egypt and syria at his daily appearances at the court he came to know the intimate details of the lives of many of the other visitors some of whom told vahedi they had idea where their loved ones were or if they were even alive vahedi also helped one woman whose drugaddicted husband was incarcerated by paying her rent for the months he was there vahedi reported seeing iranian citizens watch helplessly as their family members were hauled off in shackles without any official charges levied against them picking the best option 8 c vahedi realized that this situation was not going to change and alluded to people who knew of his situation from his daily appearances at the court approaching him with departure options vahedi said he studied the four most common illegally used routes out of iran the first was crossing as stowaway on merchant ship across the persian gulf into the uae vahedi dismissed this plan because he thought the heavy shipping traffic was too dangerous and they risked being boarded by the iranian navy who were patrolling the area the second option was overland through baluchistan but vahedi could not obtain enough facts about the execution of that plan to seriously consider that route the third choice was to enter iraq heading to karbala and try to make contact with member of the american military stationed there vahedi seriously considered this option but feared being discovered by the iraqis before he could make contact with an american soldier xxxxxxxxxxxx 9 sbu in spite of temperatures hovering around zero degrees fahrenheit vahedi chose the early part of january because it coincided with the shia commemoration of ashura and he thought it likely the police would be more preoccupied in the weeks prior to his departure this 75year old man trained for strength and altitude by climbing in the hills north of tehran to protect his family and friends from retribution by the goi after his absence was noted he spoke to none of them of his escape plans on january 7 vahedi boarded bus xxxxxxxxxxxx over the mountain 10 c the two escorts were paid 5000 at the beginning of the journey and the three set out as soon as it was dark for all his planning vahedi did not have clothing appropriate for the weather and had very difficult time with the cold at one point xxxxxxxxxxxx the escorts had to physically hug him to keep him warm as an inexperienced rider hours into the climb vahedi lost his concentration and fell off the horse tumbling into the woods he told conoff that at this point he really believed he was going to die by freezing to death on mountainside however his only partiallypaid escorts came to his aid and put him back on the horse although he had thought he would be able to walk part way the altitude proved too much for him and his only choice was to remain on the horse vahedi said that he believes they were following known dug smuggling routes evidenced by the way the horse knew exactly which way to turn vahedi said the horse often led the escorts even going off the normal path in what seemed to be the wrong direction knowing that he escorts could also be trying to smuggle drugs on this trip he covertly went through the one pack they had thrown on the horse and said he found nothing 11 sbu once over the turkish border they were met on schedule by man vahedi described as about 25 years old during the handover vahedi paid out another 2500 but was unsure how the three escorts split that payment the turkish escort then brought vahedi into home where he was fed and given time to rest and warm up in the early evening he was driven to and waited there at the bus station for the 0200 bus to ankara vahedi said he maintained very low profile and did not talk to anyone during the 10hour bus trip he arrived at the consular section around noon on friday january 9 deportation conflict 12 c as vahedi had entered turkey illegally conoff worked with got officials to ensure his deportation back to america initially the chief of the foreigners police within the ministry of interior in ankara told conoff that because we knew vahedi was coming he intended to deport him back to iran post is aware that iranian and iraqi citizens have been deported back to those countries in fairly brutal manner according to unhcr some have been taken by bus in the middle of the night to the southern turkish border and released police have then allegedly shot into the air forcing the deportees to run across the border into iraq or iran with food or water to sustain them 13 c post contacted ministry of foreign affairs officials who subsequently exerted pressure on the ministry of interior to allow this 75year old american citizen to be deported back to the united states consular staff assured his security during the four days it took to work through the departure arrangements and accompanied him through the police and court proceedings and finally onward to the airport vahedi told conoff he had never done anything illegal in his life and that he was ashamed to be seen in policy custody vahedi departed turkey at 400 pm on january 13 comment 14 c the problems vahedi faced as result of entering turkey illegally highlights the tough stand this government takes on illegal entry this is particularly true with iranian and iraqi nationals even those who may also carry american citizenship ensuring vahedis return to the united states vice deportation to iran required the intervention of the embassys front office visit ankaras classified web site at
