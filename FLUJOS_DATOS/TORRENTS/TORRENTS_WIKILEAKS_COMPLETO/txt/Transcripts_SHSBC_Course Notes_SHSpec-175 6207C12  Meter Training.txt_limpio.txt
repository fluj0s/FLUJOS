6207c12 shspec175 meter training auditors make mistakes reading meters while the basic reason for this is in their banks poor metering can be countered educationally the first requirement for accurate reading of meter is good eyesight the first thing we find wrong is that the auditor cant see it may he necessary for him to wear glasses unpopular though that is amongst scientologists when case assessment form on new pc we should take something with extremely small print like railway timetable or the stock market report in the newspaper and hold it as far from the pcs face as meter would be and have him read it if he can read it make note on the assessment form that his eyesight is good with glasses if that is true if he cant read it put down eyesight poor this will make ds of p and ds of t aware that his metering may be suspect when he starts to audit check eyesight again when doing practical sections on auditing courses since persons eyesight changes with auditing recheck the eyesight if as an auditor he gets crammed for gae lets assume that all auditors who goof have something wrong with metering how wide is present time this is the next area to look into one could have an awareness of present time as much as ten minutes wide lrh has this at least for movie and tv plots clear can tell fifty to hundred feet before an intersection whether there is anything coming he may find himself seeing the truck coming around the corner before it does he is not looking around corners he may think that it is new linear perception but it is not its just that pt has gotten bit wider than the instant that most people perceive he has wider fringe of knowingness really sharp athlete also has wider pt for instance sam snead can look from the point of driving the ball to the point where it lands and know where it lands as he hits it great athletes control both ends of broadened pt so you get holeinone perfectly placed serve etc they are always exterior and the axioms seem very obvious to them they dont think of their present time as continued motion motion doesnt happen randomly in their pt they think of it as continued control when they are doing something they are controlling all the motion in that present time because they are in that present time and they have the width of that present time to decide it is as if at the end of two seconds they could undecide what they decided at the beginning of the two seconds so they have tremendous judgment they know which decision is right because they saw it happen they can perceive both motion and stillness as total isness then theres the guy whose pt is one thousandth of second wide he is in continuous anxiety and regret it is always all wrong that is crazy mans present time he doesnt even know if the bed will continue to sit on the floor you only get the idea of continuance by perceiving across span of time not by comparing different times the less pt person has the more trouble he has with the perception of motion and stillness so you can run look around here and tell something you are absolutely certain will be here in one second and keep increasing the timespan you could drill the persons perception into broadening of pt you could also run look around here and find something thats having an effect on an effect or look around this room and find something thats having an effect on something else the latter will occasionally turn on very widened pt such processes are really drills rather than processes an auditor needs to have broader pt than most if he is to be able to spot speeded rise for instance reading meter is spotting motion nomotion and change of rate of motion when it exists this is beyond perception it is matter of consecutive awareness there are three moments that must be perceived to find out if needle is still 1 the moment before it wasnt moving 2 the moment it is still it isnt moving 3 the moment after it will not move you need comparison you are not just looking at one moment moving needle requires only two observations two moments of awareness thus it is easier to read than still needle for instance sitting pheasant is harder to see than moving pheasant not because motion attracts the eye or some such reason but because motion requires only two observations to perceive while stillness requires three motion takes part of the responsibility for directing attention whereas stillness takes responsibility for directing attention in perceiving motion all you have to do is to observe that something was in place and is now in place how narrowly can places and b be spaced and still have perceptible motion between them one tenth of the width of the tip of the needle apart the next question is what section of the present time you are in do you require to perceive an action or an inaction this opens the door to the solution of this problem broadening pt is best done by clearing but it wouldnt work to insist that auditors must be clear before they can clear someone actually clear raw meat with comprehension or reality on what has happened is enormously inferior to someone who has the data and goes clear training gives subjective reality on what it is like to wrestle with the problems of clearing someone trained individuals have capability to understand people while clear raw meat is likely to be very impatient with people raw clear will also ask the damndest questions he is very oddball and unpredictable this guy has been launched into the atmosphere and expected to fly without knowing that he is in plane it is better to go clear with the data you get more comprehending people that way because it takes more time to see stillness an individual has less tolerance for it hence person is impatient with observing stillnesses his continuance has to be too great stillnesses absorb time they give sense of foreverness something that moves does not have to have such continuance however the period of time required to perceive motion or stillness can be shortened until the person can observe in the tiniest narrowest pt three moments stillness or two moments motion of time you do this by practice and drill if persons span of pt is twentieth of second long he would need to be able to perceive an instant of time that is longer than sixtieth of second in order to be able to observe three moments in time in his pt and therefore to be able to perceive that the needle is still he must be able to perceive an isness that is only sixtieth of second long the amount of pt someone can observe can be tested with camera you could set the lens wide open and vary exposure time the less pt span they can observe the smaller the diameter of lens that they will be able to perceive at given speed suitable target would be to get to where we can perceive an isness in hundred and twentyfifth of second people can be drilled to get up to this speed without broadening their pt you could do it gradiently by flashing say slide of chair for one second over and over until the students can actually tell you all about the chair then cut it down to half second quarter of second etc until you reach hundred and twentyfifth of second the student will gradiently improve until he can get everything in the slide in hundred and twentyfifth of second the name for the viewing device is variable speed tachistoscope the navy used this system during world war ii for an aircraft identification drill it is now being used to teach reading and to improve reading speed even without these devices you can learn to read meter this is necessary and now we know that it will he done the result of the training should be an auditor who can tell that still needle is present given only twentieth to sixtieth of seconds observation time the old saw about the eye having shutter speed of about twentyfifth of second is stupid lie there is thetan in back of the eye who has width of pt and who tends to fixate on what he considers an observable moment
