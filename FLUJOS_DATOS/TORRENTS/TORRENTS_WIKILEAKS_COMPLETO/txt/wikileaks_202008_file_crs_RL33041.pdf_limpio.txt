test the net value of the plan taking into account expected premiums must be at least equal to the actuarial net value of part d standard coverage in general gross value of coverage is determined using actual claims experience and demographic data for part d eligibles who are in the sponsors plan alternative approaches are permitted under certain conditions the plan satisfies the gross value test if the total expected paid claims fo r beneficiaries under the sponsors plan will be at least equal to the total expected paid claims for the same beneficiaries under the defined standard part d benefit the net value of coverage under the sponso rs plan is determined by reducing the gross value of coverage by the expected pr emiums plan sponsors that charge single premium for both drug and other medical coverage must allocate portion of this premium to drug coverage the plans net value is compared with the net value of standard coverage under part d the ne t value of standard part d coverage is calculated by reducing the gross value by 1 monthly beneficiary premiums expected to be paid for standard covera ge and 2 an amount reflecting the impact of sponsorprovided supplemental coverage on th value of standard coverage if the sponsor provides coverage th at supplements sta ndard coverage this will delay the point at which retiree will qualify for cat astrophic coverage because sponsorpaid costs will not count toward the troop trigger this in turn decreases the value of that catastrophic coverage assurances related to the gross value st must be provided separately for each benefit option for which spons or is requesting subsidy assurances related to the net value test may be provide d in one of several ways it may be app lied separately for each benefit option for subset of benef it options that in the aggregate meet the test or in the aggregate for all benefit op tions for example if retiree group health plan has five separate options all of which individually m eet the gross value test the plan could claim the subsidy for 1 each of the options that separately meet the net value test 2 all five options if they meet the net value test in the aggregate or 3 subset of the options if the subset m eets the net value test in the aggregate8 cms notes that actuaries will have considerable flexibility in the use of simplified actuarial

calculate the subsidy records must be retained for minimum of six years after the expiration of the plan year in which the costs were incurred longer period is required in the event of investigation litigation or negotiation involving civil administrative or criminal liabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33041crs6 subsidy payments as noted above the mma subsidy provisi ons were intended to counteract the erosion in employerprovided retiree health benefits the subsid is calculated based on gross planrelated drug costs that ar actually paid net any manufacturer or pharmacy discounts chargebacks rebates and s imilar price concessions the calculation includes drug payments made by the qualified retiree drug plan and those made by the covered retiree or on the retir ees behalf gross costs include costs directly related to dispen sing of the drugs but not administrative expenses in 2006 subsidy payments equal 28 of an individuals gross drug costs between 250 the cost threshold and 5000 the co st limit the dollar amounts for the cost threshold and cost limit will be adjusted annually by the percentage increase in medicare per capita prescription drug costs subsidy payments may be made on m onthly quarterly or annual basis as elected by the plan sponsor unless cms determines that these options must be restricted because of operational limitations mma specifies that subsidy payments to plan sponsors are not subject to federal tax other options types of options instead of taking the subsidy an em ployer or union may choose another option for providing prescription drug coverage fo r their retirees under these options the retiree is encouraged to sign up for part d the employer or union plan would then provide some additional assistance the following are the major options available payment of part d premiums employers or union sponsors could choose to pay some or all of the part d premiums for their part d eligible retirees and eligible dependants providing supplemental coverage employers could set up their own separate plans that supplement or wrap around part d coverage these plans would coordinate with benefits offered by any pdp or mapd the beneficiary chooses health plans typically take this approach for services such as hospital and physicians services provided under medicare parts and b purchase of enhanced part d benefit through pdp or mapd an employer or union could elect to c ontract with specific pdp or ma pd plan to offer enhanced prescrip tion drug benefits to retirees and dependants eligib for medicare become pdp or mapd alternatively the retiree plan itself could apply to be part d plan for its retireeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33041crs7 10 it should be noted that cms final regulations state that distributions from

party payments do not count toward troop thus if an employer chooses to pay some of the part d costsha ring on behalf of its retirees this would have the effect of delaying the point at which the part

plans employers or unions that contract with part d plan to provide customized package for their retirees as well as t hose who elect to become part d plan themselves will have to meet part d plan

which would otherwise hinder the developmen t and offering of such plans the intention is to facilitate employerunion sponsors to offer these group plans waivers the following are some of the key waivers that have been identified enrollment plans may restrict enrollment solely to their retirees further they do not have to m eet otherwise applicable minimum enrollment standards governmental

premium subsidies paid on behalf of an eligible retiree must first be used to reduce the portion of the monthly premium paid by the beneficiary with any remainder used to reduce the employerunion

part d plans are required to charge uniform premium for each beneficiary enrolled in the plan this is the standard premium for basic coverage the plan can charge 100 of the value of any supplemental coverage cms will give employerunion plans flexibility in determining the amount they will subsidize for retirees subject to cer tain conditions employerunion plans can subsidize different amounts fo r different classes provide d the classes are reasonable and are based on objective busine ss criteria such as years of service business location or job category this is in recognition of the fact that employers often acquire new employee groups as result of business deals premiums for employerunion plans cannot vary based on eligibility for the low income subsidy further enrollees cannot be charged more than the sum of the premium for standard part d coverage plus 100 of th premium for supplemental coverage finally the per capita dir ect subsidy payments from cms to the employerunion

legislation also offers othe r options to encourage employerunions to continue to provide assistance to retirees cms strongly encouraged employersunions to take advantage of the subsidy rather than one of the other available opti ons in 2006 it stated that it was generally better option because the value of the subs idy was generally expected to be larger though the actual value of the assistance varies by number of factors further cms established streamlined application process for the subsidy most large employers offering retiree h ealth benefits in 2005 have taken the subsidy in 2006 some plans may wish to avail themselves of other options however it might take time to restructure their plans in light of the new part d 2005 survey by kaiser family foundation and hewitt17 noted that its survey of 300 large private sector firms with 1000 or more employees s howed that the majority of plan sponsors 82 would seek the subsidy at least in th first year fifteen percent said they were likely to supplement the benef it and 2 said they intende d to become pdp eleven percent said they were likely to disconti nue prescription drug coverage of which 3 reported they were discontinuing bot h drug and other medical coverage18 when asked which strategy they were most likely to pursue for their largest plan 79 of surveyed employers representing 89 of the age 65 retirees in the largest plans expected to take the subsidy in 2006 the kaiserhewitt study reported that many employers taking the subsidy in 2006 were likely to pursue additional cost cont rol strategies thirtysix percent were very or somewhat likely to increase copayment or coinsurance charges 21 were likely to require use of mailorders for refills or maintenance drugs 14 were likely to replace copayments with coinsurance approach 13 were likely to only cover the cost up to the level of the lowestcost drug for given condition 8 were likely to impose deductibles specific to the drug benefit 3 were likely to impose cap on the drug benefit and 2 were likely to cover generic drugs only over time many plans may face an additiona l consideration it is not clear that employers will be able to continue to m eet actuarial equivale nce standards necessary to qualify for the subsidy for variet of reasons including the financial accounting standards board fasb standards fas 10619 many employers
