unies office of internal oversight services internal audit division ii oios audit of the united nations office on drugs an d crime information and communications technology management ae200432102 executive summary between 29 november and 6 december 2004 oios condu cted an audit of unodcs information and communications technology management function t its headquarters in vienna unodc has accepted most of the recommendations and has in itiated their implementation oios assessed that information technology service its is making efficient use of the resources at its disposal to provide services to unodc staff and other users of its systems number of areas at the management level need to be formalized to bring them in line with the policies of the secretariat and best practices governance structure covering all aspects of ict within unodc needs to be established as first step unodc should set up its ict committee i n line with the requirements of stsgb200317 this committee would then oversee all major decisions regarding new software applications define system and data ownership and monitor itrelated matters oios is pleased to note that management has accepted its recommendatio n in this regard and plans to have an ict committee operating by june 2005 unodc requires formal ict strategy that is approv ed by the ict committee and the executive director the strategy which would be updated on an annual basis should support the business plan of the office and be aligned with the global i ct strategy of the secretariat management feels that the budget and project documents that ar prepared and submitted for the review of various parties suffice and that an additional docu ment is not required oios sees distinction between budgetproject planning and strategic plann ing and remains of the opinion that an ict strategy document is required both to comply with the provisions of stsgb200317 and in particular as critical tool for unodcs executiv management to plan and monitor ictrelated matters in line with the ict strategy of the secretariat p roposals for new application systems where feasible should be backed by quantifiable returns on the investment made the ict committee should establish cost level above which proposals for new systems will need to be backed by an evaluation between inhouse system development sub contracting and the purchase of packaged system it should also establish criteria for deli very and user acceptance of such systems the situation regarding its resources in the areas of imis support and systems development calls for study on capacity building the feasibility of outsourcing within the organization should also be given consideration unodc should undertak study to establish the optimum number of personnel and mix of skills required by its to d eliver its services management has not accepted these recommendations commenting that the organizations policy of zerogrowth budgeting would make any conclusions difficult to i mplement in practice oios is still of the opinion that an exercise on capacity building based on the ict strategy should be used as an input to the budgetary process in its comments to manag ements response oios also refers to various examples of outsourcing within the organization t his option should not be dismissed outright but given consideration whenever the possibility arises eg systems development accordingly oios is reiterating the recommendations made in thi s regard oios would like to see its taking lead role in ic t matters concerning field offices with the objective of avoiding duplication achieving stream lining and ensuring standard that is at similar level as the one in vienna oios noted problems with regard to the accuracy of data received from undps atlas system for integration within unodcs financial system profi and is recommending study to look at options that would give the office independence fro m the systems of third parties for its data oios is pleased to note that the services provided by its are articulated in service delivery agreements and is recommending that where applicabl these agreements incorporate specific provisions regarding core applications such as imis profi the national drug control system and the international drug control system as applicable unodc should see that the work being done at united nations headquarters on ict security and business continuity planning is extended to cover i ts core applications and ict environment in the attached report oios also makes several rec ommendations in the areas of its staff training technical documentation communication rvices physical security and controls over access to databases with the exception of recomm endation calling for policy document on physical security and which oios is reiterating t hese recommendations have been accepted by management and have been or are in the process of being implemented may 2005 table of contents chapter

november and december 2004 oios conducted an audit of the information and communications technology management function withi n the united nations office on drugs and crime in vienna the audit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 the present organizational structure of unodc is regulated by stsgb20046 of 15 march 2004 entitled organization of the united nat ions office on drugs and crime in conjunction with the secretarygenerals bulletin s tsgb19975 entitled organization of the secretariat of the united nations and stsgb2 0045 entitled organization of the united nations office at vienna 3 information technology service its is one of t hree services that make up the division for management the other two being the financial r esources management service and the human resources management service one of the cor functions of the division is that of providing information technology and substantive in formation management services for the united nations secretariat entities in vienna and f or the field offices of unodc this function is undertaken by its the current organiz ation chart for its is annexed to this report 4 the findings and recommendations contained in th is report have been discussed during the exit conference held on 6 december 2004 with th director division for management the chief financial resources management service nd audit focal point and the chief information technology service draft of this re port was communicated to the director division for management and the audit focal point n 26 january 2005 comments received on 8 march 2005 and subsequent clarifications by th chief information technology service received on 22 april 2005 are reflected in the repo rt in italics ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to evaluat the adequacy and effectiveness of controls and procedures to ensure proper governance over ict welldefined ict stra tegy backed by adequate budgeting and funding and an appropriate ict organ izational structure and resources the use of appropriate systems architecture techno logy and application systems appropriate procedures over the selection developm ent and implementation of systems and change control procedures efficient data capture and the integrity of data th at is received from other core systems the operation of computer systems and the provision of technical support to ensure continued and efficient service to users security over systems and data 2 support to users and business continuity planning iii audit scope and methodology 6 the review focused on the relevant areas of info rmation technology controls that fall under unodc it did not examine the it controls ov er individual application systems or the functionality aspects of such systems 7 oios sought to obtain an understanding of the co mputer environment at unodc organization systems and key performance indicato rs through the completion of questionnaire and an onsite visit during which the auditorincharge met with the chief information technology service the chief financia l resources management service and the director division for management to explain t he audit objectives gather relevant information and listen to managements concerns n audit programme covering all the audit objectives was developed on the basis of the above and executed during site visit from 29 november to 6 december 2004 during this field vis it the audit team held interviews with staff analysed applicable data and reviewed the av ailable documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations establishing governance structure for ict 8 unodc forms part of the secretariat of the unite d nations and is therefore governed by the secretarygenerals bulletin information and c ommunications technology board stsgb200317 9 the mandate of this board is to ensure cohere nt and coordinated global usage of information and communications technology across partments and duty stations in line with the objectives of the secretariat and the cent ral policy direction provided by the steering committee on reform and management stsgb200317 paragraph 11 it calls for all departments and offices away from headquarters to stablish ict committees and calls upon departments to establish departmental strategies igned with the overall objectives of the secretariat stsgb200317 of 21 november 2003 ction 4 paragraph 44 10 unodc does not have an ict committee or other f ormal body to govern ict in line with these requirements an inhouse system database f databases indicates data owners but use of this facility was not being applied consiste ntly in this regard oios also noted that stsgb20046 of 15 march 2004 entitled organizati on of the united nations office on drugs and crime does not specifically mention its and only gives brief and generic description of the information and technology servi ces to be provided stsgb20046 paragraph 82e 11 there should be welldefined governance struc ture for ict that clearly identifies the parties and their responsibilities with regard to s ystems and data an essential feature of the governance framework is clearlydefined ownership f or all the systems that have been 3 implemented and the respective data the governan ce function would be better supported if the core functions of its are defined recommendation head2right unodc should take steps to set up its information and communications techn ology committee in line with section 44 of stsgb20031 7 and b document the core functions of the information technology service and present them to the ict comm ittee for approval rec 01 management response accepted implementation 1 june 2005 oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending the receipt of the ict committees terms of referen ce and minutes of the first meeting and copy of document approved by the ict committee tailing the core functions of its head2right unodc its should ensure that ownership of systems and data be clearly evidenced and reflected in the database of databases rec 02 management response accepted implementation 1 april and 1 october 2005 the database of databases has been in place and tains the needed fields for several years in the majority of cases these fields are wellpopu lated however the suggested review and tightening of these fields is welcomed semiannua l reviews are proposed oios agrees with managements proposed timing for t he reviews it will close this recommendation when it receives written confirmatio n that the reviews are taking place b implementation of comprehensive ict strategy 12 unodc does not have an information and communic ations technology strategy that is approved at the highest level of the office the bsence of longterm strategy for ict makes it difficult to identify and plan for acquisi tion of resources this process may be initiated relatively late and could result in dela ys in implementing systems 13 the constant and rapid developments in ict tech nology make it impractical to develop and implement rigid ict strategy but it should be possible to develop strategy covering the next two biennia this would be subject to per iodic review taking into account technological developments and any changes in the m andate of the office 14 oios has taken note of the presentation given b the chief of its describing its policies eg outsourcing integration the work perfor med by the various units of its and other work that is in hand or planned for the near future this would be good basis on which to develop an ict strategy that supports the mandate f the office and is aligned with the ict strategy of the secretariat recommendation 4 head2right the future unodc ict committee rec 01 should req uest its to submit for its approval rolling strategic plan for unodcs it services and applications covering the n ext two biennia this plan should support the mandate and policies of the office include details of deliverables tim ing and resource requirements and be aligned with the glob ict strategy of the secretariat the ict strategic plan should be endorsed by the executive director of unodc rec 0 3 management response rejected unodc its does not feel that another document is r equired as its on one two and three year basis prepares budget documents and project d ocuments which include this information these documents are passed through the formal review process of unov unodc new york budget acabq and fifth committee the commission on narcotic drugs cnd the international narcotics control bo ard incb regular nds user group meeting etc this extensive review and documentati on process is felt to be sufficient noting in particular that any activities which are not par t of the budgetary approval process cannot in any case be implemented whether or not they are approved by any central body furthermore its notes that we indeed follow 57620 strategy document for us b provide input to a59265 reporting on progress on the strategy and c are very active players in the ictb implementation planning and ac tion re the strategy these extensive strategy activities feed into our budget planning w hich controls our local withincontext actions this is also part of the budgetary process in particular the alignment with the ict strategy of the secretariat and also in view of the newly formed strategic planning unit of unodc indeed its has quarrel with the ict strat egy and notes that highlevel role is carried out by itsd and the ictb via extensive info rmal consultation formal monthly videoconferences and formal annual meeting from which this document is written oios takes note of and appreciates the close involv ement of its in the documentation process as outlined in the above response but sees distinction between budget planning and strategic planning and similarly between project planning and ict strategic planning furthermore in addition to complying with the prov isions of stsgb200317 which calls for all departments and offices away from headquart ers to establish departmental strategies aligned with the overall objectives of t he secretariat 44 oios considers an ict strategy document an essential tool for unodcs executive management for planning and monitoring purposes accordingly oios reiterat its recommendation c its organizational structure and staff resources organization and resources 15 as result of the march 2004 secretarygeneral s bulletins on the organization of the offices the ict function which for the previous t wo years had been positioned within unov moved back to unodc this repositioning refl ects the fact that the majority of substantive operations fall under the mandate of odc 16 the organizational structure for its looks rati onal and practical the imis technical team however only has two regular budget posts the ratio of imis technical staff to users is 123 while for unog and eca it is 157 and 146 respectively imis is at the core of unodcs it services and we understand that unodc is likely to be requested to 5 implement upgrades to the payroll and hr modules du ring 2005 this will put additional pressure on the existing resources 17 staff resources within the other its teams appe ar to be adequate to cope with daytoday requirements but are thinly spread so any loss coul d at least in the shortterm slow down operations considerably oios noted the following areas where current staff resources are just adequate to cope with demand profi technical team at the time of our audit the post of project coord inator was still vacant while that of project manager which is the only post funded from the regular budget was onloan from the office of the chief the project manager felt that second person was required for warehouse reporting b national drug control system nds management felt that resources were limited for mee ting deadlines and another person was required as backup and for the team to follow up matters at the user level c international drug control system ids the development of the systems had originally been outsourced to company that was to allocate 12 people for oneyear period but th contract was cancelled in september 2004 after users rejected the product and it was cided to develop it inhouse at the time of our visit to unodc there was only one pers on allocated to this area resulting in lack of segregation of duties in the system sign programme and test functions developer and programmer have since been allocate d to support the system manager and another programmer is being recruited 18 in the case of applications development the pa ce and quality depends on available resources apart from system design and programmin g software development project involves other processes such as testing documenta tion data migration and user training if as appears in the case with ids its is allocated i nsufficient resources and put under pressure to deliver systems within tight timeframes the sof tware that is delivered may not be of the best quality and contain an unacceptable number of errors all this would ultimately result in additional costs and reflect badly on its or in t he case of systems such as nds and ids that are used by external parties on unodc itself its may also be constrained to turn down requests for system development due to unavailable resources in this area staff may only be required for the duration of the project and oios i s of the opinion that management should explore the feasibility of engaging temporary staff for example through the international computing centre it may also be easier to obtain funds that can be utilized for this purpose instead of requesting additional posts recommendation head2right unodc its should draw up plan for capacity building based on n ict strategy that is linked to the goals of the office and to quantifiable returns on investment and b assess the feasibility of outsourcing within th organization in particular for skills related to s ystem development and implementation rec 04 6 management response rejected re capacity cannot be built without budget and all such matters are carried out in the multitude of budgetary rb support budget core bu dget drugs fund crime fund project workstation support programme etc documents alre ady produced annually all such documents are heavily reviewed and scrutinized whi its appreciates the pureness of the auditors comments in this regard the reality of ze rogrowth budgeting means that the budgetary process defines the local implementation within the context of the overall strategy re b its has followed the outsourcing environment for many years and continues to note the cost and effectiveness of outsourcing both within nd outside the its is disinclined to go down this path again oios notes that the report of the secretarygeneral to the general assembly titled information and communication technology strategy deals with capacity building and the role of the ictb and ict committees in this regard a57620 paras 7580 it sees capacity building linked to the ict strategic plan as an i nput by its to the budgetary process accordingly oios reiterates its recommendation with regard to rec 04b a57620 79 states that in addition to building internal skills selective outsourcing especially for skill s which tend to be commoditized and do not require institutional knowledge will continue to b used the report of the secretary general titled outsourcing practices of 11 august 2004 a59227 includes number of activities in the field of ict outsourced during th years 2002 and 2003 oios remains of the opinion that its should not dismiss the option of outsourcing within the organization outright but only reach decision after assessing its feasibility visàvis utilizing inhouse resources oios is reiterating this recommendation for managements attention b staff training 19 its policy is that staff members should attend two training courses each year due to budgetary restrictions however the majority of st aff are only receiving one training course in the case of the core services unit not all staf f members had the opportunity to attend course during 2004 oios also noted that the train ing of its staff is not coordinated with human resources management service 20 its staff are working in specialized areas that are subject to frequent technological developments and they require continuing training t keep up with these developments and provide the best service to users recommendation head2right unodc its should make detailed case for acquirin g more training funds for its staff and liaise with unodc human resources management service to optimize training opportunities and facilities rec 05 management response accepted implementation 1 september 2005 unodcs human resources management service hrms h as released additional funds for it training in the 20042005 biennium and permane nt expanded framework is being built the proposed recruitment of an it training coordina tor effective 1 may 2005 will enable this 7 recommendation to be actioned by the indicated date oios takes note of managements response it will close this recommendation upon receipt of documentation supporting the new framework for i t training d selection development and implementation of sys tems general 21 the report of the secretarygeneral on the ict strategy for the secretariat worldwide states that in line with the broad objectives of t he strategy all ict investments need to generate tangible returns a57620 paragraph 31 it also calls for the use of mandatory costbenefit analyses as prerequisite for the dev elopment of all new systems and for the initiation of ictrelated projects to ensure cons istent approach and returns on investment a57620 paragraph 77 22 the secretarygenerals bulletin information nd communications technology board established project review committee to apply iformly the standards decided upon by the information and communications technology board to information and communications technology initiatives within the organization and to recommend whether such initiatives should proceed stsgb200317 paragraph 52 t he prc would review proposed ict projects to see that the rationale behind the inves tment is justified ensure that the total cost of projects is accurately projected standard developm ent methodologies are applied and all relevant documentation is available 23 unodcs current policy is not to buy offthe sh elf packages and there is evaluation between inhouse development and erp solutions fu rthermore as indicated in paragraph 10 unodcs ict committee has not yet been establis hed until this committee is established the office will not have role in the prc 24 the total cost of developing and implementing system and the source of funding should be determined before the system is commissioned and there should also be an evaluation between systems development and an erp solution i n the case of profi 4 million had been invested in implementing the system by the end of 2 002 oios is not aware of any comparative analysis between the costs and benefits of hiring consultants to develop profi and other options such modifying imis the board f auditors questioned the reasons behind the decision to implement profi boa managem ent letter dated 26 march 2002 rather than an imisbased tool the problems left behind by the consultants were resolved after significant allocation of inhouse resources more thorough evaluation prior to selection could have avoided these problems 25 there should also be clear criteria together w ith formal user acceptance to define the point when project is complete and the user depar tment takes over as system owner such criteria have been absent and oios noted that user approval of new application systems for example in the case of nds and website development is not always evidenced recommendation head2right unodc should ensure that 8 the ict committee establishes cost level abov which proposals for new systems will need to be supported by an evaluation that includes financial impact and c omparative analysis of purchasing package system against dev eloping it inhouse or subcontracting it such proposals wh ere feasible should be backed by quantifiable returns on the investment made and b the scope of software development project is defined at the outset and the criteria for systems delivery and acceptance are incorporated in software development agreements with the users rec 06 recommendation 6a has been redrafted and is await ing response from management management response recommendation b is accepted and has been complet ed change in management has taken place which has immediately ad to this very desirable result oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending receipt of the policy on systems selection and docu mentation supporting the implementation of rec 06b b technical documentation 26 oios noted some inconsistencies in the database of databases which is the tool used to record information about unodcs application system s the indicated status of the applicationdatabase was not always consistent with the actual project status for example the status would be marked as inactive when its p roject status might be production the database of databases is an important management to ol and the information should be kept uptodate 27 the unodc web management team which is made up of two staff members has done lot of useful work in developing new websites and redesigning existing ones however oios noted that requests for website development re not documented and technical documentation is not complete this would create p roblems with continuity if the current staff members were longer available recommendation head2right unodc its should carry out periodic reviews to check that the in formation in the database of databases is consistent with the actual status of projects and b ensure that all requests for website developmen t are documented and that technical documentation support ing all websites is available rec 07 management response accepted in the case of reviews will be carri ed out on 1 april and 1 october 2005 b has been completed it should be noted that all websites supported by i ts run on the same technical environment 9 and use the same content management system date of documents 26 march 2004 and october 2004 new document will be completed 14 mar ch in time for the next round of training oios takes note of managements response it will close this recommendation when it receives written confirmation that the review envis aged for april has been completed c software installation licences 28 for internal control purposes and to comply wit h statutory requirements it is important for its to have complete and accurate list of all sof tware installation licences 29 software installation licences for the individu workstations in the vienna offices are tracked through the zenworks database this databa combines the installation base information with purchase details recorded in imis any discrepancies are reported to the relevant unit and purchase of the missing licence s is requested the oic of the core services unit prepares the discrepancy reports th is is manual procedure that is time consuming and difficult to maintain since its is t automatically notified of licence purchases licences for workstations in the field are not handled by its in vienna but by the global field office support team in india 30 the situation will become more complicated if i ts takes on more direct role in supporting field offices for example procedures w ill be required for managing different terms when dealing with licences that are on glob rather than local basis and where users who are on mission and have access to their own dat install software for use on pc that belongs to the field office recommendation head2right unodc its should seek to implement system whereb the core services unit is immediately informed of t he purchase of new software installation licences and implement policy over these licenses that covers all of dcs operations rec 08 management response accepted implementation 1 july 2005 for vienna its is now using novell zenworks to pol l all workstations and determine the licensing situation this is truly quantitative m ethod as it finds the true situation on the ground and does not rely on reports from any person action is being taken to remedy any current discrepancies an application is currently being developed for the field offices that allows recording of all licenses oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending the receipt of documentation showing that the syste m for recording all software installation licenses is functioning information management at the field office level 31 its is focusing on providing global services to all unodc field offices the purchasing of hardware is centrally controlled through the off ice in india its is involved in planning 10 and budgeting for ict resources as far as its activ ities at headquarters are concerned but not for it resources in the field offices its does t monitor purchases made through the india office and does not have say in the systems that are developed or purchased at the field office level neither is there monitoring of such activity 32 apart from the core systems such as imis and pr ofi there could be various applications in the field offices covering work related to the perations or administrative work of that office past experience within the system shows instances where the absence of central monitoring led to proliferation of applications nd databases often with duplication of data and lot of time and effort was subsequently requi red to achieve streamlining 33 to avoid the risk of duplicate data entry and d ata storage oios is of the opinion that development of software applications and databases above certain level should be centrally monitored to ensure that this is done on costben efit justification and there is duplication or incompatibility these projects would be tracke d through the database of databases 34 oios takes note of the significant efforts made by its over the past 12 months to bring the level of service provided to field offices on par with that received by users in vienna it is also of the opinion that its should take more active role with field offices as coordinator of the offices it strategy and policies this cou ld take the form of guidelines and briefings on matters such as the it strategy the creation of the ict committee and other aspects of stsgb200317 the ict strategy of unodc and the s ecretariats policy on the use of ict resources and data stsgb200415 recommendation head2right once set up unodcs ict committee should establish guidelines policies and standards for ict projects at the field office level and set ceiling for ict field projec ts with the stipulation that all new proposals from the field t acquire or develop application systems and databases that exce ed such ceiling should be subject to review and approval by the committee approved projects should be recorded an d tracked through the its database of databases rec 09 management response it is very difficult for hq to decide on appropriat field office projects and it is also inappropriate for hq to delay advanc in the field this is why its has team in the field in particular in india uzbekistan an d mexico tasked with this responsibility the feedback from unodc field representatives and i ncluded in hrms and frms mission reports has been positive in the extreme while its continues to have reservations with respect to the appropriateness of the committee vis àvis field office systems it can indeed accept this recommendation based on the cost level recommended by oios above oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending receipt of copy of the guidelines policies and s tandards set by the ict committee for ict projects at the field office level that exceed the set cost level head2right unodc its should supplement its main ict strategy with plan detailing its support to field offices and mea sures to ensure that guidelines policies and standards blished at 11 unodc headquarters are consistently applied in the field rec 10 management response accepted implementation 30 november 2005 oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending receipt of the plan detailing the support of its to field offices f data capture and interfaces with other system s 35 its is responsible to address the interfacing b etween unodcs systems and data with other systems used by the organization such as imis and galaxy as such it should have proper mechanisms in place to ensure the completene ss and integrity of all data that is uploaded into unodcs systems from other systems nd that corruption of unodc core data results from such uploads 36 due to staff limitations undp has been engaged to make disbursements on behalf of unodcs field offices and provide certification and approval services for bank transactions transactions are recorded in undps atlas system for the field offices to monitor what undp has expended on their behalf data from atlas has to be integrated into unodcs financial system profi our brief discussions an d review of email exchanges between unodc and undp finance personnel indicate that the accuracy of the data received from atlas is questionable indications point to user problem perhaps due to inadequate training nevertheless this issue it is taking up considerab time for both its and finance staff to resolve and impacts on the timeliness of unodcs fi nancial records 37 whether unodc should seek to move away from und p and the atlas system and to what extent this would be feasible is beyond the sc ope of this audit however given the amount of potential monetary and time savings the reduced risk of error and quicker turnaround time regarding the availability of finan cial reports detailed study of this option is called for recommendation head2right unodc frms with the support of unodc its should undertake study to determine the feasibility of and the potential savings from adopting an alternative syst em to atlas for use by unodc field offices rec 11 management response accepted new it system has been developed by frms and its and is as of january 2005 under pilot in uzbekistan potential savings are fully d ocumented by frms frms has in place plan for broad deployment following completion of t his pilot oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending the receipt of documentation showing potential savi ngs and the deployment plan g technical and network support 38 in the vienna international centre there are tw telephone switches pbxs one of these is used by the international atomic energy agency the second pbx is used by the other 12 organizations the vics building management serv ice technically controls this pbx but unodc is responsible for operating the communicatio ns the current arrangement could be rationalized so one organization would have respons ibility over the whole process 39 the its communications and infrastructure team has staff dealing with the switchboard and faxvideoconferencing systems technical opera tions are currently dealt with by unido this arrangement may be restructured to mer ge the switchboard and technical operations recommendation head2right unodc its should seek ways to improve the efficiency of communic ations technology service between the organizations in the vienna international centre through reorganizatio n of the pbxs and b liaise with unido to evaluate restructuring f the communications function rec 12 management response accepted implementation 1 april 2006 please note that the outcome of this initiative is uncertain oios takes note of managements response and apprec iates that the outcome the initiative depends on third parties it will keep the recomme ndation open pending the receipt of documentation supporting the review and evaluation of the communication function within vic 13 h logical access controls 40 our review showed that access rights to lotus n otes databases were not handled in consistent manner and sufficiently restricted dat abase security was set at the default access this access level enables any user to acce ss all the information held in the database examples noted during the audit two lotus notes databases containing personnel info rmation one of these databases contains sensitive information about staf f members and their dependants including grade birth date nationality and information on dependants and any disability the staff data consistency database comparing lotu s notes imis and the central registry where the default user had desig n rights 41 our review was not an indepth one and unrestri cted access to other databases containing sensitive or nonpublic information may be availabl recommendation unodc its should request data owners to define acc ess rights of their applications and their data and to perform periodic eg semiannual review of access rights to ensure they comply with the defined policy rec 13 management response its will ensure that the data owners review access rights immediately semiannual review by data owners i s very good recommendation and such review will be carried out on 1 april and 1 octob er of each year oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending written confirmation that the first periodic review has been completed i physical security 42 the main computer equipment is housed in five l ocations all within the vienna international centre work at the various location s is subject to the asbestoscleaning programme currently being undertaken within the cen tre 43 oios noted that the container housing backup nd other equipment is accessed via normal lock and is sited at ground level the four windows of the computer room and another two in the adjoining operator room are not adequately protected from unauthorized access and security cameras to monitor the area wer not yet functional electricity and network cabling on the outside is exposed and vulne rable to wilful damage 44 physical security measures over computer instal lations and equipment within unodc are the responsibility of safety and security service the chief its said that there was ongoing coordination between its and sss but he was not awa re of
