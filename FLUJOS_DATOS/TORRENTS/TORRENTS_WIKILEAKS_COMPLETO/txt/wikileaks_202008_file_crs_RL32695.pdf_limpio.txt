majority 26 or more state votes is required to elect president the house must vote immediately to the exclusion of all other business and by secret paper ballot in cases where state has only one representative that member would decide the state vote for other procedures precedents exist from the contingent election rules for 18 25 as drawn up by select committee establishe d for that purpose in 1825 the house decided that majority of votes of representatives in each state delegation was required to cast the state vote for partic ular candidate or the state vote would registered as divided

provisions article ii section 1 required each elector to cast two undifferentiated votes for president one each for two preferred candidates there was separate electoral vote for vice president failing or having been unwilling to anticipate the growth of political parties that w ould offer unified tickets of presidential and vice presidential nominee the constitutional conv ention had not provided distinct votes for the two executive offices the candidate receiving the most votes was elected president provided the votes constituted number equal to majority of electors not electoral votes the runnerup was elected vice president in the event of tie vote or if candidate received vote from majority of electors the house of representatives was to elect the president from among the five candidates receiv ing the most electoral votes again the runnerup would be vice president voting wa s by states with each state casting single ballot by 1796 both nascent political parties the federalists and jeffersonians or republicans but not to be confused with th contemporary republican party arranged to have one of their electors wit hhold his vote for the facto vice presidential candidate to prevent tie and thus avoid contingent ection the deficiencies of this awkward arrangement became apparent in the electi on of 1800 when all jeffersonian electors cast one vote each for presidential candidate thomas jefferson and vice presidential candidate aaron burr the failure to cast one less vote for bu rr was an oversight but it resulted in an electoral college tie requiring contingent ection in the house when it met to count the electoral votes on feb 11 1801 some federalist representatives voted for burr in the contingent election hoping to deny jefferson the presidency constitutional crisis resulted as voting continued in the house for seven da ys and required 36 ballots before the impasse was broken and burrs support collapsed jeffersons final margin was 10 states

constitution was proposed by congress in 1803 following the constitutional crisis th at marred the presidential election of 18011 state ratifications followed quickly and the 12th amendment was declared to be in effect on september 25 1804 the amendments provisions which remain in effect are summarized as follows the electors cast separate ballots for president and vice president the votes

refers intercha ngeably to the nominees for president and vice president 3 the emergence of four major presidential candidates in 1824 all of whom were democratic republicans as the former jeffers onians were then known led to fragmentation of the electoral vote resulting in c ontingent election in 1825 under the 12th amendment the top three electoral votegetters andrew jackson 99 votes john quincy adams 84 votes and william crawford 41 votes could be considered by the house the fourth candidate henry clay 37 vote s was excluded by the amendm ent although out of the running clay threw his considerable support to adams so that when contingent election was conducted in the house on feb 9 1825 adams was chosen on the first ballot with 13 state votes to jacksons seven and four for crawford jackson supporters attacked the adamsclay alliance as corrupt bargain and immediately began planning for their candidates campaign and ultimate victory in 1828 in contrast with the contentious presidential vote john c calhoun received an overwhelming majority of 182 of 260 electoral votes cast for vice president in the 1824 electionchoosing from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes quorum of at least one repres entative from twothirds of the states 34 at present is necessary for the purposes of contingent election the vote is taken by states with each state

contingent election of the vice president each senator casts single vote the votes of majority of the whole senate 51 or more at present are necessary to elect the vice president the 12th amendment and contingent election as noted previously the 12th amendment established what has become known as contingent election as fallback procedure that takes place only when candidate wins an electoral college majority2 contingent election could occur as result of several series of events 1 three or more candidates split the electoral vote so that one receives majority 2 sufficient number of faithless electors cast blank ballots or vote for candi dates other than those to whom they are pledged thus denying majority to any ca ndidate or 3 the electoral college could tie at 269 votes each for two candidates contingent electi ons have been conducted only twice since ratification of the 12th amendment for the president in 1825 following the election of 18243 and for the vice president in 1837 following the election of 1836httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32695crs3 4 the majority required was of those votes ca st not majority of the entire delegationcontingent election of the president what rules would govern the procedure the 12th amendment itself provides some of the rules for contingent election of the president first it requires that the hous shall choose immediately the president this was interprete d in 1825 as directing that the election be conducted not only immediately but to the exclusion of any other business until president was chosen the same sentence prescribes elec tion by ballot in 1825 this was interpreted as requiring the us of secret paper ballots the vote must be taken by states with each state casting single vote again by secret paper ballot quorum for contingent election c onsists of member or members representing two thirds 34 at present of the states finally the votes of majority of states 26 of the present total of 50 is necessary to elect the president if the house has been unable to choose by the date the incumbentpresidents term expires january 20 under the 20 th amendment then the vice president assuming one has been chosen acts as president until president is chosen procedures adopted for the 1825 ection filled in some of the 12th amendments gaps these would provide precedent for any future contingent election as they were

second round results were collected by tellers anddeposited in duplicate ballot boxes in the house chamber the contents were counted by tellers compared and reported to the house 5 it should be noted again that these d ecisions applied only to the rules under which the house of represen tatives conducted contingent election of the president in 1825 although they would provide reference for the house in any future application of the contingent election pro cess they would not be prescriptive and could be subject to different interpretati ons for instance in the modern context there would almost certainly be strong pr essure for contingent election sessions in both chambers to be not only open to the public and reporters but covered by radio and television as well similarly ther might be strong support for individual members votes to be made public in th house of representatives given the fact that the constitutional injunction that voting be by ballot and therefore secret arguably applies only to the votes of the states in the second round contingent election in 1825 representatives debate their options spirited debate as to the nature and requi rements of contingent election preceded the actual vote in 1825 one question concerned the role of individual representatives some asserted that it was the duty of the house to choose jackson the candidate who had won national plurality of the popular and electoral vote others believed they should vote for the popular vote winner in thei r state or district another school of opinion suggested that house members should give prominence to the popular results but also consider themselves at liberty to weigh the comparative merits of the three candidates still others asserted that contingent election was constitutionally distinct process triggered by the failure of the people and the electors to arrive at majority under this theory the popul ar and electoral college results had bearing or influence on the contingent ection process and re presentatives were therefore free to consider the merits of the contending candida tes without reference to the earlier contest6 it is likely that many of these considerations or similar ones would be raised in any future contingent electionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32695crs5 7 an internal dispute in the democratic party led to contingent election of the vice president in the senate in 1837 democratic presidential nominee martin van buren won comfortable electoral vote majority in the 1836 election but his controversial running mate richard mentor johnson split the vote with an independent democratic vice presidential nominee thus requiring contingent election electoral votes were counted on feb 8 1837 in joint session of the 24th congress and the senate then immediately returned to its own chamber to elect the vice president since the senates choice was limited by the 12th amendment to the two candidates gaining the mo st electoral votes rather than three as required for presidential contingent elections it chose between johnson and his leading whig opponent francis granger johnson was elected with 33 votes to 16 for granger 8 us congress senate

hington gpo 1932 p 4contingent election of the vice president in 18377 procedures adopted by the senate in 1837 differed from those of the house in 1825 and were simpler the 12th amendments requirements the house vote immediately by ballot do not appear in the language governing contingent election of the vice president consequently the senate decided that the roll would be called in alphabetical order at which time each senator would na the person for whom he voted8 nor does the senate journal provide any evidence that the gallery was closed it is also interesting to note that president pro tempore william r king presided over the contingent election of 1837 th is may have been due to the fact that the incumbent vice president martin van buren was also presidentelect and had retired from the senate on january 28 1837 the 20th amendment and the presidential succession act of 1947 the contingent election process was modified in the 20th century by the 20th amendment to the constitution and the presidential succession act of 1947 61 stat 380 3 usc 19 section 1 of th amendment set new expiration dates for congressional and presidential terms changing the former to january 3 and the latter to january 20 previously both terms had expired on march 4 the primary purpose of this change was to eliminate the historical anomaly of lame duck congressional sessions while also shortening the period between election and inauguration of the president and vice president by six weeks subsidiary purpose as revealed by the amendments legislative history was to remove the responsibi lity for contingent election from lame duck congress9 section 3 restates the 12th amendment provision that the vice president assuming one has been chosen acts as president in the event the house is unable to elect president in the contingent election process it also empowers congress to provi by law for situations in which neither president nor vice president qualifies ie neither has been elected the presidential succession act among other effects reinforces this safeguard by naming the speaker of the house of repr esentatives to serve as acting president in such situations ie neither pres ident nor vice president has qualified or alternatively the president pro tempore of the senate in the event the speaker ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32695crs6 10 these would presumably be

would be required to resign both as representative and as speaker to become acting president similarly the president pro tempore would be required to resign both as senator and as president pro tempore to assume the acting presidency if both the speaker and the president pro tempore decline the ffice or fail to qualify for any reason then the acting presidency would devolve upon th head of the most senior executive department department of state the other cabinet secretaries would be similarly eligible in the order of their departments seniority10 by taking the oath of office as acting president they would automatically vacate their appoin tment as cabinet officer thus avoiding the prohi bition against dual office holding11 both the succession act and the 20th amendment specifically limit the service of an acting president in such circumstances he holds office only until either president or vice president has qualified district of columbia participation although the 23rd amendment empowers citizens of the district of columbia to vote in presidential elections the nations capital is not considered state for the purposes of contingent election thus the district would not participate in the election despite the fact th at its citizens cast both popular and electoral votes for president and vice president12 recent legislative proposals near the end of the 108th congress representative brad sherman introduced hjres 113 proposed constitutional am endment on november 18 2004 section 1 of his proposal would alter the formula for electing the president under contingent election instead of each st ate casting single vote the house of representatives would vote per capita in such situations with each member casting single vote the person receiving the greater number of votes would be elected provided that this number constituted majority of votes cast the amendment would also change the existing quorum which requires that memb er or members from twothirds of the states be present secti on 2 would establish the quorum for contingent election as majority of the house of representativ furthermore member or members representing at least two thirds of th states would need to be presenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32695crs7 13 it would however preserve small arith metical advantage for less populous states analogous to the advantage they currently enjoy in the allocation of house seatsrepresentative shermans proposal w ould eliminate state equality in the contingent election process for the president instead of each state casting single vote each representative would vote for instance california would cast 53 votes while wyoming the least populous state as measured by the 2000 census would cast one vote as would other stat represented in the house by single member the argument here is that this process would be more democratic reflecting the great disparities in population and the numbe r of votes cast among the states13 arguments against the proposal could cen ter on the assertion that amendment would weaken the federal nature of the existing contingent election process in which each state casts single vote moreover it could be noted that the amendment does not alter existing vicepresidential electi on procedures in the senate which would continue to incorporate the concept of stat equality given the fact that each senator casts single vote hjres 113 was referred to the house committee on the judiciary on november 18 2004 further ac tion was taken before the 108th congress adjourned concluding observations american presidential elections have generally been dominated by two major parties since the early 19th century with the major party candidates winning majority of electoral votes in every election since 1836 popular third party or independent candidacy has th potential of preventing an electoral vote majority such candidacies have emerged in f our recent presidential elections 1968 1980 1992 and 1996 furthermore contest over election results in florida in the very closely contested presidential election of 2000 raised the possibility that floridas electoral votes might be excluded in the electoral vote count session an action that could have resulted in neither presidential candidate receiving majority of electoral votes thus requiring contingent election under either of the above mentioned scenarios or in similar circumstances the house and senate could be called on to elect the president and vice president in some future election barring any comprehe nsive reform of the presidential election system such an election would be g overned by the provisions of the 12th amendment as noted previously in th is report while important elements of contingent election procedure in both ch ambers would be prescribed by the 12th amendment the members of the house and senate would be c onfronted with the same questions that faced their pred ecessors in 1800 1824 and 1836 particularly in the case of the house of representativ body of precedent exists dating from its two previous experiences with continge nt election these pr ecedents would offer guidance but would not be considered bi nding in any future contingent election with respect to proposals to change th constitutional arrangements that govern contingent election such efforts would face the stringent requirements imposed onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32695crs8 14 article v of the constitution also provides for amendment by convention which would assemble on the application of the legislatures of twothirds of the states any amendment proposed by such convention would also require approval of threefourths of the states this alternative method however has never been used 15 these conditions have been met in some cases only after long period of national debate for example in the case of the 19th amendment which extended the right to vote to women was the culmination of decades of discussi on and popular agitation in other instances amendments have been proposed and ratified in the wake of sudden galvanizing event or series of events an example of this may be found in the 12th amendment itself or in the more recent 25th amendment providing for presidential succession and disability which received tremendous impetus following the 1963 assassination of president john f kennedyall proposed amendments including passage by twothirds vote in each chamber of congress and approval by thr eefourths of the states ge nerally within sevenyear time frame14 these constraints have meant that successful amendments are usually the products of broad national consensus sense that certain reform is urgently required or active support by congressional leadership15 in many cases all the aforementioned factors contributed to the success of an amendment given the high hurdles both constitutional and political faced by any proposed amendment it seems likely that contingent election pro cedures will remain in place unless or until their alleged failings become so compelling that large concurrent majorities in the public the congress and the states ar prepared to undert ake their reform
