thomascpetersonnoaagov date wednesday july 29 2009 1207 pm subject re this and that hi phil yes fridaysaturday i noticed that climatefraudit had renewed their interest in you i was thinking about sending an email of sympathy but i was busy preparing for quick trip to hawaii i left monday morningand flew out tuesday evening and am now in the houston airport on my way home data that we cant release is tricky thing here at ncdc periodicallytom karl will twist my arm to release data that would violate agreements and therefore hurt us in the long run so i would prefer that you dontspecifically cite or ncdc in this but i can give you good alternative you can point to the petersonmanton article on regional climate change workshops all thoseworkshops resulted in data being provided to the author of the peerreviewed paper with strict promise that none of the data would be released so far as far as i know we have all lived up to that agreement myself with the caribbean data so that is one example of data i have that are not released by ncdc lucie and malcolm for southamerica enric for central america xuebin for middle eastern dataalbert for southcentral asian data john ceasar for asia enricagain for central africa etc the point being that such agreements are common and are the only way that we have access to quantitative insightsinto climate change in many parts of the world many countries dont mind the release of derived products such as your gridded field or xuebins etccdi indices but very much object to the release of actual data which they might sell to potential users does that help regarding ar4 i would like to be part of it i have idea what rolewould be deemed appropriate one thing i noticed with the clas in my old chapter is that if one isnt up to doing his part too busy or different concept of timeliness or it can make for difficult job you and i have worked well together before eg gsn so id be delighted to work with you on it and i know youd hold up your side of the tasks we touched on this briefly at the aopc meeting if i get an opportunity i would say yes but i also dont know what the us ipcc nominating approach would be or even who decides that there is an upcoming ipcc report on extremes and impacts of extremes and i wasnt privy to any insights into the us nominations other than when it was over it was announced in ncdc staff notes that the nominations had been made however kumar had earlier asked if he could nominate so he did i provided him with the details regards tom tom if you look on climate audit you will see that im all over it our ftp site is regularly trawled as i guess yours is it seems that canadian along with two americans copied some files we put there for mohc in early 2003 so saying they have the cru data is not quite correct what they have is our raw data for crutem2 which went into jones and moberg 2003 data through end of 2002 anyway enough of my problems i have question for you im going to write small document for our web site to satisfy probably the wrong word the 50 or so foieir requests weve had over the weekend i will put up the various agreements we have with met services the question i think you told one time that you had file containing all the data you couldnt release ie its not in ghcn presumably this is not in your gridded datasets do you know off hand how much data is in this category would ncdc mind if i mentioned that you have such data not the amountlocationsanything just that there is some on something positive attached is the outlines for the proposed chs in ar5wg1 ch1 is something thomas thinks he can write himself well with qin dahe so only 13 chapters there are lot of issues with overlaps between some of the data chapters 2 with 3 2 with 5 and 2 with 14 im still thinking about whether to get involved it would be 2 if i decide at the moment id say yes but i might change my mind tomorrow nominations are from nov09 thru jan10 with the selection made in april 10 are you considering getting involved i have got the ipcc secretariat and thomas to raise the foi issues with the full ipcc plenary which meets in bali in september or october thomas
