service facsimiles lecture given on 12 september 1963 thank you sorry to keep you waiting i had to turn down the static this is the what audience the 12th of september 12 september ad 13 saint hill special briefing course and youre into the horrors of hidden standards gpms chronic pt problems service facsimiles nonobservation by the pc postulate being where the pc ought to be hows it feel to audit postulate i mean you always thought you had pc in the chair and you havent you got postulate postulate which is designed to make others wrong and themselves right i think thats quite interesting when you get right down to think of it weve had all these things in the past this is scientology three im talking to you about and as it flips over into scientology four weve had all these things in the past and the difficulties that pc has in getting forward with his case are actually just those difficulties which i just enumerated ill go over them again for you seriously pc has hidden standard almost any pc that isnt making excellent progress getting good ta action and so forth has hidden standard what do we mean by hidden standard well he doesnt even know what he is measuring his progress by but its that which he measures his progress by you say did you make any gains in this session and he consults this standard of some kind or another and then he says yes or in accordance with whether or not this standard had shifted now this is your lower level of case that does thisnot necessarily lower level because you can get case into restimulation so that i suppose he does have temporarily hidden standard pcs got headache had headache for week been processed for some little timea considerable length of time and headache has turned on well now hes liable to measure his processing as to whether or not it turns off his headache you see that all the time well now expand that of course you can take by gradients all kinds of aspects of things and you can see that these tiny little things can graduate into very serious overwhelming proportions that is to say any insanity or any complete spin condition is simply an exaggeration ne plus ultra to the exclusion of all other exaggerations of something that is quite normal in most anybody you see you eat you see you consider that normal it isnt very normal but you consider it normal and that somebody is eating is not used by you as an auditor to measure whether or not the individual is clear or not you just dont pay very much attention to it this is something you dont think about very much but as ease gets little bit worse off why you have to start paying attention to it because this may become very great exaggeration and it can become an exaggeration noteat or an eattoomuch or something like this you see now several other facets of life drop out at this particular time and if you took this same phobia at lowerlevel case you could get somebody who did nothing but eatdidnt do anything else see and you say this person is crazy see supposing they just ate everything in sight see pencils razor blades rose bushes see youd say theyre crazy and supposing they refused to eat anything of any kind whatsoeversimilar condition see if you want to understand what is an aberration it is simply an exaggeration of the positive or negative of the usual you can take anything thetan can do and exaggerate it in extremis and it becomes an aberration thats anything dont you see you could say even exteriorization can become extremis see somebody always flies out of his head he is always out of his head he cannot get near his body in any fashion or another he worries about it all the time he cant contact his environment via the body or contact the environment well youd say hes batty on the subject of exteriorization dont you see well what is this then its simply an exaggeration of condition which thetan ought to be able to do well well everybody is bit batty on this particular subject at this particular time because practically nobody exteriorizes easily or theyre always exterior see there isnt any halfway measure on this particular line of exteriorization thats because they are assisted to exteriorize by various means dont you see i mean the implantation and other means to exteriorize them but this is an aberrated condition but you see people around and theyre not exteriorizing easily and you dont think this is odd then we look at that so thats an accepted neurosis see that neurosis is the common denominator of the society or the normal see thats normal well just because everybody is doing it man has an interesting way of measuring up whats right conduct he has it measuring up of whats normal one day you get into society where everybody in the society is terrified of spiders you get into this civilizationeverybody in this civilization is terrified of spiders theyre picking spiders off of themselves all the time you see and they sleep in their beds surrounded by spider traps and they you see just go on and on well theres practically girl in the room who isnt little bit nervy on the subject of spiders dont you see you find spider crawling across your nose you boys would be upset too you see but this society does nothing whatsoever but fight spiders seenothing known in its activity but that one thing but this isnt crazy because everybody does it you see so according to those blokes in that society they look at each other and theres one guy there who isnt afraid of spiders see see one guy there so they say hes batty he doesnt use spider bait around his plate while he eats you see guys crazy you see obviously so this shows you this shows you of course that departure from the normi use an old clich√©a departure from the normal is indication of aberration it is actually of real concern of the auditor because youre bound sooner or later to find somebody who doesnt put spider bait around his plate while he eats you see this by the way what im saying here occasionally causes auditors trouble and theyll have trouble with some casecase runs too easily supposing you found somebody that just clipped off engrams in chains bzzzzzp bongthats the end of that chain of engrams well you have trouble with him you see because its not normal auditing response i remember old ray thacker she used to be worried about auditing after lectures and so forth shell tell you about it today i think and so on changed too fast its upsetting finally got this thing taped it isnt that im so good but i thought it was rather amusing you see i run havingness and zingbang cognitions brrrrand thats the end of the long chain of this and that sort of thing well thats different auditing response from the normal so youre not completely proof of making mistake as an auditor so long as you accept this normal or this average you see as the index as to whether or not person is getting better or how he should behave in processing you see well this gets boobytrapped too because you start processing somebody and he says hes out of his head and hes on the moon and hes here and hes there and hes taken care of the whole bank and that sort of thing and youre processing this bloke and you may find out its not true you see and 2 this upsets you so few weeks later youre processing somebody who is close to an ot and is doing it and it is true see well its just whether or not the guy can do the processthats your thingor whether or not he gains and whether or not he can get tone arm motion now theres good index see pc get tone arm motion you know pc stay in session pc go on willing to talk to you as the auditor see these are your indexes and those indexes are constant they have nothing to do with the speed with which process works or the slowness with which it works doesnt leave you then hung with this thing called departure from the normal you dont have to then have normal for the human race god help us all as an index as to whether or not somebody is making progress in processing i dare say if you went through an insane asylum almost any insane asylum in the world you would find in there somebody who was supernormal and who was not crazy i dare say theres probably one per asylum see but if insanity or neurosis see is measured by just this one thing whether the person is normal why then you run into all sorts of trouble in trying to adjudicate it so what youd stick with is your auditing tools see you find out whether or not this person gets good ta see on what youre running on him and whether or not this person can do the process and can stay in session with the auditor and if the expected gains and that sort of thing are made on the thing and thats your index you see his behavior his actual behavior in life is not of any great worry to you now i give you that as word of warning because as you move up the line with modern processes you very often go through periods of change and particularly with service facsimile and so forthyou go through periods of change which may be very swift and case does some sort of flick of some kind or another and goes from to z without bothering to stop at any other of the letters in the alphabet or does it momentarily and hits high and then does slide back from the high or something like this and if you were worrying all the time whether or not the pc had normal behavior youve just added something into the whole problem of auditing which you just havent anything to do with thats all see and take it from its of valueno value at all we dont care whether theyre normal or abnormal or supernormal or something like that you can define various states and its easier to draw up scale of abilities in life and try to measure somebody up against that if you must study behavior dont you see lets get scale of abilities only lets take whole row of abilities you see and lets find out how the person measures up on each one of these ability lines and so on you might have some idea of his condition as thetan see but that again would have nothing to do with normal see nothing whatsoever you try to measure up thetan to thetan why thats rough now you get some ease that doesnt behave well under usual conditions of auditingand you are having trouble under usual conditions of auditing dont you seewell youve got another problem staring you in the face here and we dont carethat problem is not solved by saying the person is normal or abnormal it is solved by the condition of restimulation of the case thats how that is solved and ive given you whole chart here which by the way has great deal of value and you could put any pc on this or monitor any auditing against this particular chart and start cutting down restimulation on the pc and you can cut down environmental restimulation you see and cut this and that down and you can cut down session restimulation in numerous ways you see just dont give him anything new to audit and that sort of thing and numerous ways of doing this anyway those various zones i gave you there the other day and youll pick up the necessary ta action at some stage or another see now thats completely independent you see of what process you are running on the pc that too that doesnt come into it either you could probably make almost any pc get tone arm action on almost any process providing you reduce the restimulation in various fronts and sectors till the pcs attention could be centered on it and the restimulation was at minimum and you could probably get on almost any pc tone arm action on almost any process but on some youd have to be lot more careful than others because the restimulation is very great you see these as the factors with which you an auditor handle case now lets take look then at the fact that there are some case peculiarities and these case peculiarities all come under the heading of the material youvethat ive just reviewed this minute see nothing in these things violate that now that person has hidden standard does not make him subnormal or supernormal or normal or anything else it merely means he has chronic restimulation that merely means he has chronic restimulation of some kind that is throwing on to the case an additional amount of charge now that was given in your chart i gave you here about whats in restimulation see and that comes under the heading of that and this thing is in restimulation its chronically in restimulation now in service facsimiles and other reasons and so forth we get the reasons why its in restimulation but were not examining why it is in restimulation at this particular time were examining wholly totally and only that it is in restimulation you got that just reduce it to that simplicity theres current stuff in restimulation all right if theres current stuff in restimulation it includes in some cases this thing called hidden standard and you say to the pc did you have any gains in this session did you have any gains in this session and the pc looks sort of holloweyed for moment and he looks back into his skull with his eyeballs or something of the sort and he says to youhe says after minute or two he says now whatwhat brought him to say what brought him to say well the thing that really brings him to say is tone arm action so you can predict whether or not hes going to say but this hidden standard is terribly interesting as little mechanism all by itself and its mechanism that you should look at as fascinating in its own gimmickry its in chronic restimulation its some engram some facsimile you know its in chronic restimulation and if it was changed in the session then hes had gain and if it wasnt changed in the session then he didnt have gain you understand now thats what makes the pc say whether hes had gain or not gain and of course theres the mechanical fact that if you get tone arm action you must have been discharging some of that restimulation so of course it will have changed this thing and he will say he did have gain see its as elementary as this but nevertheless his gain is measured by this thing called hidden standard so there he is there he is with something which tells him whether or not he has had change he actually most of the time is not aware of this now if thatif that was the only thing that happened in the session with regard to hidden standard you would be in clover because you could cope with that because you just have tone arm action see but that isnt all that happens unfortunately that isnt all that happens there is something else going on during the session that you should be very interested in and that is the fact that hes taking this thing whatever it is into every facsimile into every process and is trying to fit the process to this thing he is always trying to find hectically scramblingly and so forth what it is in the incident that you are trying to run on him in the process you are trying to run on him in the picture hes just been presented with which resolves this thing you got that in other words he takes this little red wagon everywhere he goes and he doesnt look at the picture he says did it wash up that little red wagon see now youre going to runyoure going to run some kind of an implant or something on this fellow you see and the stuff is spitting and spapping and burping at him and so forth and he hasnt got really any attention on any of this stuff at all hes trying to find out whether or not its doing anything to the paint on this little red wagon see which in effect is what it gives pc such an introversion in session that he doesnt asis anything and you dont get tone arm action and time and the tone arm fit together now listen to this one because this is very important he drags this thing into every other incident or thing to fit it up and therefore is misdating something for the duration of the session and all sessions hes always misdating something thats worth knowing isnt it the fellow with hidden standard then is always misdating because hes dragging the hidden standardhes dragging the hidden standard into everything youre trying to audit and of course that isnt the date of it thats fascinating little set of phenomena hes dragging this red wagon which may have the date of eight trilliontrillion years ago you see and hes dragging it into yesterday and hes dragging it into the breakfast table this morning and so forth and hes dragging it here and hes dragging it there if you tried to run birth on him he would see whether or not it did anything to the little red wagon you see wouldnt do anything to him so in essence hes put eight trilliontrillion years ago into birth hes put it into breakfast hes put it here and hes given it new date every time its the most effective stopper of ta action there can bethe hidden standard misdate misdate misdate now there is way of getting rid of it process which is calledwas called 3t actually should be called now 4t but could just as easily remain as 3t and until we do complete revision you can write it as 3troutine 3twhich simply asks the pc now this is very germane to your service facsimile because this is very cute very cute you ask your pc for his chronic psychosomatic what does he mainly complain about in auditing now understand you have asked him bluntly and directly hey bud whats your hidden standard but all he knows about it is that he experiences it and that it is always present so you ask him what he is experiencing and what is always present and he says this lumbosis thisthis lumbosis this lumbosis and you slicker him you slicker him and thats just called r3t because the total action of it is you date it you date it and let him get the itsa line in on it and youll find to very marked degree in most cases thats the end of the hidden standard what you have to know in order to understand this completely is the hidden standard always expresses itself physiologically the hidden standard is never hidden physically its hidden from the pc and itd be hidden from the auditor if he never inquired into it its that thing by which the individual measures his gains in processing but thats actually just about as hidden as an elephant in the middle of ballroom itll be what he complains about in processing and sometimes its going to take you an hour or two of itsaing just to find out what it is and that too is very good auditing whats this thing hes been trying to solve in processing whats the physiological condition which most worries him in processing and which he has been trying to solve and he will eventually lay it out on the silver platter and he will say it is my stomach pains now hes got that all settled now that by the way has already alleviated it to marked degree and has given you some interesting tone arm action maybe where you didnt have any before r3t is one of these things you can use in extremis you just put the itsa line in like mad on the guys chronic somatic you see what are you trying to solve in processing see he gives it to you and he gives it to you and he gives it to you and he gives it to you now the only difficulty with this if he starts giving you problems youve sort of had it because that problems isnt an itsa you understand so your question probably ought to lean in the direction of what physical condition are you trying to solve hell eventually isolate these gut pains gradually gradually gradually you know itsa line itsa line itsa line its good auditing see its marvelous auditing hell gradually itsa this thing out into view if he doesnt tell you at once sometimes he spoils the whole process he says oh its my lumbosis see i mean youve had it see then youd have to go into it on the basis well when has this troubled you in processing then youd probably get some ta action out of itsort of an anticlimax but you could probably get some ta action out of the thing even so and that may be the only way you can handle it you know is when has this troubled you this lifetime or something you see but you can take that with r3t and you say gut pains gut pains order of magnitude years ago tens of years ago hundreds of years ago keep going man keep going dont stop just because youve hit trillion some people get allergic to this thing called trillion i dont know why they got lots of them you have big problems in how to express trillions and big problems in how to this ive even had some suggestions that we invent new unit of time some kind or another im all in favor of that but im afraid it would have had to have been done some time ago for it to work on the thetan thank god we arent measuring it in numbers of heartbeats anyway you just get that order of magnitude see and this is by the way good auditing to do this you date very alertly and sometimes you say ive got read here apparently its in the order of magnitude of trillions of trillions of trillions of years ago and the gut pains go bbzzpbrrpbooom and thats all you hear about it and thats the end of that process thats the lengthiest process in scientology in terms of numbers of years covered but not in hours of auditing one warning here you try to nail this thing too closely and you get yourself in trouble and you find pc is sitting in the engram and youre going to have to shift to r3r right there hes so stuck and if he was in gpm youd have to shift to 3n and if he was in his own gpm youd probablyoh well 3m2 so therefore you can make too much of good thing out of r3t see that can be too so the datingnow get thisthe dating is done with an eye on the pc as well as the meter and thats what makes it process which commonly will fail because it is simply overrun you find out this thing is thousands of years ago and he goes dllukglunktum and you see hhhp its almost as good as the meter see hell go and you say all right i had nice read on that that was thousands of years ago all right now how do you feel oh he says i feel better and at that point you haul in the itsa line and go flankspeed ahead into your next process you hear this why he gonna push himself into things i remember oldtime dianeticist been around for lord knows how longhes down in angeles nowand he was in at 42 aberdeen road and i was showing him what straightwire was i was showing him unfortunately the difference between straightwire and engram running unfortunately see so i took his chronic somatic and his worry about this lifetime and i straightwired it out of existence like that i just spotted the time and somebody else had it and it blew and that was that see he was the happiest man you ever laid your eye on you know he was just pleased you know he just was shining and pleased and then i said all right now well pick that up as an engram proceeded to do so and keyed it right straight back in but it was actually terrible cruelty to do that to the man and i actually wouldnt have done it had i realized that he was setting so much store by it so let that serve us as lesson its mistake i havent made again whats the essence of this then when the pc drops this one off bail out too much of good thing here you can even make up some homely platitude you know something about little auditing goes long way if long auditing goes little way or something like that dont you see i know it confused too but theres something about medicine you see if little bit of medicine did lot of good why lot of medicine will do lots of good and you can actually get caught in between this on this little process so the process is not greatly advertised terribly effectiveits been with us foreverbecause its dating the somatic you see and getting rid of it but in this particular case youre not dating the pcs somatic youre asking him what hes trying to resolve in processing you get the difference and thats the only reason it has any importance at all is because once youve dropped that off the pc he then wont consult it to find out if hes made his gains and he wont be dragging the thing into every facsimile or anything else you try to run on him so hes going to make some progress and hes going to make more ta action because hes not always misdating something you got it but little of it goes long long way slippy quick fast i dare sayi dare say when you first use it about 80 percent of the time you will overrun it when you first start using it and then you will get very very expert and about 50 percent of the time you will overrun it see and youll eventually if you keep using it time to time why youll suddenly find out that youre getting pretty slippy youre getting pretty slippy you see if it disappeared on the itsa line youd bail out it isnt likely to but if it did you would youll find out that some horrendous body masses come off of the pc by reason of this operation the only thingthe only thing its used for is this thing called hidden standard you got that now hidden standard is not always present in every pc to point where it ruins the auditing but it is present in any pc who has difficult or delicate tone arm so on your delicatetonearm cases you have another little weapon and if you dont have delicatetonearm easethis character is just running fine with the tone arm action and that sort of thing it isnt always stop you know and isnt always this and isnt all that and you find yourself going around worrying about somebodys tone arm that is your immediate and direct answer if session after session youve worried about somebodys tone arm action and youre doing everything reasonable in order to get the tone arm running and you have not made it and so forth then you just remember this little point on the time track or this little point on the tape when the old man said delicate tone arm probabilityhidden standard remedy r3t and remember he also said little of it goes long way you can get enthusiastic with this r3t you could probably try to run whole ease with it all rightlets see how you can run whole case with it all right now what are you trying to resolve in processing what pains agonies illnesses or sicknesses or physical sensations are you trying to resolve in processing and so forth pc gives it to you order of magnitude date it date it to the secondyou even have to do that sometimesbut you date this thing to the second find the pc stuck in the engramfind out it is an engramshift to r3r get that out and then find the engram is stuck in the middle of the gpm so you shift to 3n you see and you get that handled you see but then you find that this in actual fact is part of one of the pcs own gpms ri so of course you have to shift to 3mr3m2 all right now youve shifted to r3m2 and you find out actually its reaching up into pt so you run service fac on it now having run service fac on it you accumulated quite few arc breaks during this auditing so you little of this goes long way and youll finally get expert at hitting the silk but you actually could take everything the pc was worried about see and do this whole thing you could do r3t even well done on everything the pc was worried about in present time now were being sensible see this isnt ridiculous this is true see you say what are you worried about you know what are you being processed to resolve and so forth and he says well my gut pains all right thats fine r3t gut pains order of magnitude whats wheres the gut pain well to hell with that thats the end of that see all right what else are you trying to resolve in processing well my headaches all right r3t headaches pssheww thats the end of his headache what else are you trying to worry about in processing and so forth what are you trying to resolve and so forth and says husbands all right lets date husbands andfact see all right pssheww order of magnitude on husbands you see your worry is back there at trillionsthirtyfive thats it okay itsa line ahwvvvh see trillionsthirtyfive thatd be good all right anything else youre trying to resolve with processing and so forth well im trying to resolve having bodyhaving body im trying to resolve having body get in my wayget in my way all the time you have to wash em you know have to wash em and they dent and they drip blood all over the place when you stick holes in them and so forth they worry they worry all right body order of magnitudebody bzzbzzbzzzbmp zump zump zump bop well well 208 thousand years ago very good all right thats it pc says yeah theres an interestinginteresting thing there well good good thank you thats when you want to get that tr 2 in there see good all right well what do you know well im certainly glad you found that very fine all right im glad you found that okay now what else are you worried about in actual fact in processing you see you let his line go on the backtrack and hes going to have you wrapped around into every process you ever heard of man youre going to lose control of that session when you finally finished up youd have clear that is method of clearing got it needle would go free ta would come down and so forth impossible as it seems it is method of clearing thatd be every hidden standard he ever heard of anything he could dream up here but dont let him pull any back from the backtrack hahaha that return journeyno payload return empty see nothing baggage otherwise hell start scraping that track up and bring it up to pt and the next thing you know why youre doing oh my god see now the service facsimilethe service facsimilehas to be severely located on the time track and we say this lifetime but actually what youre doing is circumscribing the duration this is your absolute limit of your service facsimile activityr3scis the pair of ris hes currently sitting in on his own gpm line now that can be pretty broad sphere but if you limit it very severely to this lifetime you could even work to key that out dont you see but if for some reason or other this becomes so complicated and you cant get down to it and somehow or another it doesnt come and they just cant make it out and youand you get to wondering why you ever came to the session in the first place you see why youve still got another string to your bowyouve got r3tr3t clearing you can still make clear he cant stop you from doing it you see that now this is with the pc that you cant seem to find service facsimile on that runs over any period of time you know difficult difficult now i say youre going to get some difficult pcsits impossible to say otherwise because the hidden standard in this particular case is the service facsimile but it just happens to be for some reason best known to somebody else completely undentable well theres one thing that will dent it and thats to pick it up wrap it in small black bow wind your arm up around your head and pitch it with high velocity down the time track to place where it belongs and that has degree of workability now of course this is all under the heading of destimulation so because its under the heading of destimulation you have to be very careful not to run anything see thats why it becomes absolutely ridiculous to start running things because you start running things on the whole track on case that youre already trying to destimulatewhy are you trying to destimulate the ease youre trying to destimulate the case so that it doesnt have pt problems and so forth to kick your auditing session to pieces so therefore if you start destimulation actionif you start an action of destimulationwhat have you done if you suddenly start running something on the backtrack hm and if the pcs service facsimile has in it to make you wrong as an auditor thats the first thing the pcs going to do he gonna try to restimulate more than he already got now how do you keep the itsa line in on pc who wants to restimulate more thats your problem how do you keep from arc breaking this pc how do you keep him from actually actively cutting the itsa line well the best way to do it actuallyand i will help you with this problemis be awful damn careful of your whatsits use that whatsit line with great skill knock out of your auditing all social actions thats the first thing you do avoid all violent attention shifts avoid all attention shifts that you possibly can which are directed by whatsit in other words dont direct the pcs attention in such way as to arc break the pc so he starts to get even with you by restimulating more or some weird combination like this occurs just avoid all that see what i mean be awful careful of those whatsit dont say how have you been today you understand thats whatsit gives him an opportunity to say well actually i was sitting inup in the lounge at the bideawee club and so it occurred to you know saw this figure in roman armor see youve had it got the idea it isnt matter of withholding something unless youre obsessively social its just dont use them now the type of model session that is employed on case that is very prone to restimulationisnt getting much tone arm action anyhowis your w unit model session thats your zero social oh let him discuss anything he wants to after sessiondiscuss anything he wants to after session but hes aware of the fact youre longer auditing him and he actually wont plow it in you get the idea now dont keep putting the brace on him and shutting him off and stepping all over his toes and that sort of thing but in session how did that go hmmmmyoure walking along the edge of the precipice dont you see any delicateta ease any case that youre having trouble with any case that youre having difficulties trying to stabilize them into process any caseyou know overrestimulation leads to selfinvalidation you should know that case is invalidating his own case and hes chewing himself up all the time and he doesnt know and he this and that well actually the more you restimulate the more hes going to selfinvalidate and the more hes going to invalidate scientology and other dynamics you understand this is symptom of overrestimulation you can actually classify aberration into these two classes theres the symptoms and reactions occasioned by overrestimulation and then theres the particular significances caused by the service facsimile and other things you see the significancesthe dramatizations the person goes throughthats one channel and restimulation is another channel of course restimulation gives you the degree of dramatization too if you raise the restimulation on case you can raise its dramatization if you handle these problems in the guise and line of restimulation and monitor nicely with destimulation and handle case very nicely like that you can get the case up to point of discharging great deal of stuff and you can get ease to discharge lots of charge but if you go at it so knuckleheadedly that everything you say to the case leaves the ease wide open to the restimulation of more actions you see on the track everything you do with the case and so forth leads to more restimulation and then if your queasiness in handling the case also gets in your road and prevents you from really running processor the pcs nerviness or overrestimulationthen the case is just going to get less and less and less and less and less controllable less and less and less controllable do you see why restimulation is catching up with you so therefore the destimulation of case is an art and it is peculiarly positive sector in the field of auditing and most of you are on this sort of thing right nowservice facsimile see now the service facsimile discharged decreases the restimulation that the ease is subject to even though its just discharged right here in this lifetimepresent time lot of action and so forth case is subject to less restimulation because he pulls in less present time problems in his environment dont you see now the present time problem the aspect of the present time problem is another category of upset to you case with tremendous present time problem does not make good processing gains if persons graph remained the same throughout week of auditing you can assume this case had present time problems the way to handle present time problems is to handle that factor in the ease which causes the case to have present time problems what causes the ease to have present time problems there must be something in restimulation to the case which pulls in present time problems ill give you another method of listing for service facsimile which actually nails present time problems with magnitude you realize that there are so many solutions in the zone or area where we are operating at this particular momentthere are so many solutions to the thingthat itd be very hard to give you total coverage of all of these materials and youre going to discover quite few solutions in running somebody with an itsa line and handling service facsimiles and that sort of thing see youre going to discover lot of these things there are certain standard ones and this could be classified as standard one whats safe assumption about your environment what would be safe method of handling your problems here and now in life now question and list of that particular kind is going to drop into your lap with thud the stable datum that the individual is holding at bay various sectors of his existence so it comes in that wise method of destimulating the environment all you had to do is just list the list with some such question as i just gave you and youll wind up at the other end with what he uses to handle his family what he uses to handle his job that may be another one see all right now lets expand that process and lets take the pcs whole environment to pieces lets take this big sector we call the pcs environment lets take that whole sector and lets compartment it lets find outin present time lets find out where his life is in conflict or contact with what lets find out the whole lot dont you see now this is terrific itsa line stuff youre not saying this lifetime now youre saying now man theres opportunity to go restimulating something else you see its now and his idea of now will probably go back to yesterday afternoon or it might go back for year or so somebody living in farm community or something like that and things are pretty calm he may consider his present time you see much broader you ask london city dweller what his now consists of and he will tell you about his sandwich at lunch you see thats about as far as his time goes its very hectic but lets just take this guys environment just in social sort of an auditing way because youve got such terrific limiter on it you see that you can be very relaxed with your auditing see you can ask him almost anything as long as you dont throw his attention on the backtrack all of your questions have to do with right now your present time the life you are living at this particular moment what have you been in contact with the person will say what period well you know now now well now im in contact with the session this guys too sane to ask such question of so you say to him well in the last thirty days you know what are you in contact with that might not include his parentsthey havent had letter for thirty days something like thatbut its part of his environment lets just get that environment all torn up see lets get him to tell us you know where each sector of this is this is terrific scientology one the guys got the isness of his environment how many people have ever sat down and seen exactly what their life contacts consisted of here and now you talk about orientation man this is orientation well thats going to throw you with ta action and thats going to loosen your needlejust that little innocent questions from you well where are they see oh and i know the smiths i know the smiths the smiths i know the smiths pretty well shes pretty nice looking and he makes awfully good rum nog and punches or something you see and yeah i know the smiths well hes just liable to go on saying well i know the smiths you know i know the smiths your tone arm action will die down after while wake up well what can you say well its like the questions you use in 2h see well where are they where are they see now there youre running the locational process on him you know well where are they oh theytheyretheyre up at eastbourne see theyre up at eastbourne and they live attheythey moved they moved lets see they used to live at 13 galloway street and they now live at 42 yard roadyeah at 42 yard road i dont know quite where that is i was up in eastbourne the other day and so forth and so on lets see yard road and so on i think you come up from the dock its that one under the hill thats thatsthats the one yeah thats where they live yeah ive seen the place before i havent seen their new house but i know where that place is yeah i got that see see that tone arm action go there man you watch that fly you see where are the smiths its apparently got nothing to do with the price of fish see but now youve got the smiths not only categorized but located see and he works for the bideawee biscuit company see all right thats fine of course you can reduce all this to rote procedure that takes all the life out of it very easily bideawee biscuit companyhes telling you very interestedly about the bideawee biscuit company they gettheyre located there and he goes down there to work every morning and so forth and theres porter there by the name of george and george has always got his hand out for an apple or sandwich or something of the sort and hes always got some wisecracks and so forth and theres lot of people around there and theyre pretty good people down at the bideawee biscuit company well let him get away with this down to the bideawee biscuit company you see just so long and well you want to know where is this bideawee biscuit company you see hes run the tone arm action out of what it is you see well lets get some tone arm action lets bleed it down with where it is dont you see and man he gets the bideawee biscuit company parked and hes all of sudden liable to have terrific cognition he all of the time because he goes in the underground its lost sight of the fact that it is actually twelve miles from where he lives see so his bideawee biscuit company and then he realizes they got lot of branch offices around here and there and hes been to several of these branch offices and you can just see this bideawee biscuit company hell start to expandtake place and you see the tone arm start moving on the thing you get lot of nice tone arm action out of it and so forth and he finallyfinally he gets down to the personalities on the thing and youll notice it will be the things which hes having gradientscale difficulty of confronting and youll build up this gradient see and youll see his confront starts going up on his environment to the degree that you blow charge off of it see and his confront starts up on his environment and you can notice this in his kind of answers if youre very clever about it youll notice that he just goes down to the bideawee biscuit company dont you see and he sees george you know georgethats the bideawee biscuit company you know thats about all hes got of the bideawee biscuit company even though he goes there every day is george and the only important fact about george is the fact that george has always got his hand out for an apple see something of that particular sort see now however he expands the fact that he actually works in certain section of it and he has certain associates there who are somethingorothers you see and they work in little bunch of offices and then he all of sudden tells you all about georges family and where george lives see hell revert to that and do wider confront see and then hell go up and then he tells all this and of course he finally can tell you whos managing director and youd consider his confront is adequate then at that moment but youll see how pinned down his attention line is in the environment it doesnt take terribly clever auditor to do this but it takes one that doesnt mind pc being gabby and youre just putting the itsa line in whats his present time consist of and where is it and whos in it and where are they next thing you know you got the guy permeating all over the place see this is lot of auditing this is lot of auditing its terrific hgc approach see after thats happened to somebody in an hgc theyll know very well that the hgc has got their good interests at heart well they have you see but they know that because good scientology one has been run here on the persons lifetime well when hes all through with this and hes got all of his environment laid out and his wifes relations and how likely it is at any moment theyre liable to come to visit him and when hes got everything all taped every place under the sun and you finally now decided that youve got his present time because youve used this you see present time lot of times with him in the discussionand you dont let him catch sight of that otherwise hes going to tell you his war stories false itsa line false line you dont want anything to do with that see so what your lineup here consists of is his present timegot that all categorizedand then you throw in that process i just gave you now that youve got all sections of itand you could actually lay out plot of it and draw mapyou now know where are his zones and sectors of problems and you know which one hes most fascinated with because he gets gloomiest whenever he talks about it you dont need an emeter to tell you that although if you kept talking about it very long its problem problem problem so your tone arm action would die down you see oh well theres my parents sigh about that time even the most imperceptive auditor would notice that there were problems in that vicinity he wouldnt even have to look at his emeter see but if he also looked at his emeter dont you see he would see all of sudden that it started to rise and it wasnt doing any blowing down got that well thats weird way to do an assessment but thats very accurate assessment theres more problems there than he can confront see rising tone arm is confrontalways you see he cant confront this many problems so he cant put any itsa into the vicinity now why cant he put an itsa into the vicinity well you say you can explain that very well sons feel odd sometimes about their parents you see and so on you can explain and explain and explain you see and you can figure it all out and you can figure it all out and you could worry yourself to death but let point something out to you the longer you spend worrying it out you see at breakfast and that sort of thingthe longer you spend doing thatif you catch yourself doing too much of this realize that you are not at the time you are eating breakfast putting an itsa line in on the pc and even though you come to total conclusion with regard to the thing you wont have moved his tone arm one bit and i point that out to you see you wont get any tone arm action on him at all now in your idea you should be getting tone arm action on him thats reasonable assumption see so use this as your assessment line now isnt that an interesting assessment its not an assessment by tick and click and reading lists you see thats an assessment of zone and its an assessment by oh yes yes an assessment by rising tone arm and youve located zone where he has service fac in operation right like that see now we know now we know now why do you get rising tone arm he obviously isnt confronting it now its good for you to assume that there are lots of reasons why he cant confront it and it blows up in his face every time he tries to confront it you understand thats nonsense for you to assume that for the excellent reason its not true youre going to find out he cant confront the bideawee biscuit company because biscuits are good stable datum he never confronts the bideawee biscuit company he confronts and is biscuitsarenogood see so as long as hes got that problem totally solved in present time he never has to look at the bideawee biscuit company so now he will continue to have present time problems with the bideawee biscuit company ill give you the most elementary type of present time problem with the bideawee biscuit company if he cant confront the bideawee biscuit company at all hes going to make mistakes on the job and its going to make present time problems for him doesnt have to be anything esoteric about it you understand because present time problems are in direct ratio to the confront the frequency of present time problems are the measure of confront and heres the recent datum stated at terrific simplicity at the servicefacsimile level heres this recent datum service facsimile confront is caused by substitute confront now that gives you brandnew look at life you always assume you see that the reason the thetan isnt confronting is because he cant confront see we dont care whether he cant confront but that statement doesnt lead to solution of the problem thats all we need to know see so dont worry about whether he cant confront it or not yeah colloquially we speak all the time as scientologists were always saying well well you know joe hes always in trouble he just cant confront that see thats fine thats perfectly true in its limited sense but in actual fact that doesnt lead to resolution of that guys case because it isnt factual it isnt quite factual the reason hes not confronting is caused by the substitute confront which we call service facsimile its something like he has set up little radio tower in the middle of the bideawee biscuit company on which has got i hate biscuits see and that thing that thing confronts the whole bideawee biscuit company for him and so help pete as long as hes got that thing the bideawee biscuit company is going to cave that guy in and is going to knock down the case between sessions to point where youre always having to handle the restimulation of this ease in his environment and if youre only auditing this case two and half hours week and the case is spending fortysome hours week at the bideawee biscuit company in that two and half hours youre not going to even come close to removing the gathered restimulation of the past week you add up the number of hours which youve spent with the case on the subject of the bideawee biscuit company youll find out that they will vastly exceed in efforts to handle his pt problems with the bideawee biscuit companies the effort you would make to simply compartment his environment with great care and find the stable datum that he uses for the bideawee biscuit company find that and run it as service facsimile with r3sc see thatd be the smart thing to do well the opening gun on case obviously is if youve got the tools to do it is to clean up his present time problem so he isnt going to be accumulating continuously this see now the present time problem which generated in his environment is different thing than this other thing i was talking to you about called hidden standard see thats different thing now it stems simply from bigger zone however of restimulation but its being pulled into restimulation arduously and forcefully by the pc continuously for some reason best known to somebody else and the reason its in continuous restimulation is just all these things are bits and pieces of the ri the pc is in and its interesting that you can put that ri to bed and take the thing apart in this lifetime thats whats fascinating that you can do it at all but this thing of bideawee biscuit company he does this all the time its one of the best things thetan does he gets tired of walking down the halls so he puts postulate in the hall i hate biscuits and thats the end of the bideawee biscuit company on his confront but the damn fool continues to stay on at the bideawee biscuit company you can put right conduct down is dont remain places that you dont want to keep confronting see you can put that down as little lesson in life see completely aside from processing dont stay in places you dont want to keep on confronting see because your dontgoonconfronting will then lead you to stick up stable datum of some kind or another to do your confronting for you in that vicinity and the next thing you know this is going to be gorgeous piece of mass and its going to be giving you more present time problems than you can ordinarily count and your life is going to become very restimulative indeed thats little social lesson i give you there out of scientology five anyhowhow to get along in this universe if possible now do you see in essence the compartmentation of the environment and the selection of these little odd bits and pieces you see that hes using as stable data in his environment and the knocking these things out you see with your r3sc processes and so on you will find very easy activity that was what r3sc was originally designed against and for it however goes little bit deeper in that it can take apart service facsimile when r3sc is running very very hard and very arduously and your pc is being knocked all over the place by all of this sort of thing recognize what you have collided with you have collided with the ri which is the current ri in the forming gpm of this particular lifetime its very difficult not to collide with it well it also surrenders to the techniques of r3sc but makes very much more arduous run of it you see so you would say theres two versions of r3sc see but in view of the fact that they are both handled in the same way we classify r3sc in terms of what assessment was done in order to find it and we number the assessments regardless of what stable datum you find you are going to handle it by the steps of r3sc you could enter the thing at almost any of these levels you can also enter it at fourth level solutions when have you used it for solution see but youve got this pattern by which you address stable datumr3sc see now how you arrived at that stable datum would be the assessment you did for r3sc and there are several of these numbered assessments now ive just given you very simple one good scientology one done by class iitype auditorbut its scientology one orientation and isness you see he just does this with the itsa line in and everything running along gorgeously and he gets his environment all oriented on the pc and he gets this thing all taped and he locates the most prevalent source of ptps on his pc by an assessment of mostly ohhh an assessment also with rising ta but that is less observable than the pcs attitude about it hes been talking about you see well actually i uh imim in contact most of the time with airline companies i go down to airline companies and deliver things and that sort of thing and talk to lot of people have to talk to lot of passengers and so forth and talk to hostessesa lot of hostesses to talk to down there too you see once in while i get to talk to pilots and uh i get out to the airport quite often and go over there theres girl at the magazine stand i like to talk to shesshes lots of fun and so forth and any of the toys get worn out why she gives them to for my kids and so forth we have pretty good time out at the airport and i do that and so forth well the real knucklehead of an auditor comes in after that dissertation and says now what stable datum do you have for the airport he isnt going to have any hell finally say the dispatchers tower see hell give you something in the airport you know the girl at the magazine stand you see shes good stable datum for the airport she always tells whats going on in other words you wont get one see so you have to be perceptive just to that degree and now youre going along and you say all right now all right we got all that taped and so forth well how about the socialist club that you belong toyou mentioned moment ago what about that oh well the auditor after while should wake up and realize that what isnt being called on here is another whatsit whats being called for here is safe assumption for the socialist club he must have landed right in the middle of it because he obviously has nonobservation the easiest way to look at it is if the pc hasnt got anything to say about it he isnt observing it obviously then its being observed for him well whos observing it for him whats observing it for him well that being person idea thing television setthats service fac for that zone or area what do you do with it once youve assessed it out and so forth why youve got it lying there and youvoila just run your r3sc steps on it thats all how would it make people right and you wrong and the person said it wouldnt well how would it dominate somebody oh well hohohohohohohohawhaha thats different thing huh thats the most dominative stable datum that you possibly could have thatthatsthatthatthatthats the most dominative that you could have yeah thatthatthatthat is that is yep you keep sitting there waiting for him to answer the question well hell hes answered it and hes blown the level too see here youve got to come back in there and say all right now whats thehow does it get you to escape domination help you to escape domination in any way hoho haha perfect solution thats the end of that level see all right how is survival with regard to this thing hes realizing things all the way along the line it doesnt matter you see whether you flatten any of these processes or not at the first run through when you finally check them over just dont leave one of them hanging out unanswered do you understand it doesnt matter how you chop these things up see dont be neat because its not neat see at the end of the thing get neat see make sure youve got them all now and its all straightened out and that sort of thing see now be neat but heswhatwhat do you mean what do you mean domination dominatehow would it dominate somebody dominate somebody dominating somebody how would it dominate i dont know how it would dominate anybody i dont have any idea at all how itd dominate anybody you know it doesnt dominate anybody havent got any idea well of course the auditors real knucklehead if he says well yes well the question wasill repeat the auditing question for you how would it dominate somebody but thats what im trying to tell you dominate somebody it doesnt dominate somebody and so on see you say all right okay take his answerit wouldnt dominate anybody all right all right thats all right how would it assist your survival ohho well thats different thing come to think about it itit just is it just is survival it isis survival itsitsitsitsit just is its just life to you know i never really looked at that before but it is justits its life thatthats what it is itit is its just life and the auditor who says at that time all right thank you now how would it assist your survival is being complete knucklehead the guy has answered the question hes not answered the question hes answered the whole universe of questions with regard to it hes given you the perfect answer which it is that is the most perfect answer there is about anything thing you got to do is keep your tone arm moving and you do that sort of thing and you do it real slippily and only ask the pc what he can answer and only take it and so forth dont start getting hard or tough on the pc till you finish it up see now lets go over these things tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk ah that one ticked that one ticked that one ticked right there all right now how would it make people wrong well i meant to tell you but in actual fact ii used to use this quite bit quite bit on all of my girls ive been reluctant to mention it but there it is and he clears this thing up and of course youre away in other words youve got variety of processes here that are all running more or less at once and the reason why you have variety of processes all running at once is youre running variety of confusion so it wont be very orderly it wont get orderly till toward the end most of the confusion is discharged you see that service facsimile held in abeyance all the confusion that was there residual its that confusion running off which gives you the tone arm action your tone arm action doesnt come from stable data flying off it comes from enunciating and asising stable datums which then permit confusions to fly off which have been held in abeyance by those stable data so if your confusion flies off youre going to get charge releasing because charge is in essence confusion thats all there is to that see its elementary youre going to untangle ball of string youre going to have string if you dont untangle ball of string youre not going to have string i mean thats all there is to that you untangle ball of confusion youre going to have tone arm motion and if youre not going to untangle ball of confusion youre not going to have tone arm motion thats it theres two reasons why you dont get tone arm motion then youre not untangling the confusion or there isnt any confusion there thats the only two reasons so you enter into this problem at these various levels and youll find out theres beautiful assessment that gives you service facsimiles like mad now how you run the service facsimile after youve gotten it ive just covered but its always the same you always handle service facsimile in this particular line youll get very slippy at it after while its slippy auditing but the number of ways that you can arrive at what is the pcs service facsimile are practically uncountable now the very best method i know of at this particular time is the method i have just given younot the method of picking up the ri from pcs goal see thats liable to restimulate the whole gpm particularly in very inexpert hands that couldnt rescue it and list it out anyhow if it did happen see but this other one is doll this other one is doll i can see you now supervising auditing someplace or another and you hand out this assessment sheet you see that the auditor is supposed to fill in see and you hand him this assessment sheet you see who are your parents and why not and all kinds of things and they all go down the line and the thing has got about three pages and youve got this assessment sheet and you say now youre running r3sc make sure to keep the itsa line in very very well while youre doing this assessment sheet and you give him this fourpage sheet see takes care of his job and his profession and where its located and all that sort of thing the auditor bounces up fortyfive minutes later and hands you the sheet all complete we obviously have somebody there who had to get something done as an auditor see he just blew the intensive thats all and im sure this is going to happen to you every one of you thats supervising any auditing at all this is going to happen to you you just blew the intensive see for the pc now what do you do now what do you do where do you go from here i mean thats it you obviously have to run some other process you can go off on to parts of existence and that sort of thing but in actual fact the assessment sheet was never filled in dont you see you just said whos your father whos your mother mothers name mothers name and brothers or sistersgot any brothers or sisters thirtythree brothers four sisters and eight cousins all right thats fine how old were you last birthday fortyseven all right thank you very much so forth and where do you live whats your address whats your address all right 933 north elm all right cincinnati very good and what company are you with oh the bideawee biscuit company very good all right thank you very much whats their address where are they located whats the address oh 29 front street thank you very much now so whats missing here well the only thing thats missing is the total assessment he isnthe just missed the whole purpose of what hes supposed to do you want to know all about this pcs present time and everything hes in contact with you see well in matter of fact you could come back to the question i just asked you before if you were scotched to that degree you could come back to the question i gave you about assumptions about your present time environment and that sort of thing you could get stable datum and you could get the pc to run without the assessment dont you see look at all that gorgeous tone arm action that you missed out on see you might have missed out there two sessions three sessions of gorgeous tone arm action marvelous you see the thing would be flying all over the place the guy destimulated all over the place the guy practically clear and flying see itd just be in the difference of emphasis of the assessment so the understanding of the assessment and understanding that an assessment in r3sc is to produce tone arm action not data we dont care anything about the data it produces but the tone arm action now that assessments supposed to produce some tone arm action and youll see that itsan r3sc becomes peculiar brand of assessment and the individual in scientology three who has been carefully carefully carefully educated in doing an r3sc assessment keeping the itsa line in keeping the tone arm running like mad moves into scientology four and does an assessment for gpm goals list with the itsa line in wide open uuhhh well thats one case we wrote off see r3m see is done pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa see itsa line data data data data data all of sudden the pc cognites on something you see oh thats fine he tells you something about it and so forth see all right good data data data data data see item item item list list list there thththuh theres your item bang schnook got it thats your item oh yeah now let your itsa line go in little bit in this lifetime i really had oh yeah schnook could reallywould reallyreally mow schnack down man thatthatthatthatthats it thats it thats it thats it thats it fine all right good all right heres the next list who or what would schnook oppose tsktsk rapidly rapidly come on come on come on come on come on give the data come on and so on and so on schnookoppose all right good good good got it got it yeah your nextcome on come on come on what would it oppose well all right you can cognite give you thirty seconds to cognite something like that give you the idea thats 3m2 see you could go dragging your heels doing one of those assessments and youd wind up five intensives later with two ris found see pc in total restimulation everything gone to pieces you wonder whats wrong you get the difference this lifetime present time itsa line in assessment well i dont know i dont know i think were going to have to get rid of bill as an auditor because he had one of these present time assessments and it only lasted him two intensives he found out all about the guy by the middle of the second intensive tsk nothing else to do on the pc finished wrecked the case wrecked the case pc not clear yet and hes got the intensive filled now what are we going to do see theres different end goal in progress here isnt there entirely different atmosphere involved in these assessments so you must keep in mind that there are two different moods of assessing and if you dont keep that severely in mind youre going to make an awful flub because its another auditing style r3sc leisurely quiet calm drag it out endlessly itsa line in because its all guided you see by present time and lifetime and that sort of thing see r3m2 pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa gimmegimmegimmegimme what is it what is it lets make it speed man all right oh you only found four ris in this session going to have to speed it up in the next session you know assessment do goaloppose list we didwe didwe did goaloppose list and so forth all right its taken us two and half hours to find this next goal whats the matter with you it took you two and half hours to find the pcs next goal whats the matter with you whats the matter with you guy had been doing scientology three all the time well i thought i had until the next intensive oh man youre doing another type of process here entirely and so on lets get that goaloppose list listed and nulled and that sort of thing two hours thats all you got thats it thats it more than that so you understand why because backtrack you got to keep the itsa line shut got it otherwise you restimulate the pc your tone arm action disappears all right ive kept you little bit overtime start your sessions fifteen minutes late tonight okay thank you thank you
