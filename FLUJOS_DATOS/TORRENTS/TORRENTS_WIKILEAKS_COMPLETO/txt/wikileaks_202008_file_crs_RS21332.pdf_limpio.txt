divisive debate among african leaders the deba arrayed leading political and economic reformers in particular advocates of nepad and of africas further integration into the global economy against several leaders who have championed african political autonomy and nationalist policy ag endas the latter including the heads of state of libya zimbabwe namibia and gambia criticized nepad they warned that for such plan to be successful it would need to be define d realized and contro lled by africans alone independent of external influences nepad was defined by foreign political and economic models they asserted and might subject africa to externallyimposed political conditions in exchange for credit and other ssistance they also asserted that nepad would create financial depende ncy on external creditors7 libyan and south african leadership roles differences over the proposed purpose and role of the au played out in reported disagreements between president thabo mbeki of south

continental unity and sovereignty vis avis the industrialized world and strong re jection of policy cond itionalities in exchange for access to credit despite alqadhafis early conceptual contributions to the creation of the au and his subsequent outreach efforts the au organization that ultimately emerged reflected broad african leadership suppor t for nepad the gradual displacement of alqadhafis

in many african countries although in seve ral countries including zamb ia malawi and mozambique the trend toward entrenched presidential incu mbency has been reversed in other cases the legitimacy of recent local legislative ections administered by ruling parties have been questioned by opposition groups and outside observers key challenges facing the au are disputed polls in madagascar zimbabwe nigeria also held widely criticized election madagascar in the island nation of madagas car contested presidential elections in late 2001 led to tense violent half year standoff between the two candidates and their supporters after the election the cha llenger businessman marc ravalomanana citing electoral irregularities declared himself the electoral winner over didier ratsiraka the longtime incumbent the malagasy supreme court later sanctioned his claim in june 2002 the united states and several other pow ers formally recogn ized ravalomananas government and france soon followed suite the au however has not recognized the new government and s called for new elections senega l which had tried to mediate in crisis did not endorse the au decision it recognized the new government as did burkina faso mauritius libya and the comoros there are indications that the au may soon recognize the current malagasy government zimbabwe in contrast to its madagascar decision the inaugural au assembly tacitly accepted the highly disputed march 2002 reelection of zimbabwean president robert mugabe which was preceded by exte nsive political violence and controversial land redistribution program although the au did not directly address the election it affirmed earlier oau endorsement s of it mirroring acceptance of the election by sub regional leaders and sadc in contrast the united states the european union and other countries rejected the z imbabwean poll leaders of the zimbabwean opposition movement for democratic change some of whom were prevented from attending the au inauguration called upon the au to use the ne pad african peer re view mechanism to sanction the zimbabwean government for abuses of human and political rights elitism and popular participation civil society activists have long charged that the oau was statecentric forum that uphe ld the interest of political elites rather than the public good some critics predict th at the au may become subject to similar biases and assert that without much broader input from african societies at large the au will become irrelevant to the needs of the ma jority of africas citizens still many critics see positive potential in both the au and nepad and leading au architects such as president mbeki have recognized their concerns in public statements mbeki has sponsored forums focusing on aurelated po licy goals of diverse civil society groups structural poverty and financing of nepad the au may face difficulties in financing its ambitious agenda as di d the oau the average subsaharan per capita in 2002 was 470 and was much lower in many nonoilproducing countries in addition wealth is highly unequally distributed in ma ny african countries even in the wealthiest of subsaharan countries the majority of people are poor while nepad is an attempt to improve the economic standing of africa in general growth that it may generate is likely to occur over the medium to longter m in the short to medium term funding shortfalls are likely to curtail the ability of the au to meet its planned objectives
