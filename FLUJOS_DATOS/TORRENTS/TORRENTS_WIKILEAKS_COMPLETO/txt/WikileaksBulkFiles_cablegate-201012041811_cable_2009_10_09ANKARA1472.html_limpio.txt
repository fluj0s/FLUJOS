to turkey classified by ambassador james f jeffrey reasons 14 b and d 1 s sandy glad youll be able to visit turkey at this key time your short visit will give you an opportunity to engage with key turkish leaders on first and foremost in their minds missile defense the turks are keen to learn more about us plans in particular what role the us wantsexpects turkey and others in europe to play the turkish general staff tgs will be interested in our ideas for hldg reform even if they may be slow to accept them 2 s you know how broad our agenda is with turkey as you will have short time in country i suggest you focus on few key issues be sure to raise missile defense with emphasis on how the us will look to several allies not just turkey for help 3 repeat our commitment to our intel and other support for strikes against the pkk 56 appreciation for turkeys efforts on afghanistanpakistan 13 float the idea of hldg reform and ensure guner knows we expect him in washington 4 press for realistic assessment of turkeys view of the threat assessment from iran 10 watch out for pressure for direct us milops against the pkk paras 1112 conflation of turkeys exploration of air defense capabilities with our missile defense needs 3 missile defense 3 s the turks will appreciate your update on us missile defense plans and in particular will expect you to have specific ideas on how turkey would contribute to the paa while the toplevel bureaucrats with whom you will meet will understand the rationale for the paa and will be ready to explore ways turkey can help the political environment for request to base assets in turkey is mixed and turkeys perception of the iranian threat to its territory differs from ours the got continues to tread fine line in managing its strong relationship with the us and its ties with both the islamic world and russia the government must be able to demonstrate that any missile defense program is not specifically antiiran nor blatantly proisrael 4 s likewise it will want to ensure that russia is not opposed to turkeys role also important will be clarity on the degree to which this system is nato one under nato command and control c2 the paa would presumably complement turkeys effort to establish domestic missile defense capability that would protect turkeys major population centers the pac3 has been offered in response to turkeys air defense tender and you should highlight the systems ability to be interoperable with any future nato command and control architecture hldg 5 c you will need to outline us views to streamline and alter the current hldg format to make it into more substantive discussion the turks are shy to stray from the status quo you should emphasize why we feel this change is necessary while underscoring that it is vitally important the dchod guner attend the upcoming hldg in december when decisions about future dialogues will be agreed upon we have learned that the new position of tgs number three fourstar slot held by general balanli with focus on hardware might get the nod for the hldg representative weve told guner it should be his you should also be prepared for the turkish general staff to raise the shared defense vision document as they await response to their latest proposed text pkk 6 c turkeys counterterrorist efforts against the pkk have evolved in the past year and have expanded beyond military action alone although the governments democratic ie kurdish initiative is not yet fully developed the government has increased social and economic support to ethnic kurds in southeast turkey has dramatically broadened the rights of kurds to use their own language and increased educational opportunities as well it is our view that the tgs military success against the pkk supported by our intelligencesharing operation has given the civilians the political space to explore this opening turkish military operations against the pkk continue however and on october 6 parliament extended the governments mandate to conduct crossborder operations against the pkk in iraq for another year 7 c our 2007 decision to share operational intelligence was turning point for the bilateral relationship and president obamas declaration before the turkish parliament of our continuing commitment to support turkeys fight against the pkk was warmly welcomed this cooperation has helped to improve our bilateral relationship across the board turkeys military leaders value this intelligence and the advice our military leaders give them our work has made it difficult for pkk terrorists to use northern iraq as safe haven turkish causalities are still occurring however and an increasing proportion are from ieds due to pressure on chief of staff general basbug and the turkish general staff tgs to finish off the pkk this year the government wants and has requested direct us kinetic action against the pkk we have refused this request to date due to our own rules of engagement the got has also requested the sale of armed mq9reaper uavs which will be challenge to fulfill see 10 northern iraq 8 c turkey will not consider any alternative to the political unity and territorial integrity of iraq but has become more flexible on how it engages the local authorities of northern iraq how turkey refers officially to the kurdish regional government krg turkeys policy remains focused on the government in baghdad but its outreach to the krg is expanding this outreach is reinforced by the continued dominance of turkish products and investments in the krgs healthy economy it is also tied to turkeys new opening to its own kurds by far the biggest and most controversial domestic political issue here 9 s the usturkeyiraq tripartite security talks continue regularly and new tripartite operational office in erbil established to share counterpkk intelligence was established over the summer the turks remain shy to share data they are not convinced that they can trust iraqikurdish individuals to keep information concerning operations secret nevertheless it is step in the right direction turkish military officials have become more strident in their calls for krg officials to take action against the pkk us drawdown through turkey 10 s habur gate and the incirlik cargo hub vital to our sustainment operations could be helpful in our drawdown if other options prove too difficult minister of national defense vedci gonul suggested to secretary gates in june that turkey was ready to agree to the increased use of incirlik for this purpose using the surface route from habur gate to mediterranean ports iskenderun mersin is also worth exploring and we may be able to involve turkish commercial shippers in support of the northern distribution network we caution that the rough terrain security environment and the cantankerous nature of the turkish government bureaucracy will challenge any us operation nevertheless we are evaluating these options in cooperation with centcom and eucom partners iran 11 c turkey understands and partially shares us and international concerns about irans nuclear ambitions but is hesitant to use harsh language in public statements in part due to its dependence on iran as an energy supplier and as trade route to central asian markets pm erdogan himself is particularly vocal skeptic of the us position turkey believes international pressure against iran only helps to strengthen ahmadinejad and the hardliners however it continues to press iran quietly to accept the p5 plus 1 offer the got is strong partner in our nonproliferation efforts with several significant results politically turkey will try to position itself on iran between wherever we are and where russia is in pinch or if pressed the turks will slant to us uavs and attack helicopters 12 c turkey seeks to acquire on an urgent basis its own uav capability the administration has made clear at high levels that we support this goal and turkey has pending request to acquire armed reaper uavs ultimate approval for armed reapers is complicated due to mtcr obligations and hill concerns however even if those could be overcome the delivery pipeline for these systems is long and turkeys leaders have sought reassurance that we will not pull our intelligence support until they can replace it we have not made this commitment to date 13 c additionally bad procurement decisions led turkey to severe shortage of attack helicopters desperately needed for its fight against the pkk turkey has looked to us to help them bridge the capability gap asking to purchase additional ah1w super cobra aircraft these aircraft are in short supply in our own inventory but secretary gates and vcjcs cartwright have promised to try to support with request within few years four each in 2011 2012 and 2013 the turks took this as an affirmative and recently started pressing for delivery in 2010 instead of 2011 afghanistanpakistan 14 c turkey has commanded isaf twice since its inception and will take command of rccapital this november turkey leads prt wardak and plans to open second prt in jawzjan in early 2010 turkey has sponsored the ankara process dialogue one of several efforts to encourage constructive communications between kabul and islamabad and is leading participant in the friends of democratic pakistan turkey pledged significant aid to both countries usd 200 million to afghanistan and usd 100 million to pakistan because of its culture history and religious orientation as well as foreign minister davutoglus strategic ambition turkey is well disposed to act as an agent of the international communitys goals in afghanistan and pakistan constraining turkeys potential is lack of resources our conversations with turkish interlocutors have helped us identify several areas in which turkey can be of particular help education and health military training and support economics counternarcotics and trilateral engagement note turkey will not support any ct operations in afghanistan they do not believe there is natoisaf mandate to engage in these operations and they additionally have national caveats preventing them from participating in natoisaf ct operations the got also believes that isaf should notnot be engaged in the counternarcotics fight believing that foreign fighters who engage in this fight just produces antipathy against foreign forces in the local population i do however believe the got are willing to engage the training of afghan security forces caucasus 15 c turkey seeks to develop itself as regional power and recognizes that the caucasus region stymied in its growth by frozen conflicts could turn to turkey for develop the signing of the protocol document in zurich on october 10 was landmark for the region and should serve as starting point for establishing bilateral relations and ultimately the opening of its closed border nevertheless future relations will still be heavily linked to the 1915 genocide issue and the resolution of the nagornokarabakh conflict between armenia and azerbaijan turkey consistently warns that any us determination of the events of 1915 as genocide would set off political firestorm in turkey and the devastating effect on our bilateral relationship including political military and commercial aspects would be unavoidable political environment 16 c pm erdogans islamistleaning justice and development ak party is squarely in the drivers seat but fears an erosion of its political base from more conservativeislamist parties civilianmilitary relations remain complex chief of staff general basbug has worked out modus vivendi with pm erdogan but the longrunning struggle between turkeys secularists with the army as its champion and islamists represented by the government naturally puts them at odds erdogan has the clear upper hand fact with which basbug has seemingly learned to live alleged past military involvement in coup contingency planning or even deliberate generation of internal chaos remains political theme number one and preoccupies both erdogan and basbug and their respective underlings israel 17 c while the foreign ministry and the turkish general staff agree with us that strong turkeyisrael relationship is essential for regional stability pm erdogan has sought to shore up his domestic right political flank at the expense of this relationship his outburst at davos was the first in series of events the results of which we and his staff have sought to contain the latest of these was exercise anatolian eagle erdogan canceled israels participation hours before the exercise was to begin with an israeli strike across turkish airspace against targets in iran possibility erdogan decided he could not afford the political risk of being accused of training the forces which would carry out such raid through some remarkable work with allies and with the interagency we engineered public postponement of the international portion of the exercise but the relationship has begun to sour jeffrey visit ankaras classified web site at httpwwwintelinks govgovwikiportalturkey
