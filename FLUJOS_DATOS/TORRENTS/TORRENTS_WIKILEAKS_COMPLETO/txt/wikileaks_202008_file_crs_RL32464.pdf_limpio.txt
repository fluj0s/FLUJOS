policy and issues in usfrench relations introduction the end of the cold war has altered th usfrench relationship before the collapse of the soviet union the unite d states france and their nato allies viewed the ussr as the principal threat to security france was known for its independent streak in polic ymaking both with its eur opean counterparts and the united states notably under president ga ulle in the 1960s nonetheless there was cohesion throughout the alliance at such moments as the berlin crisis of 1961 the cuban missile crisis the following year and the debate over basing euromissiles in the 1980s several factors shape french foreign policy that may be of interest during the 110th congress after severa l years during which jacques chirac contested elements of bush administration policy the new french president nicolas sarkozy is seeking improved bilateral relations nonetheless differences between the ited states and france in the approach to foreign policy are likely to persist france has selfidentity that calls for efforts to spread french values and views many rooted in democracy and human rights france prefers to engage most internati onal issues in multila teral framework above all through the european union eu france is also highly secular society characteristic that influences views on the states relation to religion since the conclusion of the cold war the perspectives of france and the united states have diverged in some cases most core interests remain similar both countries governments have embraced th opportunity to build stability in europe through an expanded european union eu and nato each has accepted the need to ensure that russia remain constructively engaged in european affairs each has also recognized that terrorism and the pr oliferation of weapons of mass destruction are the most important threats today postcold war developments have brought new challenges which have affected the usfrench bilateral relationship german unification and the entry of central european states into the eu and nato may have shifted the continents balance of political and economic power away from th frenchgerman engine and towards central and eastern europe while frenchgerman initiatives remain of great importance in europe german perspectives are increasingly eastward and in some eyes central european states feel closer strategically and politically to the united states than they do to france nonetheless france remains key player in european affairs and few initiatives can succeed without its support and participationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32464crs2 1 anand menon france nato and the limits of independence 19811997 the politics of ambivalence new york st martins press 2000 p 6971 2 is wary of dangers

states global superpower since the second world war has remained deeply involved in european affa irs in the view of some europeans however by the mid1990s washington app eared to be slowly disengaging from europe while wanting at the same time to maintain leadership on the continent1 french and german and some would say british efforts to form an eu securitypolicy potentially independent of nato and the united states emerged and evolved in this period the europeans based this policy in part on the belief that the united states had growing priorities beyond eur ope and in part because americans and europeans were choosing different means to protect their interests the us decision to go into afghanistan in october 2001 with in itially minimal allied assistance was one example of this trend the us war against iraq with overt opposition from france and several other allies was another during the bush administration france w ith other european allies has pressed the united states to confront emerging crises within multilateral framework terrorism and proliferation are threats that cross borders and of ten involve nonstate actors france where possible normally attempts to engage elements of the international community in responding to such threats and to legitimize actions ranging from economic sanctions to political censure to military action at the united nations in the view of many offici als the united states has disparaged the united nations and is impatient w ith its decisionmaking process 2 france has promoted view of multipolar world with the eu and other institutions representing poles that encourage economic development political stability and policies at times at odds with the united st ates while jacques chirac was president bush administration officials have reacted with hostility to such efforts charging that multipolar is euphemism for organizing opposition to us initiatives in the recent past some us observers characterized france as an antagonist the previous french ambassador reportedl charged that some us officials deliberately spread lies and disinforma tion about french policies in order to undercut paris3 occasional mutual antagonism was already evident during the first years of the fifth republic 1958present when president gaulle sometimes offered singular views on international ffairs often at odds with washington and other allies and in 1966 withdrew france from the military structures of nato in the 1960s france began to develop its own nuclear deterrent force french assertiveness is generally seen in different more constructive light in europe other europeans often credit french initiatives in the eu and in other institutions as fresh in perspective or moving discussion in to new

france and the united states the inevitable clash international journal vol lix 1 winter 20032004notion that there could be turning back to monarchical government not only was the monarchy overthrown and powerful c hurch structure forcibly dismantled but french armies and ultimately french administrators in their wake transformed much of the continent into societies where more representative democratic institutions and the rule of law could ultimately take root the revolution was therefore central formative element in modern european hist ory notably in europes evolution from monarchical to democratic institutions the cultural achievements of france before and since the revolution have added to french influence french became the language of the élite in many european countries by 1900 french political figures of the left and the right shared the opini on that france was and must continue to be civilizing beacon for the rest of the world6 the view that france has civilizing mission mission civilisatrice in the world endures today for many years the french government has emphasized the message of human rights and democracy par ticularly in the developing world and in central europe and eurasia many french officials particularly gaullists7 have been highly assertive in seeking to spread french values throug hout the world dominique villepin the last prime minister under jac ques chirac wrote that at the heart of our national identity there is permanent search for values that might be shared by others gaullists have sought to embed french views in eu initiatives sometimes in concert with germany and sometimes alone in th 1990s one cabinet fficial called for an inner circle in the eu defined as small number of states around france and germany that must move

prejudice and fanaticism however they see occasional c ontradictions in french policy as when france sought to lift sanctions against iraq when wmd inspections temporarily ended there in 1998 then only belatedly accepted new inspections regime in 2002 even though french officials had privately been stating their belief that iraqi wmd programs were likely continuing or when france balks at what some view as more democratic powersharing in the expanding european union9 the european union france was one of the founding member s of the european union initially known as the european coal and steel community and then the european community in the 1950s improved trade and economic devel opment were central objectives in europe still struggling from the dislocation caused by the second world war but overarching objectives from the beginning were political rapprochement between germany and its former enemies and political stability on the continent the eu was conceived in this context with strong us support france has been catalyst in achieving greater political unity and economic strength in the european union jac ques chirac the french president from 1995 may 2007 altered the traditional gaullist view that france c ould act alone as global power and be the unions most important member rather today the gaullists believe that france can best exert its power through the eu acting in tandem with germany and occasionally with britain at the same time the defeat of re ferendum in spring 2005 endorsing an eu constitution meant to make eu decisionmaking more effective may be sign of popular doubts about the direction and streng th of the union the defeat of the constitution at least temporarily diminished frances leadership role in the union some european governments object to the view that france germany and britain can guide eu policies they describe the claim for leadership of the three countries as nascent directoire or initiative to dominate the eu and push smaller member states to follow the three governments lead french officials dispute the idea of directoire in their view initiatives in the union should not be held back by governments that wish to proceed more slowly chirac described the efforts of france and germany and occas ionally britain as those of pioneer group that wishes to go faster and furthe r in european integration some french officials say that france does not wish to be resigned to europe which would only be space of internal peace rather in th eir view the eu shoul d become force for positive broadreaching change in

monetary policies france initially described emu as bove all political measure in which eu member states agreed upon jo int economic policies for the good of all when france and germany decided to

government the conflict in iraq in 2003 raised questions about the legitimate use of force france together with several other european governments has been critical of the bush administrations national security doctrine that endorses preem ptive action in the face of imminent danger sarkozy has said that the us invasion of iraq in 2003 was significant mistake that has contributed to the destabilization of the middle east although the french government does not reject the use of force it maintains that certain criteria must be met for military action to acquire legitimacy in the words of villepin fear of terrorism and other threats make the use of force tempting use of force is justifiable if collective security or humanitarian crisis requires it but it should only be last recourse when all other solutions are exhausted and the international community through the security council decides upon the question in speech to the general assembly in clear reference to the us invasion of iraq chirac said in todays world one can act alone in the name of all and one can accept the anarchy of society without rules there is alternative to the united na tions multilateralism is essential it is the security council that must set the bounds for the use of force one can appropriate the right to use it unilaterally and preventively15 for the most part frances record over the past decade has been consistent in following the precept that the must ndorse the use of force in crisis for example france along with other countries si nce 1990 has obtained resolution for the potential or actual use of force for interventions in the first gulf war bosnia afghanistan congo the ivory coast and haiti one notable exception came in 1999 when france joined its nato allies in going to war against serbia in an effort to prevent ethnic cleansing in kosovo in that case until the eleventh hour the french government sought reso lution for natos use of force at the same time in the face of an increasingly likely russian veto french officials and counterparts from several othe r european allies began indi cating that serbian actions had reached stage where using force to prevent humanitarian catastrophe in kosovo would be justifiable without resolution16 when russian veto became certain there was consensus in nato that the use of force was justifiable in this instance even in

to war in the 16th century over religious differences nd dynastic claims the conflict left many thousands dead and the society badl divided one cause of the revolution was desire by many to nd the catholic churchs grip on elements of society and dismantle church hierarchy widely vi ewed as corrupt and poorly educated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the government sought to ensure that public schools did not become embroiled in religious controve rsies parliament passed law in 1905 intended to ensure paration between relig ion and politics the law enshrined laïcité as principle of french life laïcité is not simply secularism but rather an attempt to balance religious freedom and public or der the government protects freedom of religion and there is state church in france at the same time there is an effort to ensure that religi ous groups do not engage in political activism that would be disruptive of public life17 current controversy in france has pitted elements of the

passed by wide margin in march 2004 with governme nt parties and elements of the left supporting it some observers in france criticized the b ill because they viewed it as essentially negative instrument in this view the government should do more to integrate muslims into french society the deba evokes familiar theme in recent french history at the turn of the 20th century for example many opposed the large migration into france of italians and sp aniards ethnic groups viewed as coming from societies where political violence was ri fe yet these groups have become well assimilated into french society their members commonly occupying senior positions in politics and the professions in contrast many observers in france believe that large elements of the muslim population ve not been assimilated one observer member of the governmentappointed commission to study the issue of head scarves in schools opposed the law in his view france should seek balance that embraces diversity yet preserves degree of uniformity that sustains the french identity he belie ves that the law unfairly stigmatizes the muslim population21 sporadic riots since late 2005 have troubled the suburbs surrounding paris lyon toulouse lille and othe r cities for the most part these are working class suburbs p opulated by north africans unemployment levels ar high and educational levels are low in

intervention in corporate activity and the war in iraq have contributed to increased bilateral tensions in recent years agriculture agricultural trade disputes historically have been the major sticking point in usfrance commercial relations although the agricultural sector accounts for declining percentage of out put and employment in both countries it has produced disproportionate amount of tr ade tensions between the two sides as trade is under the jurisdiction of the eur opean commission the problems of course are not technically bilateral in nature from the us perspective the restrictive trade regime set up by the common agricultural policy cap has been challenge it has been longstanding us contention that the cap is the largest sing distortion of global agricultural trade american farmers and policymakers have complained over the years that us sales and profits are adversely affected by 1 eu restrictions on market access that have protected the european market for european farmers by 2 eu export subsidies that have deflated us sales to third markets and by 3 eu domestic income support programs that have kept noncompetitive eu ropean farmers in business but from an eu and french perspective the cap s been substantially reformed in recent years and cannot be characterized as the rgest source of distortions in agricultural trade on the contrary under this view there is ample evidence that eu as well as australian new zealand and ca nadian farm exports have been hampered by us food aid policies in some developing countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32464crs25

farmers the french position can determine the limits and parameters of the european commissions negotiating flexibility on range of agricultural issues that are of keen interest to the united states the most prominent and perhaps important example relates to current efforts to get th wto doha round of multilateral trade negotiations back on track by reducing ag ricultural subsidies and other barriers to market access other exam ples where the french position arguably has made settlement of disputes more difficult include expanded trademark protection for wines cheeses and other food products li nked to specific regions and ban on the importation of beef tr eated with hormones64 government intervention in corporate activity despite significant reform and privatization over the past 15 years the french government continues to play larger role in influencing corporate activity than does the us government this difference is manifested not only in the french governments continuing direct control of key companies but also in its continuing proclivity to influence mergers involving french firms president sar kozy has continued to support this policy orientation in number of ways nevert heless although bilate ral disputes may be more prone to occur because of the french governments interventionist tendencies the dictates of eu laws as well as the urgent need to raise the revenues through privatization efforts and to enact marketo riented reforms are weakening the french dirigiste tradition in 1997 the then socialist government re started process of privatization and opening of governmentcontrolled firms to pr ivate investment that had begun in the 1980s and the program was continued by the centerright government that took power in 2002 in 2003 and 2004 the government reduced its stakes in large companies such as air franceklm to 446 from 540 percent france telecom to 422 from 545 percent renault to 156 fro m 260 percent and thomson to 20 from 208 percent the government still s stakes in bull and safran and in 1280 other firms while the trend has been to privatize many large companies fully or partially the government still maintains

thales and safran66 at the same time that sarkozy is suppor ting interventionist policies designed to enhance frances economic and industrial strength he is also promoting market oriented domestic reforms on issues such as taxation and labor markets in this context president sarkozy views increased competition as way to get frances overregulated economy on track for stronger growth67 foreign policy discord in the era of the cold war there was considerable concern that trade disputes between allie s could undermine political and security ties deep differences over the iraq war between the united states and many of its allies particularly france and germany reversed this cold war concern into whether foreign policy disputes can weaken or undermine strong commercial ties specific concerns that divisions over iraq could spill over into the trade arena arose in early 2003 with reports of us c onsumer boycotts of french goods and calls from some us lawmakers for trade reta liation against france and germany the spike in bilateral tensions and hard feelings however appears not to have had much impact on sales of the products such as wines perfumes handbags and cheeses most prone to being boycotted68 the data show that us imports of all four of these french products increased in abso lute terms from 2003 to 2007 moreover the french share of us total imports of th products increased for cheese and curd stayed the same for perfumes and travel goods and declined only for wines decline that started well before the iraq war69 because the dollar grew substantially

urged acceptance of international institutions to resolve disputes and mana ge global financial and economic systems since the end of the cold war centerpiece of the policy of three us administrations has been that central eu ropean governments should join nato the european union and other institutions as means to ensure stability through closer consultation joint decisionmaking and development of

the use of force french efforts to build politically strengthened eu and an effective esdp could reduce the us role and influence on the continent some critics of france have interpreted instances of
