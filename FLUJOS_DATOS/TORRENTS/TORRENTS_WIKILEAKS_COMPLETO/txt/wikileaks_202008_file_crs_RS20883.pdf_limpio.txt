boards6 under the railway labor act the formal bargaining process begins when one party serves upon the other written notice of proposed changes in agreements affecting rates of pay rules or working conditions7 such notice must be given 30 days in advance of the effective date of the proposed change and within ten days of the receipt of notice the parties must agree to time and place for the initial conference between the representatives of the interested parties8 the first conference must take place within 30 days of the notice unless the parties agree otherwise9 throughout the dispute resolution process the parties are required to maintain the status quo 10 during the course of the negotiation either party may request the services of the national mediation board nmb or the board may proffer its services in case any labor emergency is found by it to exist at any time11 the board shall use its best efforts by mediation to bring them the parties to agreement12 mediation has been described as catalytic process through which the disputants with the aid of an impartial mediator seek ways to break their bargaining impasse by identifying and isolating common ground for agreement and settlement13 the nmb has great flexibility in structuring the mediation process which has been interpreted as giving the board the authority to do anything that can fairly be said to be designed to settle dispute without strike and does not independently offend other laws14 if the nmb is not successful in bringing about an amicable settlement through mediation the board is obligated to induce the parties to submit their controversy to arbitration15 however the parties are not required to enter into arbitration16 if either party declines the board must notify both parties that its efforts at mediation have failed and for 30 days following such notice change shall be made in the rates of pay rules or working conditions or established practices in effect prior to the time the dispute arose17 if the parties accept the proffer of arbitration the agreement to arbitrate musthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20883crs3 18 45 usc 158 19 id 20 45 usc 160 21 the railway labor act 221 22 the railway

determines that the dispute threatens to substantially interrupt commerce to degree such as to deprive any section of the country of essential transportation service the board shall notify the president who in turn may appoint an emergency board to investigate and report on the dispute20 the railway labor act is silent as to how the national mediation board is to determine what constitutes substantial threat to commerce though in the past the nmb has considered the effect of strike or shutdown on the state of the economy as whole the immediate economic impact on transportation industries shippers and travelers or the effects on military logistics and transportation requirements21 the determination whether any given dispute threatens to deprive any section of the country of essential transportation service is also open to interpretation and presidential emergency boards have been created under variety of circumstances22 congress amended the railway labor act in 1981 to add special provisions for the resolution of labor disputes between publicly funded and publicly operated carrier providing commuter service and its employees23 included in these provisions are an extended mediation and negotiation timetable as well as presidential authority to appoint second emergency board if settlement is reached within 120 days of the creation of the first emergency board24 presidential emergency boards upon notification from the national mediation board that the dispute threatens to substantially interrupt commerce to degree such as to deprive any section of the country of essential transportation service the president has the discretion to appoint an emergency board to investigate and report on the dispute25 the decision whether to create an emergency board rests

chooses to exercise his discretion to appoint an emergency board the board may be composed of any number of persons the president desires provided that member of the board has pecuniary or other interest in any organization of employees or any carrier27 the presidential emergency board investigates the facts of the dispute and reports to the president within 30 days from the date of its creation28 the railway labor act does not specify what must be done during the investigation though the investigation generally consists of hearings in which the affected parties testify under oath along with briefs and submissions29 the emergency boards report usually contains recommendations for settlement of the dispute but the boards recommendations are not binding on the parties30 during the initial 30 day period and for 30 days after the report has been issued change except by agreement shall be made by the parties to the controversy in the conditions out of which the dispute arose31 during the final 30day coolingoff period the national mediation board continues to mediate the dispute if agreement is reached by the end of the 30day period the parties may resort to selfhelp congressional intervention in railway and airline labor disputes congress authority to intervene in labor disputes that threaten to interrupt interstate commerce was confirmed prior to the enactment of the railway labor act the supreme court in wilson v new et receivers of the missouri oklahoma gulf railway company decided in 1917 held that labor disputes in the railway industry are within the legislative power of congress to regulate commerce32 in wilson railway employe rs challenged an act of congress establishing an eighthour work day for employees of carriers engaged in interstate and foreign commerce and prohibiting decrease in pay for those employees33 the court found that if acts which if done would interrupt if not destroy interstate commerce may be by anticipation legislatively prevented by the same token the power to regulate may be exercised to guard against the cessation of interstate commerce threatened by failure of employers and employees to agree as to the standard of wages such standard being an essential prerequisite to the uninterrupted flow of interstate commerce34 in wilson the court also addressed the question of whether congress authority to intervene was limited by the private rights of the carriers or their employees considering that the carriers and their employees were engaged in interstate commerce the court heldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20883crs5 35 id at 353 36 id at 354 37 see also pub l 100380 aug 4 1988 38 pub l 99385 sec 1 39 pub l 102306 june 26 1992 see also pub l 100429 sept 9 1988 40 see eg pub l

rejected the carriers claim that the congressional intervention violated both the equal protection and due process clauses of the constitution36 on several occasions congress has intervened in labor disputes by enacting legislation to delay or prohibit railway and airline strikes for example on august 21 1986 congress enacted public law 99385 entitled joint resolution to provide for temporary prohibition of strikes or lockouts with respect to the maine central railroad company and portland terminal company labormanagement dispute37 this legislation extended the final 30 day coolingoff period imposed under the railway labor act by an additional 60 days to allow more time for the parties to negotiate 38 in 1992 congress enacted public law 102306 entitled joint resolution to provide for settlement of the railroad labormanagement dispute between certain railroads and certain of their employees which required amtrak and conrail to enter into arbitration with their employees in an effort to resolve various labor disputes39 additionally congress has enacted legislation requiring the parties to submit the dispute to another emergency board40 or to accept the emergency boards recommendations41 judicial challenges to this legislation have been unsuccessful with courts generally affirming congress authority to enact such legislation as an exercise of its commerce power42
