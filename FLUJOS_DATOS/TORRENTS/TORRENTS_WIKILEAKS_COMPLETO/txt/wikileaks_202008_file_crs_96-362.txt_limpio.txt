abstract this is comprehensive report on the subject of antipersonnel landmines to include background about the use and misuse of these small military weapons relevant international treaties administration policies and congressional legislation specific subjects covered include humanitarian demining activities ottawa treaty convention on conventional weapons conference on disarmament status of us moratoria on export and use and glossary of terms antitank landmines are not addressed directly the report is meant to assist those interested in legislation affecting us military forces foreign relations and humanitarian concerns as related to landmines the report will be updated occasionally as major events of interest to congress occur landmines basic facts and congressional concerns summary the decade of the 1990s saw increasing awareness of the dangers to innocent civilians posed by the indiscriminate use of antipersonnel landmines apl in many conflicttorn countries the deployment of us military forces to bosnia as part of the natoled implementation force ifor refocused the attention of the congress and citizenry on the dangers of apl prior to participation by the us military in ifor the us congress had manifested concern with the larger issue of ap landmine proliferation through hearings and legislation the history of warfare evinces three uses of ap landmines the first use is as tactical weapon employed to protect friendly forces from an enemy advance or to canalize an enemy into fields of fire ap landmines are also used in conjunction with antitank mines at mines second landmines have also been used as weapon to intimidate and control populations use of landmines as terror weapon is prevalent during irregular warfare the third consequential role of landmines in warfare is as an indefinite hazard to civilians landmines left in place after the termination of hostilities have served as hindrance to refugee resettlement development and peacekeeping operations the response of the united states congress to landmine proliferation has been multifaceted moreover to control the tactical role of landmines the us military is guided by law and doctrine advances in the technology of mine warfare such as remotely delivered or scatterable mines have been accompanied by the development of selfdestructing and selfdeactivating capabilities to curtail the indiscriminate use of mines the us congress has prohibited the export of ap mines by us companies congress has reviewed protocol ii of the convention on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons an amended protocol remains before the senate public law 104107 will ban us use of apl in 1999 the administration has asked for repeal lastly congress has appropriated funds for demining training and other assistance to nations with landmine problems research and development of countermine technology and grants for demining equipment current us policy is eventually to ban the use of all apl worldwide the administration however wants to retain the use of dumb mines in korea and the use of smart mines in potential combat situations until alternative technologies are available advocates for more rapid action support joining the ottawa treaty which was ready for signing in december 1997 immediately the administration prefers the stepbystep approach traditionally adopted by the conference on disarmament in geneva to gain more universal participation but has set goal of signing the ottawa treaty in 2006 if alternatives to apl are then available

congressional concerns introduction throughout the decade of the 1990s thousands of innocent civilians have been injured or killed by residual antipersonnel landmines apl from many local and regional conflicts around the world humanitarian organizations and concerned individuals strove to raise world consciousness of this tragedy the deployment of us military forces to bosnia as part of the natoled implementation force ifor and the prospect of subsequent casualties resulting from landmines focused the attention of congress journalists and the citizenry on the larger dangers of anti personnel ap landmines efforts to meet the concern of landmine threat to us service members included first existing us military doctrine for both the tactical employment of mines and demining operations second legislative history1 of the efforts of congress and individual members to ban the use and export of ap mines and third an amendment to protocol ii of the convention on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons ccw by the treaty signatories two efforts towards an international treaty to ban apl are ongoing in essence the problem of landmine proliferation particularly in countries such as cambodia afghanistan and angola was recognized by both the congress and the clinton administration prior to the creation of ifor moreover both the global proliferation of ap mines and congressional efforts to curtail the export and production of landmines hold significant implications for several facets of american foreign policy the landmine easily manufactured and transported serves role in the military doctrines of our own forces and those of allies and potential enemies and impedes the work of humanitarian relief workers and peace keepers thus the subject of landmine proliferation is and in all likelihood will remain recurring theme before the congress the purpose of this report is to review the basic definitions issues past legislation and administration policies concerning antipersonnel landmines as context for understanding ongoing policy debates 1 see figure 1 crs2 the role of landmines the current debate issues throughout the history of warfare the role of the landmine as weapon has been disparate and manifold as warfare and science have evolved so too have the design technology and function of the landmine much of the current debate within the congress and between nations regarding ap landmine design and proliferation centers around question of political purpose how for what and by whom are ap landmines to be used three distinct present and potentially future functions for ap landmines are discernible from witness testimony delivered during congressional hearings existing legislation and the various negotiating positions assumed by the signatories to protocol ii of the ccw during series of review conferences the first role is as traditional weapon of warfare employed to canalize the advancing forces of an enemy either armor dismounted or mechanized infantry into avenues of approach that are covered by direct and indirect fire weapons this traditional or tactical role of the ap landmine has been expanded through advances in technology such as the family of scatterable mines fascam moreover landmines used in the first role serve as means to channel enemy forces into terrain designated as preplanned target where the preponderance of fire power and advanced weapons can be brought to bear or as weapon to erode the advancing forces of an enemy the second role is as weapon of warfare directed less toward specific tactical objectives and more toward broad political objectives such as denying civilian populations access to arable land homes and commerce for many forces that employ ap landmines in the second role as weapon against civilian populations ap mines are primary source of their firepower landmines emplaced for these two purposes when left in place after the termination of hostilities and unmarked create tertiary consequential role indefinite hazard to civilians the current debate concerning landmine proliferation represents an effort to reconcile the traditional role of the landmine with the objective of limiting or ending the second role and abolishing the third in the following section this report will briefly review the role of landmines in national defense crs3 figure 1 legislative actions public law 100461 this appropriation provided 5000000 to aid victims of war for the provision of prostheses for civilians injured in civil strife and warfare as part of the foreign operations appropriation this law provides humanitarian and development funds public law 102484 section 1365 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1993 established unilateral moratorium on exports of ap landmines by the us for period of one year in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1994 public law 103160 the moratorium was extended for three years public law 104107 section 580 established one year ban on the use of ap mines by us personnel three years from the date of enactment signed february 12 1996 section 558 of this law provides that demining equipment used for humanitarian purpose may be disposed of on grant basis to foreign countries public law 104106 as form of humanitarian assistance the department of defense oversees demining training and mine awareness programs section 1313 of this law ensures that us military personnel serving as instructors are prohibited from demining activities public law 103160 provided 10000000 for humanitarian demining activities public law 103139 provided 10000000 to support the clearing of mines for humanitarian purposes as did public law 103 335 public law 10461 provided 20000000 for training and activities related to the clearing of mines for humanitarian purposes the role of landmines in national defense mine warfare as practiced by the romans consisted of burrowing beneath the fortifications of an enemy and thereby causing resultant collapse of their defenses2 with the advent of gunpowder mine warfare came to include burrowing beneath an enemy position and emplacing explosives for later detonation3 2 brodie bernard and fawn m from crossbow to hbomb bloomington indiana university press 1973 p 26 3 dupuy r ernest and trevor n military heritage of america new york mcgrawhill book company inc 1956 p 294297 crs4 the first world war saw the introduction of tanks and antitank at mines4 the introduction of at mines often improvised from trenchmortar ammunition provoked the development of mine breaching techniques5 in experiments conducted in 1918 tanks were fitted with rollers to detonate mines in their path6 the development of at mines proceeded into the 1920s and as they were relatively easy to remove in their early stage of development provoked the introduction of anti personnel mines7 mixing at and ap in minefield complicated manual removal of at mines recognition by the us military of the importance of mine warfare grew as the course of the second world war unfolded the great tank battles of north africa became the proving ground for the allied employment of mines and for the general principles of mine warfare the 1994 department of state report for the congress hidden killers the global landmine crisis which contains an excellent synopsis of the evolution of mine warfare observes that for the allies north africa was the crucible in which the principles and techniques of largescale mine warfare in mobile mechanized operations were tested and refined americans particularly took note of the significance of mine warfare revitalizing production and training programs that had suffered from neglect allied and axis armies whose strengths were insufficient in north africa used mines to compensate for shortages of artillery armor and infantry neither side believed though that the value of mines extended beyond temporary tactical advantage to strategic import8 perhaps the mine did not extend beyond strategic import although general mcnair touring north africa following the allied victory of 1943 concluded that the land mine was almost new arm of warfare9 several important developments in the tactics and technology of mine warfare grew from the second world war first both the germans and the americans experimented with nonmetallic mines the us requirement for such mine lessened as the war proceeded and the allied strategy turned to the offensive an army ground forces project which sought to develop nonmetallic ap mine was canceled in the summer of 194410 second the at mine came to be viewed by the allies and the axis as cost effective expedient weapon against advancing armor 4 brodie p197 and

381 10 ibid p 384 crs5 although mine technology has advanced further since the second world war the defensive role of mine warfare in the us military has remained constant us army field manual 2032 minecountermine operations lists the uses of minefields as to first produce specific effect on enemy maneuver thereby creating vulnerability that can be exploited by friendly forces second to cause the enemy to piecemeal his forces third interfere with enemy command and control fourth inflict damage to enemy personnel and equipment and last protect friendly forces from enemy maneuver11 throughout the cold war the us military continued to use landmines for the purposes described above during the korean war both the united nations command and the north koreans employed landmines to stifle enemy movement and protect friendly forces two combat operations that were indicative of american encounters with enemy landmines were the fight for yondungpo by us marines subsequent to the amphibious landing at inchon and the us army battle for bloody ridge12 two relevant aspects of mine warfare that inform the current debate were present during the korean war first the danger of trafficking minefield emplaced by friendly troops which had been poorly marked second the conversion of us mines to enemy booby traps13 as one battalion report described enemy defenses large number of mines and booby traps were discovered within the battalion sector most of these being us types which were placed by rok troops with only few enemy mines scattered in the central portion of the sector14 the mine warfare employed in the korean war nevertheless evinced remarkable continuity with that of the second world war the conduct of mine warfare in the vietnam war was marked by both continuity and change during the vietnam war the us military employed mines for the purposes described in fm 2032 minecountermine operations to reinforce perimeter security of defensive positions airfields fire bases and the local population the us also developed several mines that were delivered by air and were usually associated with some sort of cluster bomb unit cbu15 the development of

enhanced the traditional role of mines16 the advent of fascam and the continued improvement of this technology during the late 1980s and early parts of this decade have provided to us commanders the ability to emplace minefield during the course of attack or as an antitank weapon deployed at the range of indirect fire weapons or aircraft changes in mine warfare evolving from the vietnam war will be discussed below in the section concerned with the second role of landmines as weapon directed toward the wider political purpose of denying populations access to land water and commerce during the vietnam war mines were regularly used by the viet cong and peoples army of vietnam in role described by hidden killers as instruments of terror to intimidate the local population17 distinctions between combatants noncombatants counter insurgency and civil war hold profound implications for the current debate concerning landmines particularly in consideration of the latest review conference amendment of protocol ii of the ccw and the efforts of congress to curtail the use of ap landmines these matters shall also be addressed in the section below that discusses the ccw prior to concluding this review of the role of land mines in national defense there remains final aspect of current defense policy to be considered the disintegration of the soviet union and the dissolution of the warsaw pact provoked reduction in us military forces stationed overseas in europe and asia as secretary of the army togo west testified before congress the us army longer concerned with soviet attack through the fulda gap is becoming power projection force based largely in the continental united states18 as each of the armed services attempts to reconcile the requirement of the clinton administrations defense policy to be prepared to fight and win two major regional conflicts nearly simultaneously with diminishing resources two clear requirements of power projection must be balanced speed of deployment which mitigates against heavy forces and lethality of the force which demands heavier weapons which are less mobile19 to compensate for the reduced us military presence overseas the services particularly the army have placed greater reliance upon prepositioned weapons and equipment20 these measures have improved the ability of us forces to 16 hidden killers p 7 17 ibid p 7 18 us

an unforeseen exigency in region without prepositioned stores complicates the trade off between speed of deployment and lethality the regional warfighting commanders in chief have contingency plans which would draw upon amphibious ready groups the xviii airborne corps and mix of other forces task organized to arrive rapidly to given theater the survivability of such force in the face of an armored attack was brought into question following the initial deployment of the 82nd airborne division and the 7th marine expeditionary brigade to saudi arabia in 1990 in the initial stages of desert shield21 one proposal to increase the 82nd airborne divisions antiarmor capability was the armored gun system ags the ags was designed to replace the antiarmor capability of the m551 sheridan light tank that could be inserted by parachute but sheridans service life has ended army commanders are considering antiarmor systems such as the javelin manportable at missile and enhanced fiber optic guided missilesefogm in lieu of the canceled ags of which only javelin is immediately available for deployment22 one source of firepower the m198 howitzer is capable of firing the area denial artillery munition adam which is an anti personnel mine system delivered in cargo type projectiles23 marine expeditionary units deploy with 155mm howitzers and tanks light army forces do not thus fascam technology provides limited source of protection and lethality to early entry forces24 second this limited antiarmor capability may suggest that expeditionary and airborne forces should retain the ability to emplace ap and at mines by hand for force protection moreover while fascam as an example of mine warfare may seem problematic as an indefinite hazard to civilians scatterable mines

their battery runs down between 30 to 60 days crs8 forces are typically selfdestructing and selfdeactivating the army field manual that prescribes the emplacement of scatterable mine field emphasizes that the characteristics of fascam require impeccable communication and coordination to ensure friendly units know where mines are located when they will be effective and when they will selfdestruct25 the fact that mine warfare remains twoedged sword requiring skill and care on the part of soldiers was highlighted in 1997 us army advanced warfighting exercise at fort irwin ca some 45 simulated casualties were ascribed to friendly mines 23 in one incident when unit inadvertently drove across volcano minefield recently dropped by friendly aircraft26 the second role landmines against noncombatants the second role of the landmine in warfare intimidation of the local populace or denying to them the means of commerce directly conflicts with the laws of war despite whether one views the vietnam war as an example of national liberation movement communist insurgency civil war or combination of these the conduct of the war provided examples of mines used in this second role27 several features of the vietnam war are important in the evolution of mine warfare first the mobility provided to us forces by the helicopter greatly nullified the concepts of the front this helped to somewhat diminish the importance of landmines in the tactical sense second as the viet cong and north vietnamese sought to avoid major conventional confrontation and preferred to rely on surprise attack nearly all territory was thus battlefield third due to the nature of an insurgency distinctions between combatants and noncombatants were eroded as robert leckie described the problem 12 year old girl leaning bicycle up against wall might be planting vehicle of death whose tubular frame was packed with explosive on patrol americans encountered booby traps set along trails on farmyard gates in chicken coops and fishing nets or the very doors of schoolhouses mines pressure trip or electronically detonated were everywhere28 strikingly the conduct of irregular warfare was bound to conflict with the jus in bello understood by the west according to andreopoulos the main vehicle of irregular warfare is the civilian soldier notion that encapsulates not only the 25 see minecountermine

single identity29 during 1961 in reaction to the growing attention given to unconventional guerilla or counterinsurgent warfare john shy and peter paret published small book guerrillas in the 1960s the authors observations have only grown more salient in light of the american experience in vietnam the soviet experience in afghanistan the insurgency of the khmer rouge in cambodia and several other conflicts in which the landmine has been used indiscriminately against the civilian population the authors observed that forces engage in guerilla war in pursuit of political objective not as preferred alternative to open battle but as matter of necessity in describing the historical accounts of the civil war confederate leader john mosby and irregular warfare as he practiced it in northern virginia paret and shy are critical of historians for failing to consider the consequences of guerilla warfare one doubts mosbys skill in making union operations in this area very difficult but in 1864 sheridan devastated the shenandoah valley and systematically and successfully destroyed the guerrillas base sheridans counter strategy was ruthless and effective and it demonstrates some of the special costs of resorting to guerilla warfare30 in irregular conflict conventional forces are hard pressed to separate the civilian from the soldier insurgents on the other hand find security in anonymity coercion and control of the population is goal of both sides moreover as guerrillas or insurgents turn to irregular warfare out of necessity they are also likely to disdain much of the law that guides conventional conflict one critical element of the second role of mine warfare has emerged during and since the vietnam war landmines have been used indiscriminately against civilians the indiscriminate use of landmines reflects the fact that in irregular warfare the distinction between combatants and noncombatants is blurred and at times non existent or to borrow andreopoulos phrase guerilla tactics render one of the most fundamental principles of the laws of war untenable namely the distinction between combatants and noncombatants31 during the vietnam war the viet cong and the north vietnamese were able to pursue the twin objectives of intimidating the local population and killing americans through placing landmines on roads and trails the vcpavn reliance 29

gravity to these terms and merely to make distinctions between conventional conflict and irregular warfare crs10 on mine warfare was aided by their ability to appropriate mines emplaced for tactical purposes by us forces32 the soviet union also employed mines in this second role during the invasion of afghanistan one account of the soviet occupation describes how soviet helicopters and planes strewed the provinces bordering pakistan with thousands of butterfly mines colored green for vegetated areas beige for deserts to terrorize the local population antipersonnel mines were placed along fields and mountain passes33 the us committee for refugees in 1995 report estimated that total of 10 to 15 million landmines were planted in angola belts of landmines were emplaced to ring cities deny civilians access to roads and despoil agricultural lands the us committee for refugees report states that among the victims of landmines have been women and children who were killed or crippled while searching for food or firewood the widespread use of landmines as weapons used to deny irregular forces access to territory serves the second role of denying this same land to civilians the central point that irregular warfare is undertaken out of necessity rather than choice is essential for understanding the second role of mine warfare mines are political and military weapon of choice because they are plentiful inexpensive and effective as such they are likely to be employed irrespective of any restrictions that exist within the law of war two important approaches now exist for preventing mines produced for the first role in warfare from being used for the second role the technological approach wherein mines designed for tactical purposes would selfdestruct or eventually self inactivate and the legal approach wherein the production export and use of ap mines would be curtailed by treaty both of these approaches will be discussed below following brief review of the third role of landmines mines left in place at termination of hostilities that then become an indefinite hazard to civilians the consequential role landmines as indefinite hazards when employed for tactical purposes and left in place unmarked minefields can pose an indefinite risk to civilians living working or traveling in once contested lands of even greater risk to civilians are mines emplaced to separate peoples or irregular forces from roads wells or arable land this third consequential role of landmines as an indefinite threat to civilians complicates the processes which follow the termination of hostilities resettlement of refugees peacekeeping 32 hidden killers p 67 33 girardet edward afghanistan the soviet war new york st martins press 1985 p 213 crs11 operations humanitarian delivery of food and medical supplies and development of economic infrastructure the example of cambodia as nation stymied by the legacy of landmines is evident in report of the general accounting office cambodia limited progress on free elections human rights and mine clearing according to the gao report prior to 1970 cambodia stood as net exporter of food the provinces of battambang and svey rieng were the most productive areas after years of warfare cambodia is now an importer of food and battambang and svey rieng are largely unusable due to landmines moreover infrastructure development such as the repair of bridges and roads is impossible until surrounding areas are cleared of mines34 second problem created by landmines is the slowed pace of refugee resettlement as one example hidden killers considers mozambique to be country where fear of landmines has been cited as significant cause of the slow pace of repatriation of refugees35 the state department report also estimates that within angola mozambique somalia afghanistan and cambodia remain approximately 30 million mines which inhibit and endanger the return and reintegration of some 6 million refugees and 55 million internally displaced persons36 further complicating the problems associated with repatriating refugees are the high medical costs of treating landmine victims37 the medical economic and social effects of mines left in place after the cessation of hostilities are both astounding and well documented the international committee of the red cross human rights watch the international rescue committee and the united nations development program have all published reports concerning the human costs associated with the third role of landmines moreover congress has held hearings on both the global landmine crisis and developments in countermine technology38 unsurprisingly institution or nation advocates the third role of landmines as it exists only as derivative of the first and second roles this fact of course does nothing to diminish the manifold problems resulting from the third role of landmines however apart from the remedial efforts of demining programs any attempt to abolish the third role of landmines must address the tactical and indiscriminate use of these weapons demining efforts confront the staggering fact 34 general accounting office cambodia limited progress on free elections

and 300 to 1000 per mine to clear including logistics and support expenses39 the current debate concerning landmines centers upon the seemingly contradictory roles described above several possible avenues exist for reconciling these roles among these potential solutions are military doctrine international law and treaty national law and moratoria the technology of ap mines and demining programs each of these possible means of addressing the contradictory roles of the landmine shall be discussed below addressing the roles of landmines military doctrine the use of ap mines by the us military as prescribed by doctrine exemplifies the first or tactical role of landmines in warfare in this regard according to field manual 2032 minecountermine operations minefields are used to produce specific effect on enemy maneuver thereby creating vulnerability that can be exploited by friendly forces second cause the enemy to piecemeal his forces third interfere with enemy command and control fourthinflict damage to enemy personnel and equipment and fifth protect friendly forces from enemy maneuver us military requirements for minefields comply with the geneva convention the ccw and nato international standardization agreements minefields are to be marked with signs 10 to 50 meters apart depending on the terrain and documented in accordance with standardized format40 the advent of scatterable mine technology added to the capability of us commanders to expeditiously deploy minefield before advancing enemy forces such capability does not allow however for the precise accounting of the location of each mine deployed the locations of scatterable minefields once emplaced are recorded and disseminated to friendly units all us scatterable mines are designed to selfdestruct or selfdeactivate ie battery within the mine exhausts itself rendering the mine inert the location of remotely delivered fascam minefields are calculated and marked by either estimating the area around aimpoints or by plotting the respective corner points of minefield thus us military doctrine attempts to fulfill the first role of mine warfare through both doctrine and technology us military doctrine does not provide for or allow the indiscriminate use of landmines against noncombatants last us military doctrine attempts to end the third role of mine warfare by using mines with short and finite lifespans 39 subcommittee on foreign operations senate appropriations committee hearing the global landmine crisis p 99 137 40 fm2032 minecountermine operations p 21 241 crs13 criticism of military doctrine within the current debate concerning the role of landmines several critics have argued that the tactical use of landmines by the us military undermines the larger foreign policy goal of abolishing the third role of landmines second criticism leveled against military doctrine is that landmines do not provide any appreciable value to battlefield commanders are ap landmines effective in tactical role critics of the tactical role of landmines frequently observe that landmines produce friendly and enemy casualties alike second critics argue that once deployed fascam minefields are difficult to mark and therefore contribute to fratricide and the indiscriminate killing of civilians third critics have also contended that until the design of scatterable mines achieve complete reliability in the capacity to selfdestruct or selfdeactivate they should not be used41 mine warfare is an integral part of us military doctrine and has become more important as army force structure becomes smaller in recent battle lab simulations and exercises at the national training center the army found that friendly casualties were lower and enemy casualties were higher by factor of two when advanced landmines were used rather than not used42 second ap mines were developed to prevent enemy forces from breaching or tampering with antitank minefields this presents stark difference with mines emplaced around village to deny the local populace food and water ground combat is intrinsically dangerous disorderly and confusing us military doctrine places strict guidelines on the employment of mines by us forces these restrictions were designed to minimize the loss of american life and the occurrence of fratricide when used in accordance with planning guidelines which seek to avoid civilian casualties scatterable mines whether dropped by aircraft or emplaced from an artillery projectile pose comparatively little risk to civilians arguably much less than from concentrated gunfire the common alternative to mines to impose rate of reliability of 100 percent on these weapons as some critics have suggested suggests that foreign policy goal of abolishing landmines

selfdeactivating battery expires features of us scatterable mines are considered the reliability rate exceeds 999 that scatterable mine will cease to be hazard to civilian population over given

practice43 proponents of ban on landmines early noted that many combat veterans were either ambivalent or skeptical about the military utility of the weapon many had been frustrated by the difficulties of countering enemy use of such weapons and the gruesome casualties they may have witnessed others may have suffered from accidental encounters with friendly minefields many found that mines seemed to be net benefit to the less technologically advanced foes of the united states on april 3 1996 group of fifteen retired generals and admirals wrote letter to president clinton strongly urging him to renounce mines44 the signers included army general h norman schwarzkopf of persian gulf war fame and air force general david jones former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff most early press treatment of the issue seemed to favor proponents of ban an exception was retired marine corps officer lieutenant general bernard trainor who noted that land mines had saved his life in korea and took the position that banning them could put us troops in danger in the future45 the pentagon was late in marshalling support against total ban on july 10 1997 the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff all service chiefs and all commanders of unified and specified commands signed letter to the chairman of the senate armed services committee opposing bill that would unilaterally ban all use of apl by us forces46 it made case for retaining smart mines until all nations agreed on total ban since such weapon was not humanitarian threat and was combat multiplier for downsized us land forces on september 11 1997 twentyfour retired us generals and admirals wrote president clinton to urge him not to sign the ottawa treaty that would ban all use of apl47 in the debate over total immediate ban on apl studies have been used by advocates on both sides supporters of the ottawa treaty argued against the us position that apl should remain deployed against the threat of an invasion by north korea claiming that apl would be marginal factor in determining the outcome48 some in congress have been concerned about the wisdom of legislation imposing moratoria on us use of apl the defense

accomplishment it cited potential increases in casualties of from 15 to 35 percent depending on theaters involved49 addressing the roles of landmines international treaties the international community has and is addressing the problem of ap landmines in several ways for some time efforts to restrict landmine use in order to protect innocent civilians were embodied in the convention on conventional weapons ccw treaty this treaty was however ignored by many combatants and judged inadequate by most observers in light of continuing and appalling innocent casualties in many regions of the world recently efforts to improve that treaty have been overshadowed by initiatives to achieve universal ban on ap landmines the canadian government sponsored the ottawa treaty presented for signing by interested parties in december 1997 and the united nations is sponsoring landmine ban negotiations under the conference on disarmament framework in geneva convention on conventional weapons an early effort of the international community to reconcile the divergent roles of landmines is represented by the convention on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effectsccw specifically embodied in the protocol on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of mines boobytraps and other devices protocol ii this convention was concluded at geneva on october 10 1980 was signed by the united states on april 8 1982 entered into force on december 2 1983 and was approved by the senate on march 24 1995 in existing form ccw provisions greatly resemble guidelines and restrictions resident in us military doctrine original restrictions within protocol ii were article 1 limits the protocol to landmines as opposed to antiship mines 49 colin clark defense week jcs casualties could rise by third without mines september 15 1997 p 2 crs16 article 2 sets forth other definitions such as mine50 booby trap and civilian objects article 3 restates existing international law regarding the use of landmines and prohibits the use of weapons directed against the civilian population article 4 prohibits the use of booby traps against civilians article 5 restricts the use of remotely delivered or scatterable mines the article imposes restrictions on use and design of fascam minefields must be recorded or be equipped with either automatically selfdestructing or selfdetonating mechanisms mines may also be destroyed through command detonation to quote the senate foreign relations committee report on the ccw the restrictions contained in article 5 do not affect the operations of the us military since all us remotely delivered mines are equipped with selfdestruct devices article 6 consistent with us military doctrine and practice restricts the use of boobytraps attached to food drink toys and casualties article 7 directs the recording of all preplanned minefields and contains requirements to protect civilians article 8 directs the parties to conflict to remove render harmless and transmit information concerning minefields to any united nations peacekeeping force article 9 directs former belligerents to endeavor to reach agreement to demining operations the ccw also contains technical annex which contains guidelines for marking minefields51 formal review conference of the ccw conducted by states parties to the convention met in several sessions from september 1995 through may 3 1996 to consider technical cooperation and implementation mechanisms the purpose of the review conference was to strengthen ccw restrictions against inhumane use of landmines particularly against noncombatants consensus was difficult the issue of selfdestructing mines was contentious in that many nations do not currently produce these weapons nations that possess existing stockpiles of scatterable mines that do not meet ccw standards will incur considerable expense in converting to 50 the ccw defines mine as any munition placed under on or near the ground or other surface area and designed to detonate or explode by the presence proximity or contact of person or vehicle and remotely delivered vehicle means any mine so defined delivered by artillery rocket mortar or similar means or dropped by aircraft see document aconf 9515 of october 27 1980 annex i senate treaty

to an amended protocol and the president transmitted it to the senate on january 7 199753 major objectives achieved by the amendment are 1 scope expanded to include internal armed conflicts 2 all remotely delivered ap mines must include selfdestruct devices and backup self deactivation features smart mines 3 requires all nonremotely delivered ap mines without selfdestruct features dumb mines to be used only within controlled marked and monitored minefields 4 all ap mines must be detectable using commonly available technology 5 parties laying mines assume responsibility for them to ensure against irresponsible and indiscriminate use and 6 more effective compliance so that restrictions are actually observed the administration sees this amendment as step forward in dealing with apl problems and precursor to its goal of an eventual total international ban of such weapons the senate foreign relations committee endorsed ratification on july 23 1998 by vote of 134 opponents were concerned that the resolution might to some degree compromise us signing of the ottawa treaty it addressed concerns over administration landmine policies through conditions placed in its recommended advice on ratification such issues included assurance that the pursuit deterrent munition used to help special operations forces escape dangerous situations is not restricted by the protocol that proposed export moratoria in other treaties are not more restrictive than the protocol and that the president will not facto implement the ottawa treaty without advice and consent to ratification by the senate the ottawa treaty beginning in 1991 number of nongovernmental organizations concerned with the humanitarian toll of casualties mounted campaign to eliminate ap landmines as weapon category in 1996 canada took the initiative to organize coalition of likeminded countries international organizations and non governmental organizations in fasttrack diplomatic process to complete treaty for signature in december 1997 the effort gained momentum and 89 nations agreed to sign the resulting treaty on december 2 1997 in ottawa some 125 nations and the holy see have signed to date the rapid

stockpiling production and transfer of antipersonnel mines and on their destruction the treaty is short and to the point admits for exceptions and basically relies upon voluntary compliance it will enter into force after 40 nations have deposited their ratification instruments although the united states supported the ottawa fasttrack effort by participating in its negotiation the administration could not achieve accommodation to its concerns and decided not to sign the treaty president clintons explanation was there is line that i simply cannot cross and that line is the safety and security of our men and women in uniform55 general impediment to treaty effectiveness would be the many nations not participating to include major users of land mines such as china india and russia other nations that perceive serious security concerns and consequent utility for landmines include cuba egypt finland iran israel kuwait north korea vietnam and south korea specific us concerns were that the treaty would not allow special case for use of apl along the border with north korea until suitable substitute could be devised and that smart apl could not continue to be mixed into smart antitank minefields to protect those temporary barriers from dismounted enemy for those reasons the presidents obligations to provide security to us and allied troops took precedence over his desire to sign immediately the ottawa treaty he has however established goal to sign the ottawa treaty by the year 2006 provided the pentagon can develop suitable alternatives to apl by then56 conference on disarmament landmine agenda the clinton administrations preferred vehicle for pursuing an international ban on ap landmines is the standing conference on disarmament cd in geneva switzerland an independent deliberative body sponsored by the united nations it has produced such treaties as the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt and the chemical weapons convention cwc on november 4 1996 ambassador madeleine albright introduced resolution on landmines to the general assembly cosponsored by the united states and 84 other nations the resolution passed 1850 with 10 abstentions and placed the issue of landmines on the cd agenda abstaining nations reserving their right to use landmines in selfdefense were belarus china cuba north korea israel pakistan south korea russia syria and turkey57 among other things the resolution urges states to pursue vigorously an effective legallybinding international agreement to ban the use stockpiling production and transfer of antipersonnel

control issues but some attention was given to the landmine issue special coordinator on antipersonnel landmines was appointed john campbell of australia he believed that most cd members would support or not oppose treaty work the approach would be stepbystep probably beginning with elimination of apl exports imports and transfers many nations in the cd supported reappointment of the special coordinator for the 1998 session to include the nations of belarus russia and turkey who had originally voted against placing landmines on the cd agenda the united states continued to push for pursuit of cd landmine treaty some ottawa signatories support cd action as complementary and way to include reluctant nations others fear dilution of effort and may prefer greater emphasis on enforcing ccw protocols since the cd proceeds by consensus and includes nations that were opposed to the ottawa fast track process formulation of viable treaty may take long time critiques of international treaties the ccw is the most longstanding international attempt to reconcile the divergent roles of landmines notably the ccw greatly resembles us military doctrine in that mines used responsibly can serve limited tactical role on the battlefield without unduly endangering civilians second the ccw attempts to restrict the use of scatterable or remotely delivered mines some deficiencies in the ccw as noted by the senate foreign relations committee report and the clinton administration were addressed by amendment the ccw must deal with civil war if it is to include the second role of landmines and the treaty requires some form of verification mechanism strong verification measures which would include inspections were opposed by china pakistan cuba and india59 the ccw continues to be criticized by nongovernment organizations such as the international committee of the red cross that believe the only measure that will abolish the third role of landmines is total ban on landmine production and use60 this position rests upon the assumption that the first and third roles of landmines are indivisible according to this view the humanitarian interest of ending the third role of landmines enjoys precedent over any tactical advantage the us military may gain from landmines moreover this position depends upon the notion that complete and total ban will somehow end the second role of mine warfare which in itself was inherently unlawful from inception as robert w tucker observed any weapon may be put to unlawful use for example it would be unlawful to use an otherwise legal weapon against the civilian population of an enemy state or as means of inflicting unnecessary suffering or destruction61 58 united nations general assembly an international agreement to ban antipersonnel

trooboff in law and responsibility in continued crs20 last this position assumes that total ban will prevent nations from illicitly producing exporting and using ap landmines or create an international norm against such behavior this last assumption exists despite the growing record of illegal arms and technology transfers even of weapons of mass destruction by and between several nations in violation of existing arms control treaties and regimes62 there is question however that the idea of banning ap landmines from the worlds military arsenals is in ascendancy such longterm goal is stated us policy many nations will voluntarily do so under the ottawa treaty an effort has begun in the conference on disarmament to craft treaty that all nations could embrace addressing the roles of landmines legislative actions the breadth of difficulties caused by global landmine proliferation was early acknowledged by congress several legislative initiatives have supported if not led efforts to solve the problem individual members such as senator patrick leahy and congressman lane evans have gained national and international recognition for their efforts the subcommittee on foreign operations of the senate appropriations committee conducted special hearing during may 1994 which addressed the global landmine crisis ratification of the ccw was approved by the senate in march 1995 more recently the house national security committee military procurement and military research and development subcommittees held hearing which considered the technological response to the landmine threat in bosnia the subject matter of these hearings ranged from demining technology the tactical role of landmines protection of noncombatants and the economic effects of landmine proliferation in response to the global landmine crisis congress has debated and passed varied legislative proposals each of which addresses the problem of landmine proliferation number of these proposals such as bills that appropriate money for demining training attempt to alleviate single role of landmines in warfare in the case of demining operations the intent is to protect civilians from the aftereffects of armed conflict on the other hand some legislative proposals such as the ban against landmine use by the us military public law 104107 seek larger end 61 continued warfare chapel

legislation is to begin process whose ultimate goal is to make the tactical use of landmines war crime63 listed below is brief summary of the significant legislation drafted with the intent of influencing the role of landmines in warfare public law 100461 foreign operations export financing and related programs appropriations act 1989 this appropriation provided 5000000 to aid the victims of war the appropriation directed that funds be used for the provision of prostheses for civilians who have been injured as result of civil strife and warfare as facet of development efforts and humanitarian assistance foreign aid granted to war victims helps to reduce the medical costs incurred by developing countries many of the victims of landmines employed in the second role of mine warfare were noncombatants this appropriation also complements the work of nongovernmental organizations such as the international committee of the red cross that have labored to mitigate the effects of civil wars as j brian atwood administrator of the united states agency for international development testified aid regards the war victims fund as an investment in sustainable development64 public law 102484 22 usc 2778 section 1365 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1993 this law established unilateral moratorium on us exports of ap landmines for period of one year in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1994 public law 103160 the moratorium was extended for three years during the ten years prior to the passage of the ban on exports the us department of state had approved ten licenses for the commercial export of ap landmines valued at 980000 forecast international predicts that any efforts by the us and some european nations to limit the exports of ap mines will mean that the unmet demand will be taken up by the firms in the international sector forecast international further concluded that over the next ten years the peoples republic of china should remain the largest producer of landmines of all types in the international sector65 effects of the export moratorium have not altered the tactical role of landmines nor has the export moratorium altered the use of landmines in the second and third roles of mine warfare however the proponents of the export moratorium claim that this law provides the us basis for international leadership on the issue of landmine proliferation second proponents of the moratorium believe that this law is only the first step in process that will conclude in an international ban on landmine use 63 see remarks of senator patrick leahy dvt in congressional record january 26 1996 104th congress second session vol 142 11 s425 64 remarks of j brian atwood before the senate foreign

law 104107 sec 580 the foreign operations export financing and related programs appropriations act 1996 was signed february 12 1996 this law established one year ban on the use of ap mines by us personnel three years from the date of enactment the law allows use of command detonated claymore mines and use of ap mines along internationally recognized national borders or in demilitarized zones the moratorium places further restrictions on the use of mines along demilitarized zone dmz such as marking and monitoring to protect civilians as the law did not limit the use of landmines until passage of three years the actual effects of the legislation have yet to be determined the law does ban the use of fascam and thereby must result in change in the first role of mines for the us military three of the militarys principal scatterable mine systems are manufactured with mix of ap and at mines in each system therefore the whole scatterable mine dispensing system cannot be used resulting in loss of twothirds of the militarys scatterable antitank capability to include all of its aircraft delivery systems66 thus according to the law us military doctrine will have to be altered barring change in the legislation for example us soldiers and marines will be denied the ability to lay an ap minefield as part of either planned defense or retrograde operation special forces members are concerned that they may lose their pursuit denial munitions form of mine they employ when being chased67 in 1997 concern over this law was however registered by the house national security committee in the national defense authorization act for fy1998 hr 1119 section 1055 the secretary of defense would be required to certify that any implementation of ban on use of apl would not adversely impact us military combat capabilities in may 1998 secretary cohen and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff shelton sent letter to the senate armed services committee asking for relief from the moratorium due to start on february 12 1999 the problem is technological alternatives to apl are likely to be fielded before 2003 the only alternatives immediately available are more troops and conventional weapons in the case of korea for example they estimated that 17000 additional troops would be required68 the 1996 legislation will have effect on the second and third role of mines in war as existing us military doctrine and law prohibits indiscriminate use of mine warfare against civilians section 558 of this law provides that demining equipment used for humanitarian purpose may be disposed of on grant basis to foreign countries public law 104106 national defense authorization act for 1996 signed february 10 1996 as form of humanitarian assistance the department of defense

data congress has also appropriated money to operational commanders in chief for demining efforts69 over the last several years congress has expressed sustained commitment to demining as an aspect of humanitarian assistance public law 103160 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1994 provided 10000000 for activities to support the clearing of landmines for humanitarian purposes public law 103139 the department of defense appropriations act 1994 signed november 11 1993 provided 10000000 to support the clearing of landmines for humanitarian purposes as did public law 103335 the dod appropriations act 1995 public law 10461 the dod appropriations act 1996 provided 20000000 for training and activities related to the clearing of mines for humanitarian purposes the 105th congress continued to support demining efforts in the defense authorization bill for fy1998 for example the sasc recommended adding 66 million to the administration request for 193 million for research on countermine technologies particularly for field testing of vehicular mounted detection equipment defense appropriations for fy1998 hr 2266 included 47130000 for overseas humanitarian disaster and civic aid conferees specifically directed that acrosstheboard reduction would be applied to demining efforts the major landmine legislation before the 105th congress is the landmine elimination act of 1997 this bill would prevent the us government from expending or obligating any funds for new deployments of apl beginning january 1 2000 this act would codify the administrations general moratorium on use already in effect but with fewer exceptions it would be similar to enforcing the ottawa treaty except that it does allow waiver for use in korea in the senate s896 has been referred to the armed services committee and in the house hr 2459 has been referred to the national security and international relations committees evident from the legislation described above is an acute awareness within congress of the problem of landmine proliferation also evident is an understanding of the three roles of landmines for example the moratorium on the use of ap landmines described above seeks to ban the tactical use of these weapons by the us military with exceptions for the claymore70 and in demilitarized zones the unilateral export moratorium seeks to prevent the second role of landmines by 69 see the testimony of colonel richard h johnson us army retired before the senate committee on appropriations the global landmine crisis may 13 1994 p 112 70 see glossary crs24 removing ap mines from the international arms market congress has also expressed sustained support for demining programs in an effort to combat the third role of mine warfare additionally congress has inserted into several pieces of legislation expressions of support for the ccw finally congress has expressed an interest in one other approach to reconciling the roles of landmines in warfare through technology the role of technology is discussed below in separate section addressing the roles of landmines administration policy banning antipersonnel landmines at press conference on may 16 1996 president clinton announced new policy to ban antipersonnel landmines and to lead global effort to eliminate these terrible weapons and to stop the enormous loss of human life71 the policy was comprehensive and consisted of several types of unilateral initiatives stated as four steps first us forces would immediately discontinue use of all dumb apl and destroy existing stockpiles of some 4000000 devices by 1999 exceptions would be those mines retained for countermine training and those used along the border between north and south korea until the threat abates or alternatives to apl are available smart mines which pose residual threat to civilians could continue to be used in combat when necessary until such time as they might be banned by international treaty second the united states would propose resolution at the united nations general assembly urging support for worldwide ban on landmines this was done and details are described in the international treaties section above consultations with canada on the ottawa initiative were affirmed under press questioning third the department of defense was directed to begin research and development on alternative technologies that would not pose new dangers to civilians and would end reliance on apl fourth dod would expand its efforts to develop better mine detection and clearing technology that could be used by all nations afflicted with mines the ongoing programs for training and assisting other nations in demining efforts would be strengthened 71 federal document clearing house inc transcript president clinton holds news briefing to discuss new policy on the use of landmines may 16 1996 crs25 after two years events in the international arena and congress had put pressure on the administration to increase efforts to ban landmines at the same time various military voices raised the case for caution in forfeiting system still uniquely useful for protecting american troops on september 17 1997 when explaining his reasons for not signing the ottawa treaty president clinton established specific goals for the process of eliminating apl dod must develop alternatives so that use of apl even selfdestructing systems would end in 2003 for korea the deadline was extended to 2006 former chairman jcs david jones was appointed personal advisor to the president and secretary of defense to assist72 in may 1998 the presidents national security advisor wrote senator leahy to say that the united states would sign the ottawa treaty in 2006 provided the pentagon can develop suitable apl alternatives by then in light of that he requested support to repeal public law 104107 that mandated oneyear moratorium on use of apl by us forces starting in 199973 positive benchmark for administration policy was reached on june 30 1998 when the us army completed destruction of over 33 million nonselfdestructing apl that represented the entire us stockpile of dumb ap landmines except for about one million maintained for use in the korean peninsula and small numbers at various training locations for demining training purposes74 the remaining obstacle to us landminebanning policy centers around smart apl these selfdestructing or selfdeactivating devices were designed to negate the indefinite hazard threat of landmines but they were also banned by the ottawa treaty initial efforts to devise effective substitutes were disappointing faced with daunting deadlines the pentagon rejuvenated its search for apl alternatives in late 1997 but funding and definitive technological directions were not clear75 finding suitable apl alternatives for us troops remains an obstacle to further progress on banning landmines humanitarian demining the us government has been particularly active in overseas humanitarian demining activities since 1993 it is claimed that the united states spends almost as much on demining as the rest of the world combined76 emphasis has been on training and assisting people to accomplish demining within their own countries us troops are not allowed to do the task directly the overall program is overseen by the interagency working group on

both promising and problematic the differing roles of landmines in warfare are mirrored by important distinctions between countermine techniques and resources in conventional combined arms warfare minefields represent obstacles which are to be breached and transited in pursuit of an objective us army doctrine also provides for clearing operations in the support of continued passage of forces or as part of postwar nation assistance in postwar settlement or humanitarian and peacekeeping operations minefields must be demined to allow for habitation of the land the distinction between breaching and demining has informed the research and development of countermine technology changes in landmine technology have paradoxically blurred and clarified the different roles of landmines in warfare for example scatterable or remotely delivered mines have augmented the ability of the us military to defend against or canalize an advancing enemy force moreover selfdestructing and selfdeactivating mines seem to provide solution to ending the third role of mines in warfare fascam mines are surface laid not buried and are visible to the naked eye conversely in the hands of military forces intent on terrorizing civilian population remotely delivered mines simplify their task and are unlikely to be marked or recorded changes in landmine technology have also yielded nondetectable mines and antihandling devices both of which complicate the task of demining crs28 common technology of antipersonnel mines mines can be very simple devices easily manufactured from universally available materials the primary component is an explosive charge that damages the victim by blast or from dispersal of the casing fragments another necessary component is detonator fuse which can be mechanical chemical or electrical finally sensing device is needed to initiate the chain of detonation in simple mines the sensing can be achieved by direct pressure of footstep the pull of tripwire or release of pressure when the mine is picked up or uncovered the simple blast mine is difficult to detect because it can be very small and encased in plastic larger somewhat more mechanical minethe bounding fragmentation mineis more lethal an additional component projects the main charge one or two meters into the air where it explodes and propels fragments throughout radius of ten to thirty meters this technology is over thirty years old but still effective it will deny an area and create casualties until trained and equipped personnel clear or demine the mined area advanced technologies because current technology for antipersonnel mines is very costeffective there exists little incentive for advancing ap mines per most recent research and development has been in conjunction with creating more effective antitank systems many of these systems continue to include ap mines most of the new systems being devised are incorporated into modern mechanized forces and include automatic self destruction the most advanced components are often the sensing methods these include seismic sonic and infrared sensors in conjunction with computer software recognition of target signatures most of this technology is not costeffective against personnel and is not likely to exacerbate current problems with control of ap mines81 to alleviate incidents of fratricide the us military employs selfdestructing mines some antipersonnel mines employed by the us military are not self destructing three examples are the m14 nonmetallic blast mine the m16a1 fragmentation mine and the m18a1 claymore command detonated nonmetallic fragmentation mine each of these type of mines is removable and provides us forces with the capability to emplace hasty protective minefield in tactical environment all mines are picked up by the emplacing unit upon leaving the area unless enemy pressure prevents mine retrieval or the minefield is being transferred to relieving commander82 according to the deputy program manager for landmines since 1970 the us has not designed mine without finite life83 some critics have suggested that modern us landmines are not reliable enough to 81 based in

at 999999 percent backed up by selfdeactivation through battery exhaustion in 32000 tests all systems selfdestructed84 advanced technologies have also yielded mines that are not detectable non detectable mines have complicated the ccw negotiations as some nations must convert existing stockpiles to level of detectability the issue of selfdestructing mines has also created requirement for some nations to convert existing stockpiles countermine technology85 countermine operations generally consist of detecting breaching marking and clearing mines the actions support larger military concept of operations and scheme of maneuver means of detection range from visual physical probing electronic mechanical and even the use of dogs86 the dod report to the congress conduct of the persian gulf war concluded that during desert storm breaching minefields under enemy fire proved demanding requirements for countermine and engineer equipment should be reviewed carefully87 existing technologies for tactical breaching include the m58a4 mineclearing line charge miclic rocketpropelled explosive line charge which basically blasts vehicle width lane through minefield another example of the line charge is the antipersonnel obstacle breaching system apobs the apobs is man portable linecharge capable of blasting footpath through minefield88 other methods of breaching or clearing essentially expanding footpaths created by line charge are through the use of plows blades and rollers attached to tank each of the methods described above was employed in desert storm as was manual probing in reaction to the finding in the report conduct of the persian gulf war the congress added funds to the countermine research development test and evaluation program in the senate armed services committee report on the fy93 national defense authorization act the committee linked countermine technology for tactical purposes to humanitarian demining programs an accelerated 84

the explosive standoff minefield breacher crs30 countermine rdte program could develop improved mine detection methods to support mine clearing operations89 this linkage between tactical countermine technology and demining operations has been accelerated due to the deployment of us forces to bosnia as part of the nato implementation force to support us forces in bosnia the army assembled countermine task force lightweight armor that can be attached to vehicles has been used successfully in bosnia army commanders in europe have also requested the integration of existing technologies to provide for better locating marking and tracking of all minefields the advanced technologies currently being developed for countermine operations largely rely upon thermal imaging and infrared ir sensors one program currently in testing is the airborne standoff minefield detection system astamids which employs either laser andor an ir sensor placed on an unmanned aerial vehicle to detect mines90 the closein man portable mine detector also uses an ir sensor to detect mines and is man portable91 various ir detection systems are also being tested in conjunction with remotelycontrolled minedetection vehicles for clearance of mines one system being explored is the standoff minefield breacher net containing shaped charges which when hurled over minefield and detonated trigger mines beneath the surface92 as evident from the above review the preponderance of technological development focuses on mine detection two areas of research that may advance demining programs are foams which either destroy mines in place or prevent activation of pressure and tensionrelease mine fuzes and demining vehicles that clear and destroy mines93 mine clearing and demining for the foreseeable future will involve the painstaking tasks of exploding or disarming landmines alternatives to antipersonnel landmines since 1996 the us department of defense has searched for alternatives to apl initial studies were discouraging and determined that shortterm solutions would have to involve increased use of manpower rather than technology the search was rejuvenated in late 1997 with the signing of the ottawa treaty and the 89 us congress senate committee on armed services national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1993 report to accompany s 3114 july 31 1992 washington dc us govt print off

pursuing track 2 that might discover more sophisticated technological alternatives to current apl general categories of weapons concepts being considered are on site sensors with remote response remote sensors with remote response obstacles and diversions and mobile robots other nations such as south africa sweden and the united kingdom also are researching apl alternatives many options attempt to use existing weapons with more precise command and control remote sensing and man in the loop another tack suggested by some is wider application of many nonlethal technologies being developed for lowerintensity conflict situations95 criticisms of technology advances in landmine technology have allowed for increased lethality increased rates of dispersal and selfdestruction capability advances in countermine technology allow for detection by thermal imaging and rapid breaching one criticism of the technological approach to landmine proliferation is that mines will continue to be used indiscriminately absent an international ban on production export and use criticism of the ccw is that some nations cannot afford the costs of converting existing stockpiles of mines to those that selfdestruct conclusion the united states as an advanced industrial power in possession of the worlds most advanced weaponry is unlikely to confront opposing military forces which seek battle according to our own preferred strategy two examples from past wars and one from current conflict should illuminate the role of landmines during union general william t shermans march to the sea in 1864 the general came upon group of soldiers tending to young officer whose foot had been destroyed by torpedoa mineplanted in the road as sherman described the incident there had been resistance at that point nothing to give warning of danger and the rebels had planted eightinch shells in the road with friction matches to explode them by being trodden on to the union general this was not war but murder and it made very angry96 in discussing an incident from the war novel fields 94 dod annual report to congress on use by armed forces of antipersonnel landmines 1998 95 ibid also

landmines and booby traps were fixture the great leveler 97 according to major giangaetano carancini an italian mine removal specialist currently serving in bosnia the main danger is many of the mines are homemade not traditional and that makes them harder to recognize they are made with materials found in the markets like water pipes filled with nails and dynamite 98 because landmines serve as leveler they are unlikely to soon vanish from the international arms market addressing the roles of landmines poses significant challenge to american foreign policy the tactical role of landmines is an element of us military doctrine and contingency planning that is currently being reviewed99 some proponents believe that us soldiers should continue to have ap mines in their arsenal while some critics of us military doctrine believe that ban on the military use of ap mines will serve to reduce landmine proliferation100 proponents of total ban also reason that such measure will reduce the indiscriminate use of ap mines against civilians during and after war during war the laws for the conduct of armed conflict jus in bello are occasionally subsumed by the right to go to war jus ad bellum101 thus it is unlikely that legislation enacted by the congress to ban the use of landmines by the us military will result in the disappearance anytime soon of these small cheap weapons from all battlefields nevertheless the us response to landmine proliferation has been multifaceted and accelerating to control the tactical role of landmines the us military is guided by law and doctrine

congress has prohibited the export of ap mines by us companies to fight against the debris of mine warfare the united states has appropriated significant humanitarian funds for demining training and grants for demining equipment to nations in need lastly the united states has unilaterally restricted its own use of apl is searching for alternative military weapons and is pressing negotiations toward global ban on antipersonnel landmines the major political issues revolve around how quickly and how carefully to proceed crs34 glossary landmine any munition designed and manufactured to be
