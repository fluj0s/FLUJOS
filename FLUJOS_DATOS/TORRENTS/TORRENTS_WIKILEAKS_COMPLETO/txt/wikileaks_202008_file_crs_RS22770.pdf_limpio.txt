by stuart goldman background most analysts agree that russias democra tic progress was uneven at best during the 1990s and that the previous two cycles of gislative and presidentia l elections held under the leadership of president vlad imir putin those in 19992000 and 20032004 demonstrated further setbacks for democratization1 after the proputin united russia party gained enough seats and allies to domin ate the state duma the lower legislative house of the federal assembly the upper hous is not directly elected after the 2003 election the kremlin moved to make it more difficult for sma ller parties to win seats in the future including by raising the hurdle of minimum votes needed to win seats from 5 to 7 also the election of 50 of duma deputies in constituency races where independent candidate s and those from small opposition pa rties usually won some seats was abolished with all duma members to be elected via party lists changes in campaign and media laws also made it more difficult fo r small parties and opposition groups to gain publicity in the run up to the december 2 2007 duma electionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22770crs2 2 open source center central eurasia

three parties are opposition parties and the latte r two are liberal democratic parties fair russia is widely viewed as creation of the putin administration and considers itself centrist party the ultranationalist li beral democratic pa rty usually supports putins initiatives in the duma other russia an opposition bloc of movements and unreg istered parties co chaired by former international chess champion garry kasparov called on the cec to permit it to field candidates but the cec denied their request saying it could not rewrite new law that permits only single registered parties to participate in the election perhaps the most significant event in the runup to the 2007 duma election was president putins october 1 2007 announcement at the convention of the united russia party that he would accept its invitation to head its lis t of candidates although he declined to join the party the parties long have relied on the prestige of prominent persons at the top of their lists and the voters are often aware that these people will pass on taking their seats in the duma if the party wins in his acceptance speech putin stated that suggestion by previous speaker that he become the prime minister after his second term as president ends is entirely realistic but it is too soon to talk about this at the moment because at least two conditions would first need to be met first united russia would have to win the state duma electi on on december 2 and second our voters would have to elect decent effective and modernthinking president2 short campaign season was permitted by law to

informative the united russia party and the putin administrationsupported nashi youth group stressed russian nationalism and an anti western image absorbing and amplifying the themes of the former motherland party which was allegedly created and later abolished by the putin administration these themes appeared to at least partly reflect real fears by some part of the putin administration that small domestic groups funded by enemy western countries might try to launch democra tic color revolutions like those that took place in georgia in 2003 and ukraine in 2004 to reinstall the soca lled oligarchs and divvy up russias oil and gas resources flyer attributed to nashi ca lled for rallies on december 36 to prevent the united states from using traitors and thieves such as kasparov to launch color revolution some observers ve warned that although ited russia might have gained some electoral support by using such themes associated dangers include fueling ethnic and religious hate crimes and calls for belligerent and isolationist foreign policy6 reflecting these themes putin explained in major speech to his supporters on november 21 that he had agreed to head th united russia party list in order to prevent the duma from becoming collection of populists paralyzed by corruption and demagoguery as in the past he warned his supporters that russias stability and peace were still threatened by three groups which he seemed to conflate the supporters of sovietera politicians the s upporters of former russian president boris yeltsin and those who scavenge outside foreign embassi foreign diplomatic missions and rely on support from foreign foundations and govern ments these groups he asserted want weak and sick state and disorganized and disoriente d society in order to wheel and deal behind its back in order to receive their piece of pie at our expense he warned that some members of these groups are campa igning for seats in the duma and staging demonstrations as taught by western advisors in the hope of restoring the oligarchs regime based on co rruption and lies7 results and assessments according to the final results reported by the cec four parties won enough votes to pass the 7 hurdle and win seats in the duma see table 1 united russia increased the number of seats over those it won in 2003 but the real effect may be minor since many deputies in that duma later aligned with united russia giving it the twothirds majority needed to approve changes to th constitution the losing parties altogether garnered about 7 of the vote another 1 of votes were deemed i nvalid the relatively high turnout 637 of 109 million voters co mpared to 2003 56 won plaudits for the cec although the main contribution appear ed to be putins active role some regions

mandate on putins rule according to many observers in the 2007 elec tion however putin did not just endorse the united russia pa rty but placed his name at the head of its list and many observers viewed the electi on results as more popular endorsement of putin than an endorsement of united russia in this view the voters were indicating that they wanted putin to remain in leadership position even after his presidential term ends on december 3 putin announced that he would use his power as president to convene the new duma within few days so that it could start working with the government he argued that since more citizens than in past elections had turned out and voted for parties that ended up with legislative seats this incoming duma would be more legitimate some critics suggested that by this definition voting during the soviet era for the sole communist party would have been the most perfect legitimacy putin also praised voters for rejecting destructive shift in the

out putins second term in offi ce as uzbek president islam karimov did in 2002 to lengthen his term in office10 since united russia strengthened its dominance of the duma the party leader and outgoing duma speaker boris gryzlov stre ssed on december 3 that the party would not fundamentally change its ready nonpareil record in passi ng legislation to implement putins development plans and budgets s imilarly deputy prime minister aleksandr zhukov suggested that there would be few if any changes in the government although the communist party is now the sole opposition in the duma the dominance of united russia over legislative offices and committees will permit the communists little leeway for influencing legislation also the communist party in the last duma appeared to play the role of constructive opposition by s eeking to work with united russia on many legislative issues including agreement on such foreign policy issues as sanctions against georgia and condemnation of nato enlarg ement and us missile defense plans united russia planned to hold conventi on on december 17 to choose its candidate for president this choice is likely to be putins preferred successor according to many observers there is speculation that the candi date could be first deputy prime ministers dmitriy medvedev or sergey ivanov or sitting prime minist er viktor zubkov according to one scenario such an official woul d be elected in march 2008 and serve as placeholder president and might even resign after short period in office permitting putin to constitutionally run in presidentia l byelection under this scenario putin might serve as prime minister according to some indicators intraelite conflicts are increasing as proputin groups maneuver to pr otect their interests in the runup to the supposed putin succession one security chief in october 2007 warned that these conflicts threatened russias stability11 most opposition party leaders criticized the election as marking the further whittling away of democratic freedoms putins fo rmer economic advisor andrey illarionov now in opposition denounced the newly elected duma as illegitimate and predicted on december 3 that putin will have to stay in office to violently suppress rising dissension against the authoritarian political system coleader of the union of right forces boris nadezhdin asserted on december 2 that putin was planning to use united russia to rule similar to singleparty rule during the soviet era another union of right forces co leader boris nemtsov called for opposition partie s and groups to join in backing single presidential candidate to run against the kremlins candidate12 under the law parties that gained only 24 or less of the vote face h eavy financial pe nalties that threaten their existence including losing their state subsidies forfeiting their relatively large election deposits and paying for the free airtime they had been alloted the result could be political system with
