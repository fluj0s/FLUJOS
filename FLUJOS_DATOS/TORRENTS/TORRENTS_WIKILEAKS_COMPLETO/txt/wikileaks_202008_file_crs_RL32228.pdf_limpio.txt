of taxfavored individual retirem ent accounts iras two new accounts life time savings accounts lsas and retirement savings accounts rsas senator craig thomas of the finance committee and representative sam johnson of the ways and means committee have introduced identical bills s 545hr 1163 and s 546hr 1162 to create lsas and rs as expanded savings accounts also were part of the final recommendations of the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform these proposals differ from the current sy stem of iras in several important ways including the required use of back loaded method now used for roth but not traditional iras in backloaded account s contributions are not deductible but withdrawals are not taxable higher c ontribution limits in some cases introduction of lsas with penalties for withdrawal and elimination of income phaseouts shifting to mandatory backloaded thod including the ability to roll over current deductible iras into the new syst em along with some other features has important consequences for the path of re venue loss the treasury projects the plans to either raise revenue or have little revenue effect in the first 10 years crs projections of longrun revenue costs i n the steady state beyond 2015 suggest 10 year loss in the neighborhood of 300 to 500 billion while it is difficult to estimate the cost precisely the large limits and lack of strings attached suggest that very large fraction of interest dividends and capital gain s could be tax exempt neither theory nor empirical evidence s eems to present much of case for significant or even positive effect on private savings resulting from these provisions particularly the backloaded form th change would tend to redistribute after tax income on both relative and absolute basis from lower to higherincome groups in part because lower and moderateincome individuals tend to have little or savings although benefits to the highest income individuals w ould be constrained by the contributions limit the provision of tax favored savings acc ounts with high limits could have some consequences for certain ac tivities and sectors of the ec onomy it could reduce the fraction of small businesses w ith pension plans as owners elect to save in their private accounts rather than through acc ounts set up in their businesses the provisions would also make variety of cu rrently favored investments less attractive including tax exempt state and local bonds life insurance products such as deferred annuities and direct investme nts in owneroccupied housing some of these effects should increase economic efficiency the change would discourage equity investment in unincorporated businesses and rental housin g and favor investment in debt it would have uncerta in effects on the

retirement accounts with 10000 annual limits as part of its final recommendations these proposals differ from the current system of individual retirement accounts in several important ways first unlike the current system choice is allowed between traditional or frontloade d account where individuals deduct contributions pay tax on earnings bu t pay tax on withdrawals much like pension plan and roth or backloa ded accounts adopted in 1997 where contributions are deducted and earnings or withdrawals are taxed as with tax exempt bond the new system requires all accounts to be in the backloaded form while both backloaded and frontloaded acc ounts effectively resu lt in tax rate on earnings of zero assuming cons tant tax rates in the case of frontloaded accounts the revenue paths of frontloa ded and backloaded accounts are quite different the costs of frontloaded accounts occur much mo re quickly than the costs of back loaded account2 moreover the projected revenue effect would also reflect both the involuntary substitution of backloaded fo r frontloaded accounts because the latter would longer be allowed and voluntar shifts of present asset balances or contributions to employer plans with disc retion such as 401k plans the form of the account also has some important impli cations for private savings responseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32228crs2 3 the economic growth and recovery act of 2001 increased the ira limit to 3000 in 20022004 4000 from 20052007 and 5000 in 2008 with indexation for inflation thereafter the provisions sunset after 2010secondly the limits of the new account s are higher than current accounts amounting to contributions of 10000 5000 for each account for the fy2007 proposal and advisory panel proposal and 7000 for the fy2008 proposal married couples filing jointly would have twi ce the limits the 2004 proposals supported by senator thomas and representa tive johnson were 15000 7500 for each account the contribution levels of iras were 2000 before the recent tax cuts and would have reverted back to this cap after 2010 but the be nefits were made permanent and the new amounts were set at 50003 these higher limits also have important economic implications thirdly the lsa account is to be allowed with pena lties for withdrawal before retirement age this feature ma kes this type of account unlike the current ira virtually perfect substitute for ordinary savings and one would expect financial institutions to quickly set up simp types of accounts th at would be eligible for the tax benefit rsas have penalties for withdrawing before age 58 slightly below the current 59½ age but like curre nt roth iras have required minimum distribution after age 70½ as do tr aditional or frontloaded iras finally the proposal eliminates all in come limits on the accounts veryhigh income individuals are not currently eligib for the benefit but would become so under the proposal long run revenue cost the projected revenue effects of thes proposals show either small revenue gain or small loss the magnitude of these effects is more than few billion dollars over 10 years for the budget horiz on but these intermediateterm revenue effects greatly understate the eventual cost of the program beyond the budget window this section explor variety of approaches to estimating the long run cost that would occur after the cost has settled into steady state which would probably be in the tens of billions per year and several hundred billion over 10year period within the steady state perhaps after the second or third decade even though the annual contribution caps differe d from proposal to proposal the revenue loss pattern is similar in every case and many conclusions remain unaffected by the difference the long run cost projected from short run official estimates an illustration the near term revenue effects of the fy2004 lsarsa proposal with the 7500 ceiling as projected by either the treasury or the joint committee on taxation jct were very small th presidents 2004 budget proposal showed gain of 148 billion in the first five years and gain of 2 b illion in the first

on 55 billion 28 billion and 07 billion there were effects in fy2004 revenue losse s then occurred through fy2014 07 billion 21 billion 38 billion 43 billion and 47 billion according to the treasury departmentyears4 the jct found similar pattern gains then losses but projected quite different numbers with loss of 49 b illion in 2013 an overall gain of 12 billion in the first five years and loss of 5 billion over the 10year period5 for the fy2007 proposals with the lower 5000 ceiling both treasury and jct project small 10year losses of 122 million treasury to 275 million jct6 the comparable treasury 10year estimates for fy2006 and fy2005 proposals were 15 billion and 56 billion gains respectively7 jcts estimates of the measures were 24 billion and 09 billion losses over the 10year period respectively8 both sets of estimates show similar pattern of revenue gains in the first years reversing into the losses in the remainder of the period9 these nearterm estimates for the next 10 years show positive or small negative effects for three reasons first for any new normally taxable savings that are now funneled into these tax free account s the cost rises very rapidly over time compared to most tax reductions which tend to rise at the nominal growth rate of the economy perhaps around 5 for example suppose 7500 were put into an account in each year and the interest rate is 10 in the first year the reduction in taxable income is 750 10 of 7500 in the next year the previous yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32228crs4 10 in the short run this offsetting gain woul d include the tax benefit of traditional ira contributions which were about 7 billion in 2000 at 20 tax rate worth 14 billion over 10 years therefore the current lim its would be at least 14 billion even without accounting for growth and would probably be c onsiderably larger because of the rapid growth of the income limits while the do llar limit of contributions is fixed at 2000 temporary provisions in the 2001 tax cut allow increases in the dollar am ounts to be contributed to iras and the income limit will increase substantially over the period the temporary provisions have been estimated to increase revenues by about 25 billion over 10 years if we use the conservative 14 billion number and add the 25 billion there are temporary 10year gains of 39 billion embedded in the estimates and wit hout those temporary gains the gain of 2 billion for the 7500 limit would be loss of 37 billion based on the projections discussed above the longrun steadystate cost would be five times as large or 185 billion leading to an annual loss of about 185 billion with the higher revenues reported for the fy2005 estimates with the lower ceiling the 39 billion would be offset by about 6 billion for loss of 33 billion suggesting total of 177 billion over 10 years or an annual about 17 billion note that this analysis assumes that additional accounts would be diverted from existing acc ounts and not associated with additional private savings see the section on savings ffects for justification of this assumption 11 for the fy2004 administration estimates the appropriate year would be 2008 where the revenue cost is estimated at 18 billion however this 18 billion is the net of positive gain from substitutions for frontloaded iras and the loss from additional backloaded continuedinvestment is now worth 8250 7500x110 nd adding current investment the total in the account is now 15750 the s econd years reduction in taxable income is 1575 or 21 times the first year growth rate of 110 in the third year the cost is 331 times the first year based on the model shown in the appendix which allows for contributions and withdrawals which relates each year to its eventual long term steady state the first years cost expressed in cu rrent income levels is about 3 of the steady state cost th fifth years cost is about 18 and the tenth years cost is about 41 overall the first five years cost is about 11 of steadystate five year cost and the first 10 years cost is about 20 thus these losses are only fraction of their long run losses secondly there would be temporary reve nue gain because repeal of traditional ira provisions would reduce the cost of up front deductions in order to determine the loss from the expanded limits we need to eliminate this revenue to measure the loss and then use the revenue pattern disc ussed above to project from the short term to the long term using this approach we project the cost with the 7500 limit to be at least 18 billion per year 180 b illion over 10 years with constant income levels using the treasury estimates th annual cost would be slightly over 20 billion with the jct estimates the co st with the 5000 limit treasury estimates is about 17 billion10 again these are conservative measures thirdly individuals are allowed to ro ll over existing accounts into backloaded accounts and pay for the cost over four years since these effects are in the first four years we can extrapolate from single year past that point where the cost is expected to be about 18 of the steady state t hose calculations suggest an annual cost of closer to 40 billion with relatively little difference between the 5000 and 7500 ceiling11 the projections from the joint tax committees estimates wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32228crs5 11 continued iras the cost for the 2001 increases for that year was projected at 34 billion and if we use 14 billion cost for current iras the results imply loss of 66 billion which would translate into an annual loss of 37 billion 66 billion divided by 018 per year 370 billion over 10 years this estimate fixe s the existing loss of front loaded iras at only 14 billion if it were raised to 2 billion the cost would 40 billion 23418x01018 applying the same met hods to the new 2005 estimates with the lower limit results but using 2010 the 2005 proposal is made year later and delays the effective date by another year the proposal loses 07 billion however the gain from the temporary limit increase is 44 billion implying loss after backing out the temporary revenue gain of 65 billion which would lead to cost of 36 billion also close to 40 billion if the value of current iras was increased 12 in the steady state the loss from backloaded accounts is the interest rate times the asset balance the loss for frontloaded account in cludes this forgone interest but it is reduced by the gain from tax on withdrawals less the ss from the tax benefit of the deductions see jane g gravelle estimating the longrun revenue effects of tax law changes eastern economics journal vol 19 fall 1993 pp 481494however have been smaller about 28 b illion for the 7500 cap these estimates would be affected by recent legislation th at allows onetime rollover of iras into roth iras with income limit in 2010 fourthly the revenue estimates may also include some gain from the possibility of shifting some of the amounts currently contributed to 401k and similar plans to individual accounts at least for amounts without an employer match given there are strings attached these choices have th same types of effects as prospective future iras and further expand th scope for additi onal revenue loss finally the long run revenue cost will be slightly larg er although the effect will probably be small12 by the replacement of frontl oaded by backloaded accounts the implication from this extrapolation exercise is that the longrun steadystate revenue cost of the plans will be in the tens of billions of dollars per year and even without accounting for all of the contributi ons to cost could amount to as much 40 billion per year or 400 billion over 10 years while the short run effect at least according to the administration estimates is gain of several billion over 10 years dramatic contrast direct estimates of the steady state cost the previous numbers extr apolated from the presumed use of these savings accounts by the treasury and jct revenue estimators another approach is to examine the total revenue collected from passive forms of investment and to estimate what fraction of that revenue will become tax exempt under the proposed plan since the lsa accounts have strings attached individuals should prefer to place all of their savings up to the limit in these accounts including nonretirement savings the 5000 or 7000 limit and even the 2000 limit for each of these plans is so great that the plans could allow all savings of m oderate income individua ls to be contained in the account over period of time particularly for married c ouples whose lsa annual amounts would be twice as large and combined lsa and rsa amounts wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32228crs6 be 20000 or 30000 over 10 years savi ngs could cumulate to as much as 300000 an amount much greater than the ty pical liquid savings of most families thus these families would not be expected to be constrained by the limit in 2000 according to the internal re venue service statistics of income individual returns dividends and intere st on taxable returns were 186 billion and 140 billion respectively there were also capital gains distributions of 61 billion and net gain from sales of capital assets of 623 billion the 623 billion would include nonpassive inve stments such as real estate nd would be highly concentrated among high income individuals just c onsidering interest dividends and capital gains distributions the total is 387 billion which at 20 marginal tax rate would yield 77 billion in revenue implying potential loss from the lsarsa plan in that vicinity or greater since it excludes sales of capital assets if virtually all assets were eventually to be placed in these plans the actual revenue loss would be smalle r than this amount for two reasons first the amount alread excluded from individual retirement accounts under permanent rules could change because of rising income limits although comparisons of tax expenditure projections suggest this effect is only few billion dollars more importantly some share of this amount is in high income brackets where substantial portion of individuals might exceed the limit 133 billion of the 387 billion is in the 100000 and over income class nd even among more moderate income classes some individuals will exceed the dollar limits to explore how much this revenue cost might be reduced by individuals saving more than the maximum amount we firs t determine how much would be earned from accounts assuming the maximum had been saved and reinvested every year the formulas for calculating these effects are shown in the appendix in tables 1 and 2 we show the dollar amount of earnings depending on the real interest rate and the period of time that the asset is accumulating for limits of 5000 and 7500 respectively note that these are the am ounts accrued by single taxpayer married couple would be able to save twice as mu ch

29001 44471 67085 100231 source crs calculations see text the inflation rate is assumed to be 2 the exact amount of exempt relevant passive income would vary for every taxpayer depending on such factors as th amount of individual annual contributions and withdrawals years of pa rticipation in the program and the rate of return on persons investments modeling each of these parameters is not possible without detailed data particularly data that reflect age which is not provided on tax returns in order to estimate the magnitude of the impact we consider several scenarios and combine them with the historic tax return data sources of the relevant passive income were limited to taxable interest dividends and capital gains distributions in one scenario there are several other sources of income in particular capital gains on sales of capital assets and much of these gains largely representing capital gains on stock sales is also passive income we provide second scenario that includes these gains as well the 1999 income amounts were not adjusted for inflation althoug h that is unlikely to have significant influence on the results we ignore expansions in the regula r individual retirement accounts which would increase the maximum amount that coul d be sheltered in the savings plans but whose use is more difficult to predict ig noring rsas would also understate the cost particularly keeping in mind higher contribution limit of 5000 under the proposal we also ignore the offsetting effect of interest earned on checking accounts where lsa treatment would not be feasible as shown in table 3 three illustrative annual taxexempt lsa income threshold values of 5000 15000 and 35000 per person are selected thus married filers would effectively face caps of 10000 30000 and 70000 correspondingly the estimation process pplies these assumed thresholds to sample of historic 1999 i ndividual income tax returns supplied by the irs13 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32228crs8 14 see

impact with sales of capital assets billions 5000 267 314 15000 432 5535000 541 754 source crs calculations see text for example consider two single ta xpayers returns in the case of 5000 threshold the first one with the sum of interest dividends and capital gains distributions in 1999 of 3000 and the second one with 11000 under the 5000 assumption the first taxpayer would be able to exempt all of the relevant passive income since it is less than 5000 the s econd one would be able to exclude just the first 5000 of 11000 and pay the ta x on the remaining 6000 under 15000 or 35000 cap scenarios both of them woul d be exempt on all of their relevant passive income therefore the sum of these taxpayers deductions in the first case of 8000 would increase to 14000 in the sec ond case because of the higher income taxpayers increased lsa deduction as the cap value increases the impact grows larger because higher income taxpayers could exempt larger shares of their relevant passive income and each dollar deducted by taxpayers in higher marginal tax brackets would be costlier than the one deducted by taxpayers in lower marginal tax rate brackets the revenue cost increases much more slowly proportionally than does the cap tripling of the cap increases costs by 60 seven fold increase doubles the cost the results are sensitive to the limits c hosen but even the very modest 5000 limit indicates cost of 27 billion per year since close to half of all capital gains is typically associated with sales of stock14 if we take the intermediate limit of 15000 associated with savings period of around 25 years at 4 to 5 return with 5000 limit and average the last two columns the estimate is around 50 billion the general magnitude of effects is consistent with study last year by burman gale and orzag who used similar approach to estimate the fy2004 revenue loss which they project to be in the neighborhood of 50 billion at current 2003 income levels15 given the modest increase in revenue cost with an increasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32228crs9 15 continued proposals preliminary analysis tax notes march 3 2003 pp 14231446 16 joint committee on taxation estimates of federal tax expenditures for fiscal years 20042008 december 22 2003 17 recent cbo working paper steadystat analysis of proposals to reduce the tax on saving by paul burnham february 2006 estimated loss of 17 billion per year in steady state well above the official annual co st estimates of the first ten years of the continuedin limits at this level there is probabl not lot of difference between the 5000 and 7500 limit one revenue cost that is not included in this analysis is the loss arising from arbitrage for example individuals who actually have smaller savings than that eligible for iras could potentially borrow from home equity line of credit and reinvest in iras creating an artificial tax saving this artificial tax saving would be constrained by the spread between the ra charged on loans and the rate earned on investments but it is possible that mark ets will develop to take account of such arbitrage possibilities projections from current costs of iras final way of gaining some notion of the magnitude of l ong run revenue cost is to consider the tax expenditure timate for the current ira provision which is 20 billion according to the tax expenditure compendium for 2008 the last year for which estimates have been made16 some provisions have been in the law long time others since 1997 and the most r ecent changes were made in 2003 and reflecting limit of 5000 so the provision is below its steadystate level if one just recognized that the dollar limits will be tripled in comparison to the 5000 cap if everyone tripled the size of the asse ts in their accounts the cost would be an additional 40 billion this estimate is overs tated because all i ndividuals will not be at the ceiling so that one could not simp ly add 40 billion to account for this effect however the income limits will be completely removed which would add to the cost and the cost is not at its steadystate level the cost would also be larger if compared to 2000 limit but in general since current ira provisions are relatively costly ie 20 billion it should not be surprising that such dramatic expansion is also quite costly and could again easily be in the tens of billions of dollars summing up the evidence for longrun costs while it is not possible to place precise price tag on the long run cost of these proposals they are clearly much more cos tly than is suggested by the nearterm revenue estimates an timate of 300 to 500 billion or even more over 10year period does not seem unreasonable significant contrast to the 2 billion revenue gain in the short run projected by the treasury for its fy2004 proposal the 4 billion loss projected by the joint committee on taxation for that same plan or the 55 billion gain projected by the treasury for the fy2005 proposal17 this

economic issues aris with respect to expanding savings incentives the focus of the administrati on and perhaps of other supporters of the plan is to increase savings and economic growth critics are often concerned about distributional effects savings incentives tend to favor higher income individuals the ceilings on contributions however limits the benefit available to high income individuals

18 continued fraction of ira contributions represent net savings see ayse imrohoroglu selahattin imrohoroglu and douglas h joines the effect of taxfavored accounts on capital accumulation vol 88 sept 1998 pp 749768evidence on savings incentives in general nd on the particular ffects of individual retirement accounts which were made available to all i ndividuals in the period 1981 1986 if one begins with overall evidence on savings with incentives without caps or strings attached even this evidence does not necessarily suggest private savings would increase the effect of tax re duction on savings is theoretically ambiguous because of offsetting income and subs titution effects the increased rate of return may cause individuals to substitute future for current consumption and save more substitution effect but at the same time the higher rate of return will allow individuals to save less and still obtain larger target amount an income effect the overall consequence for sa vings depends on the relativ magnitude of these two effects empirical evidence on the relationship of the rate of return to the saving rate is mixed indicating mostly small effects of uncertain direction thus individual contributions to iras may have resulted from shifting of existing assets into iras or diversion of savings that would ot herwise have occurred into iras more stark illustration of the uncertainty of increasing savings with higher rate of return is the juxtaposition of high returns in the stock market with dramatic reduction in the personal savings rate suggesting that income or wealth effects dominated behavior this fall in the savings rate in the face of high returns provides some additional evidence that expanded iras may not be successful in increasing savings rates iras are even less likely to increase savings because they are subject to contribution limits for those who have saving in excess of the limit there is marginal incentive in this case only the income effect dominates there is one caveat about this theoretical point in the case of frontloaded or traditional iras there is some reason to expect that the tax cut itself would be saved or largely saved that is because the savi ngs plan has future tax liability attached to it when withdrawn so that even if an individual were not affected by the savings incentives in the normal way he or she would wish to save the tax cut to pay the future tax this choice would keep c onsumption fixed this analysis applies however only to frontloaded iras and not to the backloaded forms in the administration proposal note that despite this conventional analysis of iras and savings some economists have argued that ira contribu tions were largely new savings the theoretical argument has been made that the iras increase savings because of psychological mental account or advertising reasons individuals may need the attraction of large initial ta x break they may need to set aside funds in accounts

gail makinenare restricted to discipline th emselves to maintain retirem ent funds or they may need the impetus of an advertising cam paign to remind them to save there has also been some empirical evidence presented to suggest that iras increase savings this evidence includes both some simple observations that individuals who invested in iras did not reduce their nonira assets and variety of statistical studies especially estimates by venti and wise that showed that ira contributions were pr imarily new savings19 however the fact that individuals with iras do not decrease their other assets does not prove that ira contributions were new savings it may simply mean that individuals who were planni ng to save in any case chose the taxfavored ira mechanism the venti and wise estimate has been criticized on theoretical grounds and another study by gale and scholz using similar da ta found evidence of savings effect20 study by manegold and join comparing savings behavior of those newly eligible for iras and those already eligible for iras found evidence of an overall effect on savi ngs although increases were found for some individuals and decreases for others study by atta nasio and deleire also using this approach found little evidence of an overall savings effect21 and while one must be careful in making observations from single episode there was overall increase in the savings rate during the period that iras we re universally availa ble despite large contributions to iras similarly the hous ehold savings rate continued and actually accelerated its decline after expansion of iras in 199722 an important issue for evaluating the administration proposal is that in any case the argument regarding private savi ngs of the up front be nefit and the debate on the psychological effects of iras on savi ngs concerned the effects of frontloaded or deductible iras these arguments do not apply to backloaded iras if the objective of the plan were to encourage pr ivate savings the frontloaded form would have been more appropriate indeed by repealing the frontloaded form and requiring backloaded approaches there s hould be direct reduction in savings from this effect even if savings incentives otherwise have effect on savings individuals who now effectively prepay their taxes which gives the government its revenue gain should reduce th eir savings by an equal amounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32228crs13 of course the effectiveness of an expansion of iras is also affected by contribution limits since anyone contributing at the limit would not be affected at the margin for some individuals there is currently marginal effect but would now be one which would tend to induce savings for other new contributors who are still at the limit there would be marginal effect and the income effects will reduce savings higher contribution limits incr ease the fraction of revenue loss that is associated with marginal inves tment nevertheless as shown in tables 4 and 5 under our simulations significant amount of revenue goes to individuals who are at the maximum limit excluding sales of capital assets 56 at the lower limit and 24 at the higher limit this discussion relates only to private savings if the deficit increases in the long run then national savings could fa ll even if private savings did rise most of the evidence presented here suggests that the proposal is unlikely to increase savings or if it does increase saving s the effects would be small however one point is clear by choosing form of subsidy that reduces shortrun revenue costs the administration is also choosing form that is least likely to increase private savings and most likely to reduce them table 4 revenue impact and contributions limits in steady state excluding sales

income versus low income individuals savings subsidies typi cally benefit higher income individuals who are far more likely to have significan t savings the benefits of iras are somewhat constrained for high income individuals compared to other savings subsidies however because of the dollar ceilings and in the case of current iras the income limits which are particularly severe for traditional individual retirement accounts this proposal raises the cont ribution limits and ends the income limits to examine the distributional effects we return to the assumptions used to assess the general

however significant benefit accrues to the highest income taxpayers for this proposal comparing table 6 with table 8 which contains distribution of th population we see for example that in the case of the 1500030000 assumed ca p the bottom 40 of the population gets 4 of the tax cut the top 15 gets about 60 and the top 2 gets quarter the dollar benefit per return rises rapidl across the income classes because higher income individuals save much more that lower income ones and to lesser extent because of higher marginal tax rates table 8 number of returns by income class agi range

restrictions on availability through caps or exclusions because they have much higher incomes almost any general tax cut would exhibit some degree of this pattern there is case for using instead relative measure of redistri bution way to measure the relative distribution is to examine the tax savings as percent of income ideally as percent of aftertax income this relative di stribution measure still indicates shift in relative income from lower incomes to higher incomes through most of the income distribution where the peak is reached pends on the cap used and the inclusion of full capital gains however in both table 6 and table 7 the peak generally is reached in either the 100000 to 200000 income class or the 200000 to 500000 class suggesting that the relative benefit rises through 90 to 95 of the income distribution thus except for the very wea lthiest income classes that is the top 5 or 10 of the population the provision in creases the relative share of disposable income for higher income people that is redistributes income shares to the well off effects on other types of tax favored savings the final economic consequence of ne w savings account pr oposal particularly one with strings attached is that it would reduce participation in alternative taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32228crs18 favored savings as new substitute becomes available there are several types of tax favored uses that might be reduce d including employer pensions standard individual retirement accounts insurance plans tax favored education savings accounts tax exempt bonds owner occupied housing and tax favored capital gains and dividends the displacement of tax favored accounts may be desirable or an undesirable outcome for purposes of efficiency gains fo r example the current tax rules favor investment in owneroccupi ed housing and dive rting funds out of housing and into other types of investments may be desirable the shift into passive forms of investment also favors debt fi nance disfavors quity investments in unincorporated businesses nd has mixed effects on corpor ate equity encouraging employer pensions through tax benefits has some potential be nefits but may also involve some distortions following the release of the fy2004 propos als much attention was focused on the effect of employer plans in discussion and most attention w ill be devoted to that issue this possible effect is cited as one of the reasons for scaling down the limits from 7500 to 5000 employer pension plans actually the administration proposal also proposes to simplify employer plans including substituting employee retirement savings accounts for existing employer plan s such as 401ks and allowing after tax backloaded style employee contributions the objective is to simplify these plans for employers although the switch to backl oaded plans could reduce private savings and affect revenue patte rns just as in the case of lsas and rsas while it is possible that the simplifications in the proposal could increase employer coverage much more attention has been devoted to the possible effects of the individual plans on employer pension pl ans particularly in the case of lsas since lsas have strings attached i ndividuals might find it more attractive to reduce their voluntary 401k or similar c ontributions not matched by employer contributions and put such money instead into lsas because these plans could be easily tapped for nonretirement uses the lsas could actually reduce retirement savings an even more serious issue arises with small business plans and relates not only to the lsas but also to the linking of benefits of highly paid employees and rank andfile employees many smallbusiness owners find setting up plan complicated but may still do it to make their own retirement plans and plans of their highly compensated workers more taxfavored qualification for tax purposes requires plan to cover rank and file employees as we ll as owners and top officers the basic argument made in many of these discussions is that smallbusiness owners finding individual retirement plans with high ceilin gs and in the case of lsas strings attached will now prefer to save through individual acc ounts rather than by setting up retirement plans within their firms for themselves and their employees with 7500 ceiling in each account lsa and rs married couple could save 30000 per year and save additional amounts in childrens accounts these views have been expressed by number of different groups and organizations for example the executive director of the

retirement savings accounts the presidents b udget pr oposal for 2004 by patrick purcellof these proposals on small business retiremen t plan coverage will be anything less than devastating23 similarly the president of the profitsharing 401k council of america psca stated the proposed ch anges significantly erode the tax code incentives that encourage employers to accept the fiduciary obligation and expense that come with offering retirement plan the current approach links the availability of tax benefits for decision makers and better off workers with the retirement savings of lower paid employees this linkage requires that employers incentivize lower paid workers to save for retirement by using expensive matching contributions as well as conducting aggressive educa tional campaigns24 jack vanderhei business professor associated with the employee benefit research institute when commenting on the benefits of lsas and rsas stated thats probably enough for most small employers who could jettison doing anything for their employees and still get enough of tax break25 many other groups have made similar arguments26 there are also arguments that even larger employers might abandon plans because of the availability of individual tax deferred savings for their employees while there is way to know for cer tain the effects of the proposal on employer plans it does seem possible and according to the groups quoted above likely that the individual savings accounts despite simplification for employer plans ultimately reduce the coverage of employer pensions individual retirement accounts and life insurance products individual retirement accounts for individua ls not at the limit of their combined savings could be displaced by the lsas which have penalties for early withdrawal or other strings attached u nder the latest administration proposal such conversion becomes mandatory any life insurance product that has sa vings elements involves tax subsidy in the form of deferred taxes on earnings even term life policies if they have level premiums involve an accumulation of ear nings tax free and whole life policies explicitly provide inside buildup finally life insurance companies offer plans that are particularly aimed at achieving tax benefits in the form of annuitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32228crs20 since the tax exemption benefit for lsas and rsas is greater than the deferral benefit the attractiveness of these products particularly in cases where tax reduction is principal objective could fall substantially these shifts may not involve efficien cy costs and may involve gains but they would be disruptive for the life insurance industry education savings accounts tax benefits are provided for variety of educational savings accounts whose taxfa vored benefits depend on using the funds for educational purposes under the administrations fy2007 proposals lsas would either displace these accounts or include them as kind of subaccount although certain types of edu cation plans could be retaine d for example due to state provided tax benefits the ttractiveness of nostringsattached lsa should lead to the displacement of many of the educa tional accounts for those who are not saving at the limit qualified tuition plans are more likely to remain concentrated among high income individuals where the incentive probably matters least and less likely to apply to moderate income individuals where the relative benefits may actually influence decisions on how much to spend on education tax exempt bonds tax exempt bonds carry lower interest rates than equivalent taxable bonds w ith favorable tax treatment for many other investments the demand for tax exempt bonds should cont ract which would raise financing costs for state and local governments many analysts have criticized the tax subsidy for state and local bond finance which is largely an accident of history and of constitutional interpretation and might support this displacement but it will place an additional burden on the states and localities owner occupied housing debt and business equity t h t x exemption would shift investment into passi ve forms and out of equity investments in owner occupied housing and unincorporat ed business including rental housing in general the shift out of owne roccupied housing should increase economic efficiency because this type of investment is favored the shift out of unincorporated business equity may decrease efficiency the effects on corporate equity the most heavily taxed type of investment is uncertain while the changes favor corporate equity relative to investme nts in other types of equ ity the savings proposals also favor interest more than dividends and capital gains which are subject to lower rates and thus shifts assets into debt simplification the administration justifies its proposal on the grounds of simplification as well as incentives to save for most taxpayers the current choice is either back loaded or frontloaded retirement education health or other account with restrictions more limited on backloade d plans and income limits differing individuals whose incomes exceed the ceilin gs can invest in nondeductible tax deferred account the proposal would re place these choices with two plans that individuals could invest in simultaneously the rsa and the lsa the proposal may simplify rules by eliminating disparities among currently existing taxpreferredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32228crs21 accounts it is important to keep in nd though that the substantial longrun costs of the proposal may make this simplif ication effort very costly one although simplification may serve as an impetus for this change it is unclear how much simpler the resulting system would be there would still remain disparity between rsas and lsas the lsa rules are less restrictive than those of rsa because they do not have agebased withdr awal penalties furthermore some disparities do not disappear under the fy2007 proposal but rather become less conspicuous for exam ple it retains some qualified tuition plans as subaccounts within lsas the funds within rsas may be treated differently depending on their origin rollovers from some existing accounts may be subject to various additional requireme nts compared to the new contributions the fy2007 proposal would also retain limited traditiona l iras finally at this point the administrations proposal is just concep tual framework free of all the intricate details that ultimately determine the comple xity or simplicity of the whole system if simplification were the principal goal it would be much easier to permit certain dollar amount of passive income to be excluded without requiring the complications of keeping accounts at l east for lsas this approach would however cost more in the short run b ecause the growth of the accounts limits the initial revenue

where it grows for 15 years and then is wit hdrawn as level annuity for the next 10 years we assumed that contributions in each case are constant share of output while variations in holding periods and withdrawal patterns will affect the results this example illustrates the general pattern because of the time path of roth ira the cost is very small in the beginning but grows rapidly28 for example in the first year earnings from roth ira that are exempt from tax per dollar of contributions is r where r is the interest rate assuming an annual interest payment in the sec ond year the value is r1r r or slightly more than double the first term is intere st on the original first year contribution while the second is the interest on the second year contribution based on calculations assuming 7 interest rate and 3 growth rate g and keeping all measures constant relative to gdp in the first year assets in the accounts and revenue costs are 3 the size of their steadystate value by the fifth year they are 18 of the value of the steady state size relative to gdp which is reached in 25 years by the 10th year they are 41 of the size on average over the fiveyear period the cost is 11 of the steady state cost over 10year period the cost is only onefifth of the steadystate value relative to gdp rothtype iras costs are directly related to the interest rate since they involve forgoing tax on interest if in terest rates are rela tively low during the estimating period as there is some reason to believe to be the case the revenue loss will be even further below the steadystate values this effect does not occur with traditional deductible iras whose costs in the short run are related only to contribution levels mathematically to perform the calculations designate
