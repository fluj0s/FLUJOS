draft 271109 decision 1cp15 decision 1cmp5 in separate document adoption of the copenhagen agreement under the united nations framew ork convention on climate change the conference of the parties pursuant to the bali road map adopted by the conferen ce of the parties at its thirteenth session acknowledging and building on the work by the ad hoc working group on longterm cooperative action under the convention and the ad hoc working group on further comm itments for annex i parties under the kyoto protocol sharing commitment to take immediate and enhanced national action under the convention in pursuit of its ultimate objective and in accordance with its principles and commitments including the principle of comm on but differentiated responsibilit ies and respective capabilities seeking at the same time to move ahead promptly to take action related to address climate change believing it imperative that the parties continue to work together constructively to strengthen the worlds ability to combat climate change affirming the need to continue negotiations pursuant to decisions taken at cop13 and cop15 with view to agreeing on comprehensive legal framework under the convention later than copxx decides to adopt this political agreement hereinafter the copenhagen agree ment which will become effective immediately the copenhagen agreement 1 the parties to the united nations framework convention on clim ate change hereinafter the parties seek to further the implem entation of the convention in manner that pursues its ultimate objective as stated in its article 2 that recalls its provisions and that is guided by the principles in article 3 i shared vision for longterm cooperative action 2 the parties underline that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time and commit to vigorous response through immediate ambitious national action and strengthened international cooperation with view to limit global average temperatur rise to maximum of 2 degrees above preindustria l levels the parties are convi nced of the need to address climate change bearing in mind that social and econom ic developm ent and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priori ties in developing countries the parties note that the largest share of historical global emissions of greenhouse gases originates in developed countries and that per capita emissions in many developing countries are still relatively low the parties recognize the urgency of addressing the need for enhanced action on adaptation to climate change they are equally convinced that moving to lowemission economy is an opportunity to prom ote continued econom ic growth and sustainable developm ent in all countries recognizing that gender equality is essential in achieving sustai nable developm ent in this regard the parties commit to take action to mitigate climate change based on their common but differentiated responsibilitie s and respective capabilities comm it to take action on adaptation includi ng international support assisting the poorest and most vulnerable countries commit to strengthen the international architecture for the provision of substantially increased finance for clim ate ef forts in developing countries comm it to establish technology mechanis m to prom ote the developm ent transfer and deployment of environmentally sustainable technologies in support of mitigation and adaptation efforts welcom ing the significance of the commitments on all bali buildi ng blocks reflected in this agreement the parties emphasize the need for full implementation both domestically and internationally take note of the additional efforts being taken and planned by the parties such as cooperative efforts regarding transformational and other technologies and encourage each other to take app ropriate additional steps 3 recalling the ultim ate objective of the conventi on the parties stress the urgency of action on both mitigation and adaptation and recognize the scientific view that the increas in global average temperatu re above preind ustrial levels ought not to exceed 2 degrees c in this regard the parties support the goal of peak of global emissions as soon as possible but later than 2020 acknowledging that deve loped countries collectively have peaked and that the timeframe for peaking will be longer in dev eloping countries support the goal of reduction of global annual emissions in 2050 by at least 50 percent versus 1990 annual emissions equivalent to at least 58 percent versus 2005 annual emissions the parties contributions towards the goal should take into account common but different responsibility and respective capabilities and long term convergence of per capita em issions ii adaptation 4 the adverse effects of climate change are already taking place and are posing serious threat to the social and econom ic developm ent of all count ries this is particularly true in the most vulnerable developing countries which will be disproportionally affected the adverse impact of climate change will constitute an additional burden on developing countries efforts to reduce poverty to attain sustainable deve lopment and to achieve the united nations millennium development goals both adaptation and mitigation efforts are fundamental to the fight against climate change adaptation must include action to reduce risk and vulnerability taking into account gender equality and build resilience in order to reduce the threats loss and damages to livelihoods and ecosystems from disasters caused by extreme weather events and from slowons et events caused by gradual climate change recognizing that the impact of climate change will diffe r according to regional and national circumstances planning and implementation of adaptation actions must be considered in the context of the social econ omic and environm ental policies of each country adaptation action at national level will be country driven process taking into account national developm ent priorities and plans 5 in this regard the parties endorse the adapta tion fram ework in decision x4cp15 with the objective of reducing vulnerability and building resilience to present and future effects of climate change through national action and international cooperation this includes the provision of finance technology and capacity building in the immediate medium and long term support should be provided with priority for the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the context of this framework institutional arrangements will be established over time to support parties actions and provide technica l assistance including for risk reduction and provide financial risk transfer such as insurance further this will include system to ensure mutual accountability with monitoring review and asses sment of supp ort and actions and share lessons learned share of faststart financing comprising x for 201012 will be provided through existing channe ls including the adaptation fund to implement actions identified in national adaptation programmes of action and other urgent needs and to build capacity for further planning iii mitigation 6 the shared vision limiting global average temperature rise to maximum of 2 degrees above preindustrial levels is addressed by nationally appropriate mitigation contributions to be carried out by the parties consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and re spective capabilitie s and with developed countries taking the lead developed countries nationally approp riate mitigation commitments and action s 7 the developed country parties comm it to individual national econom wide targets for 2020 the targets in attachment would expect to yield aggregate emissions reductions by x1 percent by 2020 versus 1990 x2 percent vs 2005 the purchase of international offset credits will play supplementary role to domestic action the deve loped country parties support goal to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases in aggregate by 80 or more by 2050 versus 1990 x3 percent versus 2005 8 attachment reflects the individual economywide targets includ ing quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives by all the developed country parties developing countries nationally appropriate mitigation actions 9 the developing country parties except the least developed countries which may contribute at their own discretion commit to nationally appropriate mitigation actions including actions supported and enabled by technology financi ng and capacitybuilding the developing countries individual mitigation action could in aggregate yield percen t deviation in 2020 from business as usual and yielding their collec tive emissions peak before 20xx and decline thereafter 10 attachment b reflects individual commitments to nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing country parties developing country parties which have not reflected their contributions at cop15 should do so before xx except least developed countries developing country party may subsequently amend its national contribution to register additional national appropriate mitigation actions which increase its overall mitigation outcome 11 registry in the form of database under unf ccc is established in order to enable the international recognition of developing country mitigation action the registry shall include supported mitigation actions that meet agreed mrv specifi cations and unsupported actions that are subject to national mrv based on intern ationally agreed guidelines and consultative review under unfccc developing countries comm it to inscribe supported nationally appropriate mitigation actions in the registry and indicate the expected emissions outcomes unsupported action shall except for the least developed countries whic h may do so at their own discretion be inscribed via the national comm unications and can be inscribed directly in the registry beforehand on voluntary basis reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degrad ation 12 reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is an important aspect of the necessary response to climate change developing countries should contribute to enhanced mitigation actions through reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation maintaining existing and enhancing carbon stocks and enhancing removals by increasing forest cover parties underline the importance of enhanced and sustained financial resources and positive incentives for developing countries to through series of phases build capacity and undertake actions that result in measurab reportable and verifiable greenhouse gas emission reductions and removal and changes in forest carbon stocks in relation to reference emission levels parties collectively endorse the fram ework in decision xcp15 with the aim of stabilizing forest cover in developing count ries by x and reducing gross deforestation in developing countries by at least xx by 2020 com pared to current levels bunkers 13 an effective mitigation response includes reduction of emissions from international bunker fuels the parties therefore commit to set and implem ent global emission reduction target for international shipping equal to x in 2020 compared to 2005 and global emission reduction target for international aviation equal to in 2020 compared to 2005 the parties shall work throu gh the internationa l maritim organization and the international civil aviation organization to take this issue forward and secure timely implementation of actions needed carbon markets 14 an effective mitigation response requires well functioning carbon market carbon markets have the potential to deliver significant mutual benefits to developed and developing countries in terms of both ontheground investm ent and environm ental and energy security cobenefits the parties will work towards an effective and orderly transition from project based to more comprehensive approaches they will also improve the existing project based carbon market mechanism in order to ensure the environmental integrity and further underpin broad and liquid carbon m arket in this regard the pa rties endorse decision x3cp15 and x2cmp5 national policies 15 the parties commit to further integrate lowemission development policies into national planning the parties commit to rationalize and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consum ption as we do that we recognize the importance of providing those in need with the ability to purchase essential energy services including through the use of targeted cash transfers and other appropriate mechanisms in addition the parties commit to work towards adopting domestic policies aiming at payment for actual consumption of energy furthermore transparency concerning consumption and cost of energy should be increased response measures 16 parties decide that countries must strive to implement policies and measures in such way as to minimize adverse social environmental and econom ic impacts on developing country parties taking fully into account all relevant articles of the convention and as set forth in decision in xcp15 parties furthe r decide that action relating to response measures should be handled in structured manner in accordance with the convention recognizing the needs of developing country parties and as set forth in decision xcp15 iv technology 17 the international community can only be fully successful in addressing climate change if it is able to effectively develop diffuse and deploy existing climate friendly technologies and rapidly innovate new and transformational climatefriendly technologies this will require combination of efforts including substantially increased public and private sector investm ent in rdd enhanced internationa l cooperation and transfers the removal of barriers increased incentives to prom ote the developm ent and dissem ination of environm entally sustainable technologies elaboration of global technol ogy roadm aps infor mation sharing on best practices and greater capacity building efforts to prom ote the developm ent and deploym ent of environmentally sustainable technologies in support of m itigation and ad aptation efforts 18 parties commit to enable the accelerated largescale development transfer and deployment of environmentally sound and climate friendly technologies across all stages of the technology cycle respecting ipr regim including protec ting the legitimate interests of public and private innovators developed country partie s comm it to work towards doubling aggregate public investments in climate related research developm ent and demonstration by 2015 from current levels and quadrupling the efforts by 2020 parties stress the need for up front finance for inter alia technol ogy capacity building joint research and developm ent and demonstration projects parties endorse the technology mechanism set forth in decision x5cp15 containing technology objective unfc cc technolo gy body the developm ent of technology action plans the establishm ent of six climate technology innovation centres in developing countries support to joint rdd efforts between developed and developing countries and technolo gy support to nationally appropriate mitigation actions and adaptation activities by devel oping country parties v financial resources and investments to support actions on mitigation adaptation capacity building and technology cooperation 19 substantially scaled up financia l resources will be needed to address mitigation adaptation technology and capacity building it is essential to strengthen the international financial architecture for assisting the developing countries in dealing with climate change and to improve access to financial support resources will derive from multiple sources and flow through multiple bilateral and multilateral channels 20 the parties share the view that the strengthened financial architecture should be able to handle gradually scaled up internati onal public support international public finance support to developing countries shouldshall reach the order of x billion usd in 2020 on the basis of appropriate increases in mitigation and adaptatio n efforts by developing countries 21 the parties confirm climate financing committed under this agreem ent as new and additional resources that supplement existing international public financial flows otherwise available for developing countries in support of poverty alleviatio n and the continued progress towards the millennium development goals in this regard developed country parties comm it to deliver upfront public financing for 20102012 corresponding on average to 10 billion usd annually for early action capacity building technology and strengthen ing adaptatio n and mitigation readiness in developing countries as set forth in attachm ent c from 2013 the parties comm it to regularly review appropriatenes s of contributions and the circle of contributors against indicators of fairness based on gdp and emissions levels and taking into account the level of development as set forth in attachment c 22 recalling article 4 of the conventio n parties decide that climate fund be established as an operating entity of the financial mechanism of the convention which should function under the guidance of and be accountab to the cop as set forth in article 11 of the convention the fund should be operated by board with balanced repres entation which will develop the operational guidelines for the fund and decide on specific allocation to programmes and projects the cop will form ally elect members of the fund board and endorse the operational guidelines and modalities for the fund the fund should complement and maximise global efforts to fight climate change through upscaled support for climate efforts in the developing countries including mitigation adaptation technology and capacity building support from the fund may be channeled through multilateral institutions or directly to national entities based on agreed criteria parties comm it to allocate an initial amount of x to the fund as part of their international public climate support medium term funding should be based on share of less than of the overall international public support parties decide to operationalise the work of the fund following the modalities set forth in annexdecision 23 in the context of the commitment in paragraph 14 parties comm it to global financing contributions from international aviation and international maritime transport generated through instrum ents developed and implem ented by the icao and imo respectively should be channeled through the climate fund from 2013 mainly for adaption purposes taking into account the principle of comm on but differentiated responsibility 24 to enhance transparen cy and overview the parties decide to establish an international clim ate financing board under the unfccc to monitor and review international financing for climate action and in this context identify any gaps and imbalances in the international financing for mitigation and adaptation actions that may arise the board will consist of x representatives from developed countries and representatives from developing countries z representatives from international institutions will participate in the board as permanent observers decision making will be by consensus if all efforts to reach compromise have been exhausted and agreement has been reached decisions shall be taken by twothirds majority the unfccc secretariat will serve as secretariat for the international climate financing board parties endorse the further guidelines as set out in attachment d and decision x7cp15 25 placeholder for facilitative matching mechanism vi measurement rep orting and verificati on and improved national communications 26 the parties commit to robust measurement reporting and verification mrv of the commitments undertaken in this agreement and to review global progress in addressing climate change the parties endorse the furthe r guidelines as set out in decision x7c p15 measurement reporting and verifi cation for developed countries 27 in order to prom ote transparency and accountabil ity the developed country parties will report on the implementation of their individual mitigation commitments or actions in annex including methodologies and assumptions used the implem entation of the respective mitigation contributions and the related reductions are subject to international measurement reporting and verification and each developed country party is to report on emission reductions achieved in relation to targets in attachm ent utilis ing common methodology finance technology and capacity building for developing countries actions are subject to robust mrv provision of international public climate financing should be verified in conjunction with the mrv of supported action and according to international guidelines measurement reporting and verifi cation for developing countries 28 in order to prom ote transparency and accountabil ity the developing country parties will report on the implementation of their individual mitigation actions and emission outcomes achieved in relation to their estimates in attachment b the supported mitigation actions and the related reductions are subject to robust mrv mrv of supported actions must verify that financing as well as action is delivering in full towards commitments implementation of developing country mitigation actions that are not externally supported will be subject to national mrv based on international agreed guidelines and consultative review under unfccc the registry 29 parties decide to establish registry that will be managed and operated independently by professional secretariat which shall perfor m its tasks to the highest standards of professionalism and objectivity the secret ariat shall further prepare and propose the accounting standards for mrv of specific mitigat ion action and of financing further tasks improved national communications 30 noting that lowemission development is indispensable to sustainable development and recognizing that development strategies and priorities are sovereign national decisions the parties decide to strengthen the reporting regim and to enha nce the forward looking aspects in the natio nal communication by including mitigation plans the parties decide that parties are to provide their greenhouse gas inventories on an annual basis with the exception that the developing countries can provide updates on biannual basis and the least developed country parties on triennial basis national communications should be provided every 2 years the parties endorse the further guidelines as set out in decision x1cp15 to include forward looking mitigation plan would help frame actions planned in the near and medium term 2020 in the context of longerterm goals 2050 the plans should describe countries current mitigation and energy policy frameworks including regulation and pricing and mitigation potenti for developing countries these plans will help facilitate access to support for mitigation actions anchored in the plans the parties except the least developed count ries which may contribute at their own discretion are invited to put forward national communicatio n including forward looking plans as early as possible and before 31 may 2011 in accordance with revised national communication principles and procedures in attachm ent xdecision xcp15 the plans will be updated every 2 year the parties will report as applicable on support received and support provided to developing countries for their actions in national comm unications comprehensive set of statis tics for climate change finance will be established enabling transparent monitoring of both provision of finance and supported climate actio ns financial flows from the international carbon market should be monitored and recognized separately to enhance and expand the scope of the review of inventories and national communications consultation procedure is established under the sbi the parties undertake such consultations on the basis of input prepared by newly established expert group on national communications that consider national communications including countries forward looking plans vii the copenhagen process 31 the parties underline their comm itment to immediate action pursuant to this agreem ent furthermore the parties decide to continue negotiations pursuant to decisions taken at cop13 and cop15 with view to agreeing on comprehensive legal fram ework under the convention later than copxx decide on review of comm itments and actions under the convention to be started in 2014 and completed in 2015 with view of enhancing commit ments and actions on mitigation and adaptation and climate finance to achiev the convention s ultimate objective and paragraph 2 and 3 above taking into account the conclusions of the fifth assessm ent report of ipcc will keep track of overall efforts with view to ensure full
