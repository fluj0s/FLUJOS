figures on the fy2003 defense budget part i provides basic data on the administrations fy2003 national defense budget request submitted on february 4 2002 it includes data on budget authority and outlays for the department of defense dod and for the national defense budget function function 050 part ii shows trends in overall defense spending in personnel levels and in military force structure it includes data showing the growth and decline of defense spending over time defense outlays as share of total federal expenditures and defense outlays as share of gross domestic product it also includes table showing military spending by foreign nations part iii defines key defense budget terms data showing long term spending trends can be interpreted in different ways for example while defense outlays are at historically low levels as percentage of total federal outlays this trend is more reflection of increases in federal entitlement programs notably the escalating costs of medicare and social security than decreases in defense spending also while defense outlays as percentage of gdp are at their lowest levels since world war ii in constant dollar terms they remain comparable to average peacetime defense outlays during the cold war most of the data used in this report are taken from annual budget documents prepared by the office of management and budget omb these data have several features that users of this report should be aware of first figures represent the administrations request to congress including requested changes in standing legislation such as this years request for changes in accounting for retirement benefits second omb sometimes adjusts figures for prior year budgets for purposes of comparison with proposed budgets and third the data show estimates of funding in years prior to the budget year fy2003 according to omb conventions for scoring of funding which may differ from those used by the congressional budget office or the department of defensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31349crs2 this year all of these features of the omb data have some quite significant effects on estimated and projected funding for defense and other parts of the budget major adjustments include 1 financing of benefits for military and civilian personnel on an accrual basis most federal retirement benefits including benefits for uniformed military personnel and dod civilian personnel have long been funded on the basis of accrual accounting in which the cost of future benefits for current employees is charged to the employing agency as the benefits are accrued under accrual accounting procedures federal agencies pay the actuarily determined cost of future benefits into trust fund payments to retirees are then charged to the fund not to the agency in the fy2003 and fy2004 defense budgets three substantial adjustments involving accrual accounting have large effect on reported budget totals these are accrual accounting for over65 health care benefits for uniformed personnel the fy2001 defense authorization act included provision known as tricareforlife that guarantees dodprovided health care to over65 military retirees and their dependents beginning in fy2003 these benefits are being funded on an accrual basis this results in 1 an increase of 81 billion in fy2003 in the military personnel accounts to reflect the accrual cost of future benefits for current uniformed personnel and 2 reduction of 56 billion in operation and maintenance accounts to reflect payment from the health care trust fund to dod for providing care to over65 retirees accrual accounting for all civilian personnel retirement pension and health benefits while most federal civilian retirement benefits are funded on an accrual basis small part is not now the administration is proposing to fund all retirement benefits on an accrual basis in fy2003 the proposed change results in an increase of 33 billion both in budget authority and in outlays in the department of defense budget accrual accounting for under65 health care benefits for uniformed personnel beginning in fy2004 the administration is also proposing to finance health care benefits for under65 military retirees on an accrual basis in which again dod would pay into trust fund the cost of future benefits for current employees and would receive reimbursement from the fund for costs of under65 retiree health care that it provides both the contributions to the fund and reimbursements from the fund are reflected in budget projections from fy2004 on 2 adjustment of prior year budget figures for accrual accounting omb has adjusted fy2001 and fy2002 figures though not figures for earlier years to be comparable to the new proposed treatment of civilian retirement and health benefits thus omb figures include 30 billion in fy2001 and 32 billion in fy2002 department of defense budget totals both in budget authority and in outlays for increased civilian retirement accrual even though this accounting procedure was not in place in those years 3 fiscal year scoring of fundin g provided by the emergency terrorism response supplemental appropriations act congress and the executive branchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31349crs3 sometimes count or score appropriations differently this year there are major differenc in how omb and the congressional budget office cbo show the allocation of funds provided in the emergency terrorism response supplemental appropriations measure that congress approved on september 14 2001 in all congress appropriated 40 billion for respond ing to the september 11 terrorist attacks including 20 billion that was made available to agencies after the president notified congress how the funds would be distributed and second 20 billion that was made available only after congress allocated the funds in subsequent appropriations act of the 40 billion total 175 billion was allocated to the defense department of which 140 billion was from the first 20 billion and 35 billion from the second 20 billion an additional 374 million was allocated to the department of energy for defenserelated activities of which 5 million came from the initial 20 billion and 369 million from the second these amounts are part of the national defense budget function cbo and omb differ in allocating these funds cbo scoring conventions cbo scores funds by fiscal year according to the date when congress makes funds available to the executive branch thus cbo allocates all of the initial 20 billion in supplemental funding to fy2001 when the original appropriation was enacted while it allocates all of the second 20 billion to fy2002 which is when congress approved subsequent appropriations measure distributing the funds among federal agencies under this convention cbo shows 140 billion of supplemental funds in the department of defense budget for fy2001 and 35 billion in the budget for fy2002 all in budget authority omb scoring conventi ons omb however normally allocates funds by fiscal year based on when the executive branch actually releases money to the agencies following that rule omb allocates 43 billion to dod in fy2001 because the president had sent two notifications to congress distributing that amount to dod before the end of the fiscal year on september 30 2001 omb allocates the 35 billion that congress provided for dod in the second 20 billion to fy2002 omb did not however include in either years dod budget the remaining 98 billion that was allocated to dod out of the initial 20 billion in supplemental funding instead omb shows those funds in the emergency response fund governmentwide account into which the funds were initially appropriated although omb released all but small amount of the initial 20 billion before the budget was released on february 4 it does not show funds released after september 30 2001 in agency totals this report relies primarily on omb data so the figures shown here follow
