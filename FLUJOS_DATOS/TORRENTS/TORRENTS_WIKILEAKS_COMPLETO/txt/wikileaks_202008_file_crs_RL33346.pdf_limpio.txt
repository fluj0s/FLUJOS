policy debate about how to struct ure the agencys budget and priorities the corps civil works program has been criticized by some observers as an agglomeration of projects with underl ying design these observers see the corps backlog of authorized activities as an example of this lack of focus estimates of the backlogs size vary from 11 billi on to more than 50 billion depending on which projects are included although some observers view the backlog as nothing more than corps to do list others are concerned that projects in the backlog face construction delays nd related cost overruns as ava ilable appropriations are spread across an increasing portfolio of projects the corps backlog of authorized pr ojects and concerns about the fiscal planning and management of the agencys portfolio contribute to support for performancebased criteria for structuring the agencys budget and for concentrated appropriations on small set of priority projects othe rs also express concerns about the agencys fiscal planning and manageme nt yet reject both th use of performance based criteria that have been proposed nd the focus on 8 to 10 priority projects these critics argue that the criteria used are too simplistic and that basing the corps budget on performance criteria does not produ ce an integrated multiyear program for the agency they also argue that the focus on priority projects has resulted in disproportionate amount of the agencys budget being concentrated on fewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33346crs6 1 for more information on the modified wat er deliveries project see

acceptably hazardous and economically uncompetitive under the administrations gnep initiative plutonium partially separated from the highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear reactors would be recycled into new fuel to expand the future supply of nucl ear fuel and potentially reduce the amount of radioactive waste to be disposed of in permanent repository the united states and other advanced nuclear nations would lease new fuel to ot her nations that agreed to forgo uranium enrichment spent fuel recyc ling also called repro cessing and other fuel cycle facilities that could be used to pr oduce nuclear weapons materials the leased fuel would then be returned to s upplier nations for repr ocessing solidified highlevel reprocessing waste would be nt back to the nation that had

initiative the nuclear energy programs advanced fuel cycle initiative afci was the primary component of gnep in the fy2007 budget request the 243 million budget request for afci constituted nearly all of the 250 million gnep program with the remaining 7 million requested for program direction according to the budget justificati on afci will develop and demonstrate nuclear fuel cycles that could reduce the longterm hazard of spent nuclear fuel and recover additional energy such technologies w ould involve separa tion of plutonium uranium and other longlived radioactive materials from spent fuel for reuse in nuclear reactor or for transmutation in particle accelerator most of the proposed afci funding would be for an engineer ingscale demonstration of separations technology called urex 155 million in wh ich uranium and other elements are chemically removed from dissolved spent fu leaving mixture of plutonium and other highly radioactive elements propone nts believe the proce ss is proliferation resistant because further purification would be required to make the plutoniumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33346crs17 useable for weapons and because its high radioactivity would make it difficult to divert or work with however the house appropriations committee expressed concern that more fundamental research on the urex pro cess was needed par ticularly on waste byproducts before moving ahead to the dem onstration phase as result the house passed energy and water f unding bill would have held the programs spending to 120 million but the senate appropriati ons committee calling gnep imperative for reducing nuclear waste and increasing energy supplies boosted afci funding by 36 million over the request as noted bove the spending plan provides 1675 million for the program removing uranium from spent fuel would eliminate most of the volume of spent nuclear fuel that would othe rwise require disposal in deep geologic repository which doe is developing at yucca mount ain nevada the urex process also would reduce the heat generated by nuclear waste the major limit on the repositorys capacity by removing cesium and strontium for separate storage and decay over several hundred years plutonium and other longlived elements would be fissioned in accelerators or fast reactor s such as the type under development by the generation iv program to reduce the l ongterm hazard of nuclear waste even if technically feasible however the economic viability of such waste processing has yet to be determined and it sti ll faces significant opposition on nuclear nonproliferation grounds nuclear hydrogen initiative in support of president bushs program to develop hydrogenfueled vehicles doe requested 187 million in fy2007 for the nuclear hydrogen initiative 25 reduc tion from

nuclear weapons complex reconfiguration in testimony before the house appropriations committees energy and water subcommittee in march 2004 the secretary of energy agreed to conduc t review of reconfiguring the nuclear weapons complex the complex the committees fy2005 energy and water report contained requirement for that study the committee was concerned about high costs the security of fissile material distributed among many sites and the size and age of the current complex task force of the secretary of energy advisory board released its final report in octobe r 2005 it recommended among other things having consolidated nuclear produc tion center that would make nuclear components such as those of uranium or plutonium for nuclear weapons and would assemble and dismantle nuc lear weapons the task force also recommended consolidating large quantities of uranium and plutonium at few sites and probably closing several current complex sites the house appropriations committee in its fy2007 report supported the task forces recommendations and rejected nnsas plan to modernize the current complex in place the co mmittee recommended 1000 million for transition planning site selection and preliminary design and development for consolidated nuclear production site for reliable replacement warheads and stockpile support the bill as passed by the house provided this sum nnsa had not requested funds for this purpose the senate appropriations committee did not recommend funds for this purpose and the doe operating plan did not include such funds directed stockpile work dsw

life extension program both by jonathan medalia although rrw is small program in relation to the total nnsa budget the house appropriations committee in its fy 2006 report on the energy and water bill viewed rrw as enabling large changes transitioning the nuclear weapons complex from large expensive cold war relic into smaller more efficient modern complex allowing longterm savings by phasing out the multiple redundant cold war warhead designs that require ma intaining multiple obsolete production technologies obviating any reason to move to provocative 18month test readiness posture by increasing warhead reliability and reducing the need to test permitting reduction in adva nced simulation and compu ting funds by redirecting them to current warhead maintenance programs pending initiation of rrw and supporting other changes and budget d ecisions the senate appropriations committees report stated that the recomme nded funding increase for rrw is to accelerate the planning development and design for comprehensive rrw strategy that improves the reliability longevity and certifiability of existing weapons and their components the conference report emphasi zed that rrw design work must stay within the military requirements of the existing deployed stockpile and that any design must stay within the design meters validated by past nuclear tests other goals that the conference report t for rrw were improving manufacturing practices reducing cost and increasing performance margins to support reduction in stockpile size further pl 10916 3 the fy2006 national defense authorization act section 3111 set seven objectives for the rrw program including to increase the reliability safety and secur ity of the united states nuclear weapons stockpile and to further reduce the likelihood of the resumption of underground nuclear weapons testing for fy2007 the administration requested 277 million for rrw in its fy2007 report the house appropria tions committee linked rrw with restructured smaller and consolidated nuclear weapons complex the committee supports the rrw but only if it is part of larger package of more comprehensive weapons complex reforms it reco mmended 527 million for rrw but restricted use of the additional 250 million until nnsa delivered an infrastructure plan to congress the committee also directed nns to have the jason defense advisory group conduct peer review of competing candidate rrw designs and to analyze the premise of rrw that new warhead can be designed and deployed without nuclear testing the committee called for the report to be submitted to congress the bill as passed by the house left these provisions unchanged also under dsw the committee 1 reduced the 2327 million request for warhead life extension programs by 800 million directed nnsa to terminate the life extension program for the w80 warhead for cruise missiles and used the funds to support weapons complex transformation and 2 increased funding for warhead dismantlement from 750 million to 1050 million to accelerate that activity the bill as passed by the house left these provisions unchanged the senate appropriations committee

manufacturing facility called ta 55 nnsas plan is that ta55 would be able to manufacture 10 pits per year by the end of fy2007 and 3040 by fy2012 but nnsa saw that capacity as insufficient to maintain the stockpile and has favored building mpf with capacity of perhaps 125 pits per year hr 2419 the fy2006 energy and water development appropriations bill as passed by the house eliminated mpf funds until capacity require ments tied to the longterm stockpile size are determined and until the longterm strategy for the physical infrastructure of the weapons complex has incorpor ated the reliable

recommended that amount the fy2007 operating plan included 2424 million for this activity the appropriate test readiness posture the time between presidential order to resume testing and the conduct of the test has been contentious the posture was set at 24 to 36 months several years ago with fears that it was in actuality 36 months or more the administration and cong ress sought to shorten it but there was dispute over how much nnsa and the armed services committees favored an 18 month posture on grounds that it would take th at long to prepare test but that any testing should not be delayed beyond that time in contrast the appropriations committees favored 24month posture on gr ounds that an 18month posture would be provocative and significantly mo re costly see crs report

security with 2814 milli on allotted for it in the request requested funding for the fissile ma terials disposition program for fy2006 was 6531 million but the congress appr opriated 4688 million the programs goal is disposal of us surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors including cons truction of facility to convert the plutonium to mixedoxide mox reactor fuel at savannah river south carolina and similar program in russia the house appropriations committee cut funding for the savannah river facility sharply citing delays in agreement with russia over the program total funding for fissile materials disposition in hr 2419 as passed by the house would have been 3017 million the senate version of the bill would have funded the program at th requested 6531 million level for fy2007 the administration noting that the issue that had delayed the program in russia had been resolved requested 6033 million however the house appropriations committee report said in 2006 it has become clear that the russian government is not going to participate in the moxlight water reactor plan that the united states has proposed and the hous epassed version of hr 5427 would have cut the funding drastically to 2480 million the move would have shut down the moxfuel construction pr oject at savannah river the senate appropriations committee likewise expressed disappointment that the russian government was not pursuing its program to convert surplus weapons plutonium to mox but supported the tinuation of the us program to convert its own surplus weapons plutonium to m ox with continued construction of the facility at savannah river the senate version of h r 5427 would have funded the fissile materials disposition prog ram at 6184 million 15

nuclear weapons is longstanding issue doe establis hed the office of environmental management in 1989 to consolidate its efforts to admin ister the cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites these efforts include the disposal of radioactiv and other hazardous wastes management and disposal of surplus nuclear materials the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated from such wa stes and the decontamination and decommissioning of excess buildings and facilities through this program doe also administers the disposal of wastes and re mediation of contamin ation at sites where the federal government conducted civilian nuclear energy research altogether therehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33346crs34 5 doe makes distinction between its geogra phic sites that represent entire facilities and the lands they occupy and the thousands of discrete contaminated sites located on each facility that have been or need to be cleaned up one of these geographic sites the waste isolation pilot plant in new mexico was constructed as repository to dispose of transuranic radioactive waste from other sites although this facility is not cleanup site its operation is essential to the cleanup of tran suranic waste at many sites where such waste is removed and prepared for permanent disposal offsite 6 see crs report rs21988 radioactive tank waste from th past production of nuclear weapons

and decommissioning fundwere 114 geographic5 sites in 30 states where these activities resulted in the generation of wastes and contamination some of the ongoing issues associated with efforts to clean up contaminated sites have been the adequacy of riskb ased approaches to cleanup the technical soundness of waste treatment facility designs how to safely remove treat and dispose of highlevel radioactiv waste stored in underground tanks6 the effectiveness and costsavings of incentiv ebased cleanup contracts and the pace and adequacy of cleanup overall the challe nges of the environmental management program to clean up nuclear waste and c ontamination are subs tantial and require significant resources as such this cl eanup program is the s econd largest function within doe after the national nuclear security administration and represents approximately onefour th of the departments total budget fy2007 appropriations as indicated in the table below does fy2007 operating plan allocates 619 billion for the environmental ma nagement program7 this funding level is more than the 583 billion that the president originally requested in february 2006 and more th an the 599 billion the full house approved in passing hr 5427 in the 109th congress and the 591 billion the senate appropriations committee reported in its ve rsion of that bill although does operating plan allocates an increase relativ to the funding originally proposed for fy2007 it provides less funding for the prog ram than the 659 billion that congress appropriated for fy2006 accounting for the use of prior year balances does plan indicates larger amount of funding was allocated in fy2006 for the defense environmental cleanup account resulting in greater decrease in fy2007 for the program when comparison is made to fy2006 funding including the use of these balances see the notes to the table below substantial portion of the reduction in funding for the program relative to fy2006 is due to the completion of cleanup at accelerated closur sites such as rocky flats in colorado despite the ove rall decrease does plan allocates over 100 million more for closure activities at rocky flats than any of the original proposals for fy2007 and more than twice th original proposals for administration of closure sites for sites where cleanup is not complete there are varying decreases and increases in funding when comparing does fy2007 operating plan to the presidents fy2007 request the fy2007 proposals considered in the 109th congress and the fy2006 appropriation s ites with some of the larg er differences in fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33346crs35 include those where substantial cleanup and waste disposal challenges remain such as hanford wa and sa vannah river sc both of which store highlevel radioactive waste in underground tanks as required by the nuclear waste policy act this waste must be removed for perm anent disposal in geologic repository the adequacy of funding to clean up hanf ord has been particul arly controversial for many reasons including potential risks from radioactive contamination migrating through groundwater into the columbia rive r and the delayed construction of the waste treatment and immobilization plant this facility is key element in does plans to treat the substantial volume of hi ghlevel radioactive waste to be removed from the underground tanks at hanford and to solidify that waste for permanent disposal in geologic repository this task is one of the more costly cleanup challenges across the complex of sites construction of the waste treatment and immobilization plant has been delayed as result of various engineering and design issues does fy2007 operating plan allocat significantly more funding for the waste plant than appropriated in fy2006 but allocates less funding than in fy2006 for the management of the waste still stored in the underground tanks the table below indicates the fy2006 appropriation the presidents

river 10 doe uses the term end state to denot the intended condition or land use of contaminated site once cleanup is complete termining the end state is critical to making cleanup decisions as the degree of cleanup re quired and the specific action to achieve that degree of cleanup are dependent on the potentia l pathways of human exposure that would occur as result of how the land will be used in the future land uses resulting in greater potential for human exposure generally require greater degree of cleanupestimated future funding needs the need for annual appropriations of several billion dollars to clean up nuclear waste sites has motivated ongoing concern within congress about the longterm financ ial liability of the united states to meet these needs accordingly there has been much debate about how to ensure public health and safety and the pr otection of the environment in the most expedient and costeffective manner doe reports that it had cleaned up 81 of the 114 geographic sites as of the end of fy20068 although doe has disposed of substantial quantities of waste and remediated many areas of c ontamination at the remaining sites much work remains to be done to complete cl eanup at many of them doe expects to complete cleanup at certain sites within the next few years however the department anticipates clea nup to continue for decades at the larger and more complex sites such as nford savannah rive r and the idaho national laboratory where highlevel radioactive waste is in need of treatment and disposal and soil and groundwater contamination is generally more severe based on recent assumptions doe expects cleanup and dispos of wastes to be comp lete at savannah river in 2031 at the idaho national laborator in 2035 and at hanford in 20429 accurately assessing the time and funding needed to complete cleanup and dispose of all radioactive nd other hazardous wastes is difficult at best developing reliable estimates is especially challenging for the larger more complex sites where many final decisions have yet to be made because of technical limitations and uncertainties such as the end state10 of many sites do periodically

program11 the 159 billion estimate is not adjusted for inflation and is in fy2006 dollars in addition to inflation other factors could cause actual costs to exceed the 159 billion estimate for example actual costs could be higher than expected depending on whether federal and state regulators may require more stringent and costlier cleanup actions than doe plans to take costs also could rise if initial cleanup actions prove inadequate to protect human health and th environment over the long term future performance of cleanup actions is especially critical for nuclear waste sites because of the rate of decay of radi oactivity which can be thousands of years depending on the particular radionuclide predicting the effectiveness of methods to contain radioactive wastes over such long periods of time is challenging if not impracticable in some cases consequently additional funding could be needed at sites where cleanup was thought to be complete if the initial cleanup proves inadequate over time does 159 billion estimate also does not include the costs of longterm care of sites once cleanup remedies are in place to ensure the protection of human health and the environment into the future does performance and accountability report for fy2006 estimated that as of the end of fy2006 18 billion would be needed for cleanup and postclosure site responsibi lities after work under the environmental management program is completed12 these responsibilities in clude surveillance and monitoring longterm operation and main tenance of soil and groundwater cleanup remedies and
