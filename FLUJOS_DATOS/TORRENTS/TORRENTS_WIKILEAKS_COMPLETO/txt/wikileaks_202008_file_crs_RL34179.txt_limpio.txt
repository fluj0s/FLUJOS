technologies and studying design options for planned new cruiser called the cgx the navy wants to procure 19 cgxs as replacements for its 22 existing ticonderoga cg47 class aegis cruisers the navy wants the cgx to be highly capable multimission ship with an emphasis on air defense and ballistic missile defense bmd the navy has not yet announced preferred design concept for the cgx observers were expecting the navy to announce preferred design concept in late 2007early 2008 but such an announcement is now expected to occur earlier than 2009 the navy originally intended to use the design

congresss decisions on this issue could affect navy capabilities and funding requirements us bmd capabilities and the us shipbuilding industrial base background context for cgx program the context for the cgx program includes the following concerns about the affordability of the navys shipbuilding program the emergence of the navys new bmd mission interest among some in congress in having the cgx be nuclear powered and concerns for the surface combatant industrial base affordability of navy shipbuilding program the navy currently faces challenges in being able to afford all the ships in its shipbuilding program particularly in fy2011 and subsequent years4 because the designs of most of the 3 continued cuts defensenewscom july 14 2008 stated that the cgx would be delayed until fy2015 or later see also geoff fein navy likely to change cgxs procurement schedule official says defense daily june 24 2008 rebekah gordon navy agrees cgx by fy11 wont happen but reveals little else inside the

crs3 ships in the navys shipbuilding program for the next several years are already determined the cgx is one of the navys relatively few remaining opportunities to use new ship design to manage the overall cost of the shipbuilding program new navy mission of ballistic missile defense bmd has emerged in recent years as significant new mission for the navy navy surface ships in coming years may face threat from antiship ballistic missiles asbms theaterrange ballistic missiles tbms equipped with maneuvering reentry vehicles marvs that are capable of hitting moving ships at sea kind of threat the navy has not previously faced5 navy bmd capabilities could also be used to defend allied or friendly ports airfields cities or forces ashore against enemy tbms or to defend the united states against enemy intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms6 the navys desire for the cgx to be highcapability bmd platform is principal reason why the navy wants the cgx to carry radar that is larger and more powerful than the spy1 radar on the navys current aegis cruisers and destroyers the size weight energy requirements and cooling requirements of this radar may help set lower limit for the size and cost of the cgx interest in nuclear power for surface ships representatives gene taylor and roscoe bartlett the chairman and ranking member respectively of the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee strongly support expanding the use of nuclear power to wider array of navy surface ships beginning with the cgx7 representative john murtha the

for surface combatant industrial base all cruisers destroyers and frigates procured by the navy since fy1985 have been built by either general dynamics bath iron works gdbiw in bath or the ingalls shipyard in pascagoula ms that forms part of northrop grumman ship shipbuilding ngsb10 the financial health of shipyards that build ships for the navy including these two yards has been matter of concern at various points since the early 1990s when the rate of navy shipbuilding was reduced following the end of the cold war the surface combatant industrial base also includes hundreds of additional firms that supply materials and components and the financial health of some of these firms has been matter of concern in recent years particularly because some of them are the sole sources for what they make for navy surface combatants cgx program in brief announcement of cgx program the cgx program was announced on november 1 2001 when the navy stated that it was launching future surface combatant program aimed at acquiring family of nextgeneration surface combatants this new family of surface combatants the navy stated would include three new classes of ships11 destroyer called the ddx later renamed the ddg1000 or zumwalt class for the precision longrange strike and naval gunfire mission12 cruiser called the cgx for the air defense and ballistic missile defense mission and 9 continued options for congress by ronald orourke 10 ngsb also includes the avondale shipyard near new orleans newport news shipbuilding of newport news va and compositemanufacturing facility at gulfport ms 11 the future surface combatant program replaced an earlier navy surface combatant acquisition effort begun in the mid1990s called the surface combatant for the 21st century sc21 program the sc21 program encompassed planned destroyer called dd21 and planned cruiser called cg21 when the navy announced the future surface combatant program in 2001 development work on the dd21 had been underway for several years but the start of development work on the cg21 was still years in the future the ddx program now called the ddg1000 or zumwaltclass program is essentially restructured continuation of the dd21 program the cgx might be considered the successor in planning terms of the cg21 the acronym sc21 is still used in the navys research and development account to designate the line item ie program element that funds development work on the ddg1000 and cgx 12 for more on the ddg1000 program see crs report rl32109 navy ddg1000 and ddg51 destroyer programs

potential cgx design features as mentioned earlier the navy has not yet announced preferred design concept for the cgx observers were expecting the navy to announce preferred design concept in late 2007early 2008 but such an announcement is now expected to occur earlier than 2009 the cgx is expected to feature radar that is larger and more powerful than the spy1 radar on the navys current aegis cruisers and destroyers or the dualband radar that is to be carried by the ddg1000 the navy testified in 2007 that the power requirement of the cgx combat system including the new radar could be about 30 or 31 megawatts compared with about 5 megawatts for the aegis combat crs7 system16 the cgx radars greater power is intended among other things to give the cgx more capability for bmd operations than navys aegis cruisers and destroyers or the ddg1000 for which bmd is not principal mission the cgx is expected to feature more missilelaunch tubes than the ddg1000 which has 80 and possibly more than the navys current aegis destroyers 90 or 96 each or aegis cruisers 122 each the cgx may be equipped with only one 155mm advanced gun system ags or none at all compared with two agss on the ddg51 two fiveinch 127mm guns on the navys aegis cruisers and one fiveinch gun on the navys aegis destroyers cgx analysis of alternatives aoa the navy assessed cgx design options including the option of nuclear power in study called the cgx analysis of alternatives aoa known more formally as the maritime air and missile defense of joint forces mamdjf aoa the cgx aoa was begun in mid 2006 and completed at the end of 2007 as of november 2008 the navy had not publicly released the results of the aoa the navy testified on march 14 2008 that the results of the navys analysis of alternatives aoa for the maritime air and missile defense of joint forces capability are currently within the navy staffing process resulting requirements definition and acquisition plans including schedule options and associated risks are being evaluated in preparation for cgx milestone planned to occur in fy 2008 this process includes recognition of the requirement of the fy 2008 national defense authorization act that all major combatant vessels of the untied states navy strike forces be constructed with an integrated nuclear power plant unless the secretary of defense determines this not to be in the best interest of the united states17 original preference for cgx design based on ddg1000 the navy originally intended to use ddg1000 hull design as the basis for the cgx design18 16 source spoken testimony of navy officials to the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee march 1 2007 17 statement of vice admiral barry mccullough deputy chief of naval operations for integration of capabilities and resources and ms allison stiller deputy assistant secretary of the navy ship programs before the subcommittee on seapower and expeditionary forces of the house armed services committee hearing on navy force structure and shipbuilding march 14 2008 p 9 18 for example at an april 5 2006 hearing navy admiral in charge of shipbuilding programs when asked what percentage of the cgx design would be common to that of the ddg1000 stated that we havent defined cgx in way to give you crisp answer to that question because there are variations in weapons systems and sensors to go with that but were operating under the belief that the hull will fundamentally be continued crs8 the potential for reusing the ddg1000 hull design for the cgx was one of the navys arguments for moving ahead with the ddg1000 program it is longer clear however that reusing the ddg1000 hull design as the basis for the cgx is still the navys preferred approach july 2 2008 letter from john young the department of defense dod acquisition executive the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics to representative gene taylor the chairman of the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee stated i agree that the navys preliminary design analysis for the next generation cruiser indicates that for the most capable radar suites under consideration for the cgx the ddg1000 hull design cannot support the radar19 it is not clear that the ddg1000 can accommodate onehalf of the twinreactor plant that the navy has designed for its new gerald r ford cvn78 class nuclearpowered aircraft carriers20 if the ddg1000 hull cannot accommodate onehalf of the fordclass plant then the navy might face choice of either designing new hull for the cgx that can accommodate onehalf of the fordclass plant or designing new reactor plant that can fit into the ddg1000 hull 18 continued the hull mechanical and electrical piece of cgx will be the same identical as ddx so the infrastructure that supports radar and communications gear into the integrated deckhouse would be the same fundamental structure and layout i believe to accommodate the kinds of technologies cgx is thinking about arraying youd probably get 60 to 70 percent of the ddx hull and integrated inaudible common between ddx and cgx with the variation being in that last 35 percent for weapons and that sort of thing the big difference between cgx and ddg1000 will likely be the size of the arrays for the radars the numbers of communication apertures in the integrated deckhouse little bit of variation in the cic combat information center in other words the command and control center and likely some variation in how many launchers of missiles you have versus the guns source transcript of spoken testimony of rear admiral charles hamilton ii program executive officer for ships naval sea systems command before the projection forces subcommittee of house armed services committee april 5 2006 the inaudible comment may have been reference to the ddg1000s integrated electricdrive propulsion system between the two paragraphs quoted above the questioner representative gene taylor asked so the big difference between cgx and ddg1000 will be what 19 letter dated july 2 2008 from john young to representative taylor p 1 20 for more on the cvn78 program see crs report rs20643 navy ford cvn78 class aircraft carrier program background and issues for congress by ronald orourke crs9 july 2007 press report on aoa july 23 2007 defense trade press report stated that analysts conducting the cgx aoa were considering dividing the cgx program into two groups of ships 14 smaller conventionally powered cgxs based on the 14500ton ddg1000 hull design for aaw operations and 5 larger nuclearpowered cgnxs21 displacing 23000 tons to 25000 tons each for bmd operations the report stated under pressure from the us navy to develop new cruiser based on the ddg 1000 zumwaltclass hull form and from congress to incorporate nuclear power group of analysts working on the next big surface combatant may recommend two different ships to form the cgx program one ship would be 14000ton derivative of the ddg 1000 an escort cruiser to protect aircraft carrier strike groups the vessel would keep the tumblehome hull of the ddg 100022 and its gas turbine power plant the other new cruiser would be much larger 25000ton nuclearpowered ship with more conventional flared bow optimized for the ballistic missile defense bmd mission in all five large cgnx ships and 14 escort cruisers would be built to fulfill the cruiser requirement in the navys 30year 313ship plan which calls for replacing todays cg 47 ticonderogaclass aegis cruisers and adding specially designed seabased missile defense force the analysis group is said to be firm in its recommendation for the smaller escort cruiser details are less developed on the nuclearpowered variant sources said the article also stated the antimissile cruiser also wouldnt require the high level of stealth provided by the zumwalts tumblehome hull analysts said since the ship would be radiating its radars to search for missiles returning to more conventional flaredbow hull form would free designers from worries about overloading the untried tumblehome hull there will be great reluctance to use the wavepiercing tumblehome hull form for the larger ship said one experienced naval engineer he noted the ddg 1000 stealth requirement is necessary for the ships ability to operate in waters near coastlines but that the openocean region where bmd ship would operate means you dont need to go to the extremes of the tumblehome form splitting the cgx into two designs also makes political sense sources said 21 if the ship is nuclearpowered its designation would become cgnx with the n standing for nuclear power 22 tumblehome hull slopes inward as it rises up from the waterline tumblehome hull is thought to be less visible to enemy radars than conventional flared hull which slopes outward as it rises up from the waterline creating corner reflector between the water and the hull that can strongly reflect enemy radar beams crs10 theres concern that the ddg hull has stability problems and doesnt have growth margin said congressional source nuclearpowered option the source said also would placate congress and cashstrapped navy wouldnt be fully committed to nuclear ship the nuclear ship also would need to be larger than the ddg 1000 in separate statements navy officials have been hinting that 20000tonplus ship could be in the works sources said early analyses of the cgnx showed 25000ton ship which the navy said was too large more realistic one source said would be about 23000 tons23 october 2007 press report on aoa an october 29 2007 defense trade press report on the cgx aoa stated study refining the definition of the future cgx cruiser was recently completed and will be vetted by navy officials in the near future top shipbuilding official said here last week rear adm bernard mccullough the navys director of warfare integration n8f told inside the navy on oct 24 that the analysis of alternatives aoa for the new cruiser recommends about four variants one of those options calls for splitting the ship program and building two different size hulls for the surface combatant one based on the ddg1000 destroyer and one that is larger he confirmed theres about four options and thats one of the options mccullough told inside the navy at an expeditionary warfare conference in panama city fl the analysis conducted by researchers at the center for naval analyses will be briefed out to navy leadership starting in about another two weeks mccullough said 23 christopher p cavas us may build 25000ton cruiser analysis of alternatives sees nuclear bmd vessel defense news july 23 2007 the article also stated according to sources the aoa looked at two possible nuclear powerplants based on existing designs doubling the singlereactor seawolf ssn 21 submarine plant and halving tworeactor nuclear carrier plants doubling the 34 megawatts of the seawolf plant would leave the new ship far short of power requirements and not even match the 78 megawatts of the zumwalts but halving the 209megawatt plant of current nuclear carriers would yield bit more than 100 megawatts enough juice for powerhungry bmd radars plus an extra measure for the navys desired future directedenergy weapons and railguns crs11 further navy analysis of the aoa will examine the lifecycle and acquisition costs of the options mccullough said the navys surface warfare directorate will then make presentation to officials including navy secretary donald winter he said24 january 2008 press report on aoa january 21 2008 defense trade press report on the cgx aoa stated navy staff members are in the midst of answering chief of naval operations adm gary rougheads questions on lengthy study of options for the configuration of the services next cruiser naval officials told inside the navy rear adm victor guillory director of surface warfare n86 described the analysis of alternatives aoa on the future cgx as roughly 500page document that includes collection of options of analysis from various sources into aspects of the nextgeneration cruiser the cgx analysis delivered last year by the center for naval analyses cna which navy and industry sources said describes handful of possible variants for the ship including nuclearpowered vessel is just part of what is now the cgx aoa guillory told itn inside the navy jan 15 at the surface navy associations snas annual symposium in arlington va guillory said the current aoa does not include specific options that this is one version of the ship this is another version the options are the next level down he said so what are all the potential propulsion options for the ship then you look at the combat systems level you look at the weapons level you look at the manning level you look at the shoreinfrastructuresupport level roughead has not made determination that the analysis satisfies all his questions so were still answering questions guillory said lot of those questions dont require cnas input because they are questions navy staff has to answer he added there may be questions related to some other aspect of the navy guillory said for instance how will cgx impact our replenishment ships do we need more oilers thats not necessarily cgx question but it is navy question vice adm bernard mccullough deputy chief of naval operations for integration of capabilities and resources said there has been one briefing session on the cgx aoa with roughead in recent weeks were briefing the study report to cno mccullough told itn on jan 16 in brief interview at the sna conference weve had one session with him i imagine it will take couple more 24 emelie rutherford analysis of alternatives for future cgx cruiser completed inside the navy october 29 2007 crs12 mccullough added one would expect the service chief to have questions on an investment of the magnitude of the new cruiser the report also stated guillory said navy staff will continue to answer rougheads questions on the aoa until further notice until we satisfy all of his questions theres timetable for when he has to be satisfied he can continue to ask questions forever guillory said at some point then they will be passed over to the secretary of the navy the secretariat side for their approval and then forwarding on to the office of the secretary of defense who ultimately is the receiver of the analysis of alternatives guillory said the aoa is lot to read and that it is his responsibility to make that discussion palatable at every level for roughead while parts of the aoa are made up of the cnas analysis guillory said the document also includes work by naval sea systems command and other entities such as laboratories there are lot of sources of information that go into this body of work he said nuclear power is one of many options for the cgx propulsion system with other alternatives including steam sail marine gas turbine and diesel guillory said and then every aspect of that not only how much it costs to build one but then to maintain one he said does it take more people for nuclear ship than it does for gas turbine ship whats the lifecycle cost of that roughead told sna conference attendees on jan 15 that nuclear power is being weighed for the cgx i believe as we look to the future and you look at cgx to go down that path and not be examining nuclear power given what that power can produce for us operationally but also looking at the realities of the future we have to take that into account and put that into our calculus roughead said as we look to the future we have to be considering it the cno added if you look around the country there are lot of other people that are considering nuclear power as well 25 september 2008 press report on aoa september 29 2008 press report states the first part of the closely held and long overdue analysis of alternatives for the navys nextgeneration cruiser cgx was submitted recently to senior 25 emelie rutherford navy staff answering cnos questions on nextgen cruiser analysis inside the navy january 21 2008 crs13 pentagon leaders and the second part will be submitted in the next few months according to the navys top programmer the first part of the study which examined radar sensitivity analysis the number of missiles the ship needs to carry and what various hull forms would work for these requirements was submitted to the office of the secretary of defense earlier this month vice adm barry mccullough told inside the navy in an interview last week the second part which addresses the propulsion system remains under review by navy secretary donald winter and chief of naval operations adm gary roughead he added the secretary and the cno continue to review the studies and i would hope in the next couple of months we would come to the resolution on which alternative of the many included in the study the navy will choose mccullough explained that will include the initial radar capability missile capacity hull type and propulsion type so we would have recommended material solution he added the surface combatant tailored for integrated air and missile defense is intended to replace the cg47 class cruiser the navys analysis of alternatives for the new cruiser was supposed to be completed in fiscal year 2007 but that deadline slid because service leaders said more time was needed to review requirements the navy did not budget cgx hull in its current program objective memorandum 2010 pom10 submitted to osd last month and currently under review mccullough said last week originally the navy wanted to build the first new cruiser in fy11 but recently service leaders have acknowledged that date is longer feasible to reach we dont see cgx commencing within the current budget plans through fy15 mccullough said last week its got to do with technology development of both the radars and propulsion and to get the risk to moderate or below we dont see how we can bring all those things together within pom1026 october 2008 press report on aoa an october 27 2008 press report states that study that will inform the navys requirements for the cgx remains under close wraps with senior navy and pentagon leadership the navys analysis of alternatives for the new cruiser was supposed to be completed in fiscal year 2007 but that deadline slid because service leaders said more time was needed to review requirements 26 zachary m peterson part one of overdue cgx aoa sent to osd second part coming soon inside the navy september 29 2008 crs14 the first part of the cgx study which examined radar sensitivity analysis the number of missiles the ship needs to carry and what various hull forms would work for these requirements was submitted to the office of the secretary of defense in september vice admiral barry mccullough told inside the navy the second part which addresses the propulsion system remains under review by navy secretary donald winter and chief of naval operations adm gary roughead he added navy spokesman lt clay doss confirmed the status of the document had not changed at press time oct 24 the secretary and the cno continue to review the studies and i would hope in the next couple of months we would come to the resolution on which alternative of the many included in the study the navy will choose mccullough explained that will include the initial radar capability missile capacity hull type and propulsion type so we would have recommended material solution he added27 november 2008 press report on aoa november 2008 magazine article states that at this time two cgx designs are being proposed 6 small ships and 13 large ships the former could be an improved arleigh burke ddg51 class destroyer with hull plug inserted for additional verticallaunch missile cells the number of hulls being mentioned may indicate that the restarted ddg51 program could become the cgx the proposed 13 large ships would be of new design originally these were to make use of the tenyearplus 13 billionplus investment in developing the ddg1000 design but the tumblehome hull shape of the ddg1000 has been rejected for the large cruisers while congress has directed that the ships have nuclear propulsion rough procurement cost estimate of almost 9 billion for nuclearpowered version of the lead ship has been mentioned28 another november 2008 press report on aoa november 17 2008 press report states that the first half of the tightlyheld cgx nextgeneration cruiser analysis of alternatives remains under review by senior office of the secretary of defense officials navy leaders tell inside the navy itn the finished portion of the aoa addresses what type of radar the navy will require on its future surface combatant service officials have stressed the importance of determining the radar type before moving ahead with deciding what the best hull type and propulsion system are for the new cruiser the radar is very significant driver of the hull requirement navy secretary donald winter told reporters aboard his plane nov 8 returning to 27 zachary m peterson navy awards technology company 128 million contract for cgx work inside the navy october 27 2008 28 norman polmar still adrift us naval institute proceedings november 2008 88 crs15 washington after the commissioning ceremony for lcs1 the navys first littoral combat ship in milwaukee wi when the decision will be made remains uncertain i wish i did but i really dont know when decision about the radar on cgx will be made allison stiller deputy assistant secretary of the navy research development and acquisition for ships told itn in an interview last week cgx is very important and the most important part of it is the radar stiller noted then you figure out the ship youre going to host the radar on all options are open for the hull type she said but the critical piece is the radar technology i dont know if itll be an existing hull form or new hull form stiller said29 oversight issues for congress navy delay in announcing preferred design concept one potential oversight issue for congress on the cgx program concerns the navys delay in announcing preferred design concept for the ship potential oversight questions for congress include the following why is the navy taking so long to announce preferred design concept for the cgx what information does the navy lack at this point for making decision on this issue has the navy simply decided to defer announcing preferred design concept until the change in administration next year if so why has the navy not stated this openly procurement date for lead ship second potential oversight issue for congress concerns the navys reported plan to defer the procurement of the lead cgx from fy2011 to fy2017 if procurement of the lead cgx is deferred to fy2017 potential oversight questions for congress include the following 29 zachary m peterson cgx study remains under wraps radar requirement being reviewed inside the navy november 17 2008 crs16 how might such deferral affect other navy program areas such as destroyer procurement30 how might such deferral affect the navys ability to meet projected operational challenges in future years accuracy of navy cost estimate cbo believes that the navy is substantially underestimating ddg1000 procurement costs31 and consequently is also substantially underestimating likely cgx procurement costs cbo reported in june 2008 that it believes the first two cgxs would cost roughly twice as much as the navy estimates and that the average unit cost for all 19 cgxs would be about 40 more than the navy estimated in 2007 cbo also believes that its own cost estimates for the cgx may prove to be too low cbo reported in june 2008 that cbos estimates for the first two ships of the class are about double the navys estimates cbo assumed that the cgx would use the same hull as the ddg1000 the navys budget estimates for the 2011 and 2013 cruisers are based on the same assumption the navy expects those ships to cost 28 billion and 25 billion in constant fy2009 dollars respectively the navy last year conducted an analysis of alternatives aoa to determine what capabilities the cgx should have results of that analysis have not yet been released but version of the cgx built using the ddg1000 hull is only one of the options considered in the aoa the navy says that it is studying other options that would be larger and more capable than cgx built using the ddg1000 hull including ships that use nuclear propulsion the navy does not appear to be considering ship smaller than the ddg1000 as the basis for the cgx any design that is larger is likely to be substantially more expensive than the ddg1000 using the ddg51 as an analogy cbo estimates that the lead cgx would cost 52 billion in constant fy2009 dollars the average cost for each ship in that class would be about 42 billion in constant fy2009 dollars assuming that the cgx is conventionally powered and uses the ddg1000 hull cbo also assumed that consistent with the ddg1000 program two shipyards would build the cgxs moreover cbos estimate for the cost of the cgx may be optimistic the last time the navy reused hull design for new class of surface combatants was in the 1970s when the service built the spruance class destroyers and ticonderoga class cruisers both ship classes shared the same hull design but were intended for different missions the spruances were generalpurpose destroyers used to escort other navy ships in the event of war and were designed in particular for antisubmarine warfare the ticonderoga class cruisers incorporated the aegis antiair combat system the spy1 radar and surfacetoair missiles to counter the threat to navy carrier battle groups posed by soviet naval 30 for more on this issue see crs report rl32109 navy ddg1000 and ddg51 destroyer programs background oversight issues and options for congress by ronald orourke 31 congressional budget office resource implications of the navys fiscal year 2009 shipbuilding plan june 9 2008 pp 2023 crs17 aviation reflecting its more complex combat systems the cost per thousand tons of the lead ticonderoga was more than 60 percent higher than the cost of the lead spruance notwithstanding their many common hull features and mechanical systems32 cbo also reported that building future nuclear cruiser cgnx would probably cost more than the congressional budget office or the navy has currently estimated for conventionally powered cgx navy report on the costeffectiveness of nuclear propulsion estimates that the additional cost to install that capability in conventionally powered surface combatant would be approximately 700 million if cgnx had to be much larger than the ddg1000 there would probably be additional costs press reports have indicated that cgnx could displace as much as 23000 to 25000 tons or 60 percent to 70 percent more than the ddg1000 large ship might be necessary for example if the navy were to use for the cgnx one of the reactors now used in the cvn78 class of aircraft carrier according to the navy that reactors size weight and supporting systems could not be accommodated within hull the size of the ddg1000 if that proved to be the case the larger nuclearpowered cgnx could cost much more than the ddg100033 cbo also reported that the relatively simple design of the lcs and the substantial cost increases that have occurred in the program suggest that the navy may also have trouble meeting its cost targets for the larger much more complex surface combatants in its shipbuilding plan such as the ddg1000 and the cgx34 nuclear power major issue for the cgx program is whether some or all cgxs should be nuclearpowered as mentioned in the background section the chairman and ranking member of the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee strongly support making the cgx nuclear powered ship and the chairman of the defense subcommittee of the house appropriations committee has referred to the cgx as nuclearpowered ship as also mentioned earlier section 1012 of the fy2008 defense authorization act hr 4986pl 110181 of january 28 2008 makes it us policy to construct the major combatant ships of the navy including the cgx with integrated nuclear power systems unless the secretary of defense submits notification to congress that the inclusion of an integrated nuclear power system in given class of ship is not in the national interest the conference report on pl 110181 contained extensive report language relating to section 1012 see appendix 32 ibid p 23 33 ibid p 24 box 1 34 ibid p 27 crs18 the navy reported to congress in january 2007 that equipping notional ship broadly like the cgx with nuclear power plant instead of conventional ie fossilfuel power plant would other things held equal increase the unit procurement cost of followon ships in the class by about 600 million to 700 million in constant fy2007 dollars the report concluded that if oil prices in coming years are high much or all of the increase in unit procurement cost could be offset over the ships service life by avoided fossilfuel costs nuclearpowered cgx would be more capable than corresponding conventionally powered version because of the mobility advantages of nuclear propulsion which include for example the ability to make longdistance transits at high speeds in response to distant contingencies without need for refueling navy officials have also stated that nuclear power plant might be appropriate for the cgx in light of the high energy requirements of the cgxs powerful bmd capable radar35 for more on the issue of nuclear power for navy surface ships see crs report rl33946 navy nuclearpowered surface ships background issues and options for congress by ronald orourke technical risk the cgx is to use many new technologies being developed for the ddg 1000 the navy is now working to retire the technical risks associated with these technologies so that they will be ready for installation on the two lead ddg1000s which were procured in fy200736 potential key technical risk specific to the cgx program concerns its powerful new bmdcapable radar the need to reduce technical risk in the cgx radar may be one reason why the navy reportedly plans to defer procurement of the lead cgx from fy2011 to fy2017 november 29 2007 press article reported 35 see for example the comments of rear admiral kevin mccoy at june 25 2007 conference in arlington va sponsored by the american society of naval engineers asne news article reporting mccoys remarks stated in part mccoy has cautioned that the navys alternate propulsion study submitted to congress in january 2007 is not specific recommendation for using nuclear propulsion for the cgx cruisers which are intended to perform missile defense really the issue ill tell you is not so much about the power plant but its about the mission mccoy said june 25 and if you think the mission is sitting off hostile coast looking for bmd type mission for onebeam cycles on the big highpowered radar were talking the radar is costing in the 30 megawatts range then alternatives like nuclear power start to come in emelie rutherford despite hill pressure navy noncommittal on nuclear power for cgx inside the navy july 2 2007 36 for more on technical risks in the ddg1000 program see crs report rl32109 op cit crs19 that rear admiral alan hicks the director of the aegis ballistic missile defense bmd program cautioned that the navy shouldnt attempt to go with radically advanced radar for cg x at least not initially rather he said it might be wiser to go with incremental upgrades steadily improving radar technology on the future cruiser that will take shape in the next decade just as the existing aegis system on cruisers and destroyers today has been upgraded steadily over two decades lots of people want to build this incredible radar hicks said on the one hand he sees that as valid eventual goal but i do believe you need to get there in stepped function jumping to radar that is three generations ahead in one leap is going to be terribly challenging and may drive costs skyward imperiling the need to make cg x affordable he said so we need to be very careful how we get riskreduction package to get to that cruiser perhaps by using existing radar technology as base to help reduce that development risk he said pointing to the success of the aegis modernization program37 hull design in addition to the issue of nuclear power another shipdesign issue for the cgx is whether the ship should use the ddg1000s tumblehome hull or some other hull potential alternative hulls include existing hulls such as the ddg51 hull and the lpd17 amphibious ship hull both of which are conventional flared hulls or new flared hull design tumblehome hull with its reduced radar detectability is viewed as useful for accomplishing the ddg1000s mission of using its 155mm guns to strike targets ashore mission that could require the ddg1000 to operate fairly close to enemy shorebased radars some observers believe that hull with reduced detectability is less critical for the cgx because the cgxs aaw and bmd missions might not require it to approach enemy shores as closely and because the energy radiating from the ships powerful bmdcapable radar will in any event provide enemy sensors with an indication of the ships location other observers might argue that even if ships location is known hull with reduced detectability can improve the ships ability to evade or to use decoys to confuse the homing devices in enemy antiship cruise missile and torpedoes or the fusing mechanisms in enemy mines even if the cgx does not require the reduced radar detectability of tumblehome hull reusing the ddg1000s tumblehome hull for the cgx might still have economic advantages in terms of avoiding the cost of designing new hull which could easily be in the hundreds of millions of dollars and taking advantage of production learningcurve efficiencies achieved from earlier construction of ddg 1000s designing new hull would incur hulldesign costs and sacrifice the opportunity to take advantage of ddg1000 production learningcurve benefits on the other hand newdesign hull might more easily accommodate the power plant 37 dave ahearn large number of aegis ships would be needed to shield europe admiral defense daily november 29 2007 crs20 and combat system desired for the cgx and be designed with the latest features for reducing its production cost one option for making the cgx nuclearpowered ship would be to equip it with onehalf of the new twinreactor plant that the navy has designed for its new ford cvn78 class aircraft carriers38 reusing the fordclass reactor plant would avoid the costs of developing new reactor plant for the cgx cost that could exceed 1 billion39 as mentioned earlier the ddg1000 hull or an enlarged version of the ddg51 hull might be too small to easily accommodate onehalf of fordclass plant at least not without making changes to the plant using onehalf of the fordclass plant without making changes to it might require designing new hull that is larger than the ddg1000 hull if so then using onehalf of the ford class plant would pose tradeoff between avoided reactor plant design costs and additional hulldesign costs unit affordability vs unit capability issues such as the question of nuclear power and the ships hull design form part of more general potential general oversight issue for congress concerning whether the navy has achieved the best balance in the cgx design between unit affordability and unit capability as mentioned in the background section the cgx is one of the navys relatively few remaining opportunities to use new ship design to manage the overall cost of the navys shipbuilding program navy officials are aware of this but they also want the cgx to be capable of performing certain intended missions including the bmd mission that drives the need for the cgx to carry large and powerful new radar navy officials are seeking design solution for the cgx that represents the best balance between unit affordability and unit capability achieving such balance is longstanding challenge in ship design concerns about the potential affordability of the cgx have been reinforced by the experience with ddg1000 which turned out to be much more expensive than originally envisaged the navy originally planned total of 16 to 24 ddg1000s and sustaining procurement rate of two ddg1000s per year due in part to the ships cost this was reduced to total of 7 ddg1000s to be procured at rate of about one ship per year subsequently on july 31 2008 navy officials testified that the service wants to stop ddg1000 procurement ships and restart ddg51 procurement affordability considerations may have played role in the navys decision40 dualdesign solution for the cgx program such as the one reportedly considered in the cgx aoa see background section is one possible strategy for striking balance between affordability and capability in the cgx program 38 for more on the fordclass program see crs report rs20643 navy ford cvn78 class cvn21 aircraft carrier program background and issues for congress by ronald orourke 39 the estimated development cost of the fordclass plant is roughly 15 billion 40 for discussion see crs report rl32109 op cit crs21 dualdesign solution could permit the navy and congress to respond to changes in the strategic or budgetary environment by altering the numbers of smaller and larger cgxs to be procured41 bmd impact on cgx numbers and schedule an additional potential oversight issue for congress concerns the possible effect of the bmd mission on the required number of cgxs and the schedule for procuring cgxs the currently planned total of 19 cgxs reflects in part certain assumptions about the navys future role in us bmd operations the navys future in us bmd operations however has not yet been fully defined it is possible that as the role becomes better defined the total required number of cgxs could change42 related question is whether the schedule for procuring cgxs is properly aligned with foreigncountry ballistic missile development programs 2005 defense trade press report for example states that navy officials project that china could field tbms capable of hitting moving ships at sea by about 201543 once cgx procurement were to begin it might be possible to accelerate the procurement dates of later ships in the program so as to get more of the ships in service sooner in situation of constrained navy funding however accelerating procurement of cgxs to earlier years could leave less funding available in those years for meeting other navy needs 41 dualdesign solution might also be viewed as reminiscent of the socalled highlow mix approach that was adopted in the 1970s and 1980s for the procurement of navy surface combatants and air force fighters the highlow mix approach involved procuring mix of morecapable moreexpensive platforms the high end of the mix and lesscapable lessexpensive platforms the low end in the 1970s and 1980s the navy procured nuclearpowered cruisers and aegis cruisers as its highend ships and spruance dd963 class destroyers and oliver hazard perry ffg7 class frigates as its lowend ships the air force procured f15s as its highend fighters and f16s as its lowend fighters the air force today might be viewed as again implementing highlow mix approach through its planned procurement of combination of highend f22 fighters and moreaffordable f35 joint strike fighters jsfs the capability ratio of 23000 to 25000ton nuclear powered cgx relative to that of 14000ton conventionally powered cgx might not necessarily be the same as that of the 1970s1980s highend surface combatants relative to the 1970s1980s lowend surface combatants or of the f15 relative to the f16 or of the f22 relative to the f35 the merits of the highlow mix approach as strategy for balancing unit capability against unit affordability have been debated on and off for years 42 for more on this issue see crs report rl33745 seabased ballistic missile defense background and issues for congress by ronald orourke 43 yihong chang and andrew koch is china building carrier janes defence weekly august 17 2005 the article states that navy officials project that such missiles could be capable of targeting us warships from sometime around 2015 2007 press report states that another observer believes that marvequipped version of chinas css6 tbm may be close to initial operational status bill gertz inside the ring washington times july 20 2007 6 item entitled new chinese missiles the article stated that it was reporting information from forthcoming report on chinas military from the international assessment and strategy center authored by richard fisher crs22 industrialbase implications the question of whether some or all cgxs should be nuclearpowered has significant potential implications for the surface combatant industrial base because the two shipyards that have built all the navys cruisers and destroyers in recent years gdbiw and the ingalls yard that forms part of ngsb are not licensed to build nuclearpowered ships44 the only two us shipyards currently licensed to build nuclearpowered ships for the navy are newport news shipbuilding of newport news va part of ngsb which builds nuclearpowered surface ships and submarines and general dynamics electric boat division gdeb of groton ct and quonset point ri which builds nuclearpowered submarines these two yards have built every nuclearpowered ship procured for the navy since fy1969 there are at least three potential approaches for building nuclearpowered cgxs build them at newport news with gdeb possibly contributing to the construction of the ships nuclear portions license gdbiw andor ingalls to build nuclearpowered ships and then build the cgxs at those yards build the nuclear portions of the cgxs at newport news andor gdeb the nonnuclear portions at gdbiw andor ingalls and perform final assembly integration and test work for the ships at either newport news andor gdeb or gdbiw andor ingalls these options have significant potential implications for workloads and employment levels at each of these shipyards on the question of what would be needed to license ingalls andor gdbiw to build nuclearpowered ships the director of naval reactors nr the office in charge of the navys nuclear propulsion program testified in march 2007 that just the basics of what it takes to have nuclearcertified yard to build one from scratch or even if one existed once upon time as it did at pascagoula and we shut it down first and foremost you have to have the facilities to do that 44 gdbiw has never built nuclearpowered ships and has never been licensed to do so the ingalls yard within ngss built nuclearpowered submarines until the early 1970s but is longer licensed to build nuclearpowered ships ingalls built 12 nuclearpowered submarines the last being the parche ssn683 which was procured in fy1968 entered service in 1974 and retired in 2005 ingalls also overhauled or refueled 11 nuclearpowered submarines ingallss nuclear facility was decommissioned in 1980 crs23 what that includes and i have just some notes here but such things as you have to have the docks and the drydocks and the pier capability to support nuclear ships whatever that would entail you would have to have lifting and handling equipment cranes that type of thing construction facilities to build the special nuclear components and to store those components and protect them in the way that would be required the construction facilities would be necessary for handling fuel and doing the fueling operations that would be necessary on the ship those types of things and then the second piece is and probably the harder piece other than just kind of the brickandmortar type is building the structures the organizations in place to do that work for instance nuclear testing specialized nuclear engineering nuclear production work if you look for instance at northrop grumman newport news right now just to give you perspective of the people you are talking about in those departments it is on the order of 769 people in nuclear engineering 308 people in the major lines of control department 225 in nuclear quality assurance and then almost 2500 people who do nuclear production work so all of those would have to be you would have to find that workforce certify and qualify them to be able to do that45 the director of nr testified that newport news and gdeb have sufficient capacity to accommodate nuclearpowered surface ship construction and therefore there is need to make the substantial investment in time and dollars necessary to generate additional excess capacity46 in light of this the navy testified only the first and third options above are viable47 the director of nr testified that my view of this is we have some additional capacity at both electric boat and at northrop grumman newport news my primary concern is if we are serious about building another nuclearpowered warship new class of warship cost is obviously going to be some degree of concern and certainly this additional costs which would be and i dont have number to give you right now but i think you can see it would be substantial to do it even if you could it probably doesnt help our case to move down the path toward building another nuclearpowered case when we have the capability existing already in those existing yards48 with regard to the third option of building the nuclear portions of the ships at newport news andor gdeb and the nonnuclear portions at ingalls andor gdbiw the navy testified that the location of final ship erection would require additional analysis one navy official however expressed potential preference 45 spoken

subcommittee of the house armed services committee march 1 2007 crs24 for performing final assembly integration and test work at newport news or gdeb stating that we are building warships in modular sections now so if we were going to ask could you assemble this ship could you build modules of this ship in different yards and put it together in nuclearcertified yard the answer is yes definitely and we do that today with the virginia class submarine program as you know we are barging modules of that type of submarine up and down the coast what i would want is and sort of following along with what nr director admiral kirkland donald said you would want the delivering yard to be the yard where the reactor plant was built tooled and tested because they have the expertise to run through all of that nuclear work and test and certify the ship and take it out on sea trials but the modules of the nonreactor plant which is the rest of the ship could be built theoretically at other yards and barged or transported in other fashion to the delivering shipyard if i had to do it ideally that is where i would probably start talking to my industry partners because although we have six large shipyards for building large navy ships it is really two corporations that own them and those two corporations each own what is now surface combatant shipyard and they each own nuclearcapable shipyard i would say if we were going to go do this we would sit down with them and say you know from corporation standpoint what would be the best work flow what would be the best place to construct modules and how would you do the final assembly and testing of nuclearpowered warship49 for further discussion of the issue see crs report rl33946 navy nuclearpowered surface ships background issues and

national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 public law 109 364 required that the navy include nuclear power in its analysis of alternatives aoa for the cgx propulsion system section 1012 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 public law 110 181 further requires that cgx be nuclear powered unless the secretary of defense submits notification that inclusion of an integrated nuclear power system is not in the national interest the statement of managers accompanying that act directed the secretary of the navy to submit report with the budget request for fiscal year 2009 providing information regarding cgx design cost schedule industrial base considerations and risk assessment that would reflect the results of the cgx aoa and provide evidence that the navy is on schedule for procuring the first ship of the class in 2011 the secretary of the navy has delayed submission of the cgx report because the cgx aoa which was scheduled to be complete by third quarter fiscal year 2007 remains under review by the navy fundamental considerations 50 continued ddg1000s and cgxs to combined rate of one per year the article provides figures on the service lives of the aegis ships before or after the extension so it is unclear whether the authors are proposing to extend their lives from 35 years or some lower figure to 40 years or some other figure whether it would be feasible or cost effective today to extend the lives of the aegis cruisers is unclear depending on how intensively they are used in coming years the aegis cruisers might be worn out in terms of their basic structural or mechanical condition by age 35 some observers believe they might be worn out by age 30 if the aegis cruisers are in good enough structural and mechanical condition to permit operation beyond age 35 experience with past surface combatant designs suggests that the ships might have insufficient space weightcarrying ability or electrical power to accommodate the new sensors and weapons that could be needed at that point to keep them missioneffective beyond age 35 the navy has limited experience operating modern cruisers and destroyers beyond age 35 and thus limited experience with the engineering issues that might arise from attempting to operate such ships to age 40 crs27 regarding the cruisers requirements characteristics technology readiness levels and affordability continue to be studied making it likely that milestone which was targeted for september 2007 will slip into 2009 by all measures there is reasonable path for the nextgeneration cruiser to meet the current schedule for milestone b and award of ship construction contract in 2011 pending completion of the aoa determination of radar requirements ship characteristics propulsion system and an executable program schedule and in view of the delay to program major milestones the activities planned for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 cannot be executed per the schedule reflected in the fiscal year 2009 budget request therefore the committee recommends decrease of 872 million in pe 64300n and decrease of 336 million in pe 64501n these recommended decreases would maintain the cruiser development activities at the same level as was funded in fiscal year 2008 page 195 compromise in lieu of conference report there was compromise version of s 3001 that was accompanied by joint

delay crs29 appendix fy2008 defense authorization act bill and report language the fy2008 defense authorization bill was first reported by the house and senate armed services committees as hr 1585 and s 1547 respectively the president vetoed hr 1585 on december 28 2007 citing to objections unrelated to the matters discussed in this crs report hr 1585 was succeeded by hr 4986 bill that modified certain provisions of hr 1585 as to take into account the presidents objections hr 4986 was signed into law as pl 110181 on january 28 2008 for the parts of hr 4986 that are the same as hr 1585 including the matters discussed in this crs report the conference report on hr 1585 hrept 110477 of december 6 2008 in effect serves as the conference report for hr 4986 house report the house armed services committee in its report hrept 110146 of may 11 2007 on hr 1585 stated the following the committee believes that the mobility endurance and electric power generation capability of nuclear powered warships is essential to the next generation of navy cruisers the navys report to congress on alternative propulsion methods for surface combatants and amphibious warfare ships required by section 130 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 public law 109163 indicated that the total lifecycle cost for mediumsized nuclear surface combatants is equivalent to conventionally powered ships the committee notes that this study only compared acquisition and maintenance costs and did not analyze the increased speed and endurance capability of nuclear powered vessels the committee believes that the primary escort vessels for the navys fleet of aircraft carriers should have the same speed and endurance capability as the aircraft carrier the committee also notes that surface combatants with nuclear propulsion systems would be more capable during independent operations because there would be need for underway fuel replenishment page 387 conference report section 1012 of the conference report hrept 110477 of december 6 2007 on hr 1585 stated sec 1012 policy relating to major combatant vessels of the strike forces of the united states navy integrated nuclear power systems it is the policy of the united states to construct the major combatant vessels of the strike forces of the united states navy including all new classes of such vessels with integrated nuclear power systems b requirement to request nuclear vessels if request is submitted to congress in the budget for fiscal year for construction of new class of major combatant vessel for the strike forces of the united states the crs30 request shall be for such vessel with an integrated nuclear power system unless the secretary of defense submits with the request notification to congress that the inclusion of an integrated nuclear power system in such vessel is not in the national interest c definitions in this section 1 major combatant vessels of the strike forces of the united states navy the term major combatant vessels of the strike forces of the united states navy means the following submarines b aircraft carriers c cruisers battleships or other large surface combatants whose primary mission includes protection of carrier strike groups expeditionary strike groups and vessels comprising sea base 2 integrated nuclear power system the term integrated nuclear power system means ship engineering system that uses naval nuclear reactor as its energy source and generates sufficient electric energy to provide power to the ships electrical loads including its combat systems and propulsion motors 3 budget the term budget means the budget that is submitted to congress by the president under section 1105a of title 31 united states code regarding section 1012 the conference report stated the navys next opportunity to apply this guidance will be the next generation cruiser or cgx under the current futureyears defense program fydp the navy plans to award the construction contract for cgx in fiscal year 2011 under this provision the next cruiser would be identified as cgnx to designate the ship as nuclear powered under the navys normal shipbuilding schedule for the two programs that already have nuclear power systems aircraft carriers and submarines the navy seeks authorization and appropriations for long lead time nuclear components for ships 2 years prior to full authorization and appropriation for construction the conferees recognize that the milestone decision for the navys cgx is only months away after that milestone decision the navy and its contractors will begin significant design effort and in that process will be making significant tradeoff decisions and discarding major options such as propulsion alternatives this is the normal process for the navy and the department of defense dod to make choices that will lead to producing contract design that will be the basis for awarding the construction contract for the lead ship in 2011 in order for the navy to live by the spirit of this guidance the conferees agree that 1 the navy would be required to proceed through the contract design phase of the program with comprehensive effort to design cgnx independent of the outcome of decisions that the navy regarding any preferred propulsion system for the next generation cruiser crs31 2 if the navy intends to maintain the schedule in the current fydp and award vessel in fiscal year 2011 the navy would need to request advance procurement for nuclear components in the fiscal year 2009 budget request and 3 the navy must consider options for maintaining the segment of the industrial base that currently produces the conventionally powered destroyer and amphibious forces of the navy b certifying yards which comprise that segment of the industrial base to build nuclearpowered vessels or c seeking other alternatives for building nonnuclear ships in the future if the navy is only building nuclearpowered surface combatant ships for some period of time as it builds cgnx vessels and d identifying sources of funds to pay for the additional nearterm costs of the integrated nuclear power system either from offsets within the navys budget from elsewhere within the departments resources or from gaining additional funds for dod overall the conferees recognize that these considerations will require significant additional nearterm investment by the navy some in the navy have asserted that despite such added investment the navy would not be ready to award shipbuilding contract for cgnx in fiscal year 2011 as in the current fydp section 128 of the john warner national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 public law 109364 required that the navy include nuclear power in its analysis of alternatives aoa for the cgx propulsion system the conferees are aware that the cgx aoa is nearing completion in which case the navy should have some indications of what it will require to design and construct cgnx class accordingly the conferees direct the secretary of the navy to submit report to the congressional defense committees with the budget request for fiscal year 2009 providing the following information 1 the set of next generation cruiser characteristics such as displacement and manning which would be affected by the requirement for including an integrated nuclear power system 2 the navys estimate for additional costs to develop design and construct cgnx to fill the requirement for the next generation cruiser and the optimal phasing of those costs in order to deliver cgnx most affordably 3 the navys assessment of any effects on the delivery schedule for the first ship of the next generation cruiser class that would be associated with shifting the design to incorporate an integrated nuclear propulsion system options for reducing or eliminating those schedule effects and alternatives for meeting next generation cruiser requirements during any intervening period if the cruisers full operational capability were delayed crs32 4 the navys estimate for the cost associated with certifying those shipyards that currently produce conventionally powered surface combatants to be capable of constructing and integrating nuclearpowered combatant 5 any other potential effects on the navys 30year shipbuilding plan as result of implementing these factors 6 such other considerations that would need to be addressed in parallel with design and construction of cgnx class including any unique test and training facilities facilities and infrastructure requirements for potential cgnx homeports and environmental assessments that may require longterm coordination and planning and 7 an assessment of the highest risk areas associated with meeting this requirement and the navys alternatives for mitigating such risk pages 984 986 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34179
