government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30485the individual alternative minimum tax interaction with marriage penalty relief and other tax cuts summary tax cuts have been addressed recently rate reductions and across the board tax cuts were part of the hr 1836 the tax cut signed by the president on june7 this bill includes the changes in standard deductions and rate brackets relating to the marriage penalty and also included in hr 6 passed earlier by the house the alternative minimum tax amt provides for an alternative tax calculation on broader base but with large exemption and twotier rate that is below the top tax rates in the regular tax structure it is paid when the tax liability figured using the amt base and rates is higher than regular tax liability the amt is expected to grow rapidly and extend further into the middle class because the exemptions in the amt are not indexed for inflation in addition the tax credits such as the child credit enacted in 1997 would have caused many middle class taxpayers to be affected by the amt temporary provision allowing these credits to be taken against the amt was adopted last year and was made permanent for the child credit by hr 1836 the marriage penalty legislation and other proposals for cutting taxes will be limited in their effects for some individuals unless changes are also made in the alternative minimum tax amt individuals who pay the amt are not affected by cuts in the regular tax and individuals who switch to the amt will not receive the full tax cut this constraint will grow over time for example about 28 of the tax cuts over the next ten years in bill similar to hr 6 considered in the 106th congress would not have been received by taxpayers because of the amt this effect grows over time by 2008 44 of the tax cut will not have been received cuts in regular tax without also addressing the amt would cause more and more taxpayers to the subject to the complexities of the amt and also increase the revenue costs of future measures to restrain the growth of the amt hr 1836 partially addressed this issue by making the child credit apply against the amt the bill also increased the exemptions by 2000 for singles and 4000 for joint returns but these provisions sunset in 2004 there are number of different policy options that might be considered in evaluating the amt and its interaction with the regular tax for some priority has been in making the exclusion for credits permanent while for others indexing may be the most important priority both of these approaches will be costly in the future about 26 billion for the credit ten years from now and about 14 billion for indexing others might wish to eventually phase out the amt which will raise about 37 billion by 2010 one can also make case for expanding the coverage of the amt as an eventual flat tax although in some ways the amt does not conform to certain design principles such as adjusting exemptions for family size another issue is how to adjust the amt as changes in the regular tax system are made to keep the relative position and original purpose of the amt intact in the latter case the amt might be adjusted when fundamental changes are made in the regular tax rates bracket widths standard deductions but not for proposals that provide special subsidies this report will be updated to reflect

and across the board tax cuts were part of the hr 1836 the tax cut signed by the president on june7 this bill includes the changes in standard deductions and rate brackets relating to the marriage penalty and also included in hr 6 passed earlier by the house the marriage penalty legislation and other proposals for cutting taxes will be limited in their effects for some individuals unless changes are also made in the alternative minimum tax amt the amt is paid when the tax liability figured using amt base and rates is higher than regular tax liability growing numbers of taxpayers will in the future be affected by the amt the share of married couples with children affected by the amt will be particularly large moreover cuts in the regular tax will shift more individuals into the amt thus it is important in evaluating any tax cut proposal and especially reductions in taxes for joint returns to evaluate the role played by the amt in our tax system hr 1836 partially addressed this issue by making the child credit apply against the amt the bill also increased the exemptions by 2000 for singles and 4000 for joint returns but these provisions sunset in 2004 the first section of this study summar izes the fundamental cause of the amt interaction with other tax provisions and provides some background data on the amt the second section examines the particular interaction between the marriage penalty proposals in hr 6 last year and the amt case for which some estimates of effects are available and which are also relevant to the current tax cut the final section discusses potential policy options an overview of the amt the amt provides for an alternative tax calculation on broader tax base than the regular tax individuals add back variety of provisions including not only business provisions but certain itemized deductions mainly state and local taxes some medical expenses and miscellaneous deductions the standard deduction and personal exemptions after an exemption of 45000 for joint returns and 33750 for single returns the first 175000 is taxed at 26 and the remainder is taxed at 28 exemption s are phased out the individual compares amt liability and regular tax liability and pays the higher one while the amt base is broader than the regular tax base there are many provisions that are not included in its base notably the benefits of lower capital gains tax rates and the exclusion for tax exempt bonds and the itemized deduction for home mortgage interest indeed the elimination of the capital gains exclusion in 1986 caused significant contraction in the number of taxpayershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30485crs2 1 for history and more detailed discussion of the specific features of the amt see crs report rl30149 the alternative minimum tax for individuals by gregg esenwein 2 the data in this and the following paragraph as well as in table 1 are taken from the joint committee on taxations pamphlet jcx3999 present law and background relating to the marriage tax penalty education tax incentives the alternative minimum tax and expiring tax provisions june 22 1999 subject to the amt the current rate preferences are not part of the amt credits are automatically included in the base ie effectively disallowed although under provisions adopted as part of hr 1836 this rule does not apply to the most important credit the child credit1 however unlike the rest of the income tax the amt exemptions are not indexed to inflation the result has been an increase in the number of taxpayers who are covered by the amt2 in 1987 about 140000 returns paid the amt constituting 110 of one percent of all returns filed this number was below the 410 of percent of returns that paid the tax in 1984 and fell largely because the deduction for capital gains was eliminated by the 1986 tax act and therefore automatically affected coverage under the amt inflation however took its toll by 1999 the amt covered 823000 returns constituting 610 of percent of all returns filed an increase in percentage share of 600 between 1987 and 1999 this effect occurred even though the exemptions were increased in 1990 more growth is ahead however in 2009 the joint tax committee projects that over 9 million taxpayers will pay the amt constituting 63 of all tax returns filed an increase in percentage share of over thousand percent from 1990 to 2009 the amt would probably constitute larger share of joint returns filed since incomes are higher for these returns than for single returns the amt would also constitute larger portion of returns with tax liability since typically about quarter of returns filed pay tax taxpayers on the amt would constitute over 8 of returns with tax payments another 6 million returns would have been subject to limits on tax credits such as the child credit and education credits enacted in 1997 this surge in the amt coverage would have occurred in large part in 2002 but hr 1836 made the most important credit the child credit permanently availale under the amt while the amt will still be concentrated among higher income individuals it will gradually reach further down into the income distribution this shift in the distribution is shown in table 1 note that this table understates the coverage of the amt and its reach into the middle income classes because it does not include those taxpayers whose credits are still limited by the amt such as education tax credits but it does illustrate how the failure to index exemptions will substantially expand the amt as this table illustrates the shift of exposure to the amt from the very highest income classes to the middle and upper middle income classes is dramatic over time even without the tax cuts in hr 1836 in 1998 almost half of amt taxpayers fell into the 16 of taxfilers with adjusted income over 200000 and over three quarters fell into the top 8 of taxpayers who had income over 100000 in 2008 less than 15 of amt taxpayers have incomes over 200000 and about half havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30485crs3 incomes of 100000 or more moreover these effects occur despite the fact that taxpayers in these income classes are accounting for larger share of total taxpayers as incomes rise over time table 1 percentage distribution of amt taxpayers by income class excluding the effects of limits on credits prior

total 1000 1000 08 1000 72 source data from and crs calculations based on data from joint committee on taxation comparison of the fraction of taxpayers on the amt in each income bracket shows similar dramatic shift while the shares increase in all of the middle and upper brackets the dramatic changes are in the middle income brackets for example the share of taxpayers on the amt at income between 75000 and 100000 which most people would consider in the middle class would increase from 1 to 20 these effects understate the shift of the influence of the amt toward the middle class that is expected in the future because they do not include the interaction with the tax credits that were adopted in 1997 under the amt provisions credits are limited to the excess of regular tax over amt liability except for the child credit which is now specifically excluded for 2008 there would have been another 6 million returns thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30485crs4 3 who pays the individual amt by robert rebelein and jerry tempalski ota paper 87 june 2000are constrained by the tax credit however most of these will probably longer be affected because they reflect effects of the child credit the treasury department recently completed study of the amt that showed significant growth in the share of amt taxpayer s inclusive of the effects of the credit3 table 2 shows these effects for 2000 2005 and 2010 overall 157 of taxpayers will be covered by the amt in 2010 and the shares rise to as much as 64 these numbers will be smaller after considering the effects of hr 1836 because of the adjustment in the credit but larger because of the lower rates and other tax cut provisions table 2 percentage distribution of amt taxpayers by income class including the effects of limits on credits

exemptions would cost 139 billion by 2008httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30485crs5 4 see joint tax committee document jcx5599 for revenue estimates for the senate version of last years tax cut bill hr 2488this cost would be larger in the wake of the recent tax changes eliminating the credit limit provision would cost about 1 billion currently but would cost many billions of dollars by 2008 or 2009 eliminating the credit limit provision and adding standard deductions would cost the us treasury 26 billion by 2009 and 96 billion for the period 199920094 according to the treasury study amt tax liability was projected projected to rise from 64 billion in 2001 to 382 billion in 2010 before considering hr 1836 with total amount of 182 billion over the ten year period this number will now be higher due to the rate reductions and marriage penalty provisions in hr 1836 clearly the amt will become increasingly important in the years to come in the number of taxpayers covered and revenue cost of altering the amt and any tax cut that reduces regular tax liabilities and does not also alter the amt will interact with the amt in two ways it will increase the number of taxpayers on the amt and the number affected by the credit limit and it will cause some or all of the tax cut not to be received by certain families tax provisions that are aimed at reducing taxes for joint returns may particularly interact with the amt because married couples have greater number of dependents which increases the likelihood that taxpayers will be under the amt married couples also tend to have higher incomes and while their amt exemptions are also higher may be more likely to be affected by the amt the interaction is also affected by how the tax change is distributed across the income classes since only joint returns with more than 45000 of taxable income are potentially subject to the amt treasury data show that 21 of joint returns will be affected by the amt in 2010 compared to 157 for the overall taxpaying population for joint returns with dependents the share affected by the amt rises to 39 thus tax cuts directed at joint returns are particularly likely to be restricted due to the amt interaction between marriage penalty relief and the amt marriage penalty arises for some families because family income is combined and subject to progressive tax rates since the standard deductions and rate brackets while larger than those of singles are not twice as large marriage can cause the loss of standard deductions and cause some income to be taxed at higher rates other couples however experience bonuses this outcome tends to arise when earnings are relatively unequal or when there is only one earner because the exemption amounts and rate brackets are larger for the joint returns filed by married couples than for singles returns httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30485crs6 5 penalties will still exist because of the amt the earned income tax credit because of taxpayers in very high rate brackets and because of some other minor tax provisions the marriage penalty discussed in this paper and addressed by legislation is the penalty relative to single returns there is special headofhousehold return and some penalty relative to these returns will continue for families with children 6 data in this paragraph are based on internal revenue service statistics of income individual income tax returns 1996provisions of the recent marriage penalty legislation hr 1836 proposed to address the marriage penalty for most taxpayers granting bonuses to many taxpayers who formerly had penalties and expanding the bonuses of those with bonuses5 about 60 of joint returns are in the 15 bracket and would have any penalties that did exist eliminated and bonuses increased merely through increasing the standard deduction to twice that of single returns under hr 6 stand alone marriage penalty bill passed earlier this year by the house this provision was estimated to cost 63 billion by 2009 another 26 are in the 28 bracket and would have the remainder of any penalties eliminated and bonuses increased through both the standard deduction and the widening of the first bracket to twice that of single returns this provision would have cost 263 billion by 2009 thus 86 of joint returns ignoring the earned income tax credit and the amt would be covered by these provisions there were also some provisions for partially reducing the marriage penalty for the earned income tax credit costing 14 billion by 2009 some individuals whose income is taxed above the 28 bracket currently would also have had their penalties eliminated and since the next rate bracket is only slightly higher 31 this approach would have also most marriage penalties for the vast majority of married couples 96 are in the 31 bracket or below6 these numbers do not take into account the rate reductions and the effect of those reductions on the amt h r 1836 which included the provisions in hr 6 will have slower phasein and also sunset because the estimates are calculated with significant rate reduction the cost will be smaller reaching about 31 billion for the standard deduction and 47 billion for the increase in the 15 bracket the increase in the bracket width would shift income from 15 bracket to 28 bracket under current law and to 25 bracket with the proposed rate revisions adjusting for this effect would make the cost under the new rate structure 1013 of the cost under the old and reduce the estimate to 20 billion only accounting for small part of the difference about one fourth of the current 15 bracket is being shifted to 10 rate lowering the cost of the standard deduction 63 billion to at least 01375015 under the new system compared to the old but this adjustment would shift the cost to 57 billion not the 31 billion reported the cost of the earned income credit provisions is actually higher under hr 1836 than under hr 6 the only remaining explanation is that large numbers of joint returns will shift into the amt because of the new rate schedule and will not become eligible for marriage penalty relief httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30485crs7 7 davis the marriage tax penalty relief act cheap tax relief or not tax notes february 28 2000 pp 13001302a large part of this effect is that more individuals will be pushed into the alternative minimum tax because of the rate reductions and these individuals will not benefit from the marriage penalty relief as result many joint returns will not receive marriage penalty reduction benefits marriage penalties still exist for higher income taxpayers as well however the flatter rates themselves would also reduce marriage penalties for those individuals who remain on the regular tax the senate marriage penalty proposal in the 106th congress initially proposed to expand the 28 bracket which would increase the coverage of high income taxpayers an even larger fraction of this group would ultimately fall under the amt interaction between the amt and marriage penalty legislation the amount by which marriage penalties are reduced by the proposed legislation will declined over time because of the amt if taxpayer is on the amt marriage penalty relief provisions would not have benefitted these taxpayers moreover for taxpayers subject to credit limits change in the regular tax would have been offset by loss in the credit so the taxpayer would not have benefitted from the tax revision and the tax cuts in the marriage penalty legislation were likely to substantially increase the number of taxpayers on the amt number that as noted earlier is already growing rapidly in 2000 the treasury department has estimated that the marriage penalty alone from the stand alone provisions would have increased the number of taxpayers on the amt or constrained by it via credits by 49 by 2010 raising the total number from 17 million to 25 million of the 17 million taxpayers already affected 126 million are on the amt and the remainder constrained by the credit since there were 91 million taxable returns in 1996 which would probably not grow much over 1 or 2 per year 22 to 24 of taxpayers would then be on the amt or affected by the credit provision that currently affects less than one percent of taxpayers thus it is clear that the growth in the amt coverage would have been sharply increased by this legislation the revenue collected by the amt would also have increased by about 48 from 382 billion per year to 465 billion these results would have been even larger with the rate cuts treasury estimates indicate that 28 of the marriage penalty tax cuts in the 106th congresss version of hr 6 over the next ten years are taken back by the amt making the net budget effect 67 billion smaller7 this takeback rate rises rapidly and reaches 44 by 2008 thus absent revisions to the amt about half the tax cuts in the marriage penalty legislation would have disappeared after ten years eight years after the legislati on is enacted more than 47 of couples with two children would have been on the amt these effects are mitigated by provisions that allow personal credits to be offset against the amt but increased by the rate reductionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30485crs8 8 davis candidate bushs tax cut plan tax notes january 10 2000 pp 271277lessons from the marriage penalty example this analysis of hr 6 in the 106th congress shows how tax proposal that affects many ordinary income taxpayers has powerful interactions with the amt depending on the nature of the legislation the interactions can be larger or smaller proposals that lower tax rates or narrow brackets across the board would also be expected to have significant interactions with the amt because they tend to affect higher income taxpayers proportionally more taxpayers already on the amt would get tax cut and some taxpayers would be shifted to the amt for example even in the year 2000 44 of taxpayers with incomes over 50000 would have received less than the full 10 tax cut in hr 3 an acrosstheboard tax cut proposal in the 106th congress8 tax cuts that add to credits or other provisions disallowed by the amt would also interact with the amt tax cuts that are directed primarily at lower or middle income individuals would be less affected by amt interaction at least in the near future left unchecked over very long period of time of course virtually all taxpaye rs will eventually fall under the amt provisions as the exemptions erode in value there were offsetting effects in the initial senate finance committee proposal for the marriage penalty s 2346 s 2839 this proposal also made the ability to offset credits such as the child credit against the amt permanent this change would have reduced the number of middle and upper middle income taxpayers who would have their credits limited as result of the marriage penalty or who would be switched to the amt the expansion of the 28 rate bracket however would have expanded the interaction between the marriage penalty legislation and the amt for tax year 2000 the top of the 28 rate was 105950 while twice the top of the single bracket is 124900 since adjusted gross income is higher than taxable income this change will affect many higher income individuals the final proposal adopted by both houses hr 4810 included the credit offsets and not the 28 bracket expansion so the effects of the amt in limiting these tax cuts would have been smaller in this legislation policy options and issues while the previous analysis describes the importance of amt interaction with proposed tax cuts there are variety of approaches that could be taken to dealing with the amt however one important point to note is that cutting taxes without altering the amt by increasing the coverage of the amt makes proposals to slow or reverse its growth in importance more costly in terms of revenue loss httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30485crs9 9 for discussion of alternative views of the amt discussed here and in the following sections see michael j graetz and emil m sunley minimum taxes and comprehensive tax reform in uneasy compromise problems of hybrid incomeconsumpti on tax washington dc brookings institute 1988 pp385418 see also comments of discussants jane g gravelle and donald c lubick pp 419429 also see david weiner alternative minimum tax in the encyclopedia of taxation and tax policy ed joseph j cordes robert d ebel and jane g gravelle washington dc urban institute 1999the 1997 credit interaction the congress has considered the most urgent issue that of dealing with the lack of offset of the credits adopted in 1997 which immediately catapulted many middle class taxpayers into an interaction with the amt that reduced their credits legislation temporarily correcting that problem had already been enacted and this provision was made permanent in the case of child credits child credit provisions in hr 1836 eventually cost about 25 billion per year but this number reflects both doubling of the credit and the amt provision earlier estimates suggest eliminating the credit limit provision would cost about 1 billion currently but would cost many billions of dollars by 2008 or 2009 estimates for the senate version of the 1999 tax cut bill hr 2488 indicated 1 billion cost currently for both eliminating the restriction and allowing some small additional exemption cost that grew to become 26 billion in the tenth year indexing the exemptions according to joint committee data indexing amt exemptions would cost 139 billion by 2008 indexing the exemptions is the step that would be necessary to begin to keep the amt more or less fixed in relative importance in the tax system assuming that other changes in the regular tax structure occurred the amt as the tax of the future some might see the amt as desirable relativelyflat alternative tax with wider base and consider the expansion of the amt desirable if that is the case of course then the amt structure itself might be examined in light of general tax principles9 the exemption levels in the amt are not adjusted for family size or for head of household status there are marriage penalties within the amt structure and tax preferences are not uniformly included or excluded for example while the amt base disallows certain itemized deductions mainly taxes and business preferences it leaves other important preferences intact capital gains differentials home mortgage interest deductions exclusions for tax exempt interest on general obligation state and local bonds and exclusions for employerpaid fringe benefits and if there is concern about the marriage penalty in the regular tax there is also an issue about the marriage penalty in the amt phasing out the amt others might see the amt as an unnecessary and complicating feature of the current tax system under this view adjustments to limit tax preferences should behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30485crs10 directed at the preferences themselves and not some overall restrictions on their use as embodied in the amt approach these individuals might like to see not only corrections to allow the 1997 credits to be used against the amt and indexation of the amt exemption levels but also steps to eventually eliminate the amt some steps in this direction were already taken for the corporate amt in 1997 where depreciation rules were brought more in line with regular depreciation revising the amt and coordinating with other tax revisions others want to see the amt continue as general backup mechanism to keep tax preferences from being overused but limited to small fraction of the population for them several issues arise while the indexation for price inflation of the exemption levels is clearly appropriate to maintain the relative importance of the amt other questions are not as easily answered they include questions as to whether the current base of the amt is appropriate to its purpose and how to adjust the amt in tandem with regular tax changes to ensure that it fulfills its role the preferences taken away by the amt are selective they include for example itemized deductions for state and local taxes but not for mortgage interest even though case might be made that the former is not preference while almost everyone agrees that the latter is preference they do not include the major investment subsidies capital gains preferences and tax exempt bond interest although they include variety of business related preferences they include personal exemptions and standard deductions although the rationale for this inclusion is that the amt flat exemption is much larger than the sum of the standard deductions and personal exemptions how the amt should be altered as regular tax changes are made is also unclear for example if the principal purpose of the amt is to limit the use of preferences there is apparent reason why changes in the basic structure of the tax system wider brackets lower rates larger standard deductions should trigger additional coverage under the amt it would be appropriate to simultaneously adjust the amt deductions brackets and rates to conform to the rate changes in that case if the standard deduction increases by 500 the amt exemption should increase by that same amount however the adjustments in the amt are limited and imperfect for example there is adjustment for family size and adjustment for head of household status there are only two rate brackets and the width of the first bracket does not bear close relationship to the width of the regular income brackets the exemption is phased out at high income levels thus in the marriage penalty proposal while it might make sense to increase the amt exemption by the increase in the standard deduction it is not clear what if any conforming change the expansion of the 15 rate bracket should induce thus it is not clear that changes of these nature should trigger conforming changes in the amt also under this view of the amt there appears clear reason to allow credits under the amt although there is reason to adjust the amt for the expansion of the standard deduction in the marriage penalty legislation case might be made for an adjustment in the child credits on the grounds that these credits are the equivalent ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30485crs11 increasing personal exemptions and that such credits should be allowed against the amt there is less of justification for other types of credits and the case for the child credits is complex because only some taxpayers receive those credits but the amt exemption is uniform distinguishing only between single and joint returns conclusion the growth in the amt has been considered potential problem for some time and its importance increases with tax cuts such as those passed in 1997 and 2001 because of the amt not all taxpayers receive the full amount or even any tax cut moreover every reduction in the regular tax that is not accompanied by adjustments in the amt increases the number of taxpayers who pay the amt and the complications for those taxpayers in filing their tax return the marriage penalty legislation as well as the rate reductions cause significant expansion of the fraction of the fraction of families and each time this issue is not addressed the higher the cost grows for doing so at some future time
