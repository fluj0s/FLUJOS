congress and legislative process government and finance division quorum requirements in committee senate rule xxvi establishes minimum quorum requirements for four areas of committee activity these are listed in the following table see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml for more information on legislative process1 action minimum quorum rule xxvi to report measure matter majority of the committee 7a1 or recommendation physically present to close meeting or majority of the committee 5b hearing to transact business other onethird of membership 7a1 than reporting measure matter or recommendation to take sworn or unsworn onethird of membership or 7a2 testimony lesser number as may be authorized by the committee senate committees have discretion in adjusting the minimum quorum requirements mandated in rule xxvi as long as they adopt rules that are not inconsistent with the rules of the senate for instance most committees allow single senator to take testimony at hearing rather than the onethird required by rule xxvi committees cannot change the majority physically present quorum needed for reporting measure quorums in the senate rules and practices for quorums in the senate derive from article i section 5 clause 1 of the constitution which states in part that majority of each house shall constitute quorum to do business but smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each house provides thus the 1 this report was originally prepared by former crs specialist richard c sachs please direct any inquires to the listed author crs2 quorum for conducting business in senate of 100 members is 51 senators the senate always presumes the presence of quorum unless it is shown one is not present in practice there are rarely 51 senators present in the senate chamber except when the senate is voting any senator can challenge the presumption of quorum by rising and stating mr president i suggest the absence of quorum usually the presiding officer cannot count to determine if quorum is present but according to the requirements of rule vi paragraph 3 must immediately direct the clerk to call the roll only when the senate has invoked rule xxii and is operating under cloture does the presiding officer have the authority to count to determine the presence of quorum in the senate the quorum call is more often device by which the chamber can suspend its formal proceedings temporarily than procedure to bring legislators to the floor for vote senators initiate quorum calls for several reasons for example when senator completes statement and notices that one else is on the floor the senator typically suggests the absence of quorum when the senate finds itself confronted with procedural problem or policy disagreement senator sometimes will respond by suggesting the absence of quorum in the hope that the matter can be resolved through informal conversations while the clerk is calling the role such quorum calls provide an opportunity for informal discussions and negotiations among senators because quorum calls for these purposes are recognized as procedure for constructive delay the clerk calls the role very slowly once the quorum call has begun the senate may not resume business until either majority of senators has responded to the call or the senate has by unanimous consent agreed to request to dispense with further proceedings under the quorum call in such case whether or not quorum of the membership has come to the floor the senate returns to business there are instances when quorum call is intended to bring senators to the floor to register their presence there are four instances that may result in such situation called live quorum call 1 under rule xxii immediately before any cloture vote 2 under rule xii before the senate acts on unanimous consent request to set date for voting on whether to pass bill or joint resolution 3 when the majority leader suggests the absence of quorum and announces that there is to be live quorum call because he wishes to bring senators to the floor for some reason or 4 when the clerk completes routine quorum call without majority of senators having responded quorum calls for cloture and unanimous consent agreements are usually waived by unanimous consent during live quorum call the clerk calls the names of senators more quickly when senator who has the floor requests the yeas and nays on the pending question the senate assumes as its regular practice that those present constitute quorum the senate usually requires that the request for rollcall vote must be supported by at least onefifth of the smallest possible quorum consequently at least 11 senators onefifth of the minimum quorum of 51 senators must raise their hands to support request for rollcall vote if there is sufficient support the question then pending before the senate will be decided by rollcall vote whenever the time arrives for voting on that question for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98775
