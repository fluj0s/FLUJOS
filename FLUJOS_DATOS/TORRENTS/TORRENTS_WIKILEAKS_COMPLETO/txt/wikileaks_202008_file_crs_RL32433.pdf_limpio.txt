floodwaters2 and other inflows from the tigris and euphrates rivers these mars hes became the largest wetland ecosystem in the middle east and western eurasia th is wetland supported fi sh rice and water buffalo production that supported more than 350000 people known as madan or marsh arabs for more than 5000 years3 the marshes also provided important habitat for number of endemic species birds traveling the intercontinental flyway and aquatic species suppl ying coastal fisheries4 draining the wetlands while early inhabitants of mesopotamia built structur to capture water from the rivers and to protect themselves fro m floods plans to develop the marshes were not outlined until the middle of the 20th century5 even with plans on the drawing board largescale water projects were c onstructed sporadically and the marshes remained relatively intact into the 1980s during the 1980s and 1990s large water projects in iraq and upstream nations be gan affecting the sopotamian marshes specifically dams built on the tigris and uphrates in turkey syria iraq and iran can store more than five times the rivers average annual flows6 t h i s s t r g capacity allows upstream users to effectively

time they were not the immediate cause of marsh dessica tion beginning in the 1990s the iraqi government undertook number of massive water projects that severely reduced the marshes water supply through th efforts saddam hussein drained approximately 90 of the marshes by 20007 while the iraqi government claimed that it built these dikes dams and canals to increase land reclamation and irrigation others found evidence that the water projects were used for development purposes8 rather saddam hussein drained the marshes to give his army access to the region and to remove sanctuary where an estimated 9000 iranbacked shiite guerillas and thousands of deserters lived9 by 2000 the marshes had been severely diminished specifically the central and hammar marshes were reduced to small

marsh dwellers reflooding and monitoring reflooding has been undertaken through breaching dams and embankments opening sluice gates and stopping pumping in some cases these activities have been undertaken by the us army corps of engineers at the direction of the minist ry of water resources mwr in others areas were rewetted without consultation with the mwr aboveaverage rainfall and releases of water from iran have also contributed to reflooding marshlands as of june 2004 up to 40 of the former marshlands had been rewetted20 restoration is not as simple as rewetting former marshlands according to the iraq foundation vegetation has not returned to all of the rewetted areas in order to understand how best to pursue further rest oration entities are monitoring some of the reflooded areas monitoring demonstrati on projects is the first step in the iraq foundations threestep proce ss toward developing sust ainable restoration plan they are pursuing this step with grants from italy to monitor the revegetation and rehabitation process at one of the recently flooded sites the abu zarag marsh and to examine ways to increase the amount of water available fo r marsh rehabilitation the iraq foundation has also received 140000 from usaiddai to monitor additional sites initial reports from these monitoring efforts include the return of 45 bird species two of which are on the endang ered list unep also plans to monitor and assess the environmental character of changes taking place since unep officials are not present in iraq based on security policies they will monitor by collecting and analyzing satellite data research planning the rehabilitation of major wetland requires specific information on the former wetland site eg soil salinity vegetation and development and on the quantity and quality of available water prior to the fall of the hussein government marsh data was limited primarily to satellite imagery therefore major component of rehabilita tion efforts is gathering sitespecific information in june 2003 and february 2004 teams of independent experts from dai duke university the iraq foundati on the international resources group the iraq ministry of water the amar founda tion and the university of basra collected data on soil water quality seed banks and other characteristics of the former marshlands the june trip revealed ex tensive reflooding and lower than expected salinity in most areas the iraq founda tion has c onducte d monthly field surveys since august 2003 in addition to examining the status of the former marshlands efforts are

the iraq foundation is working on models of the central marshes these models will help clarify the quantity and quality of water available for the marshes planning the primary purpose of the vari ous research and modeling efforts is to provide for comprehensive marsh rest oration and management plan over the past year teams of experts have met to discuss restoration planning in february 2004 team of 71 experts from 6 countries22 joined together to work on an action plan focusing on integrated marsh ma nagement for usaids iraqi marsh restoration program23 usaiddais proposal for working to develop an integrated marsh management plan supports the broader work of the new center fo r restoration of the iraq marshlands crim24 according to the iraq foundation crims goal for the next year is to prepare sustainable restoration plan to prepare the plan the iraq foundations international t echnical advisory panel has recommended three actions 1 implement demonstration projects to observe how the ecosystem responds to re hydration 2 conduct series of comp rehensive environmental surveys to be accomplished by iraqi scientists with the assistance of international experts to provide scientific basis for making wise landus decisions and 3 obtain input from stakeholders to allow for decision making through participatory process within iraq25 the iraq foundation has begun some of these activities with 2 million from italy but estimates that cri m will need 10 million to complete this process and prepare the plan26 usaiddais iraq marsh restoration program includes some funding for these activities for example it includes 350000 towards strategic and comprehensive pl anning activities and 520000 for integrated marshland management training and capacitybuilding carrying out restoration actions and implementing longterm management plan require trained iraqi officials and well functioning ministries therefore entities are working to provide iraqi

activities international agreements even with plans in place and trained iraqi staff sustaining the marshes will be difficult if not impossible without international cooperation much of the pot ential marshwater originates in and flows through the tigris and euphrates rivers in turkey the syrian arab republic and iran see table 1 dams in these countries can hold b ack five times the rivers annual

funding will directly target marsh restoration it will also fund projects with less direct re lationship to restora tion eg sanitation water supply and economic development for the madan and other
