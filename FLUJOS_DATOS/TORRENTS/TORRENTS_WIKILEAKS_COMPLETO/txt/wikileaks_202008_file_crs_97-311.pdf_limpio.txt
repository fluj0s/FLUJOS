visas for hong kong residents the 101st congressenacted the immigration act of 1990 which establishes separate immigrant visa quota forhong kong and offers deferred visa to hong kong residents thereby

explained by the fact that many of the products the united states used to import from hong kong are now being imported from china some manufactured by hong kongowned enterprises in china23 ushong kong

overstated because 1 large share of chinas us exports is from hong kongowned factories in the mainland and 2 many of chinas exports to the united states are transshipped through hong kong where additional value is added by hong kong firms while us tradestatistics attribute the full value of the final product in these cases as originating from china the size of the us trade deficit with china is highly polit ical issue some us policymakers perceive it to be largely direct result of significant chinese export malpractices and tradebarriers against us exports some economists note that while the united states does facesignificant chinese trade barriers such barriers are more likely to affect the composition ratherthan the level of us exports to china still the size and growth of the us trade deficit withchina is likely to be continuing source of trade friction textile agreement the united states will continue to allocate textile quotas to hong kong separately from those it allocates to china26 but us officials remain concerned over efforts by chinese producers to avoid us textile and apparel quotas by transshipping them through third partiesincluding hong kong in june 1996 the us customs service implemented new rules requiringadditional import documentation on certain textile imports from hong kong and tightened rulesof origin for certain products in order to control illegal

for example hong kong enacted legislation to outlaw the pr oduction of pirated goods by hong kong firms outside of hong kongits ipr protection and that consequently action was needed28 should hong kong fail to enforce ipr laws and textile quotas the united states could impose trade sanctions key aspectsof such enforcement will be the ability of the hong kong government to prevent hong kong firms from illegally transshipping products from china through hong kong and the ability ofthe hong kong government to prevent intellectual property theft by china taxation hong kongs reversion to china also has potential consequences for the us tax code s treatment of us companies operating in hong kong and china under subpart f section 951964 of the us internal revenue code corporations are subject to us income tax on incomeearned by the foreign corporation that is considered to have been artificially shifted to anothercountry with lower taxes some members of the u s business community have suggested that treating hong kong as jurisdiction separate from china could have adverse tax consequencesfor us businesses with subsidiaries in both china and hong kong by making income taxablein the united states once it was moved from one of these tax jurisdictions to the other none of the provisions of the h ong k ong policy act address the us tax code directly nevertheless section 201a of the act states that the ited states will treat an aut onomous hong kong separately after the transition and apply current laws in the same manner as beforeunder current law the united states considers hong kong to be separate and not part of theuk for subpart f tax purposes the us tax tr eaty with the prc was ratified by the senate with the understanding that its provisions would not apply to hong kong thus some americanbusinesses have suggested that it is unclear how subpart f of the internal revenue code is to beapplied to businesses operating in hong kong after the july 1 transfer according to an official of the us treasury the treasury department intends to issue guidance on the subpart f issuein the near future issues for us policy one of the key trade questions involving hong k ong s transition invol ves whether the united states will be able to maintain its currently close working relations with hong kong tradeofficials on commercial issues including the exchange of information and cooperation onenforcement another questi on involves the independence of hong kong trade officials whether they will be able to operate without interference from highlevel chinese governmentofficials and whether they will be able to continue to devote sufficient resources to enforcing hong kongs trade and ipr laws the united st ates will probably be monitoring hong kong government actions to determine if there is an increase in corruption or reduced cooperation withthe united states on trade issues should china in terfere in hong kong s economic and political affairs

levels of us securityrelated cooperation with hongkong continued after hong kongs reversion to prc sovereignty nonetheless the shift of hongkongs sovereignty from great britain close military ally of the united states to the prc poses number of questions and issues for us policymak ers concerned with issues such as defense relations intelligence sharing and operations and proliferation controls thus far usgovernment officials have not publicly offered definitive answer s to these questions or firm resolutions of these issues defenserelated issues on average 70 us navy ships visit hong kong each year for crew rest and for naval support services such as ship repairs resupply maintenance and refueling the procedures bywhich us and british officials handle notification of such visits are efficient usually involvinga few days advance notice to british aut horities in hong kong by the us hong kong consulate prc officials stated during the chinese defense ministers visit to washington indecember 1996 that an agreement in principle was reached between the united states andchina allowing continued us navy ship visits to hong kong after july 1 1997 us defensedepartment officials are now in the process of working with their chinese counterparts on thespecific details of this agreement another issue concerns actions of us military personnel in hong kong under british rule incidents of us military personnel being arrested for breaking laws in hong kong haveusually involved the accused being transferred by hong kong government authorities to usmilitary authorities for judgment and punishment continuation of this practice under chinesesovereignty however is not necessarily safe assumption and is under discussion with the prc another set of defense relations issues has to do with the presence of four or five us military attaches and related support personnel in the defense liaison office of the usconsulate in hong kong these officials are involved in arranging for the us navy ship visitsto hong kong and other matters involving military cooperation such as flight clearances thedefense department hopes to continue these activities in hong kong after july 1 1997 issues for us policy the us navy is expecting to continue to use hong kong as an important port of call for its asian fleet at comparable number of annual visits as in the recent past one key issue forthe navy will be whether the notification and approval procedures for these ship visits will become more difficult in the future under chinese rule nother issue of concern is whether us military personnel accused of violating hong kong laws after july 1 1997 will continue to bereturned to us military authorities for judgment and punishment as was the case under britishsovereignty if not decisions will need to be made about whether some more formalarrangement may be needed to protect the safety of us military personnel in hong kong whileproviding for the legitimate legal rights of the hong kong and prc

has rarely been seen as strategically important in determining the balance of forces in east asia the british garrison was quickly subdued in japan s march to southeast asia in the 1940s while the british government was among the first we stern powers to recognize the peoples republic of china in part because london judged that hong kong was strategicallyuntenable if attacked nonetheless the reversion in july 1997 does give chinese military forces unprecedented free access and control in one of the major ports along the pacific rim it also frees chinese military planners of any concerns they might have had about the area falling into the hands of forces prepared to confront the prc issues for us policy hong kongs reversion to the military cont rol of the prc raises questions about the potential impact of the transfer on the overall balance of forces in the east asian region and in particular on us military concerns in the region us policymakers may wish to explorewhether chinese military planners in the past were concerned about hong kong becoming astrategic problem for the prc and if so how serious those concerns were in particularly us strategic planners will

continue to apply after the transfer ofsovereignty we do not know of any objection the prc has made to our continuing this treatment there are significant backlogs for family based visas from the prc and folding hong kong into the prc would increase not reduce these backlogs over the past decade there has been twofold increase to 152000 in the number of nonimmigrants visas ie temporary entries for students tourists business people temporary workers and the likeissued to hong kong residents basic requirement for issuance of nonimmigrant visa is that the applicant intends to return home any significant change in conditions in hong kong may make it more difficult to show likelihood of return and thusresult in tightening up of nonimmigrant visa issuances ch anging conditions so may affect how human rights provisions in the ina are applied to hong kong residents many of whom relocatedin hong kong to flee repression in the prc in cases of individuali zed persecution the refugee and asylum provisions in the ina allow for admission based on past persecution or on wellfound fear of prospective persecution due to political opinion race relig ion ethnicity or membership in social

general authority to grant blanket relief to aliens here from countries undergoing civil strife or natural disasters reportedly hong kong has been base for some organized crime syndicates that operate

extradition to the prc and did not address the question of h ong kong s separate and autonomous judicial system the court s decision disallowed the extradition under the uk treaty on the grounds that judicial pro ceedings could not be completed prior to h ong kong s transfer of sovereignty but the decision also looked unfavorably upon extending extradition obligations beyond that time by executive agreement with hong kong authorities thegovernment has appealed the january 7 decision and oral arguments are expected to be heardby midmarch 1997 at the latest whatever its legal fate the january 7 decision embodies wider concern about the ultimate independence of the hong kong judicial system than was expressed by the clinton administration in connection with its extradition negotiations with hong kong in this regard it is important to note that us extradition practice allows the secretary of state to refuse the extradition of an otherwise extraditable individual upon finding that extradition is being soughtto punish the individual because of his or her political views the ushong kong agreement is similar the ukus extrad ition treaty which heretofore has governed extradition to hong kong does not allow for judicial role in assessing the motives of an extradition request or howthe judicial system will treat person who is transferred in january 21 1997 statement issued in

foreign penal law nevertheless the increase in transnational financial and drug crime has ledto series of bilateral agreements known as mutual legal assistance treaties mlats to assistforeign prosecutions even now however the shared interest in facilitating the prosecution oftransnational crime is viewed as being outweighed at times by unwillingness to provide information to those with different standards of criminality and professional conduct the senate approved an mlat with the uk during the summer of 1996 unlike the case with the usuk extradition treaty we do not know of any exchange of notes that apply theuk mlat to hong kong still hong kong authoritie s have been directly negotiating mutual legal assistance agreement with the united states an agreement apparently has

ensure hong kongs separate treatment in the case of the prisoner transfer agreement there may be implications for the united states and china if prisoners being transferred to hong k ong routinely refuse to give their consent as required by us law given the us district court case future cases under the newextradition agreement may also be challenged on the grounds that prc itself while having approved the agreement is not the signatory party to resolve some of these difficulties someus officials may advise pressing the prc to give written notification of its approval for newtreaties and

before issuing the certificate the chief executive must obtaina certifying document from the chinese central government 3 related to concerns over acts of state there is also concern about whether
