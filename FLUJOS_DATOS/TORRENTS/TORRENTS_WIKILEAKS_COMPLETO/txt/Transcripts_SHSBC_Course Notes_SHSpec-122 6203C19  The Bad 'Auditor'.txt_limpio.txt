6203c19 shspec122 the bad auditor this lecture is based on hcob 8mar62 the bad auditor and hcob 15mar62 suppressors person who becomes bad auditor has concentration on single ability like all aberration insanity is nothing else than an insane person does something to the exclusion of all else the psychiatrist errs in thinking that the conduct of the insane is insane when what makes it insane is the concentration on one area or behavior exclusively to an intensity that is contrasurvival if you did everything insane people do you would be acting sane this avoidance mechanism is present in everyone to some degree but the case we are talking about the bad auditor gets extreme reactions to running the revelation process see hcob 8mar62 the bad auditor there is an interesting approach to terror charge case that lrh used once he had the pc move to the beginning of track and scan forward to present time this got the pc stuck in the engram necessary to resolve the case which was where he was anyhow and the terror turned on so hard that all four legs of the couch started chattering on the floor the pc found and ran the incident and got the terror charge off if person can have as much charge as that imagine how much charge could be trapped in valence that is terrified through and through terror is the result of something having appeared engramically and then threatening to appear again an emotional charge always has an incident of physical pain underlying it person cannot experience misemotional charge independent of having received physical pain hence the term secondary if someone has the pain incident subsequent similar incidents can be associated with it and can restimulate the past pain if the pc hasnt become accustomed to such events one way or another he will suppress perception of the environment as being similar to the first incident and hence unsafe if the auditor is restimulator for the pc the pc will always omit pointing at the the auditor during havingness until he gets sufficiently familiar with the environment and aware of it to key out at this point the pc sees the auditor and breathes sigh of relief ie the pc finds the auditor the guy who has somatic and hence suppressor if asked have you ever had something happen to your stomach will say yes probably has the one who has had mysterious stomach somatic would say which is dead giveaway of the suppressor person suppresses environmental restimulators using the suppress in the original incident the original impulse to unmock for instance the car in the original incident is used to unmock the restimulator just before he was hit by the car he tried to unmock the car crunch it hit him anyway that made him lose but that same crunch later comes down to unmock the restimulators and the first incident appears to be unmocked thetan never gives up he has pictures of the car unmocked in the bank when you run it out you have to run out the unmock before you get the actual incident doing touch assist the time it takes to run out the suppressor is the time it takes for the physical pain to turn on if he wasnt suppressing and if he wasnt in such games condition with mest here is what would happen the car hits him splat he hits telephone pole splat he lands on the road and gets run over by bus splat if he didnt feel so undignified he would simply have said splat splat splat and picked up the body uninjured the somatic would have run out instantly but because of his notis the somatic stays in place that is the source of disease somatics etc person goes through various phases of notis and persons impulse towards notis if failed can turn into an alteris his alteris can turn into notis and his notis into alteris so he can have suppression stacked with change and that is dubin dubin follows failed suppression below the level of unconsciousness dreams are dubins alterises of the things you cant notis when as an auditor you feel bit leery about auditing somebody you have entered into specialized field of suppression some auditors have difficulty only with certain types of pcs their suppression on particular type of being is the prevention of restimulator they are afraid something is going to appear they are suppressing something the result is to prevent the pc from talking to the auditor in thousands of guises the pc mustnt originate he mustnt give up withholds change get acknowledged etc there are zillions of variations of ways to produce this effect including premature ack eval inval overcontrol undercontrol q and etc etc all these ways combine to produce every auditing fault formerly the only cure we had was to keep the student at it long enough to run it out by gaining familiarity with pcs and discovering that they didnt reveal anything which damaged him some however never did get used to it they took the route of suppressing pcs about 20 about 30 got over it rather slowly and 50 rather easily with varying degrees of speed the length of time required in training is directly proportional to the number of suppressors you are trying to overcome in the student they are dealing with the root stuff of aberration of course there is likely to be revealed from the pc some restimulator in the likely event that this occurs these students will suppress the pcs comm the way to handle this requires drills and familiarization with suppression and finding who or what would suppress get these things sorted out to clear up the mechanism who is the person with the field black v invisible field etc its the person with tremendous suppression blackness is difficulty of recognition invisibility which is rarer is suppression of glass objects person with black field is more likely to suppress at night than during the day the person who is suppressing thetans also gets an invisible field whenever you suppress something in given timestream you of course suppress time so time becomes the primary suppression giving the instantaneousness of all time in the reactive mind because of the notising of the reactive mind everybody is trying to suppress some things normal survival conduct calls for suppression of countersurvival impulses we go down from that to suppressing things that are liable to appear thence to suppressing things that are likely to become known the withhold then suppressing things which are likely to think this gives lots of failures and invisible fields and various complications and automaticities of suppression it is only the person who has suppression of banks on total automatic completely out of his own control who is dangerous as an auditor he wont let pc ever reveal anything so the pc gets stuck in everything he utters if process works today this auditor will drop it he will only run processes that are flat the auditor will q and goof only pick up safe withholds and miss all the ones that it could do the pc good to reveal which the pc is willing to reveal if asked this auditor is dangerous because missing withholds will arc break pcs and drive them out of scientology the auditor doesnt intend this he just intends to do good safe job where one gets upset or reveals anything in study if the person never lets the sense of the bulletin or tape to come through nothing will be revealed everyone to some degree has staggeringly bad memory thanks to their overts the person who has lot of overts is the last to be aware of it because of her suppression person will help another to the degree of tolerance he has for something being revealed this works into blackmail if you dont help ill reveal something about you the reverse is to help someone unless they are likely to reveal something that is the bad auditor and the bad student this is what keeps people from employing the technology even when they know it
