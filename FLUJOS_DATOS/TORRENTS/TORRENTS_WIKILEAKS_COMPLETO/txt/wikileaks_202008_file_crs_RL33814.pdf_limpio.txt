finance in federal campaigns and has enacted major statutes to prevent real or apparent corruption and to curb undue influence by wealthy individuals and interest groups that legislation has required disclosure limited or banned certain funding sources or limite d certain expenditures to critics public campaign financing generally in conjunc tion with spending limits is the ultimate solution to perceived problems arising from evergrowing costs of campaigns and the accompanying need for privately donated campaign funds public financing supporters ma intain that replacing priv ate funds with public money would most effectively reduce potentially corrupting influence from interested money on the other hand opponents of pub lic financing question whether real or apparent corruption from private fundraising is as serious problem as critics claim they also argue that public financing w ould be an inappropriate use of taxpayer dollars and would compel taxpayers to fund candidates they find objectionable in the early 1970s supporters succeeded in enacting public financing in presidential elections system that has been available since 1976 in addition many states and localities have pr ovided public financing in their elections since the 1970s or before today 16 states offer some form of direct aid to candidates campaigns through fixed subsidies or matching funds perceptions about the presidential and state public financing systems have shaped opinions about adding public financing to congressional elections also shapin g that debate was the supreme courts landmark 1976 buckley v valeo ruling which struck down mandatory spending limits but sanctioned voluntary spending limits accompanying public financing proposals for publicly funded congressiona l elections have been offered in almost every congress since 1956 the issu was prominently debated in the mid 1970s and the late 1980s through early 1990s proposals were passed twice by the senate in the 93rd congress and by both the h ouse and senate in the 101st 102nd and 103rd congresses only the 102nd congress proposal was r econciled in conference but was vetoed by the president in the 101st through 103rd congresses resistance to public funding was sufficiently strong that the proposed role of public funds per was reduced while broader public benefits such as advertising vouchers became more prominent

sections mr cant or was responsible for the detailed legislative history that appears in this report public financing of congressional campaigns overview and analysis introduction1 overview of report this first section provides the cont ext for the debate on extending public financing to congressional elections beginning with discussion of two major political realities that inform th at debate the first is th presidential public financing system that has been in place since 1976 nd has had mixed success in realizing the goals of its original sponsors the sec ond is the in terplay between the concepts of public financing and campaign spending limits which are often linked but which have very distinct characteristics the 1976 landmark supreme court decision in buckley v valeo contributed to that linkage because of its allowance for only voluntary spending limits such as in conjunc tion with public financing system the section concludes with summary of arguments for and against public financing arguments which have not changed in essence over time but which have been shaped by the political realities noted above the second section provides historical review of fforts in congress to enact public financing of its elections although some attention is pa id to presidential public financing as precursor the sec tion begins with brief review of early congressional interest and activity in the 20th century followed by more detailed congressbycongress discussion beginning with the 90th congress special attention is paid to the two periods in which congressional activity on public financing was the greatest the watergatefocused 93rd congress and the 100th 103rd congresses public finance bills were passed by at least one chamber in those two periods although the tter period was marked by move toward downplaying public funds per in favor of the broader concept of pub lic benefits the section concludes with review of the major feat ures of congressional proposals presented as policy options to choose from in devisi ng congressional public finance system the third section examines the experience of the 16 states which provide some form of public subsidies to candidates for st ate office this section features table table 1 detailing these systems and concludes with an analysis of the impact of public finance programs in the stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs2 2 on these and other campaign fi nance issues see crs report rl34324 campaign finance legislative developments and policy issues in the 110th congress by r sam garrett 3 424 us 1 1976the fourth section offers discussi on of public opinion data on support for public financing of elections as well as for the related idea of campaign spending limits public opinion is not as extensiv on these questions as in the 1970s when the idea of public financing was particularly prominent the final section reviews the experience from public finance systems at both the state and presidential levels to offer so overarching observations for congress possibly to consider in devising public finance system for its elections should it choose to do so the report concludes with three appendices to augment the information in the section on congressional proposals the first appendix is table table 2 providing details of the public finance or benefits measures that have passed either chamber from 1973 1993 because they passed at leas t one chamber these bills are perhaps the most important for congress to review before beginning fresher look at the idea to allow more contemporary look at how recent public finance proposals have evolved the second appendix provides mmary of the four public finance bills proposed in the 109th congress third appendi x provides summary of public financing bills introduced in the 110th congress what has happened most recently in congress the most recent legislative development2 surrounding c ongressiona l public financing occurred in late september 2008 when representative larson introduced hr 7022 that bill has not been the subject of additional legislative action the only hearing on congressional public financ ing legislation occurred in june 2007 when the senate committee on rules and administration considered s 1285 and related issues that bill has not been reported from committee none of the five congressional public financing bills introduced in the 110th congress have received floor consideration add itional discussion appears ter in this report underpinnings of contemporary congressional debate while public financing of congressional elections has been advocated for century contemporary discussions of thes proposals are informed by two basic political realities of the past 30 years fi rst the nation has d public financing in presidential elections since 1976 that syst em serves both as model for proposals to extend public financing to congressional elections and as case study of how congressional system might and might not be structured second in striking down mandatory expenditure limits in 1976 while allo wing voluntary limits in the context of public finance syst em the supreme courts buckley v valeo3 ruling resulted in closer linkage between the distinct concepts of public subsidies for election campaigns and limitations on campaign spending

buckley stated congress may engage in public financing of election campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an agreement by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure limitations just as candidate may voluntarily limit the size of the contributions he chooses to accept he may decide to forego private fundraising and accept public fundingpresidential system since the 1970s model since 1976 public funds have helped finance presidential elec tions with the level of funds determined by taxpayer designations on voluntary checkoff this system was established initially under the re venue act of 19714 and augmented by the federal election campaign act feca amendments of 19745 candidates who meet eligibility requirements and agree to voluntary limits on campaign expenditures are eligible for matching funds in the primaries in th general election ma jor party candidates automatically qualify for full subsidies equal to the spending limit in 2004 john kerry and george w bush each received 746 million for their fall campaigns minor party and independent candidates may also qualify fo r public funds by meeting specified criteria also political partie s may receive funding for their nominating conventions add itional discussion of the provisions and evolution of the presidential public financing progra m appear in another crs product6 linkage with spending limits at the outset of any discussion on public financing proposals it is important to address the question of expenditure limits because almost invariably legislative proposals for public funding are linked with candidates adherence to spending limits despite this common linkage public financing and spending limits are distinct concepts with distinct potential benefits and drawbacks public financing of elec tions at its core is aimed at reducing reliance by politicians on private interested sources of money for their elections expenditure limits are ssentially aimed at curbing risi ng and in the view of many excessive amounts of money spent on elections in fact from the time public financing wa s first proposed by president theodore roosevelt in 1907 until the supreme courts 1976 ruling in buckley v valeo 424 us 1 1976 the impetus for passage stemmed more from the concern over the source of campaign money than the overall amount spent in that landmark ruling the court struck down mandatory spending limits such as those imposed on congressional candidate s by the feca amendments of 1974 but allowed that in voluntary system of public financing it wa s permissible to require candidate adherence to spending limits as condition of governmentpr ovided benefit ie public funds7 hence spending limits in conj unction with public funding would be permissible because candidates voluntarily accepted them in light of the buckley decision the prevailing view among policym akers has been that public financing offers the only realistic means of controlling campaign expenditures in congressional elections short of enacting constitutional amendment to allow mandatory limits which congress has refused to support on several occasionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs4 8 donald gross and robert k goidel the states of ca mpaign finance reform columbus oh the ohio state university press 2003 p 10 9 for an overview of some of this testimony representing support for and opposition to bcra see anthony corrado thomas mann and trevor potter eds inside the campaign finance battle court testimony on the new reforms washington brookings institution press 2003finally it should be noted that some of the goals sought in the public funding and spending limit measures have been addr essed in other legisl ation which has been less sweeping yet often with significant bi partisan support proposals to lower campaign costs without spending limits have been prominent in congress at least until enactment of the bipartisan campai gn reform act of 2002 bcra bills to provide free or reduced rate broadcast time and postal rates have sought to reduce campaign costs and the need for money without the possibly negative effects of arbitrary limits bills to provide for tax credits for small individual contributions have sought to encourage greater role for citizens visavis organized interest groups these measures offer the potential of realizing some of the aims of the more comprehensive measures but without some of the perceived pitfalls arguments supporting and oppos ing public financing brief overview supporting few major points are common arguments in favor of public financing supporters say that public fi nancing can reduce the threat of political corruption enhance electoral competition and allow candidates to focus on issues rather than raising money to many observers the amount of money spent in elections today is arguably corrupting the political system forcing candidates and officeholders to spend increasing amounts of time raising money possibly creating pressure on them to rely on affluent indi viduals and special interests for campaign assistance conceivably deterring candi dates without personal fortunes from attempting to run for office and leaving an impression among some voters that elections are bought and sold accordin gly one of the most prominent goals behind public financing is reducing the pot ential for corruption or the appearance of corruption as political scientists donald gross and robert k goidel have explained public subsidies to candidates whether in the form of direct grants or matching funds are seen as way to minimize the undue influence and corruption often ascribed to contributor s and partisan fundraising8 many former lawmakers interest group representatives political professionals nd academic experts submitted written testimony for the mcconnell v fec lawsuit heard by us district court and the suprem court of the united states in their consideration of bcra some of this testimony include d empirical analysis of claims about potentially corrupting influences from private money in campaign politics and related issues9 other public financing goals relate to electoral comp etition public financing provides candidates regardle ss of personal wealth w ith financial resources tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs5 10 see for example

ed welfare for politicians pp 2330wage campaigns10 this allows candidates who mig ht not otherwise run for office to do so as is noted in the discussion of states experiences with public financing most programs require that candidates demonstrate political viability before being eligible for funds if more candidate s have access to funds supporters say that electoral competition should increase finally public financing is attractive to some because it is one of the few constitutional ways to limit campaign spending major concern among campaign reformers although th supreme c ourts 1976 buckley v valeo ruling held that campaign spending generally could not be subjected to mandatory limits candidates could be required to limit spending in exchan ge for receiving public funding as is discussed elsewhere in this report some public financing systems including the presidential one are today in jeopardy because major candidates fear that observing spending limits associated with public financing will preclude them from spending enough money to wa ge competitive campaigns opposing objections to public financing are also varied many are rooted in philosophical opposition to funding elections with taxpayer money compelling taxpayers to support candidates whose view s are antithetical to theirs and adding another government program in the face of some cynicism toward government spending opponents also raise adminis trative concerns how can system be devised that accounts for differe nt natures of districts and states with different styles of campaigning and disparate media costs and is fair to all candidates incumbent challenger or openseat major or minor party serious or longshot similarly opponents assert that public fi nancing could distort elec tions by imposing the same system on 50 different states with different degrees of competitiveness in individual races and by providing even greater advantages to incumbents than already exist thereby decreasing the competitiveness of elections in view of the relatively low rate of participation in the voluntary checko ff for the existing presidential system 92 of taxpayers checked yes on their 2004 tax returns when asked if they wanted to fund the system they see little evidence th at the public would favor such plan some public financing opponents believe that g overnmentfunded campaign subsides amount to welfare for politicians11 and are an inappropriate use of taxpayer dollars12 these opponent s argue that public financing could coerce candidates into limiting their campaign spending viewed as form of political speech in exchange for funding or that it could force taxpayers to indirectly fund campaign messages they might find objecti onable on related note opponents suggest that public financing could waste taxpayer money on fringe candidates whohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs6 13 see for example chip mellor three lessons from arizona in john samples ed welfare

primo reform wit hout reason the scientific method and campaign finance in welfare for politicians pp 197211 17 ibidrepresent political views that may be far outside the mainstream and who have little chance of winning elections13 in response to arguments that public funding is necessary to limit campaign expenditures those opposed to public fina ncing often argue that campaign spending is not high especially compared with commercial advertisin g budgets or spending on consumer goods14 they argue that worthy candidates will win public support without government intervention via public fi nancing some researchers also suggest that concerns about rising campaign costs are overstated and that most campaign fundraising comes from individuals who give less than the legal limit15 finally opponents of public financing sometimes argu that proponents fail to sufficiently support their arguments in favor of public financing relying instead on the selfevidence of its appeal16 for example although the appearance of corruption or potential corruption is comm on argument in favor of public financing political scientists jeffrey milyo and david primo have found that scholarly research on the topic is limited or anecdotal the sa they say is true for fears about declining trust in government and declining voter turnout which some contend could be buoyed by public financing17 legislative proposals for public financing of congressional elections while the idea of public financing of federal elections was first proposed in 1907 it was not until the 1950s that bills were first introduced in congress to implement such plan since that time legislative proposals have been offered in nearly every congress while the extent of legislative activity around the issue has varied according to the political climate nd circumstances in two very active periods bills to extend public financing to congressional elec tions have passed one or both houses but were never enacted in the first period during the 93rd congress 19731974 the senate twice passed bills for public funding in congressional elections widely seen as responsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs7 18 robert mutch campaigns

later deleted in conference in view of some strong opposition in the house in the second period the 100th through 103rd congresses 19871993 the house and senate spent considerab amounts of time debating b ills that featured the twin ideas of voluntary spending limits nd public financing in the 101st 102nd and 103rd congresses both chambers actually passed such bills the 102nd congress bill was vetoed by president george hw bush but the bills in the other two congresses were never reconciled in conference in contrast to the first period when one of the senatepasse d bills covered both primary and general elections bills in the second period offered benefits only for general election candidates more broadly efforts in the more recent period reflected move toward paring down the level of public treasury funds going to campaigns in light of less favorable political clima the emphasis in this second period shifted from public funds per to public benefits public benefits were those either financed with public resources whether directly as with public subsidies or indirectly as with revenue forgone from tax incentives or postal discounts or mandated by government action such as requirements for reduced broadcast rates at cost to the us treasury the common element was that they all constituted incentives to participation in voluntary system based on campaign spending limits evolution during the early 20th century the earliest suggestion to congress of public subsidies for election campaigns was apparently made by pr esident theodore roosevelt in 1907 in his annual message to congress roosevelt saw reforms such as requiring disclosure and prohibiting corporate contributions as worthwhile but difficult to enforce and inadequate in deterring an unscrupulous man of unlimite d means from buying his own way into office he suggested an admittedly radical approach of providing ample appropriations to the major national political parties to fund their organization and machinery parties receiving federal m onies were to be limited to fixed amount that could be raised from individual contri butors all of which would be disclosed to the public it is unclear from the text of his message the rele vant portion of which is reprinted below whether roosevelt intended this plan to be limited to presidential as opposed to all federal campaigns at the time given the political parties central role in financing all electi on campaigns the distinction may not have been as great as it would be today when ca ndidates take the lead role in financing their campaigns in any case the section of the message was titled presidential campaign expenseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs8 19 theodore roosevelt annual message of the president of the united states congressional

duty and moreover fundamental and necessary duty if man is to be good citizen it is well to provide that corporations shall not contribute to presidential or national campaigns and furthermore to provide for the publication of both contributions and expenditures there is however always danger in laws of this kind which from their very nature are di fficult of enforcement the danger being lest they be obeyed only by the honest and disobeyed by the unscrupulous so as to act only as penalty upon honest men moreover such law would hamper an unscrupulous man of unlimited means from buying his own way into office there is very radical measure which would i believe work substantial improvement in our system of conducting campaign although i am well aware that it will take some time for people so to familiarize themselves with such proposal as to be willing to consider its adoption the need for collecting large campaign funds would vanish if cong ress provided an appropriation for the proper and legitimate expenses of each of the great national parties an appropriation ample enough to meet the necessity for thorough organization and machinery which requires large expenditure of money then the stipulation should be made that party receiving campaign funds from the treasury should accept more than fixed amount from any individual subscriber or donor and the necessary publicity for receipts and expenditures could without difficulty be provided19 roosevelt was not exaggerating when he commented that it would take some time for people to familiarize themselves with such proposal from the mid1920s through the 1970s lect and special committees had been established by every congress predominan tly on the senate side to investigate campaign expenditures presidential or congressional in recent elections reports issued at the conclusion of the work of these committees often included recommendations designed to correct shortcomings perceived in existing campaign finance practices in 1937 during the 75th congress the report of the senates special committee to investigate campaign expenditures of presidential vice presidential and senatorial candidates in 1936 was release d included in its section of recommendations was proposal for public funding of all fede ral elections which the committee passed along without judgment as to its merits all private contributions were to be prohibited under this pla n under recommendation 9 the report said it has been suggested that private contributions to political campaigns be prohibited entirely and that instead ll election campaign expenses should be defrayed from public funds20 congress apparently took action on this proposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs9 21 mutch campaigns congress and courts p 36 22 henry cabot lodge jr investigation of problems involved in federal financing of presidential election campaigns congressional record vol 95 july 6 1949 p 8888 23 ibidinterest in public funding of political campaigns has often been aroused by allegations of unethical c onduct by public officials for accepting particular campaign contributions such was the case on july 6 1949 when senator henry cabot lodge jr introduced resolution to commission study by the committee on rules and administration on the mechanics of estab lishing system of public funding of presidential campaigns in introducing his resolu tion lodge res ponded to rumors government corruption21 the resolution sres 132 read as follows resolved that the senate committee on rules and administration is authorized and directed to make full and complete study and investigation for the purpose of obtaining such information with respect to the problems involved in financing with governmental funds presidential ection campaigns in the united states as may be necessary to enable the committ ee to formulate and report at the earliest practicable date bill providing for such method of financing presidential election campaigns 22 lodges support for this concept the deta ils of which he envisioned coming out of congressional study was summed up in th is excerpt from his floor statement all this talk of an office market and of putting high executive and diplomatic positions on the auction block all th is breeding of suspicion and cynicism would disappear i believe overnight if the primary cause of the evil were obliterated at its root if private i ndividual or officer of corporation were permitted by statute to contribute one cen t to presidential campaign there would be far cleaner atmosphere surrounding political appointments and this would encourage publicspirited men holding public office if there are bidders there can be auction23 lodge acknowledged that the same principle could also be applied to other offices but he was limiting his suggestion to pres idential races because of the enormous number of appointments to public office at th presidents disposal apparently the type of corruption which motivated lodge in sres 132 was the selling of government positions rather than the broa der notion of trading influence or access on policy questions for campaign contributions concern over the latter possibility would be likely prerequisite for any pr oposal for public financ ing of congressional campaigns action was taken on s res 132 by the committee on rules and administration first public finance bills during the 84th congress the name of theodore roosevelt was invoked when the first public funding b ills were intr oduced in congress almost 50 years after being sugge sted by roosevelt on february 20 1956 senator richard neuberger introduced s 3242 to provide for direct public subsidies for all major party campaigns fo r federal office cosponsored

as the chief congressional proponent of public financing at the time26 declared that s 3242 was the most farreaching bill ever proposed to strike loose the financia l fetters from our demo cratic processes of government27 the final impetus for the bill wa s the recent revelation of large campaign contribution offered to senato r by an oil company during debate on removing federal controls from natural gas prices the alleged bribery attempt contributed to neubergers view that these contributions in my opinion have become an unbearable yoke to many of the men who must accept them they even have become onerous and objectionable to the individuals w ho parcel out such contributions28 neuberger based his proposal on the belief that the system of raising campaign funds from private sources hampered the indepe ndence of public offi cials created doubts among the public about the integrity of th government and created an inequality in gaining access to voters by various candidates he continued in his statement to articulate what would remain the major motivation for later advocates of publicly financed elections an undemocratic element is introduced when one nominee can eclipse his opponent not because of superiority of ability or of his policies but merely through preponderance of coin of the realm29we would not dream of permitting our presidents or our senators and representatives to draw their pay from private payroll or in the form of pr ivate contributions they get paid by the public for whom they act why then leave their campaigns for these offices to be lavishly financed from private sources30 neubergers bill provided for the allotme nt of federal funds to the major political parties to be used for campaign expenditures of its candidates for federal

these sources did not exceed the total federal donation the term matching funds was used by neuberger to describe the system but it differed from the present system of ma tching funds in presidential primaries in that the federal subsidy in the latter case is determined by the amount raised privately in the neuberger proposal the am ount that could be raised privately was to be determined by how much the fede ral subsidy would be the proposed system was to be administered by federal camp aign contributions board to include an administrator and one representative from each major party 1950s

few bills providing direct public financ ing were introduced in nearly every congress since the 84th congress 19551956 but most of these were proposed and supported by small minority of members greater number of proposals in this period however did include indirect public fi nancing of elections in the form of tax credits and deductions in 1962 report was released by th presidents commission on campaign costs established the previous year by president john f kennedy to make recommendations for improving campa ign finance practices and laws32 while the report was ostensibly focused on presid ential elections its findings were more broadly applicable to all fe deral elections because of th extent to which the political parties were at that time the major financiers of all federal campaigns its recommendations which included tax incen tives to encourage individual donations to political parties did not include the pr oposal urged on it by many for direct public subsidies rather the commission expresse d concern for public financings potential to discourage citizen participation in campaigns to redistribute power arbitrarily within the parties to encourage fraud and to be administered unfairly however the commission expressed interest in matching incentive system whereby small individual donations to partie s would be equally matched with us treasury funds such system

for public financing in congress given generally strong re publican opposition to both public financing and spending limits public finance bills continued to be introduced in every congress including in the 104th when senators john mc cain and russell feingold introduced their first campaign finance reform bill establishing themselves as the senates leading reform dvocates that bill s 1219 was the successor to the bills passed in the previous three congresses and it reflected the same pre1996 consensus among campaign finance reform advocates that prioritized curbing the high cost of congressional elections and replacing private funds w ith other funding sources the election of 1996 proved to be wate rshed in the campaign finance debate as largely unregulated campaign activity party soft money and electionrelated issue advocacy seemed to overshadow the regulated activity in response the leading reform advocates in congress made signifi cant changes in their proposed legislation at the start of the 105th congress s 25 mccainfeingold as well as its companion hr 493 shaysmeehan added pr ovisions to the comparable 104th congress bills to allow federal regulation of electionrelated activity th being conducted as issue advocacy following the most intensive congressional activity on campaign finance reform since the 1970s revised s 25 wa s offered in the fall of 1997 featuring provisions on party soft money and issue advocacy what was striking was that the provisions on congressional spending limits and public benefits and on pacs the key elements of reformers objectives for at least the previous 10 years were eliminated from the bill entirely thus in one yea rs time the very nature of the campaign finance debate d shifted from efforts to improve the existing regulatory system to efforts to save it from becoming meaningless in the face of newly emerging campaign practices this debate in the wa ke of the 1996 elections was to last until 2002

imposed nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs24 spending limit the obey bill would have established mandatory spending limit based on the median household income in the district and would have provided public funds to equal those limits the benefit would have been financed in part by tax on corporate income the bill provided for fasttrack consideration of constitutional amendment to allow mandatory spending limits if the limits in the bill were struck down the other two bills hr 3099 tierney and hr 5281 leach would have offered benefits in both primary and general elections the leach bill would have provided funds to matc h contributions from insta contributors and would have imposed 500000 per election spending limit the tierney bill was the clean money clean elections measure which w ould have provided pub lic subsidies equal to the spending limit in the primary and ge neral election specified allotments of free broadcast time and additional broadcast time at 50 of the lowest unit rate

congressional districts in the state similarly the house and senate bills propose different methods for formulating the base public funding allocation for major candidates for house candidates under

similar allocation but the base amount would be 80 rather than 100 of the national average of expenditures by winning house ca ndidates in the past two election cycles for senate candidates per s 936 nd s 1285 the base would be 750000 plus 150000 for each congressional district in excess of 1 district in the state in which the candidate was running in all cases the base amounts would be adjusted for media rates in the state an index to be determined by the fec and the federal communications commission and biannually based on th consumer price index the four bills differ regarding support for broadcast communications although hr 1614 would provide free broadcast time to publicly financed candidates hr 7022 s 936 and s 1285 would provide political advertising vouchers to participating candida tes hr 7022 s 936 and s 1285 specify that candidates may for cash value transfer their right to ll or portions of their vouchers to party committees under all four bills publicly financed candidates could purchase additional time at rate s below the lowest unit charge luc hr 1614 would reduce charges to publicly financed candidates to 50 of the luc while hr 7022 s 936 and s 1285 would reduce that rate to 80 of the luc hr 1614 would deny the luc to nonparticipating candi dates the other three bills do not specify such provision various other provisions in the bills also vary s 936 s

chairman and interest group representatives at that hearing senators durbin and specter and former senator warren rudman testified in favor of the bill saying that it was modest step toward reducing the role of money in elections and means to restoring public trust in governme nt in particular senator durbin emphasized what he called an unsustainable current system of private fundraising that potentially sepa rates lawmakers from average voters and distracts them from policymaking minority leader mcconnell testified against the bill citing declining public participation in the presid ential public financing system and philosophical opposition to public financin g for politicians chairman feinstein and ranking member bennett both expressed concerns at the hearing about the possibility of fringe candidates receiving public funds in letter to committee members the national association of broadcasters nab expressed great concern about proposed luc reductions for participating candidate s and sections of s 1285 that would bar broadcasters from preemp ting candidate adver tising and fund public financing through spectrum usage fees94 devising congressional public finance system options for policymakers based on the previous discussion of propos als that advanced in the legislative process one can see the wide range of f eatures that any public finance proposal might embody this section enumerates some of the basic options facing congress in any consideration of such proposals further potential considerati ons for congressional public financing are discussed in the conclusion of this re port these considerations are based in part on experiences in the st ates which are discussed in the following section crs takes position on an of the options presented herehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs28 95 see for example gary c jacobson money in congressi onal elections pp 183190 citizens research foundation new realities new thinking report of the task force on campaign finance reform pp 1819 majority views 96 david w adamany and george agree political money strategy for campaign financing in america baltimore the johns hopkins university press 1975 pp 179180setting expenditu re limits establishing the limits on campaign expenditures is perhaps the thorniest aspect of devising public financing system it has become widely accepted in the politi cal science community that to the extent that high spending in elections reflects desirable level of competitiveness low spending limits can inhibit real competition95 in other words low spending limits may reduce the chances for lesser known candi dates to defeat ca ndidates with higher visibility and name recognition it was this principle that has of ten led public finance and spending limit proposals to be labeled by critics as incumbent protection measures because incumbents typically st art elections with much higher visibility than their challengers spending limits for house campaigns have almost always been specified acrosstheboard amo unt 6000 00 in the last bill to pass the house in 1993 whereas the senate limits have generally reflected popul ationbased formula as late as 1997 when the initial mccainf eingold bill was offered in the 105th congress the formula in senate elections was essentially the same one incorporated into s 2 the leadership substitute in the 100th congress in general election the lesser of 55 million or b the greater of i 950000 or ii 400000 plus 30 cents times the voting age population vap up to 4 million and 25 cents times the vap over 4 million in primary 67 of general election limit up to 275 million and for runoff 20 of the general election limit the challenge for policymakers is to choose spending limit that takes into account the realities of toda ys campaigns allowing sufficient opportunity for genuine competition which serves the publics interest one way to offset potential damage to the vibrancy of the electoral process resulting from too stringent limits would be to increase the generosity of pub lic funds and benefits to lessen the need for both raising and spending money coverage general elections only or primary elections too while the bills that advanced in the 1970s included public funds in the primaries most measures in more recent congresses have covered only general elections this has been the case not so much because the s ponsors have not favored such coverage but more because of strategic decisions about the reduced likelihood of enacting more complicated and more expensive system some have stated that they would settle for public funding in general elections for now and hopefully later return to the primary issue after some experience with general election system to some however the lack of inclusion of primaries may repres ent serious flaw in recent proposals with the prospect of private money entering the electoral system earlier and expenditures aimed at influencing the general election made during primaries all to evade the restrictions of the ge neral election system96 the bills debated in the 100th 103rd congresses incorporated the concept of providing benefits only in the generalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs29 election but conditioning those benefits on adherence to voluntary spending limits in the primary as well as the general election conditions for receipt of public benefits invariably proposals condition receipt of benef its on adherence to voluntary spending limits whether solely in the election where the benefits are offered or in the primary as well as the general election most also require ca ndidates to limit spending from personal and immediate family funds to specified amount g enerally applicable to loans as well some bills have added requirement that candidates participate in specified number of debates and bills that passe d in the 1990s added the requirement that broadcast ads must include closedcaptioning there is considerable latitude in what conditions may be imposed on candidates participating in this voluntary system qualifying requirements in addition to requiring adherence to spending limits proposals typically have some sort of qualifying requirement to prove candidate is serious ie that he or she has some degree of public support most often the qualifying requirement is fundr aising threshold comprising relatively small donations from specified number of voters in that jurisdicti on petition signatures is another option public funds matching funds or fixed subsidies this choice may be informed by the experience the nation has had under the presidential system for the past 30 years in which matching funds are available in the primaries and fixed subsidies are offered to candidates in the ge neral election as is discussed in the next section the states also use mix of these two forms of subsidies fixed subsidies offer the advantage of simplicity and pr oviding candidates greater ability to plan their campaigns but depending on the percentage of the spending limit the grant is intended to constitute it can result in much greater cost in the presidential system for example major candidates in the general election get subsidy equal to the spending limit th matching fund appr oach would generally be less expensive and would offer the dvantage of linking the receipt of public money with demonstration of voter ppeal by the candidate matching fund systems may offer the advantage of avoi ding complex legislative or regulatory judgments about who is and is not s erious candidate with the meeting of fundraising thresholds and the continuing raising of small donations considered an adequate means of so doing if matching fund system is preferred there is also the consideration of whether f unds should match contributions on an equal basis or higher percentage some bills have proposed two or threetoone match at least in some circumstances public benefits ot her than direct subs idies to candidates whereas the bills that advanced in c ongress during the postwatergate 1970s were based on either direct subsid ies or matching funds the most prominent measures of the late 1980s and early 1990s reflected move away from direct public funding to candidates instead those bills featured ither more indirect forms of public funding or costreducing benefits that did not invol ve public f unds at all these indirect public funding and public bene fits measures often design ed to increase chances for passage in the face of perceived public oppos ition to use of public funds in elections offer additional ideas in structuring sp ending limits and public benefits packagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs30 indirect public funding several ideas have ga ined support in congress at various times that make use of public funds in ways other than direct payments from the us treasury to the candidates including the following tax credits for contributions to candidates abiding by limits this could provide grassroots fundrai sing incentive to candidates who agree to limit their expenditures most commonly this takes the form of 100 tax credit for c ontributions to participating candidates such form of public funding is determined by citizens decisions at the grassroots level rather than decisions of government agency which supporters see as an important advantage presumably the prospect of raising small donations much more easily would provide sufficient in centive for candidates to agree to limit spending most observers of the political system argue that the best kind of political money is that from individual citizens in small amounts it should be noted that from 19721986 the federal government allowed tax deductions or credits for political contributions but they were eliminated as part of overall tax reform also many states have such incentiv applicable to contributions in their elections broadcast vouchers to candidates the single largest component of the typical campaign budget at least for statewide and national offices and the biggest single factor in the rise of campaign costs in recent years has been broadcast advertising pr oposals have been advanced whereby candidates woul d be allocated specified amounts of broadcast vouchers for which br oadcasters woul d be reimbursed from the federal treasury under th is plan public monies do not get distributed directly to candidates thus at least ostensibly avoiding some of the objections to public fi nancing per while focusing on what many consider the biggest single problem in campaign financing the high cost of dia however the mechanics of implementing such plan particularly in districts served by high density highcost media markets pose potential concerns in terms of fairness and the particul ars of individual campaigns lower postal rates for candidates abiding by limits another proposal which seeks to draw candidates into acceptance of campaign spending limits is one which offers participating candidates lower postal rates such as those currently available to political party committees this proposal involves public funds but only indirectly because the us postal service would have to be reimbursed for revenue forgone as result of its implementation it is not clear to what extent lower postal rate may serve as an inducement to candidates to limit spending since postage is not large component in typical cam paign budget although it may well be more important in house than senate races especially in high density media markets where media costs are seen as often prohibitively expensive lower postal rates do offer the advantage of acting to reduce campaign costs generally seen as worthwhilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs31 goal regardless of ones position on spending limits or public financing public benefits without public funds proposals that passed in the 101st 103rd congresses and the natepassed version of the bcra mccain feingold in the 107th congress looked to broadcasters to offer some of the incentive toward candidate par ticipation because of broadcas ters public interest obligations as part of their license agr eements sponsors sought to re quire broadcasters to offer lower rates to candidates pa rticipating in public funding as condition of their licenses and at cost to the us treasury on the basis of this principle the federal government has since 1972 required broadcaste rs to charge political candidates at the lowest unit rate lur available to commercial advertisers for the same time and class of advertising time some proposals have g one beyond requiring stilllower rates to requiring broadcasters to provide specified amounts of free time to participating candidates to the extent that these costs are removed from candidates the overall cost of elections could be signif icantly curbed which as with lower postal rates would appeal to many observers regardless of their views on spending limits and public financing yet such proposal s invariably invite strong opposition from the broadcast industry while the senate version of bcra in the 107th congress offered substantial reductions in broadcas t rates to candidates this provision was removed in the house on floor amendment protecting participants from freespending opponents and outside groups one concept present in most bills offered since the 100th congress but absent from the presidential sy stem is protection ffered to candidates who participate in public fi nancing but are faced with large expenditures by non participating opponents or ar targeted in independent expenditures from outside groups most commonly provisions design ed to remedy such situations would increase spending limits on participants to match expenditures by opponents in excess of the spe nding limits and by independent expenditures in amounts above specified level andor provide participants w ith additional public f unds to match excessive spending from nonparticipating opponents or for opposing independent expenditures perh aps with cap on overall funds provided in this circumstance providing additional funds or allowing for supplementary private funding to participating candida tes facing nonpartic ipating opponents offers protection against being greatly outspent and presumably w ould deter candidates considering forgoing public financing potential problem with these disincentives is the increased costs they would add to public funding system costs not easily predictable what has not been reflected in recent proposals but may have to be addressed in future ones is the activity by outside groups such as 527 po litical organizations that spend money outside the purview of federal election law ie soft money other disincentives tow ard nonparticipation while public finance bills have typically focused on offering be nefits as an inducement toward agreeing to expenditure limits more recent proposals ve also looked to add disincentives ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs32 97 see crs report rs21716 political organizations under section 527 of the internal revenue code by erika lunderwell to impose some sort of penalty on candidates not participating in the system beyond providing benefits to the partic ipating opponent these proposals appeal to those who would like to lessen the role of public funds but still wish to achieve meaningful levels of par ticipation in the system critics see these proposals as heavyhanded measures designed to bludg eon candidates into participating thus casting doubts on whether participation can fair ly be deemed to be voluntary some of the disincentives advanced in recent years include the following requiring disclaimer on campaign advertisements of candidates nonparticipation this provisi on requiring nonparticipants to state in their ads that they do not abide by spending limits was included in senate bills passed in the 101st 103rd congresses disallowing lowest unit rate requi rement for nonparticipants this provision included in the 101st congress senate bill as passed would have removed the lowest it rate requirement for candidates not participating in the system and tax campaigns of nonpartic ipating candidates political campaigns are generally exempt from paying taxes on money raised97 the senate bill passed in the 103rd congress removed the exempt function income excl usion on principal campaign committees of candidates who exceeded spending limits thus in effect subjecting those campaigns to 34 tax conditional public subsidies one idea closely related to the proposals in the prior two sections is to provide public funds only as last resort when participant is faced by an opponent w ho exceeded spending limits or by opposing independent expenditures as is explaine d in the state experiences section that follows some states feature such provi sion aimed at curbing arguably excessive campaign spending without incurring the ex pense to the taxpayers that most public finance systems would incur it would be applied on very sel ective basis and would presumably act as strong inhibitor against only the most excessive campaign spending the senate bill passed in the 103rd congress contained this feature in addition to the direct incentives of lower postal and broadcast rates paying for public financing clearly the decisions made about the aforementioned variables w ill determine the cost of any public finance system estimates of costs of public finance syst ems vary considerably according to the details of the systems envisioned for bills considered in the 101st 103rd congresses one can look to the require d congressional budget office cbo cost estimates bearing in mind that the bills passed were often changed substantially from those reported and for which estimates were provided at the start of the 103rd congress the senate rules and administration committee reported s 3 which

candidate spending in those elections p ublic campaigns website states the cost of implementing such system for congressional elections is estimated to be less than billion dollars per year out of federal budget of close to two trillion dollars thats about half of 10th of percent of the federal budget 005 that amounts to less than 10 pertaxpayer peryear 99 thus by public campaigns estimates congressional elections would cost somewhat less than 2 billion every election cycle most proposals since the mid1970s have relied upon tax checkoff based on the presidential model whereby taxpayers could designate certain number of tax dollars to go into the fund to pay for c ongressional elections this idea is intended to mitigate negative images that might aris from taxpayer funding of elections because of the direct role provided c itizens in the distribution of tax revenues because of those perceptions however the 101st 103rd congresses sought creative ways to offset any losses to the us treas ury or remained silent on funding sources leaving those decisions to subsequent enacting legisla tion proposals since that time have looked to such things as broad cast licensing fees tax on lobbyists and tax on corporate income to offset treasury losses100httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs34 100 continued subsidies currently cost taxpayers far more than what it would cost to provide

and is relatively recent initiative other public financing programs in the states vary widely many of the latter programs we re initiated in the 1970s in the watergate aftermath some of the most notable di fferences between clean money models and other programs are how candidates receive public funding and how much money is available to those candidates although clean money funds are generally distributed through subsidies that allocate fixed amounts to candidates states that employ other programs rely primarily on matching funds the amount of matching funds candidates receive depends on the amount of private contributions raised states generally match 100 and sometimes more of th amount candidate raises through private contributions whether clean money models or other systems public financing programs do not guarantee unlimited funds states gene rally limit the percentage of contributions that may be matched or cap the total amount of funds that may be disbursed109

matching funds which are distributed on prorated basis110 eligibility and conditions for public funding proponents of public financ ing generally argue that unlimited private funding encourages corruption or at least forces candidates to spend t oo much time raising money therefore states often require that recipients of public funding observe certain conditions on campaign conduct wh ich are designed to increase public confidence in campaigns and limit or elimin ate large amounts of time spent raising private funds publicly financed candida tes must agree to limits on spending and fundraising some states also require pub licly financed candida tes to participate in debates public funding recipients must demonstrate that they are politically viable by raising minimum level of private contributions before becoming eligible for public funding some states individual contributions are limited to as little as 5 once candidates meet that threshold and ot her qualifying requirements they become eligible for public financing in most cases campaigns qualifying for public financing may spend their privately raised c ontributions directly in others privately raised seed money is transferred to cen tral state fund for re distribution among all publicly financed candidates participation by candidates how widely candidates take advantage of public fina ncing depends largely on whether opponents choose to participate in public financing how various states structure their public financing programs or both public financ ing programs often become dormant because poten tial participants believe that spending limits are too low in maryland for example alt hough public financing is available for gubernatorial tickets major candidate has accepted that funding ce

outside groups such as parties interest groups and 527 organizations impact of public financing in the states despite recent scholarly research there is little certainty about how changes in american campaign finance law affect electoral outcomes113 research on the impact of public financing is particularly limited dated or both public financing programs in the states vary widely and were implemented at different times even basic terminology can vary across states all these factors limit opportunities for comparing data114 in answering whether public financing has achieved the various goals proponents ascribe one group of scholars wrote in 2006 the short answer is that nobody knows because there has been comprehensive evaluation of public finance systems to identify what conditions and program elements lead to successful outcomes the conventional wisdom is based on either limited amount of data or anecdotal impression115 similarly much of what is known about public financing is based on relatively narrow evaluations of particular states or races money and competition one of the major stions surr ounding public financing is whether publicly funded campa igns are more or less competitive than those that are privately financed resear ch often considers at least two different measures of competition surrounding public financing 1 the amount of money at each campaigns disposal and 2 the margin of victory on election day in theory public financing should foster lowercos t campaigns because public financing generally requires observing spending limits and reduces fundraising costs if more candidates have access to f unding through public financing races might also be closer on election day116 evidence on both fronts is mixed in general research suggests that public financing can foster more competitive elections however research on competition and public financing commonly emphasizes that most public financing programs are in their infancy and that more time and cases are needed to draw definitive conclusions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs50 117 joel thompson and gary f moncrief eds campaign finance in state legislative elections p 112 these

this study which was published in 1998 see joel thompson and gary f moncrief eds campaign finance in state legislative elections p 112 118 for example kenneth mayer and john wood found that public

authors cautioned that their findings on this point were not definitive see donald gross and robert k goidel the states of ca mpaign finance reform p 49 119 ibid p 111 120 as the authors noted however

public financing does appear to reduce financial disparities among candidates provided that all candidates pa rticipate in public financing for example research on state legislative elections has found th at public financing in minnesota and wisconsin decreased financial disparities between challengers and incumbents117 more access to money via public funding does not always foster closer races118 although it can provide ballot access for candi dates who might not otherwise be able to run119 from this perspective public financ ing provides an avenue to consistent competition in elections but not necessarily closer elections on the other hand in comparative analysis of legislative elections in five states that offer public financing arizona hawaii maine minnesota and wisconsin political scientists kenneth r mayer timothy werner nd amanda williams found that competition generally increased after public financing was enacted both in terms of the number of incumbents facing challengers and the number of competitive races120 these findings however were contingent upon fficient funding to make the programs attractive to candidates there is some anecdotal evidence of public financing favoring challengers or demo crats although these finding s are not systematic and other research dis putes such findings121 finally preliminary evidence from arizona and maine

freeing candidates from the burdens of raising large private contributions providi ng more time to connect with voters and discuss policy issues124 research indicates that public financing does decrease the amount of time state legislative candidates spend raising money but the finding holds only for full public financing national survey of candidates who ran for state legislatures in 2000 revealed that f ull public funding can free candidates from spending large amounts of time dialing fo r dollars or making personal appeals to prospective donors by comparison candi dates who accepted partial public funds devoted about the same time to fundraising as did candidates in states that did not provide public funding125 if this finding holds in other kinds of races it suggests that partial public financing might do little to alleviate what has been called the money chase of continual fundraising126 by contrast existing models of full public financing can reduce candidates fundrai sing duties for individual campaigns nonetheless despite the assertion that full public funding can free candidates to spend less time with wealth donors raising money and mo re time on other aspects of campaigning127 it is unclear whether public financing makes campaigns more substantive or how such concepts would be measured in addition public financing would not necessarily free candida

occurred because of notable ballot initiatives in two states in 1996 and 1998 respectively maine and arizona became the first states to pr ovide full public fina ncing for qualified candidates for statewide and legislative offices these two states are often considered test cases for public financing because their programs are so comprehensive in both states the firs t disbursements under these programs were made in the 2000 election cycle131 both states adopted public financing modeled on the clean money program advocated by p ublic campaign ariz ona and maine offer similar full public financing to statewide and legislative candi dates although connecticut also recently adopted similar pub lic financing the program has not yet been fully implemented bcra132 directed the general

victory margins for reelected incumbents 3 interest group influence measured by candi date and interest group reports through interviews and surveys 4 campaign spendi ng measured in candidate spending

runni ng for office and making elections more competitive the average numbers of state legislature candidates per district race in maine or arizona in the 2000 and 2002 elections were not notably different than the averages for the two previous elections 1996 and 1998 which did not have public financing gao also found inconclusiv results with respect to changes in competition in the two states

relatively limited available data about attitudes on public financing hi storically surveys reveal that large pluralities or even majorities of americans support public financing in principle but are hesitant to invest tax do llars to facilitate public financing these findings indicate that the wording source and timing of individual questions vary greatly and can affect campaign finance polling

pproval from respondents americans have been more willing in polls to support public financing after per ceived scandals such as during the 1970s and 1990s159 in gallup polling conducted between 1972

167 the models discussed here are not the only potential avenues for delivering public financing although they are the mechanisms th states and the presidential system currently use other options such as the patriot do llars program of partial public financing in which voters would receive small amounts of funds to be distributed to their favored candidates via blind trust or subsidies for political parties or to purchase broadcast time are also possibilities yale university law professors bruce ackerman and ian ayres proposed the patriot dollars approach in their book voting with

concerned about special interests165 more generally in 2002 abc news washington post poll 66 of respondents favored str icter laws controlling the way political campaigns raise and spend money166 it appears that regu lar national polling about public financing has been uncommon since the mid1990s potential considerations for congressional public financing public financing has been debated in congress and the states for decades this suggests that interest in the topic will continue as congress considers how or whether to change the stat us quo state experiences with public financing as well as the nations presidential public financing system offer several potential lessons however the great diversity among state programs makes interpreting those lessons challenging at the federal level the presidential public financing system provides partial matching funds to qualifying candida tes in primaries but far more substantial fixed subsidies to candidates in the gene ral election at the state level which campaigns are eligible for public funding how much funding is available what requirements are placed on candidates accep ting public funding and when programs were implemented vary the presidential public financing system and those in the states all rely on either fixed subsidies in the states especially clean money models or matching funds to distribute public fina ncing despite simila r ways of delivering funds to candidates details about each program can vary greatly these differences have produced research that describes individual components of public financing programs but rarely draws systematic comparisons across states in addition only two states arizona and maine curre ntly provide full public financing for legislative elections others provide partial public financing for legislative elections but again vary widely cons equently there are fe w certainties about how public financing might apply to congressi onal campaigns none theless several potential considerations remain state models suggest two approaches167 to national public fi nancing if congress decides to pursue subsidized congressional campaigns first most public financing programs infuse public money into cam paigns in hopes of limiting the impact of private money this approach essentia lly provides candidates with money so thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs58 168 some combination of these two approaches might also be possible however most programs offering contingency funds for t hose facing high spending by opponents assume that those opponents do not par ticipate in public financingthey do not have to raise their own or can at least raise less second some models such as nebraskas public funding program have reporte dly encouraged the vast majority of candidates to limit spending on their own rather than providing public funding to candidate s based on the assumption that they will spend those funds the nebraska program reserves public financing for candidates whose opponents refuse to abide by relatively w spending limits these two approaches suggest choice for congress between public funding that concentrates primarily on distributing money in anticipation of campaign needs versus creating incentives for candidates to need less money by observing spending limits168 in addition cr eating public financing system requires choice between funding primary elections or general elections or both most existing state programs have funded both types of elections although genera l elections sometimes take priority over primary elections and might be funded diffe rently from primary elections while early cong ressional proposals generally covered primaries as well as general elections most prominent proposals since the 100th congress have dealt only with general election financing to reduce both costs and program complexity and to enhance chances for enactment regardless of the chosen approach public financing does not altogether eliminate private money in politics even clean money programs require some private fundraising to establish viability albeit far less than under private financing in addition some observers fear that pub lic financing creates opportunities for more financial influence from less accountab noncandidate sources such as independent expenditures and electionre lated issue advocacy by interest groups compared with the current system of pr ivate financing public financing systems generally do not regulate f undraising or spending out side candidate campaigns although legislation coul d address such issues congress might also wish to consider why some public financing programs have been curtailed in few states decisi ons by voters and candidates not state governments appear to be most respons ible for public financ ing programs falling into disfavor experiences in the states suggest that in order to be viable public financing must have sufficient funding to make participation ttractive to candidates as with public funds for presidential candi dates if public fi nancing provides too little money or sets accompanying spending li mits too low to c onvince candidates that they can wage effective campaigns major candidates are likely to opt out of the system ultimately making it re levant only for minor candidates in 2004 for example both of the eventual majorparty nominees for president opted out of matching funds in the primari public support can also be important to enact and maintain public financing despite regular congressional interest in public financing since at least the 1950s disagreements over ma ny of the issues noted in this report have thus far thwarted efforts to adopt public financing in gislative elections httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs59 169 this assumes that effectiveness is signaled by high levels of candidate participation 170 richard briffault public f unding and democratic elections university of pennsylvania law review vol 148 19992000 p 585 the quotation above omits briffaults footnote 70 171 see kenneth r mayer and john m wood the impact of public financing on electoral competitiveness p 86on related note eff ective public financing169 requires resources not only adequate to make participation attractive to candidates but also sufficient to administer and enforce public financing as law professor richard briffault has explained public campaign funding requires admini strators to determine who qualifies for public funds to disburse the funds and to enforce whatever restrictions accompany the funds can public administrators handle the job in fact administrators have successfully handled the qualification of candidates and disbursement of public funds in presid ential elections the real question is whether they can enforce the rules par ticularly the spending limits that are likely to accompany public funding170 comprehensive congressional public financing would therefore almost certainly require substantial administrative and enforcement resources for the federal election commission finally public financing regulates only one area of campaign conduct if congress were to adopt public financing for its elections other regulations including those currently in place would still be required to shape other areas of campaign politics such as political advertising and party activities public financing would also not necessarily ffect other factors that sh ape individual races as one pair of scholars wrote in 1995 public financing of congressional elections by itself will not eliminate the problem of uncompetitive elections as in wisconsin public subsidies may increase or prevent further deterioration in the competitiveness of contested congressional races by giving challengers more of level playing field they might not however encourage challenger s to emerge in districts where the incumbent is perceived as unbeatable171 public financing could ve diverse impacts on cong ressional elections data from the states show some evidence that public financing decreases financial disparities between candidates and fosters closer margins of victory however these findings are generally preliminary and are based on specific conditions in specific states because public financing limits the amount of private financing of campaigns it is likely that public financing in c ongressional elections would reduce the amount of time candidates spend raising money at least for their own or others candidate campaigns on its own however public fi nancing of candidate campaigns would not affect activities by 527s political parties or other organizati ons the same is true for leadership pacs unless they were prohi bited by public fina ncing legislation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33814crs60 evidence from the states also suggests that if congress chooses to fund congressional elections publicly faith in the system and patience will be required as is discussed throughout this report mu ch about the impact of public financing is simply unknown relatively few states offer public financing for legislative elections individual components of thos programs such as funding levels conditions on candidates and ot her factors can vary subs tantially making it difficult to compare public financing across states or to draw firm inferences about how state lessons might translate to congressional elections it is clear from the presidential public financing program nd state programs that assessing the impact of public financing takes multiple election cycles as more states experiment with legislative public financing and do so for longer pe riods of time potential lessons for adopting congressional public financing will become clearer it is also clear that in order to be effective public financin g programs require levels of funding sufficient to make them attractive to serious ca ndidates and to maintain t hose levels of funding over time similarly spending limits associat ed with public financing must be high enough to convince candidates that they can compete in modern campaigns including in expensive broadcast media
