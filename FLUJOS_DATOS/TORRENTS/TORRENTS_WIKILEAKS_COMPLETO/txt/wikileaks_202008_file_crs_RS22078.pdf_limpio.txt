report the senate gave its approval the following day on an 892 vote clearing the intelligence reform legislation for the presidents signature on december 17 president george w bush signed the legislation into law11 the sense of congress recommendation in the legislation for privacy officers within agencies of the intelligence community was unexpectedly transformed by the senate committee on appropriations when reporting th transportation treasury and general government appropriations bill 2005 the bill included provision that directs each agency to acquire chief privacy officer to assume primary responsibility for privacy and data protection policy these officials appeared to be very similar to the privacy officers prescribed in the intelligence reform bill as introduced by senator collins initially however this requirement seemed to apply onl to agencies funded by the bill such continued to be the case when the legi slation was included in the consolidated appropriations act 2005 hr 481812 within division h section 522 stated each agency shall have chief privacy officer to assume primary responsibility for privacy and data protection policy nd specified nine particular activities to be undertaken by such officers the section prescribed priv acy and data protection policies and procedures to be established reviews to be undertaken and re lated reports to be made located in title v of the division the requirements of th section appeared to be applicable only to agencies directly funded by the division furt hermore it did not appear that the section created new positions but instead prescrib ed privacy officer responsibilities to be assigned to an appropriate i ndividual in an existing position13 the president however declined to implement the section14 february 11 2005 memorandum to the h eads of the executive departments and agencies from omb deputy director for management clay johnson iii asked recipients to identify to omb the senior
