through the impact capital flows have on the dollars exchange rate and on the us trade balance this report will be updated as warranted by events background the september 11 attacks on new york and washington raised concerns about the ability of the us and international capital markets to absorb the financial and economic shocks1 some observers were concerned that foreign investors might curtail their purchases of us financial assets and reduce the inflow of capital into the us economy as result of doubts about the stability of the us economy thereby weakening the value of the dollar data closely following the attacks and in the period since indicate that the 1 for additional information see crs report rs21102 international capital flows following the september 11 attacks by james k jackson congressional research service the library of congress crs2 attacks themselves had shortterm and limited impact on us and international capital markets and on the value of the dollar in part the limited impact of the attacks on the financial markets can be traced to the swift actions of the federal reserve which moved aggressively to supply the markets with capital and to reassure investors economic and financial data since 2001 seem to indicate that broad range of factors since september 11th have been more important in driving the capital markets and in determining the value of the dollar than any lingering effects related to the attacks themselves in particular relatively slower rate of growth in the us economy reduced the overall demand for capital inflows in 2001 and 2002 and international perceptions about the us economy became less positive thereby lessening the kinds of pressure that led to the sharp appreciation of the dollar from 1999 to 2002 as indicated in figure 1 in 2003 demand for capital in the us economy increased somewhat over the 2002 levels and capital inflows increased but such inflows remained considerably below the peak inflows recorded in

jan apr jul oct jan apr jul oct jan apr jul oct jan 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 while number of factors affect the international exchange value of the dollar the lower level of capital inflows following 2000 likely was key factor in contributing to the slide in the exchange rate for the dollar relative to that of other major currencies that began in 2002 demand for us assets such as financial securities translates into demand for the dollar since us securities are denominated in dollars as demand for dollardenominated assets rises or falls the value of the dollar changes these exchange rate changes in turn have secondary effects on the prices of us and foreign goods which tend to alter the us trade balance international perceptions about the strength and pace of growth in the us economy in 2002 and 2003 likely also worked to push down the dollars exchange rate relative to that of other major currencies in the first quarter of 2004 capital inflows and outflows crs3 rebounded from the levels of 2003 although outflows increased more than inflows the united states as whole however remained heavy net capital importer during the quarter foreignowned firms repatriated larger share of their profits than they previously had done and both us and foreignowned banks operating in the united states lent record amount of funds to other banks abroad sharply increasing us private financial claims on foreigners foreign investors also sharply increased their purchases of us treasury securities during the quarter acquiring 664 billion in securities the second highest amount on record2 inflows of capital into the us economy are not new but such inflows grew sharply over the last decade as indicated in table 1 in 1993 total foreign capital inflows to the united states reached nearly 283 billion these capital inflows are comprised of official inflows primarily foreign governments purchases of us treasury securities and private inflows which include direct investment and such portfolio investments as private foreigners purchases of us treasury and corporate securities and other private financial liabilities by 2000 foreign capital inflows totaled more than 1 trillion annually such inflows were reduced in 2001 and 2002 as the growth rate of the us economy slowed down but picked up to over 856 billion in 2003 as economic growth improved private httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21934 capital inflows comprise the largest share of total inflows with foreign purchases of such corporate securities as stocks and bonds being the largest component of these

dollar is heavily traded in international financial markets and at times plays the role of global currency disruptions in this role have important implications for the united states and for the smooth functioning of the international financial system this prominent role means that the exchange value of the dollar often acts as mechanism for transmitting economic and political news and events across national borders while such role helps facilitate broad range of international 2 sauers renee m us international transactions first quarter 2004 survey of current business july 2004 p 6881 crs4 economic and financial activities it also means that the dollars exchange value can vary greatly on daily or weekly basis as it is buffeted by international events in part to blunt these effects the federal reserve acted quickly to reassure capital and currency markets following the 2001 terrorist attacks as result of these actions and because currency traders agreed not to profit from the event the dollars value changed little immediately following the 2001 terrorist attacks and returned to its preseptember 11 value within month3 recent data indicate that the daily trading of foreign currencies totals more than 12 trillion or more than the annual amount of us exports of goods and services or the net inflows of foreign capital the data also indicate that 90 of the global foreign exchange turnover is in us dollars4 in the us foreign exchange market the value of the dollar is followed closely by multinational firms international banks and investors who are attempting to offset some of the inherent risks involved with foreign exchange trading on daily basis turnover in the us foreign exchange market5 averages 254 billion similar transactions in the us foreign exchange derivative markets6 averages 135 billion7 recent developments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21934 comprehensive set of data on capital flows represented by purchases and sales of us government securities and us and foreign corporate stocks bonds into and out of the united states is collected by the treasury department on monthly basis8 as indicated in table 2 these data show that foreign investors buy and sell large amounts of us financial assets but that the annual accumulation though large in dollar amounts is relatively small compared with the large amounts of assets that are traded annually for instance in 2003 foreigners purchased 193 trillion dollars in us financial assets and sold 186 trillion dollars in assets for net accumulation of 708 billion in financial assets or about 4 of the amount of assets that were traded this large volume of transactions means however that relatively small changes in foreigners transactions in us securities could result in large change in percentage terms in foreign investors net accumulation of these securities and result in potentially serious economic disruption in us financial markets 3 downey jennifer and grainne mccarthy dollar movement is

273016 162883 271053 37531 25655 62274 source treasury department international capital data system conclusions the highly developed and broadbased nature of the us financial system proved that it could weather one of the worst blows in decades events such as the september 11th terrorist attacks which had direct impact on the operations of important new york based financial activities can affect the short run behavior of the financial markets but do not necessarily hamper their longrun operations the aggressive actions of the federal reserve in the immediate aftermath of the attacks addressed the most pressing capital needs of the financial markets thereby smoothing out the day to day operations of those markets in addition the federal reserves actions addressed the immediate concerns of market participants by demonstrating its intent to intervene quickly to address any perceived or real impact on the financial and currency exchange markets in addition the september 11th crisis demonstrated that the financial markets are highly efficient at processing information phenomenon which aids in spreading both good and bad news quickly as result the markets absorbed the impact of the september 11th events quickly and likely moved on in short time to assess the economic effects of other economic events and other economic news this means that the overall course of the us economy rather than the events of september 11 likely determined the flows of capital into and out of the united states throughout the remainder of 2001 and beyond 9 for additional information see crs report rs21102 international capital flows following the september 11 attacks by james k jackson crs6 the september 11th attacks and other events have demonstrated that capital flows are highly liquid can respond abruptly in the short run to changes in economic financial and political conditions and exercise primary influence on exchange rates through the exchange rates capital flows influence global flows of goods and services while broad range of factors influence capital flows in the short run and in the long run short run flows are more susceptible to daily news and events over the long run however capital flows into and out of the us economy are determined by such factors as the overall capital requirements of the economy combined with the welldeveloped and highly sophisticated us markets that provide investors with an array of financial instruments the stability of the us economy and financial system and by investors profit expectations and assessments of risks the net capital inflows inflows net of outflows the united states is experiencing bridge the gap between the amount of credit demanded and the domestic supply of funds and likely keep us interest rates below the level they would reach without the foreign capital these capital inflows also allow the united states to spend beyond its means including financing its trade deficit because foreigners are willing to lend to the united states in the form of exchanging goods represented by us imports for such us assets as stocks bonds and us treasury securities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21934 congress has rarely acted to intervene directly in us capital market to affect us capital flows or the dollars exchange rate but it is actively involved in overseeing and regulating those markets in the period since the 2001 terrorist attacks congress has attempted to address various concerns about terrorist organizations using financial markets to transmit funds for instance during the 108th congress number of bills were introduced to address concerns about tracking the overseas transfers of funds through the financial markets by requiring greater disclosure of information concerning transfer of funds10 other measures were introduced to address concerns about intervention in foreign exchange markets primarily by foreign governments to manipulate the exchange rate of the dollar relative to particular currency to improve the cost competitiveness of foreign goods in the us market while some of these measures focus particularly on chinas exchange rate policies other measures are directed toward addressing the exchange rate policies generally of foreign governments11 other measures were introduced to give congress more visible role in the conduct of us exchange rate policy12 10 such measures include hr 2074 hr 2120 hr 2637 and s 1359 11 measures related to exchange rates include h res 285 hres 414 hr 3058 hr 3269 hr 3364 hr 4986 sres
