r212 theory and practice part i lecture given on 29 november 1962 well ive got some notes tonight and again they have nothing to do with the lecture they just have to do with you all right what is this audience 29 november twentynine nov ad 12 saint special briefing course lecture one all right this is talk about r212 now theresthe first thing you should know about r212 is there are many indications and few stabilities so far as the condition of list and i only know of one absolute rule about lists list must be nullable it must be susceptible to being nulled you must be able to be able to null list that isnt you the auditor thats the list some lists are not nullable now right away we should make differentiation here between an indication and rule an indication is something like tracking and theres bit of grass bent over and thats an indication you see and theres stone disturbed in the middle of the sand pit and so you decide that something went across there and so forth those are indications theyre not like signposts and these are some indications if theres rs on the list if theres rock slam on the list why youre in trouble thats just dead horse and theres particular reason to groom it up and gild the hooves and polish the harness and wash the teeth and all that sort of thing itsyou justits just dead horse and if you suddenly look up as you go along and find out the ground is awfully close to you andand theit doesnt seem that its moving any why of course youd unload off that dead horse and sometimes you can save some of the harness but thats about all and usually you dont even bother to pick up the harness dont you see you just skip it dead horse and actually dead horses are what consume most of the time in r212 you will spend two and three times as much time on dead horse as you will spend on an active list so therefore these indications are of interest they are not rules you understand they are just indications and theyre of interest so although you say that if you dont develop rock slam in the first fifty items althoughthats an indication you seeand the pcs still awfully interested in the list and so forth well go on up to seventy eightyfive items see go on up ways go on further the pc seems to be interested and engrossed and that sort of thing why go little bit further still rock slam why just unload because list that doesnt rock slam occasionally here or there sporadically once in blue moon doesnt matter whether the slam is dwindling slam or otherwise won1 produce an item it just wont do it so although it is true that non rock slamming list list without rock slams on it will not produce an item it is not true that because it produced rock slam it will produce an item got that just because list rock slams is guarantee of anything its just better indication that theres an item on the list look at it in reverse if list doesnt rock slam it wont produce an item youve got to have an occasional rock slam on that list to get rock slamming item off the list and of course youre only interested in rock slamming items now you go on and list of course and as you go on and list so it produces rock slam well thats hopeful indication that is not rule that it will produce an item that it produces rock slam it is very positive very positive that it will not produce an item but that the list rock slams simply is an indicator that it might produce an item you got that if you justif you get these indicators in their right focus why all becomes easy now what do we mean by nullable list well it means one that you can go down without getting your mid ruds in every few items now youll want numbers but unfortunately the number varies from pc to pc but if you cant go on list more than eight nine or ten items without putting in your mid ruds and cleaning up dirty needle once more you have very very good indication that the ground is getting closer to you and it isnt going by at any speed at all and what you do about that time is start loosening your feet in the stirrups now its all right to go down few now lets talk about the sources of these nonnullable lists list that cannot be nulled what are the sources of this they are three in number 1 that thing from which they are being listedthat thing from which the list is being listedwas improper well oddly enough there is establishing this on your early list one assessment if something kicks or activates you of course represent it and get representing list but there is indication of any kind from that original indication that original needle read that will tell you at once whether this list is going to produce an item in other words sometimes you get the faintest trace in the world its sporadic speeded rise or sporadic speeded fall and you list the thing down it slams like mad and winds you up with nice big juicy reliable item and the next time you have one that dirty reads and its clicking and it even looks like it has an occasional spit you know sort of reverse rocket read or something like that the beginnings of slam it looks hot it looks tense and you go on and you list it and you list it and list it it produces slam and you list it and list it and list it and list it and list it and list it and list it and you go back to the beginning of it and the pc says thats it and you say thats it and its clean read and you start nulling and it goes out out dirty needle dirty needle dirty needle so its well well add to this list so we get in ourwe add to the list you see and we get in our mid ruds again and we test the question pzzzzt question goes whatever the list question was and you add to it and add to it and add to it and add to it and you go back its alltest the question again flat not whisper and you go back and you start in at the beginning of the list youre all set to go and it goes item null item null item null dirty read dirty needle now the unwise auditor at this point begins to hound the pc for missed withholds now the missed withhold is is there isnt going to ever be anything on this list you see the item which you are listing from is not really going into the gpm its just paralleling it and its going to go on forever well youve already got this list out to 585 items and the question is still pzzzzt there were slams on the list everything else but you cant list more than handful before you get another charged up dirty needle as opposed and different than the dirty read see just dirty read dirty needle dirty needle that ground has now greeted the soles of your shoes that horse will not go any place else it doesnt matter what you do to this horse you can feed him full of phenobarbital calm his nerves dexedrine to speed him up hormones and not thing is going to happen that list would probably go to 1595 items and still be producing the same confounded manifestations driving you stark staring mad now thats wrong source thats wrong source see thatthere was telling whether or not that thing you were going to represent off an assessment was going to produce good list or not there was indicator in that it just didnt produce decent list all right now theres another type of wrong source there is thewhat youre opposing is wrong that can be wrong source well lets say youve wound up with the item waterbuck and you saw it slam and it faded away and it isnt there any more and you cant get single click tick or snick out of waterbuck yet because it slammed youre hopeful so you say who or what would oppose waterbuck youve tested it out and you found out that it did turn on some sen actually its still turning on some sen and you say well its still turning on some sen so therefore of course theres still something there and maybe the rock slam has just been eaten up in the middle of it all so you say who or what would oppose waterbuck and this list of 300 is apparently ended as far as the pc is concerned the question is clean everything appears to be going along fine it produced slam it looks wonderful and you start in at the beginning of it and it goes item null item null item in item null item item null item dirty needle so you continue the list to be safe for another hundred which is perfectly legitimate the questions clean again everything is fine everythings marvelous so you go up to where you ended off and it goes item null item null item null item null item in item null item null dirty needle dirty needle put in the mid ruds in hurry say what are you thinking about the pc says well i thought of an extra item goon you say all right well put goon on the list about this time you should be getting nervous you know because you can get your leg caught underneath horse you know and so you put this on the list and you go little bit further and you test the question and its fine and you go back and you start to do this and its item null item dirty needle dirty needle dirty needle let tell you that can produce dwindling slam three four and five times as you list and that list will never be nullable i cannot give you any other characteristics than just that its just not nullable what in actual fact is occurring well as you see rock slam requires something to lean on to finally wind up with something now youve got this wall here see that was the reliable item and youre listing against this wall man those rock slams are discharging those rock slams are doing interesting things you finally wind up and youre going to find the item that is pressing against that wall thats because it had something to lean on but this other thing it was clean read you were getting on the thing finally although it did slam and it was an item and it looked like an item but its clean read now you cant get anything off of it and you just adventurously go on and oppose it of course its just going out into thin air theres nothing for that list to lean on you get the idea nothing for it to come up against and so its never going to end its just going to constantly miss on the gpm what youre doing kind of is cutting out paper dolls that are hanging on the concrete lampposts in the gpm dont you see and every once in while they come on close enough to the gpm to make something slam and actually what youre doing is just walking round and round the gpm picking locks off of it and you can go on and do it forever now sometimes the pc turns on sen very very heavy sen while youre doing such list and you would be very very unwise not to list the list till the sen turned off dont stop listing because the pc has bad stomach or something youll find out that these lists even when theyre going place and will result in reliable item hold the pcs interest are producing cognitions everything is dandy except theyre never going to be nullable and if you stop listing them at the moment the pc has sick stomach or he feels all caved in or youve made mistake actually if you keep on listing the pc will pass out of it to light case of sen thats the time to unload and then unload from that horse push the horse in the ditch or do anything you please with the horse but go and find another horse and of course you have to go back to youra first list again to continue on do you understand as you have been seeing here then that list rock slams is not guarantee that its going to hand you an item that list produces cognitions is only an indicator like the rock slam is so the pcs cogniting fine but thats only an indicator it doesnt guarantee thing but if the pc doesnt cognite at all while listing the list or seem interested in it thats an indithats more than an indicator that becomes rule you see so again you have rock slam on the list and cognitions from the pc well this amounts to rule thats going to be dead horse for sure but again that the pc does get cognitions is not guarantee of anything its just an indicator you understand all right now wrong assessment that is to say wrong assessment divides into auditor mistake which winds up with wrong assessment the auditor just didnt assess right and also unfortunateness the failure to get out of bed and make the magic sign in the air before you start the day thats just unfortunate because you can make right assessment and wind up with nonnullable list so proceeding from the wrong point includes for either reason wrong assessment or nonreliable item using nonreliable item you see to oppose and thats going to wind you up in the soup then of course there is this one there is auditing the case in the presence of tremendous missed withholds and thats going to louse you up but believe that is the rarer thing that is rarer thing than you would at first think you start in session you pull nearly found outs on the pc thats enough man just like youd handle it in ruds dont go using missed withholds to comb the pc apart in the body of the session because the missed withhold is the fact that the item isnt there now you could drive him round the bend hell feel like he has missed withholds hell be certain he has got missed withhold youll be certain of it too but the missed withhold is the missing item and that missing item may never arrive on the list you understand then that missing your missed withhold does play role in this but it actually plays further role than getting your rudiments in that is getting in your beginning rudiments make sure your pc doesnt isnt being audited with missed withholds and you wont run into this one at all because you dont suddenly wind up in the middle of the session in one case out of thousand the pc may suddenly say oh my god id forgotten it myself you nearly found out id robbed the bank but the funny part of it is hed just remembered it and he told you it isnt something you have to dredge for now your third source of travail trouble upset is the incomplete list now you see this incomplete list i do wish and i must get hold of some of the old 3d criss cross folders to show you real incomplete list man they are championship lists they are just marvelous youve juive looked at them and ive laughed to myself sinceat it and so on because theyll have something like twelve items you see and about every third time over the list one of them would go out which resulted in every item on the list having tremendous strings of slant marks tremendous strings of slant marks long things and of course they wind up with exactly nothing now your incomplete list is in contest however with the nonnullable list which introduces an interesting point of confusion for you now it is rule that list must be nullable that is the rule and that is stable datum the list you get must be nullable or you unload what you do with nonnullable list which is eventually proven to be nonnullable is you just unload off that list you go back then and do new first step you dont do anything else thats fancy or try to patch this up you just throw your blowout patches and all of that kind of thing throw them in the garbage can youve got use for them you can spend the rest of your life trying to figure out why something is why the thing didnt null out to that you can drive yourself batty you get down to the end of list you didnt find any item on the list and the pc all of sudden in frantic state of spurt thinks theyre guilty for not having put the reliable item on the list so they start giving you spates of reliable items well go ahead put them downwell go ahead and put all of them theyll give you five six eight ten variations on the last item that was in on the list and they just keep fading and folding up andoh you can do this forever you can come down to the last item on the list it doesnt have any action on it to amount to anything but you decide that youd better represent it and get yourself some place dont you see you decide your assessment might have been wrong and you missed the boat in doing your nulling that something was in and you missed the read something like that so you decide youre going to do the whole list again oh thats just currying dead horses man the proper action on routine 212 is when you wind up at the crossroads of nowhere the only map you have left is the step one of 212 whatever youre using for the first list whatever should now come up as the first list dont you see that is always your guiding post now you can waste more time and do less for the pc in all cases by trying to patch up something you believe must be pursuing from an error and the more time you use patching that up the more trouble youre going to get into the thing to do if you get nowhere straighten out the pc straighten out the pc put in your mid ruds for the list that you did you see and so on explain the situation to the pc go back and take off again you see crash will findwind up fatal thats quite interesting the only time you can get the pc into serious trouble is youre listing list and the pc is kind of sick and you dont go on and list the sen out of the thing or the pc is terrified or something like this and you dont list that sen out then youre in trouble and then the only remedy is just keep listing when the pc feels horrible just keep listing till he doesnt and then if you cant null that list even yet and so forth just unload and go back to your first step id say thats the only thing that i would do if i found i was on an unnullable list so id ask the pc how do you feel and the pc says oh my god ohhhhhhhh you say all right who or what would oppose waterbuck see and after while how do you feel oh i feel much better all right you got some sen anything like that yeah i feel little bit dizzy oh ill settle for that to hell with it unload realize youre carrying dead horse that whole length of time you got hold of his bridle and youre dragging him down the road with one hand you see recognize what youre doing youre not about to get an item it is not thata pc can turn on sen and you can get an item but this list is already proving unnullable nonnullable the list is not going to be nulled it cant be nulled every time you try to null it dirty needle bzzzz bzzzzzz bzzzzz bzzzzzz bzzzzz brzzzz oh to hell with it see what i mean now when you run into that ask the pc how the pc feels and if the pc feels ill sick dizzy terrified furious misemotional any of these connotations or if the pc has pain why just list it till the pc feels better and then get off of that dead horseyoure not even on him seeand go on back to your first step see thats very simple adjudication you can make so what you should do is keep fully in mind that list must be nullable list must be nullable and now nullable list is one where items just go out very easily and the needle doesnt dirty up to amount to anything and usually can be put back in by just saying to the pc offhandedly is there something there you wanted to give or something you want to tell you understand just that just that and it cleans up and once in blue moon theres been jamup you yourself should recognize these jamups and what they do to rudiments this thing has got helper see thats the item youre reading and youve gotten crosseyed in the thing somehow or another and youve put scalper and the pc dimly remembers that this is wrong and you say helper you should have said helper you say scalper and scalper has nothing to do with this list its who or what would be pleasing to mother or something like that you know and scalper the pc says and if you happen to look up and see pc looking dazed or upset and your needle has gone dirty and so forth theres always chance that you made mistake on the list somehow or another in reading it and youve muddied it up well you go and get your mid ruds in and get your protest off of it or your mistake off the thing and keep on going youll find the thing will keep on nulling you can go on nulling this thing you get on down to about four items and theyre all giving dirty read and you dont have rock slam on anything well that didnt mean you got skunked not on these light surface readings which were taking here on 212 you cant do anything with these well just ask the pc does the first onethats on an opposition listdoes the first one oppose mother does the second one oppose mother and the third one oppose mother and the pc finally says ah ah oh yes the second one and you go and you look at this mother and its evaporated theres read on mother theres read on any of it thats the packaging step which we are not particularly covering at this time youll find out that blew up well youve finished thats it thats how to get rid of the read off the last three or four when theyve all evaporated that all comes under packaging so that is not part of the nullability of list when im talking about the nullability of list im talking about being able to proceed down this list pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa one call you see out out out out out out out out out out out in out out out out in whenever i strike in and then an in and then in and then in i get in my mid ruds imagine my embarrassment occasionally to find out that those three in line were all hot but thered be telling now its very very good practice to occasionally and id say once once page or something like this ask suppress you see complete list is going out just skit skit skit skit out out out out out out out out you see and suppressed list will also go out out out out out out out out out you know so its good practice its good practice to ask the pc on this list is there anything youve suppressed and you justyou dont take him by sudden storm you justyoure running your meter and you say well now onim going to ask the suppress button and you say on this list is there anything youve suppressed and you say thats clear and you carry on got the idea dont even bother to prepcheck it see you dont do anything with it you just ask it because if its that lightly suppressed the button will read and if its suppressed then you clean that suppress off of it and then youll find out that youre fairly safe now do you go back and go over anything because you found the suppress button out i havent been and i havent gotten in trouble usually carry on nullable list that becomes stable datum with you and therefore study of what makes lists nonnullable gives you point of orientation from which to study assessment youre trying to achieve nullable list well if the pcs got beaucoup missed withholds youre not going to get nullable list in fact youre not going to be getting an assessable anything thats going to produce lots of dirty needles if the list proceeds from wrong source whether it was by the first assessment or because what youre opposing has charge on it youre going to get dirty needle list and thats going to be not nullable and your incompleteness of the list is going to produce nonnullability your judgment is only invited at this one point is how long does the list have to be to be complete and thats question like how long is piece of string how high is the sky now the more jammed up the pc is which well go into in moment the more jammed up and messed up is the pc the longer the pcs going to go with the list the list is directly proportional to the difficulties the pc has therefore to lay down rule that you must produce rock slam in exactly so many items is little bit adventurous that is again only an indicator after while even on the pc youre doing you say after while there should have been rock slam here someplace ill carry it on little bit further well how much is little bit further we know this pc is not really producing very much of anything you know i mean identification is fantastic on this case ahh i dont know you might list 150 175 on some very strange peculiar case this would be the odd case you see and all of sudden theres rock slam wow wow bang bang bang bang bang bang bang see and this other case is not so superidentified in the bank and you soon learn that if this case doesnt produce rock slam in the first fifteen or twenty youve had it so you see cases vary its actually case density and that density isnt even tone arm density unfortunately i wish it were just because case is high tone arm case is particular reason why theyre totally identified case you see mass is simply mass and although mass is also produced by identification that isnt the only source of mass so therefore we dont have reliable indicator in the tone arm you get that this fellow has an item called solid steel and thats reliable item man thats really reliable and when you get anywhere in the vicinity of this item or if youre sitting on this item for several lists before you finally arrive at the thing youre going to get one of the staggerest highest tone arms you ever wanted to consult and all of suthere isnt anything wrong with the case and all of sudden youre getting items everythings going along fine the pcs feeling better and then one day youre saying who or what would oppose the government and he says solid steel and actually at the moment he says this youll see this arm start to come down then it will come down and down and down and finally when you get the item out and pair it up and so on it goes phoof clear read got the idea it happens to be very massive item so the tone arm is not an indicator of how dug in case is which is unfortunate now we have case that starts out in total apathy of clear read this is the dead thetan case spoke of in emeter essentials now this character will requireand lets get into the rest of this thingthis case is going to require represent list after represent list assessment after assessment represent list after represent list there are slams anyplace youre just listing listing listing listing the case is feeling little bit better and case is feeling little bit better and you finally decide thats dead horse and you go on to the next one and you list that one all the way down the case is feeling little bit better and you couldnt get anyplace with that one you go on to the next one and so forth and youll see all of sudden the thing youre assessing from is beginning to go live in other words your scientology list one is getting hotter and hotter and hotter youve actually done list after list after list and you didnt get anything on any of them now all of that is very interesting but what are the mechanics involved with all this and why well frankly its the invention of new therapy although weve had it for long time we havent recognized it as therapy and i finally spotted this thing for what it was and i didnt recognize it completely even when i gave it the definition the first time which is listing is auditing listing is auditing well i knew that listing on goal was auditing and that was for sure auditing but how about the rest of this how about the rest of this just listing is auditing simple listing is auditing and lets not worry about goals or anything else just listing is auditing and listing an opposition list to anything that rock slams anything that rock slams that continues to rock slam its reliable item definition listing an opposition list to that is auditing thats auditing well how much listing is auditing and what is this new process thats called listing well you just sit there and list well how is it circumscribed youve got an emeter the pc can get reality on something that will read on the emeter all right he can get his highest reality on that which rock slams on the emeter the more read on the emeter the more capable of reality on that he is if for these purposes you call it reality meter youve got it made all right the more magnitudinous the read the more reality the pc will have on it now recognizing that then you could do any kind of an assessment that produced any read on the emeterthe read of course must not be one produced by protest and you know tiger buttons and so forthbut anything that you could get to read is safe to list its guarantee that itll produce reliable item at the other end of it but it is safe to list so lets lets just take this now straight out of the blue and lets just develop processit has nothing to do with 212 has nothing to do with anythinglets just develop process see lets put the pc on the emethe pc is sicklets put the pc on the emeter we say whats bothering you and the pc says well actually my liver and you say your liver it reads this is how crude this can be see youve got pencil and paper in front of you nothing see youve just got meter and you say all right what represents your liver to you and he says soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso and your tone arm wobbles around and soandso and soandso and soandso and pretty soon he doesnt have liver trouble this is fellow thats been to mayo brothers and has just got through spending 8965 pounds you see the only condition is is would it read on the meter that shows hes susceptible of reality on it you see that is assessment this is crude as crude as crude could be you say whats wrong with you well my heads been hurting and my livers been hurting ive had lot of trouble with my stomach youre just watching the meter see and you say stomach whats this about your stomach crash see well all right who or what represents your stomach see whats your stomach represent to you and hell go bowwow and bowwow and bowwow and bowwow and on and on and on and on and on and one of two things would happen now you see now were moving into assessment not written assessment but just the just the watching the needle to see which is the biggest read thats pretty crude but that would be establishing the fastest way to do something for this character well i think youd find out if you haunted hospital that you would be doing better with your meter than they were doing with their scalpels its taking lot less time and you didnt getnobodys getting their hands bloody now thats great deal of benefit of course to some parts of the societylaundries and that sort of thing but it doesnt do anybody else any good now lets do it without meter lets do it without meter lets take it at its earliest gradient we say to this individual whats bothering you cough well he says cough cough got lung trouble cough cough you say well anybody say you had lung trouble you were talking to well yeah the doctors all say so well what trouble do you think you have oh well it ahhhh its my back actually thats interest you find out hell go on and on and talk about his back so you could assess it without meter by interest and you say who or what represents back to you and youll find out hell spew out items down the chute man they just avalanche out of him and youd make him well and theres with meter now the thing that combines interest and reality is the rock slam so that if we really did searching one searching for the pcs interest and where it lay and we had him on the meter when we finally hit that point youre going to get rock slam now he not only has high reality on this he also has great deal of interest in this and along with these two things it is jammed up like sherman tank hitting concrete bulkhead it is cramjam packed youre looking at ridge now everything is identified with this he will tell you actually if people in the world took better care of their backs whats this tell you this tells you the fourth dynamic is collapsed on his back gayelord hauser you could run him for day or two on the subject of food because hes got everything identified with food dont you see hes very interested in it selling it like mad attributes everything to food well whats food represent to you oh man he wouldnt even be able to not answer your question now the second that you hit this button you get an automatic release and you think the pcs thinking something when hes releasing this but he is not thinking anything when he is releasing this hes just shoveling it out man now i can give you an indicator for nullable list it comes out with interest and positiveness so we find another rulethis is rule that list must not be continued that is being invalidated by the pc now that is overlisting there are several symptoms of overlisting in r212 you run into the first one and skip it which is comm lag who cares but its the beginning of an overlist we dont care about it however you would if you were listing goals but not with r212 the second one is he is groping for the exact name for it youre now getting near the danger point but once more were not interested in this in r212 this we can force and be all right the one we cant force is the one the manifestation which immediately follows those other two manifestations see its the cycle of manifestations you see the pc there the pc first starts to comm lag then he starts to get the exact word for it and he hasnt quite got it and the next line that he goes into is invalidation if your pc is invalidating items then you are not taking them off the front of the cash register youre trying to pull them out of the back of the machine or something and it just tells you that theres list the items of which are being invalidated by the pc will ever prove to be nullable list now what do we mean by invalidate well its as faint as this waterbuck well i dont know whether that would do that or notah tiger i dont think tiger should belong on the list lets see it really doesnt seem too real to that waterbuck would belong on the list but you say go on listing so all right game warden game warden game warden you can put it on the list i guess any such manifestation as that is leading to nonnullable list if the list is not nullable at the time you get there it might have been nullable and hes now just invalidating now you can go back before he started invalidating and take that much of the list and see if its nullable but youve sure overlisted dont pay any attention to this grope around for the right word dont pay any attention to the comm lags we are getting very esoteric you can pay attention to those when listing goals but not in r212 see its getting too esoteric the pc is indifferently insession this or that or the other things going wrong you cant be that nice but for sure if the pc is invalidating and being unsure of what item is on just recognize youre trying to pull them out of the back of the cash register and its just not going to wind up in the gpm the most uncertain person in the world when listing from proper source will be the most certain person you ever saw on listing so youre looking for this old factor that we used to have over here in england certainty youre looking for this factor interest certainty rock slamsthese things are beautiful indicators and list then is not nullable if it does not produce rock slam and list is also not nullable if it is being delivered with great uncertainty by the pc so the big factors that you look for are rock slam and uncertainty and then if youre lucky and you got out of bed that morning and youve made your peace properly with the church and lot of other things why you will get list that will wind up in an item but were actually not terribly fascinated with whether this thing on r212 winds up with an item or not ive just given you an example here of how you could cure somebodys back well you get lot of cases that are below rock slam you have to audit them quite while before they rock slam all you do with such case is you just keep assessing taking the most youve got doing your best to get complete list you never make list that is apparently going to result in anything and theyve got rock slams pcs interest is well its good in session but out of session it might have collapsed see in session theyre going pow pow pow and bang bang bang and ive just this and pow and bang bang and yes yes and bowwowwow yes yes bow bow bow bow they get out of session and i dont get any gains out of this i dont know what the hell youre talking about totally unreal to see you can expect some kind of manifestation like that you dont care what the manifestation was you get what i mean you dont care what the outofsession manifestation of the pc is ever on r212 youre only interested in his insession manifestation hes sailing hes interested hes this man youre sailing so he falls on his head and develops cornea of the thrombosis and lumbosis of the cornea andafter the session who cares i say youre not interested in out of sessionness because if youre going on auditing him and youve had to quit in the middle of an opposition list you can expect so of the fanciest somatics you ever heard of all you want to do is complete each cycle to the best of your ability you understand this complete each cycle to the best of your ability if youre satisfied thats it pc can turn on fantastic coldness the room could be eightyfive degrees and the pc is just shaking to pieces with chill cold and you had to end the session and they go around for the next twentyfour hours shivering their nuts and bolts loose and you give them fancy goal the next day bang folds up and the list is not nullable list i dont care it ran out this cold you get what i mean see we care nothing about that we care nothing about actually whether the list was nullable list or not we did it and it did something for the pc we did that and may have tried to the best of our ability to make it nullable list we tried to the best of our ability to get an item but if we did not get an item at any time this is not reason for auditor suicide d of p criticism or anything else you should get that fairly straight because youre going to find pcs thatll go fifteen lists off of list one fifteen of them without producing single rs and then all of sudden produce one on the list itself you find your reliable item was scientology youre all set to give up and the next time you assessed you just said scientology and it began to rock slam and then it didnt stop rock slamming either you see what youre heading for in the first place youre doing tremendously therapeutic action thats the first thing that youve got to drill into the heads of people who are doing r212 matter what you do if you do it anywhere near right youve got therapeutic action which is marvelous going to make the pc feel fine you just keep it up and do it to the best of your ability now thats what we expect of r212 just what i just said see now if we also wind up on that represent list with reliable item that just goes on slamming and it slams like mad marvelous and we take off from that and we do an opposition list and that thing winds up in you see thats already good that we got reliable item thats pretty darn good you see that doesnt happen every time you do it but there it is see gorgeous all right and then we take it out on the opposition list and so help pete the exact reliable item shows up on the opposition list that should have been there and it all packages up and it all goes bzzzz phump and the pc says wow you know wowwww see thats pretty marvelous hell feel like hes going clear and he is if you kept up that sort of thing now how often should you expect to get both items well this is factor which is monitored by the accuracy of the auditor the accuracy of the auditor an auditor who makes an inaccurate inaccurate assessments who doesnt have his pc insession who is making mistakesi mean making mistakes in his session form and hes qandaing and hes doing things hes got the pc on protest the pc thinks of lot of items but doesnt put them on the list and the auditor never finds out that the pc was thinking of and suppressing items thats pretty corny an auditor should be able to find out things like this without big qs and as and upsetting the pc an auditor who does those things is going to find far fewer reliable items and packages than an auditor who is sitting right there on the ball bangitybangitybang now for an auditor who is definitely on the ball and doing everything right and using good judgment and being careful about the thing and doing his stuff accurately and easily and so forth for that auditor how oftenhow often should you be dead on the beam about fifty percent this is your perfect auditor because that fifty percent is the pcs bank and the pcs bank has been crazy quilt for long time wadded up and thrown in dark closet and the things that start to lead in from to b actually go from to z and iteverything looks exactly as though this course from c to dyou couldnt miss on this course and you suddenly find yourself at r or g now why is that thats the factor which well talk about little more later so if youre batting 50 percent in other words half of the represent lists you do wind up with reliable itemand that means that means youre pretty doggone good auditorand if 50 percent of the opposition lists which you do after you got the first thing wind up with reliable item and therefore you wind up with package man youre geewhizzer from way back youre good youre good but what should be your expectancy about that now what about what about the guy whos terrible you know he picks up the meter and youre there as the instructor running the coaudit or whatever it is being run in you dont know whether you ought to let him pick it up or not you know because hes sort of picked it up like this you know well about 10 percent of the time he will wind up with reliable item he had to make enough mistakes to equalize it out about 10 percent of the time hell wind up with reliable item and about 10 percent of the oppositions he does will wind up with reliable item and somebody sooner or later will have to straighten out the case but the odd part isbut the odd part of it all is the case will feel better and be making gains thats why its safe process and thats why its been released to the hcahpa level of auditing now of course you guys who know your business and who can audit and that sort of thing why i expect 50 percent see i expect 50 percent just like that i mean you should be able to deal that out pretty good without too much trouble except on pcs who are obviously so dug in that tremendous amount of action of representing has to be done before they can tell the auditor from the pc youd be surprised but these people dont even know theyre in an auditing session and you do enough represent on them they eventually differentiate and they say ohhh im over here and hes over there and ohhh what do you know on such pc well i might forgive you and give youlet you drop to 45 percent now thats about the way nullable list goes thats actually the key data of nullable lists then when you look over the lecture your notes i think you will find there are not too many oddball variables along this line that theyre fairly easily assimilable now if any more data turns up which arewhich make rules out of anything ill sure be the first to let you know thank you
