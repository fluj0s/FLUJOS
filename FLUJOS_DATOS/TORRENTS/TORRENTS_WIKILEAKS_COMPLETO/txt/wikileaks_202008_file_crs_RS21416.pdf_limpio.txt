oversight in his message to congress accompanying the agenda in august 2001 president bush observed these proposals will often require the cooperation of congress congress agenda is crowded one and there is an understandable temptation to ignore management reforms in favor of new policies and programs however what matters most is performance and results in the long term there are few items more urgent than ensuring that the federal government is well run and resultsoriented p 1 on march 26 20 03 the house s ubcommittee on government efficiency and financial management held an oversight hearing on management and the presidents budget with regard to accomplishments of the agenda to date officials from omb offered this assessment the scorecard is working clearly it still shows lot of agencies in the red for status and that reflects the nature of th problems we are trying to solve chronic longstanding management challenges that defy quick fixes however there is significant

progress however has been uneven and continued focus is needed to improve the management and performance of the federal government and to ensure accountability7 at an oversight hearing on february 11 2004 omb deputy director for management clay johnson iii testified that due to efforts associated with the agenda agencies are better managed and achieving greater results than they were twoplus years ago as reflected in the scorecard furthe r according to deputy director johnson the part process offers vehicle for improving program performance while building on the foundation provided by the government performance and results act gpra the strategic and performance plans prepared by agencies pursuant to gpra provide basis on which to judge an agencys performance management practices or the goals by which it measures success the part reinforces the laws important requirements to set outcomeoriented goals and measure progress against those goals8 in his opening statement at the hear ing subcommittee chairman todd platts suggested an interest in discu ssing how best to codify th requirement for coordinated programbyprogram evaluation such as part pledging continued attention to gpra implementation mr johnson noted codifi cation of the requirement to conduct assessments of program performance would be welcome complement to the statutory management framework laid by gpra on february 25 2004 representative platts introduced hr 3826 the program assessmen t and results act to amend gpra and establish statutory requirement for program reviews the bill would have required omb to review each program activity at least once every five years but not mandated the use of part specifically hr 3826 was reported favorably in the house and senate companion bill wa s introduced but further action occurred early in the 109th congress representative pl atts reintroduced bill as hr 185 which was again reported favorably by the govern ment reform committee hrept 10926 but saw further action9 the 109th congress considered other measures relating to the presidents management initiatives in the fy2006 nd fy2007 budget submissions the president had called for establishment of two new types of statutory commissions results commissions would consider nd revise proposals from the president to restructure or consolidate overlapping programs and then submit the plans to

bush issues executive or der to create agency review of program performance daily report for executives nov 15 2007 222under expedited procedures10 president bush also called for creation of sunset commission to conduct systematic reviews of federal programs according to set schedule absent action by congress to r eauthorize them programs would terminate following the reviews several states includi ng texas have sunset commissions and for many years sunset commission bills have been introduced in congress11 outlook in the 110th congress president bush issued executive order 13450 eo 13450 improving government program performance on n ovember 13 2007 the order requires agency heads to set clear annual and longterm goal s and to prepare specific plans for achieving the goals including the means to measure progress and efficiency in use of resources eo 13450 also requires agency heads to signate an agency pe rformance improvement officer and establishes new performan ce improvement council to be chaired by ombs deputy director for management the order arguably reflects an effort by the bush administration to help ensure that the performance improvement initiative of the pma becomes lasting legacy following the unsuccessful efforts to advance legislati on to provide statutory basis for part in the 108th and 109th congresses as discussed above in the budget for fy2009 omb provided this rationale for eo 13450 to institutionalize the resultsdriven culture of the pma bush issued an executive order eo on november 13 2007 that formalizes the commitment of the government to spend taxpayers money wisely and effectively every year the eo ensures agency and program performance is transparent so that taxpayers have the critical information needed to hold government accountable p 29 some seemed less certain however about its favorable impact according to an article appearing in daily report for executives eo 13450 appears aimed at institutionalizing within the executive branch much of the controversial program rating tool part used by omb to evaluate federal programs12 congressional oversight of the agenda initiatives seems likely to continue and possibly to increase in light of inte rest generated by eo 13450 the 110th congress may choose as well to revisit sunset legisla tion such as s 1731 introduced by senator cornyn on june 28 2007 or ot her program review bills
