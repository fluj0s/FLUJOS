ensure the wellbeing of children and their families including protecting children from abuse or neglect and ensuring that they have safe and permanent home federalstate framework for child welfare policy as the us constitution has been interpreted states have the primary obligation to ensure child welfare at the state level the child welfare system consists of state and local judges and other court personnel prosecutors law enforcement personnel and public and private social service workers these representatives of various state and local entities investigate allegations of child abuse and neglect provide services to families in their own homes remove children from homes if necessary and supervise and administer payments for children in out ofhome settings federal involvement in child welfare is tied to the financial assistance it provides to states to conduct these activities in fy2008 congress appropriated just under 79 billion for child welfare purposes the bulk 46 billion of this money was appropriated to reimburse states for the cost of providing foster care for children who meet federal eligibility criteria estimated 43 of national foster care caseload in fy2006 beginning in the early 1960s the federal government has paid for part of the cost of foster care for children who would have been entitled to federally assisted cash welfare had they continued to live in their own homes in essence the cash aid was expected to follow the child into foster care states had primary responsibility to pay the full foster care costs for other children who were removed from their homes in the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 congress ended the entitlement to cash aid for needy families with children and converted funding for this purpose to block grant at the same time it continued to require that only children removed from homes that would have met the eligibility requirements for cash aid under the states pre1996 welfarereform rules would be eligible for federal foster care assistance crs2 as condition of receiving these foster care and other child welfare funds states are required to abide by series of federal child welfare policies1 federal child welfare policies focus overall on ensuring safety and wellbeing for all children served however the most specific and extensive requirements are designed for the protection of children in foster care especially to ensure them safe and permanent home these protections must generally be provided to all children in foster care regardless of whether they meet federal foster care eligibility criteria state compliance with the majority of these federal requirements is checked as part of the child and family services review cfsr state that is not in substantial conformity with federal child welfare policy as determined by the review must implement program improvement plan pip the state typically has two years to implement pip the pip must successfully address the compliance issues identified by the cfsr or the state faces loss of part of their federal child welfare funding2 child maltreatment and children in foster care in fy2006 an estimated 905000 us children or about 121 children for every 1000 in the general population were found to be victims of abuse or neglect an estimated 1530 children died due to abuse or neglect in that year the rate of reported child maltreatment victims has been about 12 children per 1000 children in the national population in every year since 1999 this rate is well below the recorded highs in the early to mid1990s 19921996 when the rate ranged around 15 victims for every 1000 children in the population and the number of child victims was counted as more than 1 million annually see table 1 for fy2006 states reported 64 of child victims experienced neglect 16 were found to have experienced physical abuse 9 sexual abuse 7 psychological maltreatment 2 medical neglect and 14 other abuse3 these shares were fairly constant between 2000 and 2006 although the rate of children found to have experienced neglect increased somewhat while the rate of children found to have experienced physical abuse or sexual abuse declined somewhat4 1 for more information about specific program requirements see crs report rl31242 child welfare federal program requirements for states by emilie stoltzfus 2 the cfsr was designed by hhs to meet the conformity review requirements mandated by congress in 1994 pl 103432 and enacted as section 1123a of the social security act the initial round of the cfsr was conducted from 2001 through 2004 and all states were required to take some corrective actions second round of reviews is now underway and is expected to continue into fy2010 for more information see crs report rl32968 child welfare state performance on child and family services reviews by emilie stoltzfus 3 some children experience more than one type of maltreatment these percentages total more than 100 because child may be included in as many categories as the types of maltreatment he or she experienced 4 us department of health and human services administration on children and families childrens bureau child maltreatment 2006 april 2008 hereafter child maltreatment continued crs3 preliminary estimates show 510000 children were in foster care on the last day of fy2006 or about 68 per every 1000 children in the general population this represents modest decline from the estimated 511000 children in care on the last day of fy2005 but is well below the recorded high of 567000 children in care on the last day of fy1999 when there were about 80 children in foster care per 1000 in the population5 see table 1 overall the national foster care caseload declined by about 10 between fy1999 and fy2006 however this decline has not been shared by all states between fy1999 and fy2006 most recent year statelevel data are available less than half of all the states 24 including puerto rico and the district of columbia reported reductions in their foster care caseload ranging from less than 1 decline in connecticut 40 children and michigan 200 children to nearly 47 decline in illinois 16000 children along with illinois california and new york posted the greatest numerical and percentage change declines in their caseloads between the last days of fy1999 and fy2006 californias caseload dropped by close to 40000 children 34 decline new yorks caseload declined by more than 21000 children 41 decline6 over the fy1999fy2006 time period slightly more states 27 posted increases in their caseloads7 these ranged from an increase of about 3 more than 300 children in massachusetts to increases of 93 close to 900 children in idaho 89 in texas nearly 15000 children and 86 in iowa more than 4000 children in addition five states wy sd ok az and wv8 saw caseload increases in their foster care caseloads ranging from roughly onethird to twothirds between the last day of fy1999 and the last day of fy20069 4 continued 2006 or another year in the series and unpublished statereported data received from the childrens bureau 5 the number of children in foster care includes some youth age 18 or older however the comparison to the general population is made with population estimates of individuals age 17 or younger 6 the state of maine also saw caseload decline of more than 34 over those same years which reduced the number of children in the states caseload by more than 1000 with nearly all of the decrease occurring since fy2002 7 mississippis caseload was virtually unchanged between the last day of fy1999 3196 children in care and the last day of fy2006 3203 children in care it is not included in the count of states showing an increased caseload 8 the percentage increase and the increased number of children this represents for these states are wv 33 1100 children az 38 2700 children ok 45 3600 children sd 50 550 children wy 68 520 children 9 caseload changes are based on children reported in care on the last day of fy1999 compared to those reported in care for the last day of fy2006 available data includes 49 states plus dc and pr data for nv are not available for fy1999 so the state is excluded from this analysis based on caseload data compiled by us department of health and human services administration of children and families childrens bureau from the adoption and foster care analysis reporting system afcars fy2006 caseload estimates are as reported by states as of march 2008 fy1999 caseload estimates are as reported by states as of april 2005 hereafter usdhhs caseload estimates march 2008 continued crs4 the overall number of children in care on the last day of given year rises or falls depending upon both the number of entries to foster care that is children who are removed from their homes in given year and the number of exits in that same year that is children reunited with their families adopted emancipated or placed in another permanent setting nationally the number of children reported as having exited foster care has risen from an estimated 250000 in fy1999 to an estimated 289000 in fy2006 however this is understood as an undercount because some states do not report all exits from foster care10 nationally the number of children who entered foster care may be trending up during fy2006 most recent year for which data are available the number of children who entered foster care in fy2006 was estimated as 303000 compared to 293000 children who entered in fy1999 table 1 indicates that this represents rate of about 41 children per 1000 in the population in both of those years however during the period of greatest recorded decline in the national caseload fy2000 through fy2004 the rate of children entering foster care also declined reaching low point of 39 in fy2003 table 1 shows national estimates of the total number and the rate ie the number of children per 1000 in the population who were found to be victims of child maltreatment who

and means green book 2004 and for remaining years are based on estimates final interim or preliminary provided by hhs acf childrens bureau child population data used to calculate the rates of children entering or in care are not shown in this table but are drawn from us census bureau population estimates for individuals under the age of 18 the population estimates used included children in all 50 states the district of columbia and beginning with 1998 puerto rico b data on child maltreatment victims were reported by calendar year from 1990 through 2002 and by fiscal year in 2003 and each year thereafter reporting methodologies related to children entering or in care varied over time however beginning later than 1995 estimates of children entering foster care refer to those who entered at any time during the fiscal year and for children in foster care refer to those in care on the last day of the fiscal year c data from puerto rico is estimated regarding child maltreatment for the first time in 2002 and regarding entries to foster care and children in foster care beginning at least with 1998 d relatively small but possibly growing number of children in foster care are 18 years of age or older these youth are included in the calculation of the rate even though the population estimates used are of individuals under the age of 18 only crs6 scope of children and families served federal child welfare policy has sometimes been considered synonymous with foster care policy and most federal dedicated funding and policy proscriptions are related to children in foster care at the same time the mission of child welfare agencies as described in federal policy and the group of children and families those agencies work with is far broader figure 1 children brought to the attention of or served by child welfare agencies national estimates 2006 source us department of health and human services child maltreatment 2006 april 2008 adoption and foster care analysis reporting system trends in foster care and adoption january 2008 state title ive foster care expenditure claims for fy2006 during fy2006 most recent data available states received allegations of abuse or neglect related to roughly six million children many of these allegations were screened out and further attention was given to the case screen out might occur because the alleged behavior does not match the state definition of child abuse or neglect because the case is transferred to another agency considered by the child protective services agency to be more appropriate because not enough information was provided to follow up on the allegation or for other reasons in the end states conducted investigations or assessments of abuse or neglect involving some 36 million children during fy2006 and found more than 905000 children to be victims of child abuse or neglect states also reported providing postinvestigation services to an estimated 13 million children including some of those who were found to be crs7 victims as well as some who were not found to be victims most of these children 77 were served in their homes and the remainder were removed to foster care11 although the number of children receiving some services after the investigation 13 million exceeds the number of victims 905000 not all victims received post investigation services12 instead the data reported by states suggest that roughly three out of every five victims received any services following the investigation overall states reported that among children found to be victims of child maltreatment an estimated 22 were removed to foster care and roughly equal portions of the remaining victims were either served in their homes 37 or received neither inthe home nor outofthe home services following the investigation 41 among the children who were not found to be victims in the investigation states reported that more than 4 were removed to foster care close to 26 received services in the home and the remaining 70 received neither inthehome nor outofthehome services following the close of the investigation13 finally during fy2006 states reported serving some 799000 children for at least one day 24 hours in foster care this number includes some children who were in care at the beginning of the year and some of those who entered care during that fiscal year whether due to abuse or neglect or another reason eg child behavior on the last day of the fiscal year september 30 2006 an estimated 510000 children were in foster care14 activities of the child welfare agency federal statute authorizes state child welfare agencies to use federal funds to offer broad range of services and other activities toward the central goals of ensuring the wellbeing of children and their families and ensuring that children have safe and permanent homes15 these services and activities may take variety of forms and include the following 11 child maltreatment 2006 12 ibid not all states reported data on the number of victims and nonvictims served following an investigation the total numbers and shares of victims served or not served are national estimates using data provided by reporting states these data should be treated as rough estimates 13 children who are nonvictims may nonetheless be served because of risk factors identified during the course of the investigation and consequent efforts intended to prevent future abuse or neglect the reason that children counted as nonvictims are sometimes removed from their homes is not fully understood these children may be the siblings of other children who have been found to be victims of maltreatment they may have been removed for alternative reasons eg child behavior issue or there may be other issues including those related to how states report these data 14 us department of health and human services adoption and foster care analysis reporting system afcars data trends in foster care and adoption fy2002 fy2006 based on data submitted by states as of january 2008 15 these broad goals are most clearly expressed in the federal regulations promulgated as part of implementing the title ivb subpart 2 program now known as the promoting safe and stable families program see principals of child and family services at us code of federal regulations 45cfr 135522 crs8 efforts to educate the public about child abuse or neglect and how to report suspected maltreatment efforts to prevent child abuse and neglect and improve child and family wellbeing generally such as provision of communitybased family support services like parenting education classes procedures to identify children who have been abused or neglected such as operating hotline to receive and screen referrals and investigating abuse or neglect allegations procedures and services to protect children from unsafe home situations by providing services to prevent the need for their removal such as parenting education respite care counseling or mental health substance abuse or other treatment services or when necessary finding temporary foster home for children and supporting their stay in foster care services and activities to enable children removed to foster care to be returned to their families eg permanency planning counseling mental health substance abuse or other treatment services parenting education or other supports for children or their parents for children and youth who cannot be reunited with their biological parents services and activities to enable them to be placed in another permanent family eg locating and supporting adoptive parents or fit and willing legal guardians for those children and youth and procedures to identify children likely to age out of foster care without finding permanent family and services and activities to enable these youth to succeed as independent adults including services and support to youth who have already aged out of the foster care system federal child welfare funding in fy2008 for fy2008 congress made available just under 79 billion in dedicated child welfare funding by far the largest amount of this funding is made available for states to help support and provide certain casework activities eg permanency planning for eligible children who have been removed from their birth families primarily due to abuse or neglect these include children in foster care 46 billion and children who have been adopted primarily out of foster care 22 billion smaller amount of fy2008 federal child welfare funding 763 million is distributed to all states for wide range of child and family services and activities these include to identify and assess children at risk of child maltreatment prevent the removal of children from their homes when possible plan for and permit the safe reuniting of children in foster care with their parents or when this is not possible plan for and find another permanent home for children in foster care and overall to provide services intended to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children in their homes whether with biological parents other relatives or in foster or adoptive families separately states receive some funding 185 million in fy2008 to help youth that are expected to leave foster care without crs9 being placed in permanent home or for those who have already done so to successfully make the transition to independent adulthood finally funds totaling 173 million in fy2008 is made available mostly as competitive grants to eligible entities primarily for support of research demonstration or pilot programs services and other activities related to child welfare16 federal program administration nearly all federal child welfare programs are administered by the childrens bureau within the administration for children and families acf at the us department of health and human services hhs handful of programs authorized by the victims of child abuse act and related primarily to court adjudication of child abuse cases are administered by the office of justice programs within the department of justice congressional committee work in congress the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee typically report legislation related to the largest child welfare programs all of which are authorized under the social security act these include the title ivb programs child welfare services and promoting safe and stable families and the title ive programs foster care and adoption assistance adoption incentives and the chafee foster care independence program including education and training vouchers at the same time the house education and labor committee and the senate health education labor and pensions help committee generally report bills amending the grant programs authorized under the child abuse prevention and treatment act capta that law authorizes grants to states to improve child protective services grants for research demonstrations and other activities and grants for communitybased services to prevent child abuse and neglect17 those same committees have typically dealt with legislative proposals related to two additional and freestanding programs adoption opportunities and abandoned infants assistance finally several other committees deal with variety of competitive grant programs related to child welfare purposes see table 2 funding authority many federal social service programs including some child welfare programs have discretionary and timelimited funding authorizations this gives congress the discretion to appropriate funds for the program generally up to the amount specified in the authorizing law for specific number of years eg for fy2004fy2008 discretionary funding authorization is said to expire once the last year of the funding authorization is completed although congress may 16 for more information see crs report rl34121 child welfare recent and proposed federal funding by emilie stoltzfus 17 in addition to those three grant programs section 107 of capta contains the program authority for grants to all states to improve the handling and prosecution of child abuse and neglect cases these grants were initially authorized by the childrens justice act of 1986 title i of pl 99401 but program authority was subsequently moved to capta at the same time authority to fund these grants is not provided in capta but remains in separate law that law the victims of crime act of 1984 pl 98473 as amended authorizes setaside of up to 20 million annually out of the crime victims fund for these grants crs10 sometimes choose to appropriate funds even after the expiration of the funding authorization congressional committees that authorize federal programs often use these dates as time to revisit how the programs are working and to consider reauthorization legislation other child welfare programs have mandatory funding authorizations either capped meaning the amount of funding that must be provided is specified in the authorizing statute or openended meaning the funding level is ultimately determined by the value of eligible claims submitted by states the funding for some of these child welfare programs is authorized on timelimited basis like the discretionary authorizations discussed above while for others it is authorized on permanent basis permanent funding authority may only be ended by repealing the law that provides for this authority for programs with permanent funding authority there is need for reauthorization legislation all the same just as with programs that have timelimited funding authorities an authorizing committee may propose to amend the program at any time table 2 shows selected federal child welfare programs by funding authority kind expiration and level of the

estimates it will need to reimburse eligible claims under those programs for the fiscal years any funds not needed for this purpose are returned to the treasury alternatively if not enough funds have been provided congress must provide the funds necessary to reimburse the eligible claims c for fy2004 pl 10836 provided combined funding authorization of 120 million for capta state grants and discretionary activities along with separate authorization of 80 million for capta community based grants both funding authorizations were continued for each of fy2005 through fy2008 at such sums as may be necessary crs13 child welfare hearings in the 110th congress in 2007 the house ways and means subcommittee on income security and family support the house subcommittee that has exercised jurisdiction over the largest share of federal child welfare programs held several hearings that were directly related to child welfare policy in addition to the hearings discussed below in february 2008 that subcommittee held hearing to receive testimony on the investment in kids instruction development and support act invest in kids act hr 5466 which was introduced by representative jim mcdermott who chairs the subcommittee18 as of midjune 2008 hearings have been held in the senate during the 110th congress that focused primarily on child welfare challenges facing the child welfare system the first of these hearings and the broadest in scope was held on may 15 2007 and sought to identify the major challenges facing the child welfare system19 witnesses at the hearing included representatives of the american public human services association aphsa the government accountability office gao casey family programs private foundation that both provides foster care services and supports research to improve those services an independent consultant who was also former child welfare administrator and the first lady of virginia who previously served as judge in juvenile and domestic relations court witnesses most often highlighted concerns related to the availability or adequacy of services provided to families and children including services to prevent placement reunite families or to sustain permanence via postreunification postadoption or guardianship supports and services the recruitment of foster homes for children especially older children and those with special

crs14 other specific challenges cited included disproportionate representation of african american children and other racial or ethnic minority groups in the child welfare system and providing adequate services to youth in foster care as well as those who leave the system without being placed in permanent home ie those who age out recommendations with regard to the availability and adequacy of services witnesses noted both the difficulty and necessity of crosssystem collaborations to treat child and family health mental health or substance abuse issues and to respond to housing and education needs they also cited the importance of addressing how federal funds are distributed for child welfare purposes among the recommendations for change with regard to recruitment and retention of foster families witnesses suggested the need to focus on recruiting families willing and able to care for older children in foster care or those with special needs and to better prepare foster parents both kin and nonkin to adequately meet these needs recommendations on workforce issues included setting national standards for the number of cases that may be assigned to single child welfare caseworker as well as providing standards for staff levels needed among workers who receive and screen calls alleging abuse or neglect hotline workers improved training support and accountability for supervisors and caseworkers was recommended finally number of witnesses stressed the importance of accountability although some cited the federal child and family services review cfsr as positive step others sought greater efforts in this regard some witnesses also stressed the value and necessity of hhssupported training and technical assistance to improve child welfare practice youth agingout of foster care at june 19 2007 hearing the subcommittee on income security and family support looked broadly at issues facing vulnerable youth populations including those who are homeless or disconnected ie those not in school or employed and those who ageout of foster care21 several witnesses at this hearing spoke about children in foster care and their need for educational stability22 on july 12 the subcommittee held hearing specifically concerning the support services and activities available to those youth in foster care who upon reaching the state age of majority typically on their 18th birthday leave state custody without being reunited with their birth family or placed in another permanent family23 these independent adolescents are frequently referred to as youth who have aged out

crs15 representatives of research and advocacy groups who are interested in learning about and improving the outcomes for youth who age out of foster care24 advocates and researchers noted that although some youth managed to do well when they left care in many cases youth aging out of foster care had low educational attainment experienced homelessness were unable to pay bills eg rent utilities experienced early pregnancy or parenthood or had relatively frequent involvement with the criminal justice system researchers testified that independent living services for youth varied widely by state25 and were spotty with one survey showing that less than half of youth exiting foster care receive transitional services related to vocational training and employment budgeting and financial management health education housing and services to promote youth development at least half did indicate they had received some educational support26 recommendations the youth who testified stressed the critical importance of working to create permanent connections for youth before they leave foster care by matching the youth with permanent supportive family including relative families or at the least by helping the youth connect with an adult mentor some suggested that youth should have the option to remain in foster care custody until at least age 21 with federal support called on child welfare agencies to pay greater attention to sibling connections for youth in care and overall emphasized the necessity of supports and services for youth who age out of foster care researchers and advocates testifying also noted the critical importance of finding permanence for foster youth by creating adult connections for them they further highlighted the need to provide services and supports related to housing financial literacy employment education and job training finally some emphasized the importance of private foundation or other community engagement on the issue of youth aging out of foster care and called for better data on outcomes for youth and the services that are now offered27 24 us congress house ways and means committee income security and family support

services witnesses included researchers medical doctors including representative of the american academy of pediatrics aap and state child welfare administrator representing aphsa28 the witnesses referenced studies showing that children in foster care have high rates of physical and mental health needs recent research review concluded that 35 to 60 of children in foster care have at least one chronic health issue or significant acute health condition and nationally representative study of children in foster care for at least one year ages 214 found that nearly half 47 had clinically significant emotional or behavioral issues children in foster care are typically eligible for medicaid and should receive screening and treatment under that programs early and periodic screening diagnosis and treatment epsdt component further many children in foster care are eligible for services under the individuals with disabilities education act idea but identification of the need for such services and access to them is not always provided29 recommendations witnesses at the july 19 hearing stressed the importance of early identification of problems they noted the importance of establishing channels for coordination between health mental health education and child welfare agencies to ensure that timely assessments are made and appropriate treatment is offered testimony regarding the prescription of psychotropic medication for children in foster care stressed the importance of clinical review of childs medical history and need as well as clear consent protocols the critical importance of access to complete medical histories for children in foster care was also raised proposals related to creating electronic records eg webbased to store and permit needed access to medical histories as well as establishment of medical home for each child in foster care were discussed30 prescription psychotropic drug on may 8 2008 the subcommittee held hearing to review the

services including number of new requirements that states must meet related to children in foster care32 many proposals to further amend federal child welfare policy continue to be debated legislation that would respond to number of the concerns raised in the child welfare hearings held during 2007 including proposals to change the federal child welfare financing structure has been introduced in the 110th congress the bills introduced would expand the eligible populations served with title ive funds and provide some additional support for child and family services appendix discusses several child welfare financing proposals made outside of congress including proposal by the bush administration that have influenced or continue to influence legislative proposals other legislative proposals would authorize or require new services and protections for children in or about to enter foster care seek to improve services for youth who are aging out of care including those who have already exited due to age encourage greater access to range of services for kinship caregivers and further encourage their involvement as decisionmakers and use as caregivers for children who cannot remain safely with their parents aim to improve foster and adoptive parent recruitment efforts of state child welfare agencies permit direct access to federal title ive funds for tribal governments and make other related changes intended to enhance the safety permanence and wellbeing of children these legislative proposals are described in greater detail below most of the bills discussed would amend child welfare programs and policy that currently exist however some would create new and freestanding programs or would amend other social service or education programs an effort was made to identify bills with proposals that highlight wide range of child welfare policy concerns and that would be expected to affect the primary populations served by the child welfare agency as well as the child welfare agency itself at the same time this discussion is not comprehensive and inclusion of bill or exclusion is not intended to suggest the viability or lack of viability for given proposal proposals to expand title ive eligible populations number of bills would expand the population of children who are eligible for federal assistance under title ive of the social security by delinking the program or parts of it from the eligibility rules of the former federal cash welfare program repealed in 1996 by pl 104193 that program was known as aid to families with dependent children afdc additional bills would further expand the population of children who may be served with title ive dollars by permitting eligible children leaving foster care for legal guardianship in relatives home to receive title ive support and by extending the age at which youth could remain eligible for title ive foster care support to 21 years of age 32 see crs report rl34252 child welfare federal policy changes enacted in the 109th congress by emilie stoltzfus crs18 delink foster care and adoption assistance from afdc rules the overall share of children in the national foster care caseload who are eligible for title ive foster care support has been in decline this share was estimated to be less than half of all children in foster care in fy2006 43 compared to high of 51 55 in the midto late 1990s33 three bills would delink federal title ive foster care and adoption assistance eligibility from the income and all or most other eligibility rules of the prior law afdc program the investment in kids instruction development and support act or invest in kids act hr 5466 an omnibus child welfare policy bill introduced by representative jim mcdermott the partnership for children and families act hr 4207s 2900 introduced by representative shelley berkley and senator sherrod brown and the place to call home act hr 3409 an omnibus youth policy bill introduced by representative ruben hinojosa34 this change would potentially expand eligibility for federal foster care maintenance payments and adoption assistance subsidies to include any child in foster care as well as any child adopted from foster care who meets state special needs criteria share of eligible children there are multiple criteria for federal title ive eligibility see appendix b and wide variation among states in the estimated share of children in foster care who meet these eligibility criteria simple correlation between states 1996 income eligibility rules and the share of its foster care caseload that is title ive eligible can be established nonetheless the current law requirement that links title ive foster care and in most cases adoption assistance eligibility to the income rules of the nowrepealed afdc program is viewed by many as an explanation for the recent decline in the share of children who are eligible for federal foster care support specifically federal law requires state to look back to and apply the income and other eligibility rules that were in use in the state on july 16 1996 under the prior law cash welfare program afdc35 this requirement has limited title ive eligibility to children from families whose incomes represent declining share of the federal poverty guidelines in 1996 the median value of all states afdc income tests for family of three was equal to 33 there are various ways to estimate this coverage rate on national basis and the coverage rates shown here are based on the average monthly number of children claimed by states as eligible for title ive foster care maintenance payments expenditure data in given fiscal year compared to the number of children the state reported in foster care on the last day of the same fiscal year adoption and foster care analysis and reporting system afcars data for example there were an estimated 510000 children in care on the last day of fy2006 and during that year states submitted title ive foster care maintenance payment claims for an average monthly number of 220000 children in foster care 34 hr 5466 would strike all references to the prior afdc program with regard to eligibility however for purposes of federal title ive eligibility hr 3409 and hr 4207 would continue to require that child must have been removed to foster care from the home of specified relative as defined in the prior law afdc program 35 although the current link was established by the 1996 welfare reform measure pl 104 193 the initial link between eligibility for cash aid and federal reimbursement for foster care expenses was established in the early 1960s for brief review of the policy and its legislative history see crs report rl32849 child welfare financing an issue overview by emilie stoltzfus section on the look back under proposals for change crs19 60 of the federal poverty level by 2007 this median value had slipped to 45 in fully twothirds of the states 34 including dc the title ive income eligibility test for family of three is now less than 50 of the federal poverty guideline for family of three or less than 858536 nature of funding there is upper or lower limit on federal title ive foster care or adoption assistance funding to states instead the federal government is committed to sharing fixed part of every eligible claim submitted by state on behalf of an eligible child this kind of federal funding is sometimes referred to as openended entitlement funding hr 5466 hr 3409 hr 4207 and s 2900 would continue to provide support for title ive foster care maintenance payments and adoption assistance payments on an openended entitlement basis these bills would also provide for continued openended reimbursement for related child placement activities eg case management training data collection costs and other program administration costs however hr 5466 would limit overall state reimbursement for specific administrative costs eligibility determination setting payment rates for foster care homes and institutions and for related agency overhead to more than 15 of states federal title ive administrative funding37 and hr 3409 would limit those same costs to more then 15 of states total federal title ive funding hr 4207 and s 2900 do not include this limit reimbursement rates hr 4207 and s 2900 would not make any changes to current federal reimbursement rates under title ive however hr 5466 and hr 3409 propose to reduce the expected cost to the federal government of expanding eligibility for title ive by reducing the rate at which states are now reimbursed for foster care and adoption assistance costs in general these bills propose to determine what portion of all states total foster care and adoption assistance costs whether incurred on behalf of ive eligible child or nonive eligible child is now provided by the federal government and would ensure that this same national level of commitment be continued into the future to achieve this each states current reimbursement rates under the title ive program except those related to training and development and operation of data collection system would be reduced by the same percentage at the same time hr 5466 and hr 3409 would provide threeyear period following the enactment of these changes during which any state that received fewer federal foster care or adoption assistance dollars because of lowered federal reimbursement rates could submit additional claims to receive funding at the level they would have received under prior law38 ultimately the overall share of federal support received by the state during that threeyear period would be used as part of establishing its title ive reimbursement rates current law currently the reimbursement rate for foster care maintenance payments and adoption assistance payments is pegged to the states federal medical 36 crs calculations based on annualized state afdc need standards for family of three as they existed in 1996 and the federal poverty guidelines for family of three in 1996 and 2007 37 hr 5466 would exclude from this calculation all administrative expenses related to training or data collection 38 this is the presumed intent of the language in these bills crs20 assistance percentage fmap which ranges from low of 50 for highest per capita income states to as high as 83 for lowest per capita income states39 the reimbursement rate for program administration costs including child placement activities is 50 and the reimbursement rate for training costs is 75 with the exception of eligibility determination and certain data collection costs both counted as administrative costs foster care and adoption assistance costs may only be reimbursed if incurred on behalf of title ive eligible children states are expected to pay the full costs for children who do not meet the federal eligibility criteria either out of state or local treasuries or if allowable some other federal funding delink adoption assistance in most cases eligibility for title ive adoption assistance is also based in part on whether or not child was removed from family that met states 1996 afdc income standards and other eligibility criteria40 roughly 89 of children adopted with child welfare agency involvement in fy2006 receive an adoption subsidy the remainder either did not meet state special needs criteria or for some other reason did not receive ongoing adoption assistance among only those children adopted in fy2006 with an adoption subsidy roughly 45500 78 received federal adoption assistance under title ive and the remaining 22 received subsidy that was solely state financed by comparison among the children adopted in fy2000 with an adoption subsidy roughly 44800 85 received federal title ive adoption assistance and 15 received stateonly subsidy41 data that would allow an estimate of the total share of children adopted in any year who receive federal adoption assistance versus those who receive state only support are not available42 39 see crs report rl32950 medicaid the federal medical assistance percentage fmap by april grady the statute provides that for purposes of the medicaid program the district of columbias fmap is fixed at 70 however for purposes of title ive the fmap is calculated annually and has consistently been 50 both hr 5466 and hr 3409 would fix the districts title ive fmap at 70 making it equal to its fmap for medicaid 40 child may currently be eligible for title ive adoption assistance without meeting the afdcrelated requirements if he or she is eligible for supplemental security income ssi or if he or she is the or daughter of title ive eligible youth minor who is in foster care and whose foster care maintenance payment includes costs incurred on behalf

incentives and relative guardianship assistance act s 3038 as introduced by senator charles grassley would remove the afdc link for purposes of title ive adoption assistance eligibility only43 s 1462 and hr 4091 are largely identical bills and s 3038 contains provisions very similar to those bills all three would potentially expand the adoption assistance caseload to each child who is adopted from foster care provided that the state has made reasonable efforts to place the child for adoption without assistance if appropriate and that the child meets the special needs criteria of given state44 special needs criteria are any factors that state determines make it unlikely that child will be adopted without adoption assistance or medical assistance these criteria vary by state but must include determination by the state that the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his parents and they often address some or all of the additional factors suggested in federal law including ethnic background membership in minority or sibling group medical conditions or physical mental or emotional handicaps45 the number of children receiving title ive adoption assistance in an average month has grown dramatically in the recent past from 106200 in fy1995 to more than 390900 in fy2007 the administration predicts continued growth and estimates that in an average month in fy2009 430400 children will receive this assistance46 the growth in the number of children receiving federal adoption assistance is consistent with the adoption and safe families act of 1997 asfa pl 10589 which among other things encouraged states to expeditiously aid the adoption of children out of foster care when returning home is not possible for them some states had begun to increase these efforts even before this legislative change and between fy1995 and fy2000 the number of children adopted with 43 s 1462 and s 3038 would also make optional the current requirement that for foster child to be eligible for adoption assistance judge as opposed to for instance the state child welfare agency must have determined that the childs continuation in the home of their parents was contrary to the childs welfare hr 4091 would maintain the requirement that such determination be made by judge 44 s 1462 s 3038 and hr 4091 would also remove the need for child to meet the income eligibility of the supplemental security income ssi program to be eligible for title ive adoption assistance and would permit the continued eligibility of other specific groups of children who now may qualify for title ive adoption assistance including those voluntarily relinquished and those who are the children of title iveeligible minor in foster care whose maintenance payment included costs incurred on behalf of the child each of the bills proposes somewhat different eligibility criteria with regard to citizenship or immigration status s 3038 would retain the current requirement as enacted by pl 104 193 that an eligible child must be either citizen or qualified alien hr 4091 would require that the child be lawfully present in the united states and s 1462 would not link any eligibility criteria to

placement for children who cannot be reunited with their parents and for whom adoption is not possible or appropriate50 some research has found that on range of factors related to safety recurrence of maltreatment permanence reentry to foster care and wellbeing school performance engagement in risky behaviors and access to community resources children placed in subsidized guardianship fare at least as well as children who left foster care to be reunited with birth families or were adopted further this research found that children placed in subsidized guardianships cited as positive both an

congress consider amending federal law to allow federal reimbursement for legal guardianship similar to that currently provided for adoption as way to reduce the disproportionate representation of africanamerican children in foster care52 many relative caregivers have limited income advocates of federally supported subsidized guardianship argue that financial support is critical for relatives to assume care and that many relatives cannot afford to assume care of children outside of the foster care system according to nationally representative survey close to two out of every three children estimated 66 who were placed in kinship care arrangement after an investigation of alleged abuse or neglect in their own home were placed in households with income below 200 of the federal poverty threshold including some 40 who went to live in households with incomes below 100 of the federal poverty level53 relative caregivers are currently eligible for varying levels of financial support depending on their legal relationship to the child and the licensing or other policies of the state in which they live relatives may receive foster care maintenance payments if they serve as formal foster parents for relative child however those payments may not be title ive federally subsidized unless the relative meets the states licensing standards and approval process similarly children who exit foster care to relative adoption may be eligible for title ive adoption assistance payment but only if that relative meets specific background check requirements some unlicensed relatives caring for children in formal foster care may instead receive temporary assistance for needy families tanf childonly benefit and this may also be true for children who exit foster care to either an informal relativecare arrangement or to more formal relative guardianship54 tanf childonly benefit levels vary by state but are typically worth significantly less than foster care maintenance payment 2004

programs vary in design and scope but all provide monthly financial payments to adults who assume legal guardianship of child some but not all states require these adults to be relatives and most

the state must have documented that relative guardianship is the most appropriate permanent placement option for the child and among other items this documentation would need to include the reasons

guardian of the child through legal guardianship established by court57 s 3038 would make these same requirements except that the grandparent or other relative is not explicitly required to have been

assistance payment on behalf of child finally s 3038 would further require that relative guardians home meet the licensing standards developed by the state for foster family homes eligibility of child s 661 hr 2188 hr 5466 and hr 3409 would each further provide that to be eligible for title ive guardianship assistance payment the child must have been in foster care for at least 12 months and must have been eligible for title ive payments s 3038 would require that the child was in foster care and eligible to receive federal title ive foster care maintenance payment in the month prior to the establishment of the guardianship all five bills require that the child demonstrate strong attachment to the relative guardian and further both reuniting with parents and adoption must be considered inappropriate permanent 57 the bills each reference legal guardianship which is defined at section 4757 of the social security act as judicially created relationship between child and caretaker which is intended to be permanent and selfsustaining as evidenced by the transfer to the caretaker of the following parental rights with respect to the child protection education care and control of the person custody of the person and decisionmaking 58 for more information on the title ive criminal background check requirements see crs report rl34252 recently enacted changes in federal policy by emilie stoltzfus crs26 placement options for the child in addition all five bills state that child who is 14 years of age or older must be consulted regarding the kinship guardianship arrangement and further child who does not meet all of these criteria but is minor sibling of child that does may or in the case of s 3038 must be placed in the same guardianship assistance arrangement with his or her eligible sibling and both or all siblings in the arrangement may receive federal title ive guardianship assistance payments s 661 s 3038 and hr 2188 would provide that the child must meet the current requirements for title ive foster care eligibility including the income rules tied to the prior law afdc program both hr 5466 and hr 3409 would similarly require child to have met title ive eligibility requirements in order to be eligible for title ive guardianship assistance payment however as discussed above both of those bills would delink title ive foster care eligibility from the prior law afdc program so those current law income eligibility rules would not apply s 661 and hr 2188 also would provide that to be eligible for title ive guardianship assistance child must be under the age of 18 unless he or she is not yet 19 and is fulltime student in secondary school or equivalent level vocational or training program or under the age of 21 if the state determines the child has mental or physical illness that warrants continued support by contrast hr 5466 would permit state to choose to provide federally supported title ive guardianship assistance payment for any youth who remains in the care of legal guardian up until his or her 21st birthday while s 3038 would not permit payment of federal title ive guardianship assistance payment on behalf of any youth who had attained 18 years of age training for relative guardians under current law title ive of the social security act states are permitted to seek reimbursement for 75 of their cost of training current or prospective foster or adoptive parents of title ive eligible children s 661 hr 2188 s 3038 and hr 5466 would provide that states could also make claims for reimbursement of 75 of the costs related to the shortterm training for current or prospective relative guardians of title ive eligible children extending the age limit for federal foster care assistance the foster care continuing opportunities act of 2007 s 1512 introduced by senator barbara boxer the reconnecting youth to prevent homelessness act of 2007 hr 4208 introduced by representative shelley berkley and s 2560 introduced by senator john kerry the omnibus child welfare policy bill hr 5466 and the omnibus youth policy bill hr 3409 would each permit youth who remain in foster care until their 21st birthday to remain eligible for federal foster care support under current federal policy children cannot be title ive eligible once they reach their 18th birthday or in most states their 19th birthday if they are finishing high school or an equivalent level of training59 additionally to be eligible for title 59 see us department of health and human services hhs administration for children and families acf child welfare

the state or any public agency with which the state agency has made an agreement however in most states child reaches the age of majority on their 18th birthday and is considered to be legally emancipated from either hisher parents or in the case of child in foster care the state foster care system most youth leave foster care upon reaching their 18th birthday and this is true even though many states now permit youth to choose to remain in care beyond that date60 however with handful of exceptions few states appear to actively facilitate youths extended stay in foster care possibly because states must pay most of these foster care costs s 1512 and hr 5466 would permit state to continue to make foster care maintenance payment claims for an otherwise title ive eligible youth who remains in foster care under the responsibility of the state until the youths 21st birthday or at state option up until their 19th or 20th birthday s 1512 would explicitly state that remaining in foster care would be choice made by the youth hr 3409 hr 4208 and s 2560 would require states to make foster care maintenance payments on behalf of any otherwise eligible youth who chooses to be in foster care after their 18th birthday but not beyond their 21st birthday further under each of hr 3409 hr 4208 and s 2560 as part of choosing to remain in foster care youth would be required to enter into written voluntary placement agreement that would be binding on both the youth and the state agency and that would specify the youths legal status as well as the rights and obligations of both the state agency and the youth while he or she remains in foster care each of hr 3409 hr 4208 hr 5466 and s 2560 would expand eligible placement settings for older youth in care current federal policy provides that state may only claim federal reimbursement for foster care maintenance payments made on behalf of child who is placed in licensed foster family home or childcare institutionand further that these payments may not be made directly to an older youth who is in supervised independent living situation or to help an older foster youth pay rent61 many older foster youth even those who remain in state care do not live with foster family or in child care institution but instead live in supervised independent living quarters or with relatives62 hr 3409 hr 4208 and 59 continued citid15

youth lived in supervised independent living settings about 20 lived in foster family homes and 19 lived with relatives the remainder lived in group continued crs28 s 2560 would each amend the law to explicitly include licensed supportive housing facility as federally eligible placement setting for older youth in foster care and would also permit foster care maintenance payments to be used to cover the rent for youths apartment alternatively hr 5466 would amend the definition of child care institution to include supervised setting in which the individual is living independently but only for otherwise title ive eligible youth who are at least 18 years of age and in accordance with any conditions related to the supervised setting established by hhs in regulations funding for services to children and families common criticism of federal child welfare financing is that most federal support is for children after they have been removed from their homes ie funds provided for foster care or adoption assistance and that relatively little federal funding is provided to encourage states to provide services that would prevent placement of child in foster care or to help children who are placed in foster care be successfully reunited with their parents in recent years the share of dedicated child welfare funding that is available for all states to provide child welfare services and activities on behalf of any child or their family needing them has been about 10 of all dedicated child welfare funding63 title ive child and family services component hr 5466 would authorize openended reimbursement of new child and family services component under title ive of the social security act this would enable states to seek federal reimbursement for services that seek to 1 safely reduce the number of children in foster care 2 safely reduce the length of stay for children in foster care 3 increase the percentage of foster children who are cared for in familylike settings and 4 improve the wellbeing of children in foster care or those who are receiving title ive supported adoption assistance or guardianship assistance payment the federal reimbursement rate for these services would be pegged to states federal medical assistance percentage fmap which may range from 50 in the highest per capita income states to 83 in states with the lowest per capita income state seeking funding under the title ive child and family services component would need to submit plan to hhs describing what services it intends to support with this funding the process by which it intends to assess the effects of the spending on the states established goals and on other indicators of child welfare performance and whether it intends to spend some or all of the funds on required program improvement plan pip the plan would also need to contain an assurance that the state would submit detailed annual spending reports to hhs in accordance with uniform reporting system to be developed by hhs hhs would be required to approve states plan for the child and family services component provided it 62 continued quarters 7 or other settings 4 see mark courtney et midwest evaluation of adult functioning of former foster youth outcomes at age 19 chapin hall center for children and families university of chicago may 2005 p 13 63 see crs report rl34121 child welfare recent and proposed federal funding by emilie stoltzfus crs29 meets these specified requirements except that it may not approve the plan from state if review eg the child and family services review has found that the state is not in substantial conformity with child welfare policy and the state is not implementing pip to correct the failure further hhs would also be permitted to disapprove states title ive child and family services component plan if the state was not making meaningful progress toward ending its failure to conform with federal child welfare policy finally hhs would be allowed to disapprove states title ive child and family service component plan if the state intended to spend the funds on service method substantially the same as one that was used in the last two of the most recent five years and if the prior spending on that service method failed to result in meaningful progress toward the goals the state described in its plan finally states would be required to use the funds received under this new service component of title ive to supplement rather than supplant any federal state or local funds currently used for such child and family services maintenance of effort provisions and service spending hr 3409 would require each state to spend at least the same amount of money previously spent to provide foster care maintenance payments for children who were not title ive eligible because of the afdc link on either foster care maintenance payments or any of the four services categories for which states must now spend promoting safe and stable families funding ie family support family preservation timelimited reunification and adoption promotion and support64 s 1462 which as described above would remove the afdc link for purposes of federal eligibility for adoption assistance only would provide that state must spend any savings it derives from the increased share of children that would be eligible for adoption assistance on any purpose now authorized under title ive or title ivb of the social security act including postadoption services this requirement is also included in s 3038 by contrast hr 4091 which would also expand eligibility for federal adoption assistance support by removing the afdc link would not make this requirement of states but would include sense of congress statement to this effect by removing the afdc eligibility link and thus increasing the number of children eligible for title ive foster care maintenance payments hr 5466 hr 3409 and hr 4207s 2900 would also increase the share of children in foster care for whom states could seek federal support for certain caseworker activities such as monthly visits and permanency planning for children in foster care although these activities are not considered services under the title ive program they are critical efforts that federal law requires states to make on behalf of any child in foster care currently states may seek reimbursement for these activities only on behalf of title ive eligible children in foster care states must use their own dollars or find other federal funds such as title ivb or social services block grant funds to pay for these caseworker activities made on behalf of children who are not eligible for title ive support thus the expanded eligibility for title ive foster care maintenance 64 specifically states maintenance of effort level that is the amount of its own money it would need to continue spending regardless of the expanded federal funds would be based on past average annual total state spending fy2001fy2006 on foster care maintenance payments for children who were ineligible for title ive because of the program eligibility rules related to the prior law afdc program crs30 payments described above would make federal support available for caseworker activities on behalf of all or nearly all children in foster care this might free up other federal funds provided to state for services to children and their families further provided that states did not use this increased support to simply supplant their current spending for these purposes it might also increase available state support for those purposes on the other hand both hr 5466 and hr 3409 but not hr 4207s 2900 would reduce the reimbursement rate for those costs to limit the effect of the expanded eligibility none of the proposed bills would address maintenance of effort with regard to current funding for caseworker activities on behalf of children not eligible for title ive transfer of unused title ive funds for services and training hr 4207s 2900 which as described earlier would remove the afdc link for purposes of both federal foster care and adoption assistance eligibility would separately permit state that reduces the number of days children in the state spend in foster care to transfer any federal savings from this reduction to be used for child welfare related training or for any of the categories of services now authorized by the promoting safe and stable families program as noted earlier those services are family support family preservation timelimited reunification and adoption promotion and support under hr 4207s 2900 state wishing to transfer funds would have to negotiate with hhs the total number of days it expected children in its state to spend in foster care ie its number of placement days the maximum amount of savings that could be generated would be the product of any fewer number of placement days and the states per child federal title ive cost of keeping child in foster care state applying to hhs for the ability to transfer funds would also need to submit plan detailing how it would use any funds generated and assuring that relevant current law child protections would be maintained additional funding authorization sought hr 3409 would increase by 200 million the annual mandatory funding authorization for the promoting safe and stable families pssf program this would raise the total annual funding authorization for that program from 545 million to 745 million of which 200 million would continue to be authorized on discretionary basis in fy2008 the pssf received funding of 408 million of which 345 million was mandatory and 63 million was discretionary funding under title i and title ii of capta is appropriated on discretionary basis and the authorization of appropriations is set to expire with fy2008 for fy2008 capta state grants under title i received an appropriation of less than 27 million and the acts title ii communitybased grant program received funding of less than 42 million the crime control and prevention act of 2007 s 2237 introduced by senator biden seeks an additional funding authorization of 200 million in each of fy2008fy2012 for capta state grants under title i and separate additional 200 million authorization for each of those same years for the title ii communitybased grants65 beyond this the bill would authorize 545 million in additional funds to be distributed to communitybased groups in all states via 65 hr 3409 would also extend the current capta funding authorization levels without significant changes crs31 title ii of capta for the purpose of parent education and counseling services and familystrengthening services and referral to and counseling for adoption services see also discussion under parenting education below improving services for older current or former foster youth number of proposals seek to bolster support for older youth in foster care and particularly those who ageout of foster care as discussed earlier some proposals would expand federal eligibility for foster care aid until youth reaches their 21st birthday see extending the age limit for federal foster care assistance above in addition these and other proposals seek to ensure greater attention to the needs of older youth in foster care and to expand and improve access to education medical and social services for older youths in foster care as well as those who age out66 foster child protections hr 4208 s 2560 and hr 3409 would amend current law related to case planning and review of permanency plans to require earlier and added actions on behalf of older youth in foster care federal statute now requires states to apply specific case planning procedures for each child in foster care including preparation of written case plan and regular review of this plan including the childs permanency goal most of these protections apply without regard to age however federal law now requires that the written case plan of any youth who is in foster care on his her 16th birthday when appropriate describe the programs and services that will help the child prepare for the transition from foster care to independent living67 further when holding permanency hearing court or other administrative body is required to consult in an ageappropriate way with the child or youth concerning the content of the permanency plan including any transition plan68 written case plan hr 4208 s 2560 and hr 3409 would amend the case plan requirement now in law to provide that for any youth in care at age 14 and at state option any other child the case plan must include written description of programs and services that will facilitate the transition of the child from foster care to independent living and further that it discuss the appropriateness of the services that have been provided these bills would also require the case plan for any youth age 14 or older or at state option any other child to document the steps the agency had taken to ensure permanent placement of the child with family or to establish another adult connection and permanent living arrangement for the child finally for any child age 17 or older or with permanency goal of emancipation each of these bills would require that the state agency document the youths permanent living arrangement upon emancipation69 66 see also crs report rl34499 youth transitioning from foster care background federal programs and issues for congress by adrienne fernandes 67 section 4751d of the social security act 68 section 4755ciii of the social security act 69 this appears to be the probable intent of certain provisions found in section 103 of hr 4208 section 103 of s 2560 and section 121 of hr 3409 crs32 permanency planning review hr 4208 s 2560 and hr 3409 would require that at any permanency hearing that concerns foster childyouths transition to independence all documented efforts to secure permanent living arrangement for the child upon emancipation would be reviewed it would also require that the final permanency hearing held with regard to the transition of child from foster care to planned permanent living arrangement or independent living be held in court70 under current law this permanency hearing may be conducted by court or court appointed administrative body social services several bills seek increased mandatory funds for the chafee foster care independence program cfcip or other changes intended to improve access to certain social services under that program the cfcip is the primary federal child welfare program supporting services to older youth in foster care and those who have aged out of foster care under its authority federal funds are distributed to each state to support independent living services and other aids for youth who leave foster care custody at age 18 because of reaching the state age of majority or those who are expected to do so these services are generally related to completing education or training programs finding and retaining job managing personal finances and other daily living skills and practicing good health states may also use cfcip funds to provide personal and emotional support to children aging out of foster care through mentors and the promotion of interactions with dedicated adults finally states are required to provide assurances they will use some cfcip funds to provide services for youth who have left foster care at age 18 but who are not yet 21 years old for activities related to educational achievement and employment as well as for counseling financial support and housing assistance however the law prohibits states from using more than 30 of the cfcip allotment for room and board purposes funding authorization and youth served hr 3409 hr 4208 and s 2560 would amend the cfcip program to increase the annual mandatory funding authorization to 200 million from the current 140 million those bills along with hr 2188 would also amend the purposes of the cfcip program to provide that states are to identify youth expected to remain in care until age 14 current law provides lower age limit but instructs states to identify youth likely to remain in care until 18 years of age and to provide services to help them transition to independent living71 hr 3409 hr 4208 and s 2560 would further provide that states could continue providing cfcip services to youth once they had aged out of foster care until age 25 current law says age 21 and would also require states to certify that they used some of their cfcip funds to serve youth who had left foster care at age 18 but had not reached the age of 25 but more than 30 for room and board services to youth in this age category additionally hr 3409 hr 4208 and s 2560 would add an additional purpose to the program that would permit states to use cfcip funds to provide independent living services for any youth who left foster care via adoption or guardianship after reaching their 14th birthday by 70 ibid 71 section 477a1 of the social security act although there is lower age limit for receipt of cfcip services in current law the proposed language appears intended to encourage states to identify youth at an earlier age than may be current practice crs33 contrast s 3038 would amend the purposes of the cfcip to make eligible for the cfcip services any youth who left foster care for adoption or placement with relative guardian after reaching their 16th birthday access to program information and services hr 3409 hr 4208 and s 2560 would amend the cfcip program to require states to certify that when or before youth leaves foster care the state will inform him or her of the full range of available financial housing counseling health public benefit employment and education services and other appropriate supports and services for which the youth is eligible further these bills would also require hhs to provide for efficient distribution to states and local areas of information about the full range of federal programs that may assist youth making the transition to selfsufficiency and provide guidance on how to access services under those programs other cfcip changes hr 3409 hr 4208 and s 2560 would modify certain requirements related to program evaluation and would require states to describe in their cfcip plan how they intend to both distribute program funds among diverse range of qualified private providers and ensure that these entities have equal opportunity to receive the cfcip funds to provide independent living services and related supports education attainment under current law youth eligible for education and training vouchers etvs include any who are eligible for general independent living services under the cfcip as well as any youth adopted from foster care after their 16th birthday etvs may be used by these youth to pursue postsecondary education or training72 an individual voucher may be valued at up to 5000 and may be used for the cost of attending an institution of higher education including universities community colleges and postsecondary technical training or vocational schools73 hr 2188 hr 3409 hr 4208 and s 2560 would expand eligibility for the etv program to permit any youth who left foster care to either guardianship or adoption after reaching their 14th birthday to receive an etv74 s 661 and s 3038 would permit any youth exiting foster care via legal guardianship after reaching their 16th birthday to be eligible for an etv the higher education amendments act of 2007 s 1642 introduced by senator edward kennedy passed by the senate in july 2007 and the college opportunity and affordability act of 2007 hr 4137 introduced by representative george miller passed by the house in february 2008 would amend the higher education act hea to authorize services specifically for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth among other related changes hr 4137 would amend the hea to stipulate that the education department must require applicants seeking 72 section 477i of the social security act 73 for the purposes of the etv program the terms cost of attendance and institution of higher education are as defined in section 472 and section 102 respectively of the higher education act 74 this is the assumed intent of the four bills although each also proposes separate language that would permit access to etvs for any youth who left foster care for any reason after reaching their 14th birthday in care crs34 funds to operate what are collectively called the federal trio programs to identify services to foster care youth including youth in foster care and youth who have left foster care after reaching age 16 as permissible service and to ensure that such youth receive supportive services including mentoring tutoring and other services provided by those programs the federal trio programs are designed to identify potential postsecondary students from disadvantaged backgrounds prepare these individuals for postsecondary education provide certain support services to them while they are in postsecondary education and train individuals who provide these services the programs are known individually as talent search upward bound student support services and educational opportunity centers hr 4137 and s 1642 would further authorize that services provided under talent search upward bound and educational opportunity centers could specifically target current and former foster youth as well as other youth defined as disconnected under the act75 s 1642 would also authorize services under student support services specifically for current and recently emancipated foster youth including temporary housing during breaks in the academic year for these youth in addition s 1642 would amend the student support services program by changing one of its purposes concerning fostering an institutional climate to support certain students to include youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth hr 4137 would make amendments to another program authorized by the hea gaining early awareness and readiness for undergraduate programs gearup like the trio programs gearup seeks to increase disadvantaged students high school completion and enrollment in higher education by providing variety of academic counseling and college preparatory services the bill would require grantees seeking funding under gearup for early intervention activities eg comprehensive mentoring counseling outreach and support services to participating students to treat as priority any student in preschool through grade 12 and first year students at an institution of higher education who is in foster care or was in care until age 16 hr 4137 would further authorize funding through the fund for the improvement of postsecondary education to be used to establish demonstration projects that provide comprehensive support services for students who were in foster care until the age of 18 to enroll and succeed in postsecondary education including providing housing to the youth when housing at an educational institution is closed or unavailable to other students finally s 1642 would amend the higher education act to require that educational technology used in training programs for staff and leadership personnel that operate trio gearup and related programs include strategies for recruiting and serving students who are in foster care or aging out 75 hr 4137 specifies that certain students are considered disconnected for purposes of the act homeless children and youth orphans in foster care or wards of the court or who were in foster care or were wards of the court until the students reached the age of 16 adjudicated or convicted juveniles and related juvenile offenders and pregnant and parenting youth crs35 the college cost reduction and access act of 2007 pl 11084 amended and expanded the definition of independent student which is used as part of determining eligibility for federal student aid under the higher education act to include in that definition an emancipated minor someone who is in legal guardianship as determined by court of competent jurisdiction or any child who is an orphan in foster care or ward of the court at any time when the individual is 13 years of age or older76 the house has passed technical amendments to this law hr 4153 introduced by representative george miller which would restate this last provision to clearly indicate that it includes any individual who is or was an orphan in foster care or ward of the court at any time when the individual was 13 years of age or older in other words any youth who spent at least some time in foster care at age 13 or older and without regard to the subsequent reason for exit from this care would be eligible for independent student status for purposes of pursuing federal student aid77 see also educational stability below medical assistance the medicaid foster care coverage act hr 1376 introduced by representative cardoza would require states to provide medicaid coverage to youths who have not yet reached their 21st birthday and who were in foster care on their 18th birthday hr 3409 would make this same change however it would provide that this mandatory medicaid coverage could continue until the youth reached the age of 25 at the same time both hr 1376 and hr 3409 would permit states to limit this mandatory coverage to those youths who were in foster care on their 18th birthday who meet certain income or asset criteria were previously title ive eligible or received cfcip services78 under current law states are given the option to provide federally subsidized health insurance medicaid to youth who age out of foster care as many as 18 states have done so and in addition some states use other eligibility pathways to provide coverage to these youth79 however research continues to suggest many youth are not covered for instance recent study that looked at 19yearolds who were or had been in foster care in illinois iowa and wisconsin found that less than half of the youth 47 who had left foster care had health coverage by contrast nearly all 98 of those who remained in foster care at age 19 had health insurance coverage80 76 section 604 of pl 11084 enacted september 27 2007 77 hr 3409 which was introduced before pl 11084 was enacted and before hr 4153 was passed by the house also proposes to amend the definition of independent student under the higher education act however it would provide that to be eligible youth must be in foster care or have been in foster care on their 18th birthday 78 under current law any child who is eligible for title ive foster care maintenance payment is deemed eligible for medicaid assistance because s 1512 hr 4208 hr 5466 and s 2560 would permit expansion of title ive foster care maintenance payments to age 21 these bills would also provide expanded mandatory medicaid coverage provided the youth otherwise met all title ive eligibility

introduced by senator clinton would permit hhs to make competitive grants to states or state partners to establish individual development accounts idas for any youth aging out of foster care funds saved in this account could be used by youth for housing education vocational training to operate business or to purchase car and at the option of the state for purchase of workrelated items or car insurance however before youth could expend these funds to either operate business or purchase car he or she would first need to spend money on housing education or vocational training s 2341 would establish this grant program as an amendment to capta and would authorize additional funding under that act of such sums as may be necessary for each of fy2008fy2012 solely for grants to establish these idas social securityssi benefit accounts the foster children selfsupport act hr 1104 introduced by representative stark would prohibit states from using certain social security benefits including survivors benefits authorized under title ii and supplemental security income ssi benefits authorized under title xvi to reimburse state for the cost of childs foster care maintenance payment the bill would also require the state child welfare agency to ensure that children in foster care were screened for potential eligibility for these benefits and to assist such children in applying for the benefits further for any foster child receiving an ssi or other social security act benefit under title ii hr 1104 would require states to develop plan specific to the needs of that child and which would conserve benefits not necessary for the immediate needs of the child to enable the child to achieve self support after leaving foster care any savings accumulated under the plan would not be counted for purposes of determining the childs continued ssi eligibility81 special immigrant juvenile classification hr 3409 would amend the immigration and nationality act to allow youth who may now be denied access to special immigrant juvenile classification due for instance to the length of application processing time or other reasons to achieve this classification congress created the special immigrant juvenile classification in 1990 pl 101649 to allow child who was born in foreign country was brought to the united states illegally and who subsequently experienced abuse neglect

children in foster care often experience more than one placement and this is disruptive to their academic achievement as well as to peer and adult relationships83 hr 5466 would require states to take new steps to ensure stability in school placement for children in foster care and would permit support for certain transportation costs to facilitate these efforts under current law states are required to maintain health and education record for every child in foster care including the name and address of the childs educational provider childs grade level performance school record and other relevant education information as determined relevant by the state agency states are also required to make assurances as part of this health and education record that childs placement in foster care takes into account the proximity to the school in which the child is enrolled at the time of placement84 hr 5466 would further require that state have plan for ensuring the educational stability of each child in foster care in addition to the current assurance that the childs placement take into account the proximity of the school where the child is enrolled at the time of the placement the plan would need to discuss the efforts by the state agency to coordinate with appropriate local educational agencies to ensure child may remain enrolled in the school he or she attended at the time of placement or if remaining in that school is not in the childs best interest efforts to 82 for information on the special immigrant juvenile classification see sally kinoshita and katherine brady

school finally hr 5466 would amend the definition of foster care maintenance payment under title ive of the social security act to include the cost of reasonable travel for child to remain in the school he or she was enrolled in at the time of the placement this would permit states to seek partial reimbursement of these transportation costs provided they were incurred on behalf of title ive eligible children in foster care85 alternatively the school choice for foster care kids act hr 4311 introduced by representative bachmann would amend the cfcip and its related education and training vouchers etv to permit funds from those programs to be used for vouchers to pay transportation costs related to schoolage children in foster care attending public elementary or secondary education schools or to enable those schoolage children to pay tuition for attendance at private elementary or secondary schools86 as discussed above under current law cfcip and etv funds must be used to help foster youth of any age who are expected to leave care without placement in permanent family and those who have exited foster care on or after their 18th birthday to successfully make the transition to independent adulthood and this may include helping them secure high school diploma or postsecondary degree87 coordination of child welfare and medical services many children in foster care have significant health and mental health needs88 although virtually all children in foster care are eligible for medicaid needed services are not always made available some research has identified coordination between child welfare agencies and health and mental health agencies as important to improving foster childrens access to necessary services89 under current law title ive eligible 85

physicians and other appropriate medical professionals to assess the health and well being of children in foster care and to determine appropriate medical treatment for them92 hr 5466 would provide that states must in addition have plan for ongoing oversight and coordination of health care services including mental health and dental services for any child in foster care the bill would require each state to coordinate and collaborate with its child welfare agency and its agency administering medicaid in consultation with pediatricians other health care experts and recipients of child welfare services to develop such an oversight and coordination plan in addition to the current requirement that states consult with and involve physicians in assessing and providing appropriate medical treatment to children in foster care this oversight and coordination plan would be required to outline 1 schedule for initial and followup health screens that meet reasonable standards of medical practice 2 how health needs identified through screens will be monitored and treated 3 how medical information for children in care will be updated and appropriately shared which may include development and implementation of electronic health records 4 steps to ensure continuity of health care services which may including establishing medical home for every child in care and 5 oversight of prescription medicines finally hr 5466 would provide that the requirement for health oversight and coordination plan must not be construed to reduce or limit the responsibility of the state medicaid agency to provide care and services for children who are also served by the child welfare agency reasonable efforts to place siblings together hr 5466 would require states as part of their title ive foster care plan to make reasonable efforts to place siblings in the same foster care placement unless the state documents that joint placement would be contrary to the safety or wellbeing of any of the siblings approximately 70 of children in foster care have another sibling who is also in care for variety of reasons including the size of sibling groups adequacy of foster care

including better outcomes for these children as well as streamlined casework efforts for child welfare workers93 access to court advocates most but not all children who enter foster care do so because of parental abuse or neglect the child abuse prevention and treatment act capta currently provides that states must have provisions and procedures for an appropriately trained guardian ad litem gal including an appropriately trained courtappointed special advocate casa to be appointed to represent any child in judicial proceeding involving child abuse or neglect available data suggest that despite this capta requirement not all abused or neglected children receive such court advocate94 casa for every child act of 2007 hr 3283 introduced by representative cardoza would require states as part of their title ive state plan for foster care to have in place the laws and procedures necessary to ensure that each child in foster care has casa funding for casas currently the victims of child abuse act authorizes some funds 132 million appropriated for fy2008 to initiate sustain or expand local casa programs and to provide related training and technical assistance to local casa programs as amended in 2005 pl 109162 the purpose of this funding is to ensure that by january 1 2010 court appointed special advocate shall be available to every victim of child abuse or neglect in the united states who needs one funding provided under this authorization is administered by the department of justice which typically provides these funds to the national casa association the national casa in turn makes subgrants to local casa programs and provides related training and technical assistance95 hr 3283 would prohibit any federal reimbursement of casarelated costs under the title ive foster care program unless the casa provided is volunteer in member program of the national casa and that member program is in compliance with national standards of the association separately s 2237 an omnibus crime control and prevention measure would authorize discretionary appropriation of 8 million for each of fy2008 through fy2011 for the following purposes to expand recruitment and build capacity of casa programs located in the 15 largest areas to serve populations overrepresented in foster care to expand recruitment of volunteers to serve populations of children significantly over represented in foster care and to provide training and supervision of volunteers in casa programs serving children significantly overrepresented in foster care96 s 2237 would provide that any casa

supplant other federal casa funding training and standards under current law capta provides that galcasa who is appointed to advocate for child in an abuse or neglect proceeding is expected to gain firsthand and clear understanding of the situation and needs of the child and to make recommendations to the court concerning the best interests of the child97 s 2237 would require hhs in conjunction with the department of justice to develop model standards for curriculum and training for individuals who act as gals or casas or other attorneys ad litem in child abuse and neglect cases the bill describes the intended purpose of this model curriculum as to improve the quality of representation by and uniformity of practice of such individuals throughout the country s 2237 would further require hhs again after consulting with the department of justice to develop caseload standards for these child representatives in abuse or neglect cases finally the bill would provide that not later than 18 months after the enactment of these provisions hhs must disseminate the curriculum and caseload standards to state child welfare agencies who receive title ivb subpart 1 funds hr 5466 would permit states to claim reimbursement of the cost of certain training for gals or casas as well as other abuse and neglect court attorneys or personnel see increased federal support for training below provision of mentoring several federal programs now target specific populations of vulnerable youth for provision of mentoring services98 the foster care mentoring act of 2007 s 379 introduced by senator landrieu would permanently authorize funding under title ivb of the social security act for grants to provide mentoring to children in foster care the grants would be awarded by hhs to states or to political subdivision of the state if it serves substantial number of youth in foster care to support establish and expand networks of public and private community entities to provide this mentoring successful applicants would be eligible to receive maximum of 600000 annually would be required to spend less than 50 of the federal grant funds for training and more than 10 on program administration and would need to provide matching funds in cash or in kind of 25 the bill would authorize 15 million for this grant program in each of fy2008 and fy2009 and such sums as may be necessary in every following fiscal year s 379 would also authorize an additional 4 million for each of fy2008 and fy2009 and such sums as may be necessary in each following fiscal year for national hotline or website to provide information to individuals interested in being mentors to youth in foster care the bill would further require an annual report on the mentoring program for children in foster care prepared by hhs and submitted to congress and separate evaluation of the programs effectiveness finally s 379 would amend the higher education act to authorize loan forgiveness for any individual who has served as mentor in statewide foster care 97 section 106b2aiii of the child abuse prevention and treatment act capta 98 see crs report rl34306 vulnerable youth federal mentoring programs and issues by adrienne fernandes crs42 mentor program for at least 200 hours in single calendar year the amount of loan forgiveness would equal 2000 for every 200 hours of eligible service not to exceed total of 20000 the bill would further provide that funds otherwise made available under the higher education act to make payments to lenders for the discharge of indebtedness of deceased or disabled individuals would be available to pay for this loan forgiveness program reducing the number of children who run away from foster care hr 3409 hr 4208 and s 2560 would require state to include in its title ive state plan description of the written policies and procedures it has to reduce the incidence of children missing or running away from foster care and to locate and return such children to foster care as of the last day of fy2005 states reported that close to 4500 children had exited foster care by running away preventing certain foster care placements several proposals seek to prevent placement of children in foster care solely due to inadequate housing or because this is the only way parents may access mental health services for seriously emotionally disturbed child prohibition on removal related to homelessness hr 3409 hr 4208 and s 2560 would amend the state plan provisions of the title ive foster care program to require states to have in effect laws and procedures necessary to ensure that child is placed in foster care solely because the childs family is homeless or living in substandard housing the proposed change would further require that the state as part of meeting the federal title ive state plan requirements have in place laws and procedures to ensure that it will work with family and state housing authorities to secure permanent housing for any family that includes minor child and is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless alternative to relinquishment for mental health reasons the keeping families together act s 382 introduced by senator collins and hr 687 introduced by representative ramstad would amend title v of the public health service act to authorize competitive family support grants for states to establish systems of care for mental health treatment and services that would prevent the practice of parents relinquishing their children to child welfare or juvenile justice custody in order to obtain mental health services for their children the gao reported in april 2003 that survey of 19 state child welfare directors and juvenile justice officials in 30 counties had produced conservative estimate of 12700 children who during fy2001 were placed in child welfare or juvenile justice custody so that the children could receive mental health services state and county officials surveyed by gao reported that limitations of public and private health insurance inadequate supplies of mental health services limited availability of services through mental health agencies and schools and difficulty meeting eligibility rules of services influenced these kind of placements99 99 us general accounting office gao child welfare and juvenile justice federal agencies could play stronger role in helping states reduce the number of children continued crs43 s 382 and hr 687 would authorize 85 million for fy2008 115 million for fy2009 and 20 million in each of fy2010 through fy2013 to award grant funds to states to establish sustainable system of care for child and youth under the age of 21 who are in state custody for the purpose of receiving mental health services or who are at risk of this kind of placement states winning grant funds would be able to use them to to establish state and local infrastructure that permits interagency cooperation and crosssystem financing expand public health insurance programs to cover an array of communitybased mental health and family support services deliver mental health care and family support services to eligible children and youth but only as part of transition to sustainable system of mental health and family support services provide outreach and public education provide the necessary training and professional development for personnel who work with eligible children and youth to implement the states plan and to carry out other administration of the plan including development and maintenance of data systems the grant funds would be received over six years and states would be required to provide increasing levels of matching funds beginning in the third year of the grant state plan would need to be submitted before the second year of the grant and among other things would need to describe how the planned sustainable system of care would be financed including through contributions from state agencies state use of funds via medicaid options or waivers the state childrens health insurance program schip and other public health insurance mechanisms the grants would be administered within hhs by the substance abuse and mental health services administration samhsa in consultation with task force established to examine the issue of mental health and children and youth in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems including issues related to access to services and the role of agencies in promoting access to these services for children and youth the task force would need to be established jointly with the administration for children and families acf and the centers for medicaid and medicare services cms both also within hhs the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ojjdp at the department of justice and the office for special education at the department of education the task force would be required to work with stakeholders to make recommendations to congress for strategies to improve the delivery of mental health services to children and youth with serious emotional disturbances and to develop improved reporting requirements concerning the numbers of children entering child welfare and juvenile justice systems solely to access mental health service including creating standard definitions for categories of data to be collected the task force would further be required to encourage interagency cooperation to eliminate the practice of custody relinquishment provide advice to samhsa on administering the grant program coordinate and deliver technical assistance for states and agencies implementing the grant program make recommendations for breaking down barriers to coordination in existing federal programs and finally provide biannual report to congress on its recommendations and progress in carrying out its duties s 382 and hr 687 would authorize funding of 1 million in each of fy2008 through 99 continued placed solely to obtain mental health services gao03397 april 2003 crs44 fy2013 to fund this task force with 60 of funds authorized for hhs 20 for the department of justice and 20 for the education department other supports and services for kinship care providers as discussed above several bills would permit federal support via title ive of the social security act for guardianship payments to relative caregivers who become the legal guardians of eligible foster children see support for subsidized guardianship above other provisions in these bills would seek to strengthen family connections for children in foster care or at risk of entering foster care including children in formal or informal kinship care arrangements and to facilitate greater use of relatives as foster parents children cared for by relatives kinship care may be broadly defined as living arrangement in which an adult who is not the parent of child but who is emotionally close to child typically grandparent or other relative assumes primary responsibility for raising this child children may be in kinship care situation for variety of reasons including their parents military deployment death or serious illness poverty abuse of drugs or alcohol mental illness or incarceration at least 23 million children are believed to be living with grandparents or other relatives who are responsible for their care100 and some estimates of children living with kin who are responsible for them are larger101 the very large majority of children living in kinship care arrangement are doing so by private arrangement on the last day of fy2006 only about 125000 children were in formal courtordered foster care and were living with relative102 at the same time some children living in kinship care arrangements neither came to this living arrangement privately nor are they currently in foster care these children may 100 the 2002 national survey of american families conducted by the urban institute estimated 23 million children lived with grandparents or other relatives without either parent present in the household see children in kinship care assessing the new federalism urban institute date based on 2002 survey 101 estimates of the number of children in kinship care are considerably larger if they include households where parent may be present but the grandparent is considered responsible for the child for fy2006 the american community survey conducted by the us census bureau reported 26 million children lived with grandparents who were responsible for them of which 1 million lived in households without any parent present and that an additional 20 million children lived in the households of other relatives although the available analysis of these data do not indicate the number of those 20 million children for whom the other relatives were responsible nor the number who were living without at least one parent in the household it seems plausible that significant share of these children are also in kinship

foster care or at risk of entering care hr 5466 would authorize discretionary funds for competitive grants under title ivb of the social security act to 1 establish kinship navigator programs 2 help identify family members with whom child may be placed or 3 encourage involvement of family members in planning for childs care through family group decisionmaking meetings s 661 and hr 2188 would authorize discretionary funds for competitive grants to establish kinship navigator programs and would separately require states to identify and give notice to relatives when child is placed in foster care finally hr 5466 s 661 hr 2188 and hr 3409 would each permit states to establish separate licensing standards for relative foster care providers kinship navigator kinship providers may lack the legal authority to enroll the children they are caring for in their neighborhood school or to access other education services for them in addition they may not have the legal right to make needed medical care decisions for these children and they may not have access to information about the kinds of health education or other services they and the children they care for may be eligible to receive further advocates note that many kin must assume care for young relative with little notice and may be unprepared or lack critical social or community supports for their efforts104 s 661 and hr 2188 would establish an independent program authorizing the administration for children and families acf within hhs to make grants to states metropolitan agencies or tribal organizations to establish information and referral systems for kinship care providers known as kinship navigator programs by contrast hr 5466 would establish family connection grants as new subpart under title ivb of the social security act and would permit state local or tribal child welfare agencies as well as certain private nonprofit organizations to seek grants from hhs for three separate purposes one of which would be to establish kinship navigator programs for more information see family connection grants below under s 661 and hr 2188 the primary purpose of the kinship navigator grants would be to help kinship caregivers learn about and access services or other assistance needed for the children they are caring for and for themselves grantees would be required to support certain core activities including information and referral systems to link kinship caregivers to the full range of supports available to them and promotion of partnerships between public and private notforprofit agencies to

would authorize 25 million in fy2008 50 million in fy2009 and 75 million in fy2010 for these grants grants would be for maximum of three years and less than half of the funds appropriated would need to be awarded to state agencies after the first year of funding grantees would need to provide increasing levels of nonfederal support for the kinship navigator program and as part of final report on services and activities funded by the grant grantee would be required to describe to acf its plans for continuing the program after the expiration of the federal grant finally acf would be permitted to reserve up to 1 of any of the funds appropriated to provide technical assistance to grantees related to the purposes of the kinship navigator program family connection grants as noted above hr 5466 would establish new competitive grant program under title ivb of the social security act known as family connection grants and would authorize hhs to award grants to help children in foster care or at risk of entering foster care reconnect with family members through implementation of 1 kinship navigator programs to help kinship caregivers learn about and access programs and services and obtain assistance in meeting the needs of the children they are caring for and their own needs 2 intensive familyfinding efforts using search technology to find biological family members of children in the child welfare system and work to reestablish relationships and explore ways to find permanent family placements for children or 3 family group decisionmaking meetings for children in the child welfare system that engage and involve family members in plans to nurture children and protect them from further abuse and neglect eligible grantees including state local or tribal child welfare agencies and nonprofit organizations with experience in working with foster children or children living in kinship care arrangements would need to submit an application to hhs that among other things would describe how funds received would be used to implement one or more of the programs identify the types of children and families to be served the manner in which they would be identified and recruited and the initial number expected to be served and give assurance that the grantee would cooperate fully in any evaluation of the program by hhs private agency grantees would need to document support from the relevant local or state child welfare agency the bill would authorize 50 million in each of fy2009 through fy2013 for these grants family connection grants would be authorized for maximum of three years and hhs would be authorized to make more than 20 payments annually under the program after the first year of funding grantees would need to provide increasing levels of nonfederal support for the activities supported by the family connection grant finally hhs would be required to reserve 3 of any of the funds appropriated for these grants to conduct rigorous evaluation of the activities they fund and it would be permitted to reserve 2 of any funding to provide technical assistance to grantees under the program notify relatives of childs placement in foster care states must now consider giving preference to suitable relatives over nonrelatives when crs47 placing child in care105 s 661 hr 2188 and s 3038 would additionally seek to ensure that relatives are aware of and understand their options related to childs placement and care s 661 and hr 2188 would require state within 60 days of removing child from the custody of hisher parents to identify the childs grandparents and other adult relatives and to give them notice of the removal subject to exceptions due to family or domestic violence the notice to the identified relatives would need to specify that the child is being removed from the custody of hisher parents and to explain options the relative has under federal state or local laws to participate in the childs care and placement in addition it would need to explain any options that might be lost if the relative fails to respond to the notice s 3038 would require that states exercise due diligence to identify and provide similar notices to adult relatives of children entering foster care s 3038 would further provide that the state must also give notice to any nonparent relative caretakers of child who is receiving federal or state tanf assistance provided that the childs placement with that relative occurred following the familys interaction with the child welfare agency licensing standards hr 2188 s 661 hr 5466 and hr 3409 would amend the requirements of title ive to permit states to establish and maintain separate licensing standards for relative caregivers of foster children the separate standards would be required at minimum to protect the safety of the child and specifically to provide for criminal records checks hr 2188 s 661 and hr 3409 would require those criminal record checks to be the same as those now required for prospective foster or adoptive parents hr 5466 does not specify this requirement106 both hr 5466 and hr 3409 would further amend the licensing requirement to provide that any child in foster care must be placed in licensed foster family home or institution not just those who are receiving federal support under title ive or title ivb of the social security act under current federal child welfare policy states are required to have in place licensing standards for foster family homes or institutions that care for foster children that are reasonably in accord with recommended standards of national organizations concerned with such standards these standards must at least address admission policies safety sanitation and protection of civil rights and must apply to any foster family home or institution that receives federal support under title ivb or title ive of the social security act107 separately states are required to have background check procedures in place for prospective foster and adoptive parents and may not approve placement until these checks have been completed further prospective foster or adoptive parent with certain criminal 105 section 471a19 of the social security act 106 hr 5466 would establish separate federal criminal record check requirements for relatives who are receiving kinship guardianship assistance payments on behalf of child for whom they have assumed legal guardianship see subsidized guardianship above however the bill does not reference that separate criminal records check language in this provision and the intent is not certain 107 section 471a10 of the social security act crs48 convictions may not be an approved caregiver108 child placed in an unlicensed home or institution or with an individual who is not approved may not receive federally supported title ive foster care maintenance payment109 since the january 2000 publication of the federal regulations to implement the adoption and safe families act of 1997 asfa pl 10589 hhs has clearly stated that licensing standards for relatives and nonrelatives must be the same110 more recently changes made in the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 also limit the ability of states to seek reimbursement under title ive for eligible costs related to case planning for children living in unlicensed relative homes111 and finally the adam walsh child protection and safety act of 2006 pl 109248 requires fingerprintbased federal criminal history checks of prospective foster and adoptive parents as well as child abuse and neglect registry checks112 yet for variety of reasons relative caregivers are less likely to be licensed than nonrelative caregivers unlike nonrelative foster care providers relatives typically do not anticipate being foster care provider and thus they do not seek license before becoming foster parent further some relatives may find the licensing process intrusive and too time consuming and in some states licensing of relatives was not routinely done housing support the housing protection and foster care prevention act of 2008 hr 5645 introduced by representative maxine waters would amend the united states housing act to exclude eligible guardianship subsidies made on behalf of former foster children from the income that is counted for purposes of determining familys eligibility and rent for federally supported housing such as section 8113 the proposed change would make the treatment of eligible guardianship subsidies equal to the treatment of foster care maintenance payments which are not considered income when determining eligibility and rent in federal housing assistance programs114 to be excluded from the familys income for either purpose the bill would require that the guardianship subsidy must be made to the legal relative guardian of child under 18 years of age who was previously in foster care for at 108 section 471a20 of the social security act 109 section 472c and section 471a20ai and ii

department of housing and urban development hud had further analyzed its incomecounting rules and that it would longer need to count eligible guardianship subsidies for children who were formerly in foster care as part of the family income115 additional provisions related to kin accessing services hr 2188 would amend the definition of family support that is included in the promoting safe and stable families pssf title ivb subpart 2 of the social security act program to include assisting kinship caregivers or guardians in locating and accessing needed services states must now generally spend less than 20 of their federal pssf funds on family support services and the hr 2188 proposal would explicitly include certain aids to kinship caregivers in this spending hr 2188 would further provide that as part of establishing title ive kinship guardianship program as is elsewhere proposed in the bill state must certify to hhs that it will inform workers who prepare case plans for children in foster care as well as families who are considering guardianship of the full range of permanency options for children further it would require states to provide or otherwise make

to do diligent recruitment of foster and adoptive parents that reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of children in the state for whom foster and adoptive homes are needed116 further states are permitted to seek federal reimbursement under title ive of the social security act for portion of their costs related to licensing foster family homes and recruiting foster families117 in the initial round of child and family services reviews cfsr which are conducted to assess state conformity with federal child welfare policy most states n31 were told they needed to make improvements in their foster and adoptive 115 see representativewaters statement on this issue at httpwwwhousegovappslist pressca35_waterspr080410_kingaphtml as of midjune 2008 formal notice on this matter had been published by hud in the federal register 116 section 422b7 of the social security act 117 code of federal regulations 45 cfr 135660c2vii crs50 parent recruitment plans118 the final reports from the initial round of the cfsr discussed use of multiple recruitment efforts including those aimed at the general population via television billboards or other mass media targeted recruitment in neighborhoods via church or other faithbased groups and child specific recruitment via websites or adoption photo books those reports also noted that some states have sought to streamline recruitment efforts by combining their training and licensing efforts for foster and adoptive parents nonetheless as part of the cfsr stakeholders in many states talked about shortage of foster and adoptive homes or more specifically about shortage of these homes for specific populations of children eg teenagers or children with special health needs the hhs office of inspector general in 2002 report emphasized the importance of both targeted and childspecific recruitment as did more recent research that was supported by the casey family programs119 one church one child hr 4198 would amend title ive to add new section authorizing competitive grants to eligible entities that conduct one church one child foster and adoptive parent recruitment programs these programs rely on churches and church leaders to help identify families willing to adopt or foster child some states and localities now use this recruitment approach and it has been identified as useful recruitment strategy by child welfare researchers advocates and practitioners120 hr 4198 would permit state or local governments local public agencies communitybased or nonprofit organizations or private groups including charitable or faith based organizations to apply for grants to establish or expand programs that use networks of public private and faithbased organizations to recruit and train qualified foster parents and qualified adoptive parents and provide support services to adoptive and foster children and their families the bill would authorize not more than 20 million for each of fy2008 through fy2013 for this purpose separately hr 4198 would require hhs to enter into contract with nationally recognized nonprofit adoption promotion and foster parent recruitment organization to establish national clearinghouse for adoption promotion and foster parent program and would authorize up to 1 million in funds for each of fy2008 through fy2013 for this purpose improving agency responsiveness the adoption improvement act of 2007 s 2395 would authorize funding for grants to child welfare agencies to 118 this initial round of reviews was conducted from 2001 through 2004 crs report rl32968 child

that many more people consider adopting children than ultimately act on that thought further recent survey that looked at how child welfare agencies responded to individuals who expressed interest in adopting children concluded more could be done by those agencies to encourage and enable interested adults to complete an adoption the researchers estimated that annually 240000 calls are made to child welfare agencies concerning adoption but in most cases 78 the caller did not subsequently fill out an application or attend an orientation meeting and only about 6 of the calls resulted in completed adoption home study prerequisite for any adoption this research further showed that prospective parents seeking adoption information faced numerous discouragements including difficulty contacting the child welfare agency unpleasant and unhelpful initial contacts and continued frustration throughout the adoption process121 s 2395 would authorize hhs to award grants to state regional local or tribal child welfare agencies that have primary responsibility to facilitate adoptions from the child welfare system to increase the share of prospective adoptive parents who actually adopt children from the agency through variety of methods among other things grantee would be required to 1 involve legitimate and independent marketing firm in its adoption recruitment training and retention efforts to incorporate business and consumer product marketing techniques 2 establish specialized adoption hotline hire employees with counseling backgrounds and provide them with specialized training for adoption work and establish process to incorporate feedback from all prospective adoptive parents to improve the first contact between the agency and prospective adoptive parents 3 coordinate all adoption sources to give prospective parents immediate access to all children available for adoption 4 provide written information about necessary qualifications for adoptive parents as well as clear information on range of other topics ranging from the agency adoption process and procedures to how children and prospective parents are matched and the availability of post permanency services 5 involve successful adoptive parents in designing recruitment strategies as well as in training and matching children with parents including developing mentoring system to link prospective adoptive parents with parents who have successfully adopted and establishing an adoption advisory committee to strengthen matching procedures and finally 6 participate in program evaluation hhs must through an expert entity conduct research on the successes and challenges of grantees efforts and must report on its findings to congress later than two years after the date on

by representative pomeroy and the omnibus child welfare policy bill hr 5466 would permit indian tribes tribal organizations or tribal consortia to make direct claims under title ive of the social security act for federal reimbursement of eligible foster care or adoption assistance payments and other related costs made on behalf of eligible children under tribal responsibility current law permits states to make these direct claims but does not permit tribes to do so some tribes however currently enter into intergovernmental agreements with states to receive some title ive funding on behalf of children in care under tribal responsibility tribal access to title ive funds s 1956 hr 4688 and hr 5466 would provide that to receive title ive foster care and adoption assistance funds tribe tribal organization or tribal consortium must operate title ive program have cooperative agreement with state or submit to hhs description of the arrangements it has made jointly and in consultation with the state to provide foster care and adoption assistance including certain protections for the child in care these bills would permit tribes tribal organizations and tribal consortia to receive adoption incentives on the same basis as states further under s 1956 and hr 4688 eligible tribes tribal organizations or tribal consortia would be permitted to receive part of states allotment of chafee foster care independence program and education and training voucher funds in proportion to the tribal entitys share of the foster care population living in the state in exchange for providing independent living services to tribal youth in the state who are aging out or are expected to age out of tribal foster care alternatively those bills would provide that states and tribes are explicitly permitted to enter into cooperative agreements to ensure services to older tribal foster youth and youth aging out of foster care under the cfcip program definition of tribe s 1956 would define indian tribe as any federally recognized tribe including an alaska native village and would define tribal organization as the governing body of any such tribe hr 4688 and hr 5466 would use this same definition except for native groups in alaska which they would define to mean any one of 12 alaska native regional nonprofit corporations and the metlakatla indian community of the annette islands reserve plan requirements with certain exceptions s 1956 hr 4688 and hr 5466 would require tribe tribal organization or tribal consortium seeking to operate title ive program to meet all of the requirements currently made of states including for instance those related to case planning and review for each child in foster care and data reporting all three bills however would modify certain plan requirements rather than operating programs on statewide basis each tribe crs53 would be required to identify the service area or areas and populations to be served under its title ive plan further in lieu of the requirement that states establish uniform foster home licensing standards that are reasonably in accord with the recommended standards of national organizations concerned with standards for such institutions or homes all three bills would generally permit tribes to establish licensing standards that met tribal standards to ensure the safety of and accountability for children placed in foster care however hr 5466 would not permit tribes in alaska to establish separate licensing standards finally s 1956 hr 4688 and hr 5466 would permit hhs to modify any requirement of title iv if it determined that doing so would best advance the interests and safety of the tribal children being served background checks s 1956 and hr 4688 would modify title ive state plan requirements related to background checks for prospective foster and adoptive parents in slightly different ways hr 5466 would not amend these provisions relative to tribes s 1956 would require tribes to conduct background checks in accordance with the rules of the indian child protection and family violence prevention act icpfvpa instead of the procedures described in title ive of the social security act and would further require that tribes include child abuse and neglect registry checks as part of those procedures by contrast hr 4688 would permit tribes to choose between the background check procedures detailed in title ive or the icpfvpa procedures and to conduct child abuse and neglect registry checks tribal matching rates s 1956 hr 4688 and hr 5466 would provide that tribes operating title ive plan or those with cooperative agreement with state or other formal arrangement would receive reimbursement of foster care maintenance payments and adoption assistance based on the per capita income of the tribal population served and hhs would determine the appropriate reimbursement rate for their administrative and training costs however in case could tribe receive lower reimbursement rate than that provided for the state in which it is located to meet title ive matching requirements tribes would be permitted to use federal state tribal or private funds including inkind funds title ive eligibility requirements for indian children children must be the subject of variety of judicial determinations in order to be eligible for title ive support these include judicial finding that the childs home was found contrary to the welfare of the child at the time of removal from the home and that reasonable efforts were made to prevent the childs removal from home these findings must be made within specific time frames s 1946 and hr 4688 would permit tribes to use certain affidavits or other legal instruments to establish retroactively that these findings had been made s 1946 and hr 4688 would also provide that any residency requirement related to states prior law aid to families with dependent children afdc program is not applicable for purposes of establishing federal title ive eligibility of child in foster care under tribal responsibility hr 5466 does not include these or any similar provisions other stipulations and requirements s 1956 hr 4688 and hr 5466 would require hhs in consultation with indian tribes and tribal organizations to issue regulations regarding tribal access to title ive funds separately s 1956 and crs54 hr 4688 would stipulate that none of the legislative changes proposed with regard to tribal access to title ive funding would affect the current and ongoing responsibility of states to provide foster care adoption assistance or independent living supports or services to eligible tribal children or youth if those supports or services are not made available under tribal program cooperative agreement or other formal arrangement further state would not be permitted to terminate foster care or adoption assistance payments currently made on behalf of tribal child and for whom it receives federal reimbursement regardless of whether there was cooperative agreement between the state and tribe or the tribe chose to operate title ive plan national child welfare resource center for tribes as passed by the senate on february 26 2008 section 211 of s 1200 the indian health care improvement act amendments of 2008 would appropriate 1 million in each of fy2009 through fy2013 for hhs to establish national child welfare resource center for tribes the resource center must not be established as part of any existing national child welfare resource center and must be specifically and exclusively dedicated to meeting the needs of indian tribes and tribal organizations by providing information advice and educational materials regarding the types of services administrative functions data collection program management and reporting that are provided for under title ivb and title ive of the social security act improving the child welfare workforce hr 5466 would establish new grant program which would be intended to help states improve the quality of their child welfare services by improving the quality and capacity of their child welfare workforce and would also permit states to claim federal reimbursement for 75 of training costs associated with broader range of workers hr 2314 introduced by representative jerry weller would specifically allow states to claim the federal title ive reimbursement rate for training costs associated with statelicense or stateapproved private child welfare agency workers who provides services to foster or adopted children finally the child welfare workforce improvement act s 2944 introduced by senator hillary clinton would expand both the range of workers and the scope of topics for which states would be permitted to claim federal reimbursement of75 under the title ive training provisions s 2944 would also require national academy of sciences study nas regarding child welfare workforce issues and would require hhs to issue regulations mandating state reporting of certain child welfare workforce data grants to support quality child welfare workers in 2003 the gao reported that survey of state child welfare agencies including interviews with caseworkers in some states and an analysis of exit interviews completed by child welfare staff across the country identified number of factors believed to hinder both recruitment and retention of child welfare workers and supervisors or to negatively affect the quality of child welfare services these included high caseloads crs55 with extensive related administrative work lack of supervisory support low salaries the risk of violence and insufficient time to take training122 hr 5466 would require the administration for children and families acf within hhs to make grants to eligible states to implement strategies that make measurable improvements related to the following specific indicators in state the caseload size of child welfare workers the number of child welfare caseworkers assigned to single supervisor the average duration of child welfare workers supervisors and nonsupervisors the number or share of child welfare workers with relevant higher education degrees and the range and scope of training opportunities as well as the number or share of child welfare staff engaged in training the bill would appropriate 200 million for this purpose in each of fy2009 through fy2013 every state including the district of columbia and each of the territories would be eligible to receive an allotment of funds provided they submitted an application that stated which indicator or indicators they planned to improve how they intended to spend funds to make these improvements what the status of those indicators was currently ie baseline data and which gave assurance that they would submit annual reports to hhs on spending under the plan and the effects of the spending with regard to improving the selected indicators hhs would be permitted to disapprove an application if it included plan to spend the funds in manner substantially similar to the way state had spent funds in the last two of five years and provided that prior spending did not result in meaningful progress after setting aside funds for the territories indian tribes and for training and technical assistance allotments to the states including the district of columbia would be based on the relative share of children among all states receiving the grant funds however pro rata adjustments would be made if necessary to ensure that state would receive less than 300000 annually state would need to spend at least 1 on the purposes of the grant for every 3 allotted to it in federal grant funds the bill would also provide additional evaluation and accountability measures related to use of these grant funds and would require hhs in consultation with the states representatives of child welfare workers and advocates for children and families to prescribe regulations for the grant program increased federal support for staff training under current law state is permitted to seek federal reimbursement of 75 of its cost of providing shortterm training for individuals employed or preparing to be employed by public child welfare agency provided the training is related to foster care and adoption assistance activities allowed under title ive of the social security act123 many

training of staff of child care institutions caring for adopted children or children in continued crs56 states make use of private agencies to provide casework and other services to children in foster care hr 5466 and hr 2314 would additionally permit states to receive federal reimbursement of 75 of the cost of short term programrelated training for child welfare workers employed by private agencies that provide services to title ive eligible children but only if those private agencies are statelicensed or stateapproved child welfare agencies s 2944 would permit states to claim this reimbursement rate for both shortterm and longterm training of public and private child welfare agency workers in addition hr 5466 and s 2944 would permit states to seek reimbursement under title ive 75 reimbursement rate for shortterm training costs related to certain individuals who work for or in abuse and neglect courts as well as individuals who work for public or private nonprofit agencies that serve children s 2944 would further amend the title ive training provisions to broaden the scope of topics for which state child welfare agencies may seek federal title ive reimbursement and would also permit funds from private nonprofit education institutions to be used by the state as matching funds under the title ive training provisions finally s 2944 would require the national academy of sciences to conduct national study of child welfare staff and among other things to provide recommendations related to federal regulations to be issued by hhs that would require state reporting on child welfare staff characteristics and provision of services other child welfare or related proposals some additional changes proposed to child welfare or related policy are discussed below home visiting the healthy children and families act of 2007 s 1052 introduced by senator salazar and hr 3024 introduced by representative degette would amend the medicaid and schip programs to explicitly permit the use of these funding streams for evidencebased nurse home visitation programs the education begins at home act s 667 introduced by senator bond and hr 2343 introduced by representative danny davis would authorize funds for formula grants to states to expand quality programs of early childhood home visitation and would also make changes intended to strengthen home visiting as component of the early head start program for fy2008 congress appropriated 10 million to fund nurse home visitation initiative the joint explanatory statement accompanying the omnibus fy2008 appropriations measure hr 2674 enacted as pl 110161 provides that hhs must ensure that states use the funds to support models that have been shown in welldesigned randomized controlled trials to produce sizeable 123 continued foster care as well as for current or prospective foster or adoptive parents under current law eligible training claims may only be made on behalf of children who are title ive eligible and only with regard to activities considered title ive eligible hr 2314 would not change this hr 5466 would expand title ive eligibility to potentially all foster or adoptive with special needs children and thus expand the share of training and other foster care costs that would potentially be reimbursed by the federal government s 2944 would remove the restriction related to title ive eligibility for purposes of training claims only and as mentioned above would also expand the topics that could be covered crs57 sustained effects on important child outcomes such as abuse and neglect and to support activities to assist range of home visitation programs to replicate the techniques that have met these high evidentiary standards124 this funding appears largely consistent with request by hhs in its fy2008 budget for 10 million in funds to enable it to make competitive grants to states to encourage investment of existing funding streams into evidencebased nurse home visitation programs the fy2009 hhs budget requests continuation of this funding125 home visiting for atrisk parents is advocated as way to prevent abuse and neglect reduce the cost to government that is associated with such abuse and neglect and improve the health safety and wellbeing of the children and families served program models vary but typically services are intended to improve family or parent functioning promote the physical health of children and mothers as well as the social and emotional development of children and to ensure childrens school readiness depending on the program model these services may be delivered by nurses social workers teachers or paraprofessionals126 numerous home visiting program evaluations have been carried out at least one program model has been found to be both effective in improving outcomes for those served as well as reducing costs to government127 at the same time results from many evaluations have shown mixed or effects and researchers caution that home visiting is not panacea128 parenting education s 2237 would amend the child abuse prevention and treatment act capta to authorize 545 million to provide parent education and counseling services and family strengthening services as well as referral and counseling for adoption services the bill would stipulate that any funds appropriated under this authority are to be distributed through the communitybased grants to prevent child abuse and neglect title ii of capta under that program local communitybased grantees in each state are required to support parent education 124 this information is based on the version of hr 2764 and the accompanying joint explanatory statement division g as posted on the house rules committee website december 17 2007 see

the promoting safe and stable families pssf program title ivb subpart 2 of the social security act states are required to spend portion of the federal funds they receive for both family support and family preservation services and the definition of both of these service categories includes improving parenting abilities for example the definition of family preservation services includes services designed to improve parenting skills by reinforcing parents confidence in their strengths and helping them to identify where improvement is needed and to obtain assistance in improving these skills with respect to matters such as child development family budgeting coping with stress health and nutrition130 in addition states must spend portion of their pssf funds on adoption promotion and support and this service category is broadly defined to include any activity that encourages the adoption of child out of foster care when this is in the childs best interest s 2237 does not propose to amend this program funds provided for family preservation under the pssf program are intended to serve families at high risk of having children enter foster care or who may be reunited with child in foster care in either case these are typically families with an open child welfare case whether the child remains in the home or has been removed to foster care by contrast as implemented by hhs funds provided under captas communitybased grant program may not be used to serve families who have an open child welfare case regardless of whether the child is living at home instead they are intended to reach and serve families before child welfare involvement is needed child welfare workers regularly come into contact with caregivers whose parenting skills they assess as poor131 at the same time federal policy charges child welfare agencies with ensuring the safety and wellbeing of children broadly and more specifically with providing reasonable efforts to prevent the removal of child from his or her home or whenever safe and appropriate to return child who 129 section 206a3 of capta 130 section 4311e of the social security act defines family preservation services for purposes of the pssf program see also definition of family support services at section 4312 of the social security act 131 across nationally representative sample of children who were in families that were the subject of child abuse and neglect investigation the large majority 79 of parents whose children were removed from their care following the investigation were assessed as having poor parenting skills by child welfare workers and this was also true of nearly half 47 of the parents in families where the child welfare agency opened case to provide services to the child and family in the home finally poor parenting skills were reported by child welfare workers for one in five 20 of the parents whose children remained in the home following an investigation and for whom child welfare agency case was opened see richard barth et parenttraining programs in child welfare services planning for more evidencebased approach to serving biological parents research on social work practice september 2005 vol 15 5 p 357 table 1 crs59 has been placed in foster care to his or her home132 it should be surprise then that parent training is widely offered child welfare service with at least one estimate suggesting that annually as many as 800000 families receive parent training as child welfare service133 research indicates however that despite its widespread use child welfare agencies frequently do not pay for parent training and possibly as consequence do not often control the kind of training provided and that the effectiveness of the training models used has rarely been evaluated or otherwise shown as effective recent nationally representative survey found that in the majority of counties 61 child welfare agencies do not always pay for the provision of parent training instead the service is provided and funded by another community organization while acknowledging that research available on effective models of parent training for child welfareinvolved families is limited and that this is particularly true where neglect is the reason for the involvement as opposed to physical abuse researchers nonetheless advocate more attention by child welfare agencies to what is known about effective parent training and to implementing those models or at least the principles behind those models they also suggest that single model is unlikely to meet the range of needs among child welfareinvolved families given the different ages and developmental needs of the children in these families and because the parenting skills most deficient in family where neglect is the main issue are likely different from those where physical abuse or child behavior is the major reason for child welfare involvement134 infant safe haven s 2237 would require states receiving certain newly proposed funding related to law enforcement and victims assistance to have in place an infant safe haven law that includes specific provisions related to the legal and anonymous relinquishment of care and responsibility for newborn135 since 1999 132 for the broadest mandate see purposes of the social security acts title ivb programs child welfare services section

establish safe haven law as described in the text above later than three years after its enactment provided the state was receiving one of two new continued crs60 nearly every state has enacted infant safe haven legislation136 federal legislation enacted in 2002 pl 107133 explicitly permits states to use pssf funds to support infant haven programs to provide way for parent to safely relinquish newborn infant at safe haven designated pursuant to state law s 2237 would require state infant safe haven laws to include the following provisions permit parent to anonymously leave newborn baby with medically trained employee of hospital emergency room without criminal or other penalty states would be permitted however to pursue criminal or other penalties if the newborn showed signs of abuse or appeared to have been intentionally harmed s 2237 would further require that this state infant safe haven law include mechanism to encourage and permit hospital employee in the receiving hospital to collect information about the medical history of the family subject to the approval of the parent and it must require that immediately following the relinquishment law enforcement entities search state and federal missing person databases to ensure the child has not been reported as missing finally the state law would be required to include plan for publicizing the states safe haven law summary analysis of infant safe haven laws in place as of november 2004 suggests that many state laws have similar provisions to those that would be required by s 2237 that analysis showed that safe haven providers are defined in state laws to include variety of settings including hospitals emergency medical services police stations and fire stations states have defined range of ages under which an infant may be legally relinquished to safe haven provider but most provide limit between three days and one month typically these state laws provide for the relinquishing parents anonymity and that abandonment charges may be filed except in cases where child abuse or neglect is indicated and that the parents relinquishing the baby may not be compelled to provide personal information or accept information offered and many states require the safe haven provider to ask the parent for family and medical history information although in some states the safe haven provider is required to attempt to give the parents information about the legal effects of leaving the infant and information about referral services finally children relinquished to safe haven provider are typically transferred to the custody of child welfare agency which is expected to petition for the termination of the parental rights of the childs birth parents and to seek an adoptive home for the child some states permit the relinquishing parent to petition to reclaim his or her parental rights typically within specified time period and smaller number of states have 135 continued grants proposed to be established by the act those grants are for federal assistance to state and local law enforcement and for education prevention and victim assistance s 2237 provides that the justice department must make grants for these purposes to variety of eligible entities and would authorize new funding for them 136 hawaii is the most recent state to enact such legislation summer 2007 as of september 2007 alaska and nebraska were the only states that had not enacted infant safe haven laws in addition the district of columbia does not have an infant safe haven law crs61 provisions for father who did not relinquish the child to petition for the childs custody137 advocates of safe haven laws believe they will reduce the number of infants discarded or abandoned in dangerous places preventing risk to the newborns and possible death eliminating the fear of prosecution they argue enables desperate birth parent to act in the childs best interest and ensure the childs safety even when the parent does not feel able to personally care for the child others argue that the laws encourage irresponsible behavior and might induce birth parents to simply relinquish the child rather than to seek additional support and services by allowing birth parent anonymity they further argue that important medical or other genetic information may be lost forever to the child further they add that these laws might interfere with the parental rights of fathers if they are unaware of the babys birth and subsequent relinquishment138 some practical considerations in implementing the laws have included ensuring public awareness of the laws so that pregnant women and their partners know about this option as well as ensuring knowledge of the laws provisions among employees at safe haven providers finally the timing and conduct of termination of parental rights proceedings with regard to children left with safe haven provider may also be an issue children of incarcerated parents s 2237 would authorize funds 25 million for each of fy2008 and fy2009 for the federal bureau of prisons to carry out pilot program to collect certain information about the children of federal prisoners as part of its standard intake procedures eg number of children their ages and living arrangement the pilot program would also require review of policies practices and facilities to ensure that as appropriate to the health and wellbeing of the child they support relationship between the family and the child and further to identify training needs of staff concerning the impact of incarceration on children families and communities ageappropriate interactions and community resources for families of incarcerated persons close to 88 of prisoners are in state prisons rather than federal prisons and thus they are under the jurisdiction of state correctional agencies rather than the federal bureau of prisons139 s 2237 however would require the federal bureau of prisons to encourage state correctional agencies to implement the same intake procedures policy practices and facilities review and stafftraining related measures that would be required of the federal bureau of prisons under this pilot program 137

families affected by the incarceration of family member as appropriate to the health and wellbeing of any child involved the share of children coming into contact with the child welfare system whose caregivers have come into contact with the criminal justice system appears substantial recent nationally representative survey of children in families investigated because of an allegation of abuse or neglect found that as many as one in three of these children had primary caregiver with an arrest record at some point in their adult lives and one in eight children in families investigated because of abuse or neglect allegations had primary caregiver usually the mother who had been recently arrested ie within roughly six months of the reported maltreatment compared to other children in families that were the subject of abuse or neglect children whose primary caregivers were recently arrested were more likely to have been the subject of abuse or neglect allegations that involved abandonment or neglect and were less likely to be alleged victims of physical abuse further these children with primary caregiver who had been recently arrested were more likely to have parent with substance abuse or mental health problem and to be in families where 140 estimates are for 2002 and are based on survey data from earlier years that was applied to the fy2002 population of inmates and others

assistance for local teams to promote developmentally aware and appropriate court services for infants and toddlers age three years or younger who have been abused or neglected and for their families the purpose of the court teams would be to promote the wellbeing of infants and toddlers and their families help prevent recurrence of abuse or neglect in these families and promote timely

local programs and polices should be developed to reduce the number of children who are abused and neglected reduce the number of children in foster care and to increase the number of children in permanent placements through family reunification kinship placements and adoption the bill would require hhs to plan conduct and convene this white house conference in cooperation with other appropriate federal entities including the department of justice department of education and the department of housing and urban development the bills would authorize total discretionary appropriations of 10 million to accomplish its purposes adoption tax credit the adoption tax credit and related income tax exclusion is available to offset the qualified costs of taxpayers who adopt an eligible child in tax year 2005 most recent data available about 362 million in adoption tax benefits were claimed by more than 56400 taxpayers these benefits helped offset the cost of adoption for more than 65800 children148 close to half of the children for whom these adoption benefits were claimed are believed to have been adopted domestically primarily through private arrangements about onethird are expected to have been adopted from other countries international adoption and the remaining children had special needs and were adopted domestically primarily out of foster care149 under current law an individual adopting child with special needs defined in the tax code to include most children adopted out of foster care may claim the full amount of the adoption tax credit without incurring or documenting any cost related to that adoption hr 5466 and s 3038 would require states as part of their title ive foster care and adoption assistance plan to inform individuals who are adopting children from foster care or those known by the state to be considering such adoptions of their potential eligibility for the adoption tax credit without the need to document expenses 147 continued conference would provide somewhat greater direction to hhs regarding the contents of required final report on the conference and would not include the freely associated states ie federated

representative lincoln davis and s 561 introduced by senator bunning would ensure that the current provisions do not end but are instead made permanent150 hr 1074 and hr 3192 would also increase the amount of the maximum adoption tax benefits and would make the credit refundable separately hr 4313 introduced by representative bean would expand the tax credit available to individuals who adopt children aged nine years or older original provisions and those subject to sunset the current adoption tax credit was established in 1996 pl 104188 and initially provided reimbursement of up to 5000 in qualified adoption costs for any child or up to 6000 for adoptions of children with special needs which was defined to mean most children adopted from foster care the full credit amount was available for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes up to 75000 after which its value declined the tax credit is not refundable the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act 2001 pl 10716 continued the credit as nonrefundable but expanded it in several ways it increased the maximum credit amount initially to 10000 and provided that it be adjusted annually for inflation the 2007 maximum credit amount is 11390 it increased the income limit for taxpayers initially to 150000 and provided that it be adjusted annually for inflation the 2007 maximum income is 170820 and it provided that the full credit amount is available to any taxpayer who adopts child with special needs without regard to actual costs of adoption many of the tax provisions in pl 10716 including the adoption tax benefits described here were made subject to sunset date of december 31 2010 and this sunset would repeal the changes thus beginning with tax year 2011 the adoption tax credit is set to revert to 5000 or 6000 for special needs adoptions the amount of the allowable credit would begin to decline for taxpayers with adjusted incomes of 75000 or more and taxpayers adopting children with special needs would again need to show qualified costs in order to claim the credit hr 273 hr 471 hr 3192 and s 561 would provide that the sunset does not apply to the adoption tax benefit changes made in pl 10716

for families adoption by emily mickelson and christine scott crs66 increased adoption tax benefits hr 1074 and hr 3192 would increase the maximum adoption tax credit and exclusion amount to 15000 for tax year 2008 and as is true in current law would continue to provide an increased maximum in each following year by applying an inflation adjustment to the amount further the bill would make the adoption tax credit refundable this would allow taxpayers to be reimbursed for all qualified adoption costs without regard to whether they owed taxes in that amount for the given year currently taxpayers are permitted to carry over the part of the tax credit they are unable to use to offset their tax liability in future up to 5 years in tax year 2005 the amount of unused adoption tax credit carried forward to future years 414 million exceeded the amount of adoption tax credit allowed 355 million in that year151 tax benefits for older child adoptions on the last day of fy2006 129000 children were in foster care waiting to be adopted and close to 50000 of those children were age 9 or older152 the advocates dedicated to older child parental tax credit adopt act of 2007 hr 4313 introduced by representative bean would amend the adoption tax credit provisions to provide additional tax benefits for families that adopt children aged 9 and older beginning with tax year 2008 taxpayer adopting child who is 9 years of age or older would be able to claim the adoption tax benefits that currently exist further for each year after the year in which the adoption was finalized until the childs 19th birthday he or she could claim an additional 2000 adjusted annually for inflation and without regard to any income limitation relatively few of the adoptions currently supported by the federal adoption tax credit or exclusion are for older children less than 15 of the adoptions supported by those benefits in tax year 2005 were for adoptions of children aged 10 years or older153 postadoption services for birthparents the birthparents assistance act of 2008 hr 5640 introduced by representative schmidt would require hhs to make grants to or enter into contracts with public or private entities including child welfare or adoption agencies and faithbased organizations to provide post legal adoption services for birthparents or postplacement counseling to birth parents establish and operate national hotline to provide counseling for birthparents who have placed child for adoption or to offer other information about other services available to them and train

encourage and expedite appropriate placement of children from foster care into adoptive families the number of children adopted with public child welfare agency involvement increased significantly from 25700 in fy1995 to 51100 in fy2000 since then the number of such adoptions has stabilized at between 50000 and 53000 annually even as the number of children waiting to be adopted from foster care has declined154 for increases in adoptions finalized between fy1998 first year incentives were awarded through fy2006 most recent awards made states collectively earned 221 million all states have won an award in at least one of these years although more than 44 states including dc did so in any one year the largest bonus amounts however were paid in the programs earliest years when adoptions were rising in the most recent award cycle for adoptions finalized in fy2006 19 states earned total of 74 million as provided in pl 108145 for state to be eligible to earn an incentive it must increase the

of children aged nine or older who were adopted in fy2002 or any later year when that number was higher and the number of title ive eligible special needs children under age nine who were adopted in

baseline and 2000 for each title ive eligible special needs child under the age of nine that exceeds the relevant baseline proposals for reauthorization hr 5466 and s 3038 would reauthorize funding for the adoption incentives program for fy2009 through fy2013 at the current annual authorization level of 43 million both bills would double the incentive award for increases in the adoption of children aged nine and older from 4000 to 8000 hr 5466 would also double the incentive award for increases in the adoption of special needs children under the age of nine from 2000 to 4000 while s 3038 would increase this incentive award amount from 2000 to 3000 for purposes of the adoption incentive program an increase in adoptions is determined on the basis of state finalizing higher number of adoptions in the given category of adoptions than it finalized in the base year both hr 5466 and s 3038 would fix this base year at fy2007 in addition provided additional appropriated funds were available s 3038 would permit states that increase their overall rates of adoptions from foster care to earn adoption incentive awards 1000 multiplied by the calculated increase in adoptions finally both hr 5466 and s 3038 would permit states to earn incentive awards related to placing children from foster care into legal guardianships hr 5466 would award 4000 for each additional such legal guardianship established by state as compared to the number it established in fy2007 alternatively provided additional appropriated incentive funds remained available s 3038 would authorize bonus 1000 for each title ive eligible relative guardianship agreement state entered into in first year and for any increase in the number of those agreements established in subsequent years the presidents budget requests 20 million for adoption incentives in fy2009 the fy2008 appropriation amount was 4 million as included in hr 5466 and s 3038 the bush administration also proposes to set fy2007 as the year in which the adoption incentive baselines are established and also like those bills it would not require that the baseline be adjusted in subsequent years if state achieves higher number of adoptions in justifying this proposed change the administration notes that the changed baselines will set goals for increasing adoptions that better reflect recent changes in the child welfare population and ensure those goals are within states reach so there is true fiscal incentive to increasing adoptions155 also like hr 5466 and s 3038 the administration proposes to double the adoption bonus for children aged nine and older from 4000 to 8000 and like s 3038 it proposes to raise the award for younger special needs children by just 50 from 2000 to 3000 the administration notes that older children make up growing share of the children waiting to be adopted that inflation has eroded the original value of the incentives and that the proposed increase in award amounts is in 155 us

administration which first proposed the presidents child welfare option in february 2003 and the private pew commission on children in foster care which first offered its financing reform recommendations in may 2004 have offered broad proposals to change the way federal dedicated child welfare funds are distributed to states presidents child welfare option the presidents fy2009 budget proposes to offer states an alternative method for financing their foster care programs and other child welfare services this proposal was first included in the presidents fy2003 budget and has been in every successive one as well according to fy2009 budget documents the proposal is intended to be budget neutral and would give states the option to receive their foster care funding as flexible grant over five years to support continuum of services for families in crisis and children at risk 174 specific legislative language to enact this plan has been introduced however the administration has indicated that under this flexible funding plan states could choose to receive their foster care funding as an annual preestablished grant amount rather than as openended reimbursement of eligible expenses for period of five years the amount of states annual grant funding during those years would be based on the funding that the state would be assumed to receive under the title ive foster care program as it exists in current law over those same five years states could use the grant funds for the full range of child welfare services including foster care payments prevention activities permanency efforts case management administrative activities training for child welfare staff and other similar child welfare activities further the funds could be spent on any child without regard to whether this child met the title ive foster care eligibility criteria that are part of the afdcprogram link the administrations proposals would not make any changes to the current title ive adoption assistance program which also includes this eligibility link at the same time the fy2009 budget documents note that states would be required to uphold child safety protections outlined in the adoption and safe families act agree to maintain existing levels of state investment in child welfare programs and continue to participate in the hhsadministered child and family services reviews to ensure compliance with federal child welfare policy states experiencing severe foster care crisis would under certain circumstances be able to tap tanf contingency funds to meet this unanticipated need175 finally the 174 us department of health and human services hhs fy2009 budget in brief p 86 175 the state of florida beginning in october 2006 and the california counties of angeles and alameda beginning in july 2007 have implemented fiveyear demonstration projects under an hhs waiver of title ive rules that permit them to receive pre established grant of funds under title ive and to use those funds on behalf of any child and for generally any purpose now authorized under title ive or title ivb the authority continued crs75 presidents proposal includes 30 million setaside to be available for indian tribes tribes are currently not eligible to directly receive federal foster care funds under title ive of the social security act and onethird of 1 setaside for monitoring and technical assistance of state foster care programs176 recommendations of the pew commission in may 2004 the pew commission on children in foster care cochaired by former representatives gray and frenzel released set of recommendations to restructure the current federal child welfare system177 those recommendations have guided some aspects of introduced bills in this and prior congresses and they remain part of the child welfare financing debate delink payments the commission recommended removing the income eligibility requirements for title ive adoption assistance and foster care maintenance payments now in law as part of the link between the title ive program and the prior law afdc eligibility requirements discussed above and continuing mandatory and openended funding for the program to reduce the federal cost of this expanded eligibility it further recommended that the share of each foster care maintenance or adoption payment reimbursed by the federal government be reduced those reimbursement rates now range from 50 to 83 depending on the states per capita income and the pew commission proposed an even 35 reduction ie new funding matching rates of roughly 325 to 540 to ensure that the lower reimbursement rates would not result in some states receiving less federal support for adoption subsidies and foster care maintenance payments than under current law the commission also recommended threeyear adjustment period during which states would at minimum receive the same level of funding that would have been available to them before the adjustment of the program 175 continued for hhs to waive title ive rules for demonstration projects was provided in section 1130 of the social security act but expired as of march 30 2006 to read more about the demonstration projects in california and florida see profiles of federal child welfare waiver demonstration projects may 2007 available at httpwwwacfdhhsgov programscbprograms_fundcwwaiver2007profiles_demo2007htm 176 separately and with regard to the district of columbia the administrations fy2009 budget again proposes to bring the match rate for title ive of the social security act in line with the medicaid program as it currently is for all states this would set the federal reimbursement rate for foster care maintenance payments and adoption assistance payments at 70 instead of 50 in the district see acf fy2009 budget justifications p g11 177 pew commission on children in foster care fostering the future safety permanence and wellbeing for children in foster care may 2004 the full report is available at httppewfostercareorgresearchdocsfinalreportpdf the commission also proposed set of recommendations intended to improve the interaction of courts with child welfare agencies and to improve the work of courts on behalf of children number of these recommendations were enacted as part of the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 crs76 eligibility criteria and the reimbursement rate thus the commission believes this delink proposal would be cost neutral to both the federal and state governments178 service case management and training funds the commission further recommended single safe children strong families grant program be created to provide capped mandatory funding that states would not be able to use for foster care maintenance payments but that they could spend on virtually any other child welfare purpose including providing services to children and their families casework support for children and training of child welfare court and other relevant personnel the commission recommended that this grant be created by combining the capped funding now available to states under title ivb of the social security act child welfare services and promoting safe and stable families with some of the openended funding now available under title ive for states to conduct specified administrative and child placement activities the initial grant funding level would be based on the total amount of current funding for each of these funding streams estimated at about 37 billion at the time of the proposal enhanced by 200 million in the first year for total of about 39 billion the commission proposed that states would receive share of this money based on the share of the total pot of money they receive under current law further the commission proposed that this grant should be indexed so that each states funding would annually grow by 2 plus the inflation rate consumer price index under current law the federal government provides between 50 and 75 of the total eligible program costs for the programs that would be rolled into the safe children and strong families grant the commission recommended adjusting this rate to create single federal matching rate that would ensure state had to provide more of its own funding to receive the same level of federal support it estimated that this federal share matching rate would be about 68 finally with regard to other funding currently provided under title ive the commission recommended that states continue to be able to claim openended reimbursement for the development 178 the commission proposed that states receiving more funding under the proposals expanded eligibility and despite the decreased reimbursement rates would have some of the funding diverted to ensure that state received less federal support alternatively the commission made two other proposals that would have accomplished delink and maintained openended funding but that they expected would cost the federal government some additional dollars the first alternative would have permitted all states to keep any additional funding they received under the proposal and would also have permitted states who lost money under the proposal to file supplemental claims during threeyear adjustment period to be paid by the federal government the second alternative would link the program over roughly 17year time frame in the first year the title ive income eligibility limit would be set at 50 of the federal poverty level and would rise 10 percentage points each year by year 16 of the proposals implementation the income eligibility limit would be 200 of poverty and in year 17 all income eligibility criteria would be eliminated further some of the federal cost of this delink would be recouped by phasedin reduction of the reimbursement rates totaling 14 percentage points ie reimbursement range of 3569 by year 17 crs77 maintenance and operation of state automated child welfare information system sacwis at the current federal reimbursement rate of 50 other pew financing recommendations among other recommendations some of which had previously been proposed in congress the commission recommended that assistance payments for children who exit foster care to legal guardianship be reimbursed by the federal government on an openended basis under title ive proposed that indian tribes be granted the ability to make direct claims for federal reimbursement under the title ive programs and sought to remove current limits set on the amount of title ive funding that may be accessed by the territories it further proposed that current law adoption incentive payments be revamped to permit states that successfully found permanent homes for children whether via family reunification adoption or guardianship to receive these bonus funds sought provisions that would permit states to transfer reinvest certain unspent title ive foster care dollars in the safe children strong families grant recommended payment of an enhanced federal matching rate for the safe children strong families grant if state showed increased competence and reduced caseloads among its child welfare workforce proposed investment of at least some of states assessed penalties for noncompliance with federal child welfare policy in that states program improvement plan with this spending directed by hhs and finally recommended continued reservation of funds for research evaluation and sharing of best practices179 the partnership recommendations in may 2007 eight organizations representing public human services administrators and employees as well as private child welfare service providers researchers and advocates formed partnership to propose child welfare reform stating that the federalstate partnership to help children and families must be renewed and strengthened this partnership produced list of reform proposals many of which are related to federal financing the eight organizations included in the partnership are the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme american public human services association aphsa catholic charities usa center for law and social policy clasp child welfare league of america cwla childrens defense fund national child abuse coalition and voices for americas children the partnership proposals are not provided in legislative form however some of the proposals have been addressed in legislation introduced in this congress and described in the body of the report brief review of the proposals is given below180 179 the commission also supported continued authority for hhs to waive certain requirements under title ive and title ivb for the purpose of demonstrating improved ways of operating child welfare programs this authority was in place at the time the proposals were made but subsequently expired on march 31 2006 180 to read the partnerships proposals see changes needed in federal child welfare law to better protect children and ensure them nurturing families may 2007 available at continued crs78 the partnership seeks to guarantee services supports and safe homes for every child who is atrisk of being or has been abused or neglected it proposes to do this by amending title ive of the social security act to permit states to use those funds on broader range of purposes and without converting any of the title ive to block grant the partnership calls for expanded federal eligibility for title ive foster care through elimination of the income eligibility criteria delink from afdc it does not propose reduction in reimbursement rates or another mechanism that would limit increased cost from this change to the federal government and it further proposes that any state that safely reduces its foster care caseload should be able to reinvest the federal title ive funds which would otherwise be lost to the state in services and supports that prevent abuse or neglect the partnership would further stipulate that any savings in state spending that might accrue because of these changes must be similarly reinvested the partnership further proposes that states should be able to use title ive funds to 1 provide postpermanency services to children reunited with their parents placed permanently with relative or adopted and to help older youth who age out of foster care successfully transition to adulthood and 2 provide subsidized guardianship for children placed with legal guardians when neither reuniting with parents nor adoption is appropriate the proposal also calls for direct tribal access to title ive funding and suggests that states be permitted to establish relative specific licensing standards provided those standards contain safety protections and criminal background checks for most states the partnership would increase the federal matching rate available to states under the title ive program for casework activities including assessment of child and family needs development and refinement of permanency plans recruitment licensing and supervision of foster and preadoptive parents under current law states may seek federal reimbursement of 50 of the cost of such caseworker activities provided they are incurred on behalf of title ive eligible children which is the general reimbursement rate for title ive program administrative costs the partnership proposes to change this matching rate for caseworker activities under the title ive program to the states federal medical assistance percentage fmap which may range from 50 to 83 with states that have higher per capita income receiving lower rates and vice versa181 further the partnership proposes to permit states to use child welfare funds withdrawn penalties or disallowed by the federal government to conduct evaluations of promising approaches to achieve safety permanency and wellbeing for children and implement approaches that have been demonstrated to improve these outcomes for children 180 continued httpwwwcwlaorgadvocacynurturingfamiliespdf 181 states fmap may vary each year based on economic conditions for fy2008 19 states including dc had title ive fmap reimbursement rate of 50 the remaining states had reimbursement rates ranging from just under 52 to just over 76 see federal register november 30 2006 pp 69209 69211 crs79 the partnership further proposes to expand both the range of topics and the kind of workers for whom states may seek federal title ive training support at the 75 reimbursement rate under current law states may receive reimbursement of training costs at the 75 rate if the topic is related to administering the title ive foster care or adoption assistance program and only on behalf of public employees training topics that are specifically not eligible for title ive reimbursement include those related to providing services including training on how to conduct child abuse and neglect investigation or how to provide treatment or other services related to domestic violence mental health issues or substance abuse among children and families coming into contact with the child welfare agency182 the partnership proposes to permit federal title ive reimbursement at the 75 matching rate for any training topic related to ensuring safety permanency and wellbeing for children and further it would permit states to make these claims on behalf of private child welfare agency workers court personnel and other social service agency workers including those with expertise in health mental health substance abuse and domestic violence related services finally the partnership proposes to enhance accountability by requiring states to report annually on funds spent on particular services and categories of services the number of children and families served the duration of the services and the number of children and families who are unable to access service for which they are referred five years after the enactment of these reforms the partnership would call on the us government accountability office gao to evaluate the effectiveness of the reforms as they relate to 1 enhancing preventive permanence and post permanency services 2 changes in foster care placements 3 recruitment retention and workloads of child welfare workers and 4 improved outcomes for children atrisk of entering or who have entered the child welfare system finally to increase the knowledge about outcomes for children the partnership would permit states to submit additional statelevel data during the child and family services review cfsr process 182 states that provide training on these topics may not claim reimbursement for that training under the title ive program at either the 75 training rate or the 50 general administration rate see child welfare policy manual section 81h question 11 and question 8 crs80 appendix b title ive foster care eligibility criteria table b1 eligibility criteria
