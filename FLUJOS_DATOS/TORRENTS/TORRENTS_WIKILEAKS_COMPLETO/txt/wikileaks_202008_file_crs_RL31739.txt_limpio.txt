preparedness and dismissal of employees summary the september 11 2001 attacks on the pentagon and the world trade center provided compelling reminder of the importance of emergency and disaster preparedness for federal agencies in the united states natural disasters infrastructure breakdowns and emergencies also can disrupt agency operations place employees at risk and damage or destroy federal buildings responsibility for federal agency emergency preparedness is highly decentralized generally agencies that occupy buildings under the control of the general services administration gsa share responsibility for emergency preparedness with the office of federal protective service fps currently part of gsa agencies that have received delegations of authority for security functions from gsa agencies that have independent real property authority or agencies whose buildings are statutorily exempted from gsa control are responsible for protecting their employees and buildings effective march 1 2003 fps moved to the department of homeland security dhs to date dhs has not promulgated information relating to its role in agency emergency preparedness including fps therefore this report is written from the perspective of fps being part of gsa and will be revised as further information becomes available with the passage of the homeland security act pl 107296 responsibility for building security will expand and shift to the department of homeland security pl 107296 transfers fps to dhs and gives the secretary responsibility for safeguarding federal buildings and buildings occupied by federal agencies which may lead to changes in how the federal government approaches agency preparedness generally the authority to dismiss employees who work in executive branch agencies located in washington dc is held by the director of the us office of personnel management opm however agency heads may act independently if the need arises although coordinated action is preferred dismissal authority among federal courts and legislative branch agencies generally is decentralized this report discusses several issues relevant to federal agency emergency preparedness including funding the development of federal emergency decision and notification protocol for the washington dc area the status of agency preparedness activities and implications of homeland security

introduction the september 11 2001 attacks on the pentagon and the world trade center provided compelling reminder of the importance of emergency and disaster preparedness for federal agencies located in the united states other recent terrorist incidents on us soil include the bombing of the alfred p murrah federal building in oklahoma city on april 19 1995 and the bombing of the world trade center on february 26 1993 terrorist acts though are only one type of incident or emergency for which government facilities and employees must prepare natural disasters such as earthquakes floods tornadoes and even heavy snowstorms and infrastructure breakdowns and emergencies including power outages fires broken water mains and inoperable elevators also can disrupt agency operations place employees at risk or damage or destroy federal buildings on september 5 2000 the earle cabbell federal building in dallas lost electrical power and was partially flooded following an accidental break in water main and minor fire prompted the evacuation of the federal building in council bluffs iowa in december 1999 agencies are wellserved by providing for the protection of their personnel employees expect to be safe from undue harm in their workplaces feeling and believing they are safe frees them from being distracted by concerns about personal safety safeguarding agency personnel also may be considered precondition to continuity of operations following an emergency or disaster federal employees are needed to continue agency operations host of agency activities from performing security checks at building entrances to developing and practicing an emergency response plan can help protect employees in event of an emergency and also demonstrates an agencys commitment to employee safety the first section of this report discusses who is responsible for agency emergency preparedness describes emergency preparedness functions and reviews the work of the interagency security committee next the report reviews dismissal and closure authority for government agencies located in washington dc and outside washington dc the final two sections cover issues and policy questions including funding for building security the status of agency preparedness the implications of homeland security legislation for agency preparedness and the ramifications of the federal emergency decision and notification protocol effective march 1 2003 the office of federal protective service moved from the general services administration gsa to the department of homeland security dhs to date dhs has not promulgated information relating to its role in agency emergency preparedness including fps therefore this report is written from the crs2 perspective of fps being part of gsa and will be revised as further information becomes available emergency preparedness federal agency emergency preparedness is highly decentralized the size and geographic dispersal of the federal workforce dictate that emergency planning and preparedness be managed and carried out locally within the united states there are 26 million federal government civilian employees working in all 50 states and in thousands of facilities most employees nearly 23 million 88 work outside the washington dc metropolitan statistical area1 who is responsible for emergency preparedness responsibility for federal agency emergency preparedness varies and accordingly guidance may vary from agency to agency and building to building as explained in greater detail below agencies occupying facilities owned or leased by the general services administration are subject to the provisions of title 41 of the code of federal regulations that direct occupant agencies to establish an emergency response team and to develop an emergency plan occupant agencies are aided by gsas office of federal protective service fps in establishing and maintaining an emergency program federal agencies that occupy buildings not subject to gsa control or not covered by fps are responsible for devising their own emergency preparedness programs generally agencies that occupy facilities owned or leased by gsa share responsibility for disaster preparedness with fps as the governments landlord gsa has control over public buildings outside of washington dc purchased or constructed from appropriations under its control2 and has charge of public buildings and grounds in washington dc3 however exceptions exist and these are discussed below facilities that fall under the definition of public building include federal office buildings post offices customhouses courthouses appraisers stores border inspection facilities warehouses record centers relocation facilities telecommuting centers and any other buildings or construction projects

security arrangements for post offices and courthouses are not the responsibility of fps alone typically the us postal service usps is responsible for security at standalone post offices ie buildings occupied only by usps in locations where post office shares facility with another occupant generally gsa has primary responsibility for security in federal courthouses responsibility for security is divided between fps and the us marshals service fps handles perimeter security while federal marshals are responsible for internal security however for the purpose of emergency preparedness courthouses are subject to the same provisions in the code of federal regulations as agencies which occupy buildings served by fps in some cases gsa has delegated one or more of its functions to an occupant agency or organization5 gsa may delegate security authority when there is clear and unique security requirement critical national security issue or an intelligence or law enforcement mission or the current security contractor is ineffective6 for example gsa has delegated security authority to the secret service for the white house and to the defense logistics agency dla internal revenue service irs immigration and naturalization service ins office of personnel management opm federal bureau of investigation fbi and department of justice for some or all of the buildings these agencies occupy7 gsa has approved total of 278 delegations of authority for security purposes each delegation is for specific building or complex consisting of several buildings in close proximity to each other8 some organizations or institutions and their facilities are statutorily exempted from gsas authority and hence are responsible for securing their buildings and protecting their personnel these

total square feet and more than 450 employees55 as for the basic security charge levied by gsa there appears to be discrepancy between actual costs and what gsa is allowed to charge prior to september

writing all funding is frozen at fy 2002 levels and funding for fy2003 is uncertain for agencies that own their own buildings or have obtained security waivers from gsa or whose buildings are exempted by statute from gsa control funding for security and emergency preparedness is their responsibility it is not known whether these agencies receive or allocate funds sufficient to meet their security

of scott hatch director office of communication office of personnel management58 opm has not yet provided any other information about the protocol in the absence of additional information or

protocol what are the extent and progress of federal executive boards efforts to develop similar protocols does the protocol cover variety of leave options for federal employees akin to the content of the november 12 2002 opm memorandum does the protocol apply only to impending or actual attacks or would it also apply in the event of citywide emergency caused by for example inclement weather eg snowstorm how will the protocol change as result of the realignment of fps and fema under the department of homeland security status of agency preparedness agency autonomy and the decentralization of emergency preparedness functions combine to make it difficult to gauge the extent of preparedness among federal agencies establishment of the interagency security committee was an effort to address this challenge and other related issues but so far the isc has compiled mixed record the vulnerability assessment of federal facilities was another initiative aimed at among other things evaluating how well agencies are prepared for disasters however this report was snapshot of agency preparedness apparently there is ongoing governmentwide effort to assess agency preparedness ideally information on the status of agency preparedness would be compiled on an ongoing basis and would be available before an emergency occurs this sequence would allow an agency head and emergency team personnel to address areas that need improvement information gathered after an incident occurs also may be useful information and data sometimes referred to as lessons learned can be used to improve program including an emergency preparedness program where an incident has occurred potentially useful tool is the afteraction report which would document how an agency responded what worked well and what needs to be improved the applicable portion of the code of federal regulations does not require agencies to produce an afteraction report although an agency may decide on its own to review and examine its performance during an incident or emergency for example the environmental protection agency epa crs16 issued lessons learned in the aftermath of september 11 2001 dated february 1 2002 more formal investigation is required by the national construction safety team act pl 107231 hr 4687 signed by president george w bush on october 1 2002 pl 107231 requires the national institute of standards and technology nist to establish national construction safety teams for deployment after an event which causes building failure that resulted in substantial loss of life although the thrust of this law is studying building failures that resulted in substantial loss of life or had the potential to and recommending improvements to building standards codes and practices it also calls for the evaluation of the technical aspects of evacuation and emergency response procedures hrept 107 530 elaborates on the function of teams the ultimate goal of investigations conducted under this act should be to develop detailed set of recommendations for any necessary improvements to building codes standards and practices as well as emergency response and evacuation procedures based on the findings of the investigation many of these procedures are based on an understanding of how people respond to disaster it is the committees view that when examining emergency response and evacuation procedures teams should evaluate not only the effect that buildings design has on emergency response and evacuation procedures but also on human behavior59 information gleaned from construction team reports could prompt agencies to revise their emergency procedures or implement new safety features construction team reports also would provide insight into the technical aspects of an agencys preparation for emergencies homeland security legislation under the homeland security act responsibility for safeguarding buildings currently protected by gsa shifts to the homeland security department with the transfer of the federal protective service to dhs furthermore the language of pl 107296 section 1706a see who is responsible for emergency preparedness suggests that the secretary of homeland security also acquires responsibility for federal buildings that currently are protected by agencies other than gsa this action would constitute significant expansion of the responsibility that had been vested in gsa centralization of responsibility for safeguarding buildings owned or occupied by the federal government does not necessarily mean that the protection function also will be centralized the secretary of homeland security could delegate to federal agencies the authority to provide security for their buildings facilities and installations 59 us congress house of representatives national construction safety team act 107th cong 2nd sess h rept 107530 washington gpo 2002 p 20 crs17 policy questions policy questions and issues will likely arise as congress examines the status of emergency preparedness within the federal government and the implications of the homeland security act for agency emergency preparedness the homeland security act places the federal protective service within the directorate of border and transportation security bts the responsibilities of the under secretary for bts include preventing terrorists and instruments of terrorism from entering the united states securing borders territorial waters ports terminals waterways and air land and sea and transportation systems conducting immigrant enforcement functions establishing and administering rules for granting visas establishing immigration enforcement policies administering certain customs laws and conducting certain agricultural inspection functions60 how will the mission of fps mesh with the responsibilities of this directorate section 1706a of the homeland security act amends 40 usc 1315 and states the secretary of homeland security shall protect the buildings grounds and property that are owned occupied or secured by the federal government including any agency instrumentality or wholly owned or mixedownership corporation thereof and the persons on the property does the secretarys responsibility include for example the legislative branch the supreme court buildings occupied by agencies that have received delegations of authority for security functions such as the white house and military installations will dhs need additional personnel and other resources to fulfill its responsibility under what conditions or circumstances might the dhs secretary allow an agency to provide its own security what model should be used to provide suitable combination of centralization of responsibility dhs and decentralization of execution agencies and buildings per pl 107296 section 422b1a the administrator of gsa retains the authority to collect rents and fees including fees collected for protective services the secretary of homeland security is not authorized to obligate amounts in the federal buildings fund and if any amounts are transferred by the administrator to the secretary out of rents and fees collected by the administrator they shall be used by the secretary solely for the protection of buildings or grounds owned or occupied by the federal government is this workable arrangement how should the fees collected for protective services be handled the transfer of fps and the responsibility for building security to dhs might provide an 60 pl 107296 section 402 crs18 opportunity for examining security fees charged actual costs of security the alleged discrepancy between the two and whether and how to reconcile the differences the vulnerability assessment of federal facilities was issued in 1995 should another assessment be conducted with focus on terrorist threats and antiterrorism measures if so who should conduct second vulnerability assessment questions posed about the federal emergency decision and notification protocol may include is opm going to inform federal employees about the protocol how might fednp procedures change in light of the creation of department of homeland security that includes fema and fps what should be the relationship between the interagency security committee and dhs gsa retains responsibility for the operation and maintenance of buildings and grounds owned or occupied by the federal government and under the jurisdiction custody or control of the administrator61 how should gsa and dhs work out issues that involve both organizations for example the homeland security department may determine that to meet security requirements entrances to building must be modified in specific way but gsa may believe there are other options available for improving building entrances more than year has passed since the attacks of september 11 2001 is emergency preparedness still top priority among agencies are agencies reviewing and if necessary revising their emergency preparedness plans are training programs provided for employees are emergency teams fully staffed do agencies have the necessary equipment and supplies needed to help protect their employees do agencies have sufficient funds to establish and maintain comprehensive effective emergency preparedness programs 61 pl 107296 sec 422a for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31739
