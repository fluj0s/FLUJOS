mark manyin specialist in asian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress foreign assistance to north korea summary since 1995 the united states has provided over 1 billion in foreign assistance to the democratic peoples republic of north korea dprk also known as north korea about 60 of which has taken the form of food aid and about 40 in the form of energy assistance channeled through the korean peninsula energy development organization kedo additionally the bush administration has proposed offering north korea broad economic development assistance in exchange for pyongyang verifiably dismantling its nuclear program although the president has considerable flexibility to offer some forms of short term development assistance longer term aid would likely require congressional action since the current north korean nuclear crisis erupted in october 2002 when north korea reportedly admitted that it has secret uranium enrichment nuclear program the dollar amount of us aid has fallen by an order of magnitude us funds have been provided to kedo since fy2003 and the bush administrations position is that it would like to permanently halt kedos currently suspended construction of two nuclear reactors in north korea us food aid also has fallen considerably in recent years food has been provided to help north korea alleviate chronic massive food shortages that began in the early 1990s and that led to severe famine in the mid1990s that killed an estimated 12 million north koreans food aid to north korea has come under criticism because the dprk government restricts the ability of donor agencies to operate in the country making it difficult to assess how much of each donation actually reaches its intended recipients and how much is diverted for resale in private markets or to the military compounding the problem is that south korea and china by far north koreas two most important providers of food send almost all of their aid directly to north korea with virtually monitoring the wfp says that food conditions have worsened since north korea introduced economic reforms in 2002 the administration appears to be loosely adhering to its dprk food aid policy ie it will provide base levels of food assistance to north korea with more to come only if the dprk allows greater access and monitoring after announcing the policy in february 2003 the administration announced new tranche of food aid despite only marginal improvements on the ground new north korean restrictions in 2004 are likely to complicate us policy decision on food aid for 2005 has yet to be reached the north korean human rights act pl 108333 includes hortatory language calling for significant increases above current levels of us support for humanitarian assistance to be conditioned upon substantial improvements in transparency monitoring and access this report describes and assesses us aid programs to north korea including the controversies surrounding the programs their relationship to the larger debate over strategy and objectives toward the dprk and policy options the roles of china south korea and japan in providing assistance to north korea are discussed highlighting the likelihood that any dramatic decrease in us aid to north korea may have only marginal effects without the cooperation of

the end of the korean war in 1953 us strategy toward the democratic peoples republic of korea dprk commonly referred to as north korea was relatively simple deter an attack on south korea an approach that included freeze on virtually all forms of economic contact between the united states and north korea in the 1990s two developments led the united states to rethink its relationship with the dprk north koreas progress in its nuclear weapons program and massive chronic food shortages there in response the united states in 1995 began providing the dprk with foreign assistance which has totaled over 11 billion this aid has consisted of energy assistance through the korean peninsula energy development organization kedo food aid and small amount of medical supplies including three medical kits that were sent to the world health organization in april 2005 to help in dealing with the reported outbreak of avian influenza in north korea see table 1 since the current north korean nuclear crisis erupted in late 2002 the level of us aid has fallen by an order of magnitude in large measure because us has sent almost funds to kedo since the organizations executive board voted to halt oil shipments to north korea in november 2002 in all likelihood the dropoff in aid levels has reduced the already little leverage us aid had exerted on north korean behavior particularly relative to chinas and south koreas continued assistance to and increased trade with the dprk aid and the debate over north korea policy aid to north korea has been controversial since its inception and the controversy is intricately linked to the overall debate in the united states south korea and other countries over the best strategy for dealing with the dprk north korea is deemed threat to us interests because it possesses advanced nuclear and missile programs has history of proliferating missiles reportedly has threatened to export parts of its selfdeclared nuclear arsenal is suspected of possessing chemical and biological weapons programs and since the late 1980s has been included on the us list of states that sponsor terrorism pyongyang also is characterized as one of the worlds worst violators of human rights and religious freedom record that some members of congress and interest groups say should assume greater importance in the formation of us priorities toward north korea

agriculture kedo korean peninsula energy development organization figures from kedo humanitarian aid supporters of aid contend that humanitarian assistance has saved and improved the lives of millions of north koreans many also say humanitarian and development assistance is one way to induce north korea to cooperate with the international community proponents of engagement argue that in the long run aid could fundamentally change the character of the north korean regime by increasing the dprks exposure to and dependence on the outside world the agreed framework which froze the dprks plutonium nuclear facilities for eight years north koreas establishment of relations with number of european countries pyongyangs unveiling of significant economic reforms since july 2002 and spate of economic and humanitarian agreements with south korea are often cited as examples of this cooperation in contrast many critics argue that aiding north korea has led to marginal changes in the dprks behavior at best at worst aid arguably has helped keep the current north korean regime in power has allowed the regime to avoid making fundamental economic and political reforms that could improve humanitarian conditions and possibly allowed additional funds to be channeled into the dprk military establishment moreover critics suggest aid has encouraged pyongyang to engage in further acts of military blackmail to extract more assistance from the international community in this view the aid under the agreed framework halted north koreas plutonium program but it did not keep the country from pursuing secret uranium enrichment program disclosed in october 2002 some argue that the best response to the north korean threat is to try to trigger the current regimes collapse by suspending nonhumanitarian assistance crs3 food aid to north korea has generated its own particular debate some policymakers and commentators have called for it to be linked to broader foreign policy concerns either by using the promise of food to encourage cooperation in security matters or by suspending food aid to trigger collapse others arguing that food should not be used as weapon and have called for delinking humanitarian assistance from overall policy toward the dprk either by providing food unconditionally or by conditioning it upon north korea allowing international relief groups greater freedom to distribute and monitor their aid us policy in recent times has delinked food and humanitarian aid from strategic interests coercive measures some critics of the current aid effort argue for more tailored form of containment that would include diplomatically and economically isolating north korea and calibrating economic sanctions and development aid to reward or punish the dprks actions major difficulty with this approach is that us options are limited in the current diplomatic and political climate offering carrots such as allowing north korea to join international financial institutions would likely require reciprocal actions that pyongyang to date has resisted punitive sanctions however would likely be only marginally effective without at least the tacit cooperation of beijing and seoul china and south korea are by far north koreas two largest economic partners and aid providers and both countries place greater priority on preserving north koreas stability than on resolving the nuclear issue chinese support would be particularly important as china is widely believed to be north koreas singlelargest provider of food and energy to this end china and south korea have been reluctant to use pressure tactics to induce changes in the kim jongil regimes behavior japan the country closest to the united states in the sixparty talks to discuss north koreas nuclear weapons program has seen its economic importance to north korea diminish markedly over the past four years1 meanwhile military options generally are considered to be poor given the uncertainties surrounding north koreas nuclear program and the risk of unleashing retaliatory north korean missile strikes on south korea andor japan therefore absent support from china andor south korea some say the actions most likely to hurt kim jongils regime are those that would cut off its supply of hard currency by curtailing sales of illicit materials particularly narcotics and counterfeit currency cigarettes and pharmaceuticals and weapons through such devices as the proliferation security initiative psi and the illicit activities initiative the scale and scope of north korean criminal activity is believed to have risen in recent years and is thought to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in hard currency2 1 the sixparty talks consist of the united states north korea china south korea japan and russia since the sixparty process was initiated in august 2003 three rounds of plenary negotiations have been held the last occurred in june 2004 as of early june 2005 north korea has refused to return to the talks 2 david sanger us is shaping plan to pressure north korea new york times february 14 2005 for more on psi see crs report rs21881 proliferation security initiative psi by

officials including president bush have issued vague pledges of us assistance that might be forthcoming if north korea began dismantling its nuclear programs in january 2003 president bush said that he would consider offering the dprk bold initiative including energy and agricultural development aid if the country first verifiably dismantles its nuclear program and satisfies other us security concerns dealing with missiles and the deployment of conventional forces3 the administration reportedly was preparing to offer version of this plan to north korea in the summer of 2002 but pulled it back after acquiring more details of pyongyangs clandestine uranium nuclear weapons program4 in june 2004 during the third round of sixparty talks to resolve the north korean nuclear crisis the united states offered proposal that envisioned freeze of north koreas weapons program followed by series of measures to ensure complete dismantlement and eventually permanent security guarantee negotiations to resolve north koreas energy problems and discussions on normalizing usnorth korean relations that would include lifting the remaining us sanctions and removing north korea from the list of terroristsupporting countries in the interim japan and south korea would provide the north with heavy oil north korea rejected the proposal as sham and it was not supported in public by any of the other participants in the talks with regard to development assistance programs in the near term the president has considerable flexibility to offer some forms of development assistance the foreign assistance act of 1961 for instance allows the president annually to provide up to 50 million per country for any purpose5 longerterm initiatives however would likely require changes in us law and thereby require congressional action for instance the fy 2005 consolidated appropriations act specifically bans many forms of direct aid to north korea along with several other countries6 many health and emergency disaster relief aid programs are exempt from such legislative restrictions because they have notwithstanding clauses in their enacting legislation additionally if the administration were to designate north korea as country involved in drug production and trafficking as some have advocated then by law north korea would be ineligible for receiving most forms of us development assistance7 congresss role the provision of aid to north korea has given congress vehicle to influence us policy toward north korea from 1998 until the united states halted funding 3 testimony of

operations appropriations requirement that the president certify progress in nuclear and missile negotiations with north korea before allocating money to kedo operations in 1998 under congressional pressure president clinton appointed north korea policy coordinator position that the bush administration terminated in 2001 with regard to food aid some members have supported continued donations on humanitarian grounds of helping the north korean people regardless of the actions of the north korean regime other members have voiced their outright opposition to food aid to the dprk or have called for food assistance to be conditioned upon north korean cooperation on monitoring and access the congressional debate over food assistance to north korea also is likely to be colored by the competing demands for other emergency situations particularly in sudan ethiopia and the countries hit by the indian ocean tsunami that have stretched fy2005 us food aid funds and commodities see the competition for food aid resources section below the north korea human rights act in 2004 the 108th congress passed and president bush signed the north korea human rights act hr 4011 pl 108 333 with regard to us assistance the act requires that us nonhumanitarian assistance to north korea be contingent upon north korea making substantial progress on number of specific human rights issues includes hortatory language calling for significant increases above current levels of us support for humanitarian assistance to be conditioned upon substantial improvements in transparency monitoring and access requires the united states agency for international development usaid to issue report to congress on humanitarian assistance activities to north korea and north koreans in china that receive us funding and any changes in the transparency monitoring and access of food aid and other humanitarian activities and authorizes but does not appropriate total of 24 million annually for the next four years for programs that promote human rights and democracy freedom of information and assistance to north koreans in china including the dissemination of transistor radios inside north korea pyongyang has cited the act as evidence of the hostile policy of the united states toward north korea and has used it as one justification for suspending its participation in the sixparty talks8 8 korean central news agency us north korean human rights act flailed october 4 2004 crs6 food assistance to north korea mountainous country with relatively little arable land north korea long has relied upon imports of food beginning in the early 1990s after the collapse of the soviet union and the system of economic benefits north korea had received from the communist bloc the dprk began experiencing food shortage of increasing severity disastrous floods in the summer of 1995 plunged the country into severe famine that by some estimates was responsible for one to two million deaths approximately 5 10 of north koreas population although natural disasters were the immediate causes of the food crisis several experts have found the root causes of the famine in decades of economic and agricultural mismanagement9 in september 1995 north korea appealed for international food assistance contradicting its national ideology of juche or selfreliance shortly thereafter the world food program wfp moved into north korea and its activities there gradually have expanded to become the wfps largest singlecountry operation the united states has been by far the largest contributor to the wfps north korea appeals contributing over half of the 37 million metric tons mt of food the wfp has delivered to north korea according to wfp statistics north korea received an additional 46 million mt from bilateral donations that are not channeled through the wfp china which is widely believed to have provided even more food than the united states sends all its food aid directly to north korea additionally since 2000 south korea has been major provider of food assistance perhaps surpassing china and the united states in importance in some years most of seouls food shipments are provided bilaterally to pyongyang current food situation though the famine apparently abated by 1997 and the dprk has made incremental progress in agricultural production the wfp estimates that nearly half of north koreas 237 million people do not have enough to eat and that more than third of the population is chronically malnourished10 2004 nutritional survey conducted by the north korean government and sponsored by the united nations also indicated that although malnutrition rates have fallen significantly since the late 1990s more than onethird of the population is chronically malnourished and approximately onethird of north korean mothers are malnourished and anemic11 the northern and northeastern provinces have been particularly hard hit by the famine for reasons examined below 9 for instance see andrew natsios the great north korean famine us institute of peace washington dc 2001 especially chapters 1 and 2 among the cited policies that over time led to the famine were excessive use of chemical fertilizers and the excessive conversion of land into agricultural uses the latter practice contributed to the massive deforestation and soil erosion that led to increasingly severe annual floods 10 wfp news release 65 million vulnerable north koreans still in desperate need of food aid january 27 2005 11 napsnet special report world food programme press conference on the dprk by tony banbury wfp regional director for asia march 31 2005 crs7 the impact of the 2002 economic reforms the economic reforms the north korean government initiated in july 2002 were perhaps the most sweeping in the countrys history and have had major impact on the lives of north koreans12 the most important of the reforms were raising official prices to bring them closer to black market levels raising wage levels to meet the rise in prices granting farmers and cooperatives greater lattitude to sell produce officially recognizing the informal markets that had sprouted in the 1990s and cutting government subsidies to most industries13 in general those with access to hard currency such as the political elite appear to be doing much better as evidenced by the appearance of more cars and restaurants in pyongyang aid workers and defector reports indicate striking upsurge in entrepreneurial activity including activity outside the state sector new restaurants and other leisure establishments have opened in pyongyang and wide range of products now appear in the official markets more bicycles are on the streets throughout the country and smallscale service activities such as bike repair shops and shoe shine stands have appeared in the countryside farmers incomes appear to have increased now that they are permitted to maintain private plots andor sell abovequota produce on the open market indeed there are reports that cash crops have appeared as farmers can raise more money producing vegetables fruits and selling those in the market than in producing staple grains such as maize or rice or potatoes14 however the reforms appear to have worsened general conditions for all except the top strata of society north korea is experiencing high or hyperinflation in many items particularly in important foodstuffs such as rice the price of which the wfp estimates tripled in parts of the country in 2003 and 200415 urban residents are particularly vulnerable as they rely heavily on inflationprone private markets in late 2002 the wfp estimated these individuals spent up to 80 of their income on food compared to more than 35 for state farmers and much less for collective farmers16 the reforms also have led to unemployment and underemployment further reducing workers ability to survive outside the governments public distribution system pds which is used by nearly 70 of the population but is subject to chronic shortages and occasional and selective shutdowns increasingly the wfp has channeled its food supplies to these newly vulnerable groups and their plight was leading some within the wfp to consider increasing the size of its 12 see for instance international crisis group north korea can the iron fist accept the invisible hand washington dc april

to north korea and 100000 through the wfp these are expected to be delivered in 2005 despite the continued and perhaps growing need the world food program has had difficulty filling its appeals for donations to north korea since 2002 due largely to donor fatigue and from competing demands for food assistance elsewhere particularly east africa figure 1 shows the decline in recorded food aid shipments overall since 2002 as well as the jump in the relative importance of food donated directly to north korea virtually all of which is from china and south korea since 2000 bilateral shipments have exceeded those channeled through the wfp the one exception 2001 occurred because of japans 500000 mt donation that year the wfp says the amount of food in the wfp pipeline has been erratic in recent years sometimes sufficient to meet only 20 of its targeted population in september 2004 the wfp for the first time in two years had enough food to feed all of its 65 million targeted recipients primarily due to large contribution from 17 banbury press conference march 31 2005 18 jay solomon us has put food aid for north korea on hold wall street journal may 20 2005 crs9 japan19 however as of

its target of 611000 mt diversion monitoring and triaging by north korea various sources assert that not all the food assistance going to north korea is reaching its intended recipients and that north koreas restrictions have made it impossible for the wfp to fully track food shipments to the over 40000 institutional recipients sources include interviews with north korean refugees in china who say they have never received international food aid20 the numerous reports of donated food being sold at price levels far higher than the official governmentcontrolled prices in markets are widely assumed to be signs that officials are stealing and selling some of the aid for their own profit additionally number of refugees including former soldiers has stated that food aid has been distributed regularly to the north korean peoples army kpa21 in february 2003 us ambassador to the food agencies tony hall cited credible reports of diversion in making the case for possibly reducing and conditioning future us food aid testifying in april 2005 at joint hearing of the house international relations subcommittees on asia and the pacific and africa global human rights and international operations economist marcus noland cited estimates of diversion that range from 10 30 presumably most to private markets noland also noted that diversion to markets can have the unintended effect of lowering food prices hurting farmers but benefiting foodconsumers22 wfp officials and number of analysts have pointed out that because the kpa receives the first cut at the domestic harvest and chinese food aid it has need for wfp food23 even if the military is not directly siphoning off food aid however such assistance is fungible funds that otherwise would have been spent on food can 19

north koreas commercial imports of food fell dramatically once fullfledged international assistance began since 1999 around 90 of north koreas inflows of food has come from aid rather than commercial imports25 since it first appealed for outside assistance the north korean government has restricted relief groups activities hindering their ability to ensure that their assistance reaches the neediest though many ngos have operated for years in the dprk several prominent groups including medicins sans fontieres msf doctors without borders action against hunger and care have halted their north korean operations because they cannot adequately monitor the assistance they provide26 msf has been particularly vocal in its criticism of the food aid program27 1999 general accounting office inquiry into us food assistance to the dprk found that the north korean government has not allowed the wfp to fully implement its procedures and as result it cannot be sure that the food aid is being shipped stored or used as planned28 as mentioned earlier bilateral food donations from china and south korea have in recent years exceeded donations from the wfp in some years by large amounts the chinese are not believed to attach any conditions to their food aid and south korea has been able to negotiate monitoring system that most observers describe as so limited as to be almost nonexistent

increased access and tolerating more and more frequent monitoring visits the spontaneity of which was increasing in september 2004 however the north korean government began restricting many humanitarian activities particularly those of resident relief organizations such as the wfp and of american ngos operating in north korea31 north korea authorities closed off several counties to humanitarian agencies told the wfp it would have to reduce its expatriate monitoring presence by onethird from fifteen to ten officials and began to deny more monitoring visit requests north korea also announced it would longer appeal for outside humanitarian assistance preferring development aid instead and therefore would longer participate in the consolidated appeals process cap and longer would have need for the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha in pyongyang wfp and ngo officials say this led to much tougher operating conditions in late 2004 and early 2005 beginning in february and march 2005 north korea began to relax some of its restrictions the wfp was allowed to reenter most of the counties that had been closed off north korean authorities have decided not to close ochas office the government granted wfp expatriates authority to use the local cellular phone service and approvals of monitoring visit requests began to rise 32 however although monitoring and access conditions appear to have improved since early 2005 they do not yet appear to have returned to the level they had reached in the summer of 2004 in particular the number of monitoring visits the wfp has been permitted is down to threeyear lows and north korea has not reversed its demand that the wfp draw down its expatriate staff which is likely to reduce the number of monitoring visits the wfp has attempted to compensate by reaching an agreement in principle with dprk authorities on several ways to improve the quality of its monitoring including the ability to observe actual distributions of food aid the distribution of wfp ration cards and the establishment of comprehensive commodity tracking system as of late april 2005 the agreement had yet to be implemented33 30 continued 6 31 north korean authorities generally do not permit american ngos to have permanent residential status in north korea 32 march and april 2005 email correspondence with

open to the wfp reducing wfps access to about 80 of the population seven of these were reopened in march 2005 bringing countrywide access to 158 of 203 counties and districts representing approximately 83 of the population35 aid workers involved in the north korean relief effort 34 see especially testimony of john powell world food program regional director before the house international relations subcommittee on east asia and the pacific may 2 2002 35 usaid report on us humanitarian assistance to north koreans april 25 2005 march and april 2005 email exchanges and phone conversations with wfp and usaid continued crs13 offer variety of explanations as to why pyongyang has prohibited access to certain areas including the presence of sensitive security related facilities anger at the actions of particular local official andor the triaging of the northern and eastern areas of the country so that more food can be provided to politically favored regions and constituencies particularly the communist party elite in pyongyang36 the 2004 nutrition survey found for instance that the stunting rates measured as heightforage for children under six in the northern and eastern provinces of yanggang 47 and south hamgyong 46 were nearly half the level in pyongyang 2637 because the wfp uses the staterun pds to deliver its food the wfps north korea program is susceptible to any use of the pds for the regimes political ends there have been calls for the wfp to abandon the pds on the basis that it helps to sustain the regime and to stunt the development of local markets that are outside the governments direct control38 inability to conduct random spot checks not only is the wfps access incomplete but is also highly circumscribed by the government which restricts the wfps staff from conducting random checks pyongyang has yet to provide wfp with the full list of beneficiary institutions through which wfp food assistance is provided despite 2001 pledge to do so in the absence of list and free access wfp monitoring teams in north korea submit travel requests to the government five days in advance local north korean authorities then decide which institutions will be visited though wfp officers onthespot requests for visits to specific sites occasionally are granted critics of the food aid programs have argued that the monitoring trips are staged by the north korean 35 continued representatives 36 the triaging argument has been prominently argued by andrew natsios currently director of the usaid in his book the great north korean famine p 10509 north koreas traditional food allocation system is highly politicized with lesserfavored groups receiving lower rations natsios highlights the considerable evidence that as food shortages worsened the north korean government curtailed andor suspended the operation of the staterun food distribution system in the northeastern provinces of chagang yanggang north hamgyong and south hamgyong from 1995 until mid1997 the government resisted the wfps plans to allocate food to much of these regions 37 north korean central bureau of statistics institute of child nutrition dprk

intentions the ngo experience in north korea praeger publishers westport ct 2003 especially p5 crs14 government39 interviewees cannot be chosen at random for instance and the wfp is not permitted to interview households that are not already receiving aid making it difficult to ascertain whether aid is going to the most needy until the restrictions implemented in the fall of 2004 officials said the level of cooperation with their north korean counterparts had increased significantly over the years in 2003 about 1 of the prearranged trips were cancelled compared with 5 in 2002 and 8 in 200140 prior to the 2004 restrictions wfp officials said their ability to monitor shipments had improved over time despite the constraints imposed on them the authorities had allowed the wfp and other relief groups more access to more institutions41 the number of monitoring visits more than doubled between 2001 and 2003 raising the average number of monthly visits to 513 in 2003 up from 265 in 2000 following the fall 2004 restrictions visits fell to levels not experienced since 2001 though they were still above some previous years levels42 additionally wfp staff reportedly have been allowed greater freedom in the types of questions they can ask and expect to be answered43 access to consumers markets until 2003 the wfp was barred access as were all foreigners from entering consumers markets which have replaced the public distribution system as the main source of food for many if not most north koreans gaining access to the markets is perhaps the only way of determining the actual price of food and other commodities in north korea in the markets prices reportedly fluctuate in accordance with relative supply and demand in contrast to the official public distribution system where prices are set by the central government in august 2003 the north korean government gave the wfp and other foreigners permission to enter the newly opened tongil consumer market in pyongyang thereafter visitations to other markets began to be allowed though wfp staff are permitted only intermittent access to other markets throughout the country44 39 see for instance sophie delaunay may 2

since 1995 in particular gaining more access to more counties and institutions and achieving greater degree of autonomy47 according to wfp policy it can withdraw assistance if country has not met its obligations under the agreements signed between the government and the wfp the wfp has curtailed food shipments to other countries such as zimbabwe to pressure central governments to improve access or monitoring conditions in 1997 the wfp reportedly used the threat of withdrawal to successfully pressure pyongyang to open the northeastern provinces48 the wfp at times has halted specific programs in north korea when it has not been able to determine satisfactorily that food donations were reaching their intended recipients49 humanitarian aid workers including wfp officials have argued that member countries have not provided the wfp with sufficient backing to push north korea to adhere to international standards of access and monitoring50 as discussed below during the 1990s us and japanese food aid was made contingent upon pyongyangs cooperation on geostrategic matters rather than compliance with principles in the provision of humanitarian relief north koreas motivations for controlling relief assistance the presence of foreign aid workers inside north korea directly threatens the myth of selfreliance or juche upon which dprk ideology is based aid groups demands for increased transparency appear to challenge two of the main pillars for perpetuating the governments political control the control of information and the control of individual movement the flood damage rehabilitation committee fdrc the north korean agency created in the mid1990s to manage interaction with most foreign relief groups has been tasked with preserving the governments strict political controls by minimizing contact with ordinary people and institutions while simultaneously drawing in as many resources as possible51 as result while contact between foreigners and north koreans has increased dramatically compared with the pre1995 situation rigid controls on humanitarian aid workers have led to little engagement relative to the amount of aid flowing into the dprk ngo representatives speculate that the tightening of restrictions on their activities in the fall of 2004 was the result of greater wariness toward the outside world by north koreas top leaders andor the increased influence of those north korean authorities who were uncomfortable with the growing access of foreign groups the tightening 46 john powell may 2 2002 testimony smith overcoming humanitarian

since 1997 the united states has sent over two million metric tons mt of assistance worth nearly 700 million over 90 of which has been channeled through the united nations world food program wfp to put these figures in context aid to north korea constituted approximately 65 of total us food aid between july 1995 and june 2001 over the same period the united states donated over 45 billion to the world food program roughly ten percent of which was designated for the wfps relief efforts in north korea us food assistance has fallen markedly since 2001 the united states requires that at least 75 of its food assistance be shipped to the northeastern provinces food aid policy during the clinton administration despite the clinton administrations claim that food assistance to north korea was not linked to security matters it has been well documented that during the 1990s the united states used food aid to secure north koreas participation and increased cooperation 52 march and april 2005 email and phone exchanges with wfp and ngo representatives crs18 in variety of securityrelated negotiations53 between 1997 and 1999 for instance the clinton administration provided food to secure north koreas participation in fourway security talks with the united states south korea and china the largest single us pledge over 500000 mt in 1999 was provided as quid pro quo for north korea allowing access to suspected underground nuclear site at kumchangri54 although the food for talks approach probably helped secure north koreas participation in number of talks and was demanded by pyongyang as precondition for joining the talks it did not appear to result in substantive changes in dprk behavior since food aid essentially is controlled by the north korean government political linkages also may have directly helped to sustain the regime55 linking food assistance to security issues was opposed on humanitarian grounds for leaving the wfp and relief groups with little leverage to negotiate better operating conditions inside north korea56 it also has been criticized for sending the message to pyongyang that north korea could maintain its restrictions on food donors and avoid fundamental agricultural reform with little fear of jeopardizing future food shipments57 food aid policy during the bush administration though the bush administration generally has followed food assistance policy that is more closely linked to humanitarian principles than was the case during the clinton years it too has given contradictory signals on food aid since june 2002 the bush administration officially has applied different type of conditionality than was used during the clinton years linking the level of us food aid to verifiable progress in north korea allowing the humanitarian community greater access to all areas of the country nationwide nutritional survey and improvements in the food aid monitoring system58 for months the administration officials made conflicting statements about whether it would continue donating food aid to north korea and if so how much and whether such aid should be conditioned on north korean actions in the humanitarian andor security arenas in december 2002 us officials said that north korea had not responded to the new us conditions and that the administration had made decision on future food aid in january 2003 president bush said that he would consider offering the north bold initiative including energy and food if the north dismantled its nuclear program also in january 2003 usaid director andrew natsios

desire to influence the sixparty talks the official announcements also referred to improvements in north koreas cooperation with the wfp on access and monitoring though those improvements were widely thought to be marginal on july 23 2004 the state department announced 50000 mt contribution to the wfps 2004 north korea appeal as of late may 2005 the bush administration had yet to make decision on new pledges of food to the dprk on may 20 2005 state department spokesman boucher said that the decision would be based on three factors the need in north korea the ability to monitor food shipments and competing needs on us food assistance60 bush administration officials report they have held number of meetings with their north korean counterparts to discuss the ways in which north korea could address monitoring and access issues in exchange for increased us food assistance north korea reportedly has failed to respond to these proposals the administration also has asked the south korean and chinese governments to donate food through the wfp and to press north korea to allow better access and monitoring of their bilateral food aid61 competition for food aid resources62 the debate over whether and how to provide food aid to north korea has been made more acute by competition with other emergency situations particularly those in sudan ethiopia and the countries hit by the december 26

of the nearly 12 billion in regular fy2005 appropriations for the pl 480 title ii food assistance program all but 33 million had been allocated as of early april 2005 congress approved an additional 240 million for sudan and other emergencies in africa in may 2005 as part of the emergency fy2005 supplemental pl 10913 but some believe that amount will fall short of existing demands historically pl 480 has been the main vehicle for providing us agricultural commodities as food aid overseas and since the end of fy2002 has been the program that has funded nearly all of the us food commitments to north korea congress directly appropriates pl 480 aid and therefore could although it rarely does direct how the food should or should not be disbursed some members of congress have asked the administration to release food and funds from the bill emerson humanitarian trust reserve of commodities and cash that is intended to provide food aid when title ii aid is unavailable for the emergency food situation in ethiopia however in early april 2005 the trust held just 14 million mt of its 4 million mt of capacity and only about 89 million in cash63 another food aid program section 416b of the agricultural act of 1949 is unlikely to be available from fy1999fy2002 most of us food assistance to north korea was provided under the 416b program which is administered by the us department of agriculture usda and allows for surplus food stocks owned by usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the government corporation that finances domestic commodity price support programs and some food aid and export programs to be donated to nations in need the heavy use of the section 416b program was facilitated by sharp rise in cccacquired foodstocks from 1999 through 2001 since then however these stocks have fallen dramatically additionally the bush administration has made policy decision issued in its fy2003 budget proposal that surplus commodities should not be used for food aid chinas food aid and food exports since the soviet union withdrew its patronage of north korea in the early 1990s china is widely believed to have emerged as the single largest provider of food to north korea though the precise amount is difficult to estimate due to lax controls on the north koreachina border and the overall unreliability of official chinese statistics additionally food from china is known to enter the north on commercial concessional and barter terms making it difficult to distinguish aid from trade64 in the mid1990s during the height of the first north korean nuclear crisis china cut its food shipments to the dprk dramatically perhaps by as much as 80 90 only to restore them in 1996 and 1997 with the onset of famine which threatened the possibility of north korean collapse and was leading to increased numbers of north koreans crossing the border into northeastern china65 as discussed below in the section on energy 63 charles hanrahan crs report rs22027 indian

fuel oil shipments were roughly equivalent to the energy north korea lost from shutting down its nuclear power plants between 1995 and 2003 the united states provided over 400 million to kedo of which nearly 380 million went towards heavy fuel oil shipments and the remainder for the organizations administrative expenses the united states is the thirdlargest contributor to kedo following south korea

exports which tend to be agricultural items one reason for the absence of north korean exports on the us market could be continued restrictions particularly the fact that the dprk does not have

probable cause is north koreas lack of export competitiveness and relative economic isolation from the rest of the world north korea has faced few or barriers to exporting to japan and the european union for instance while its exports to those areas are far greater than to the united states the absolute values are minuscule compared with countries of comparable size that are integrated into the global trading system north koreas failure to generate export revenue is major reason the country is unable to import food on commercial terms to make up for its chronic food shortage in turn the overall uncompetitiveness of north korean enterprises is direct result of pyongyangs unwillingness to engage in fundamental economic reforms leading some commentators to opine that international assistance actually has allowed north koreas leadership to avoid instituting more marketoriented policies75 there is virtually us foreign direct investment in north korea the american chamber of commerce in south korea has attempted to arrange exploratory trips to the north but has not received the necessary visas from the dprk government even if north korea were to allow delegation to visit it is likely that most us investors would be deterred by the countrys chronic shortages widespread corruption lack of legal infrastructure sudden economic policy reversals and north korean enterprises

1993 the department of defenses prisoner of warmissing personnel office dpmo has provided north korea with nearly 28 million for assistance in recovering the suspected remains of the several thousand us servicemen unaccounted for during the korean war76 most of the funds have been used to pay for the costs of over 32 joint field activities that have been conducted in north korea since 1996 operations that have recovered over 220 probable us remains77 see table 4 below these figures do not include costs of flying north korean delegation to bangkok for annual negotiations about future joint field operations dpmo estimates the cost of flying sevenperson north korean team which has been done since 2002 at 25000 figure the office says is cheaper than conducting the negotiations in other locations as with joint recovery operations in vietnam laos and other countries the payments are calculated by negotiating the compensation provided for the workers materials facilities and equipment provided by the north korean peoples army kpa and other north korean government entities payment is provided in cash deliveries via the united nations command in south korea to the kpa in installments during the course of the calendar years operations the size scope and location of the recovery operations are negotiated annually and the size of the compensation package varies accordingly defense department officials report that while operating conditions in north korea are far from ideal the scale of the operations increased gradually significantly from 1996 to 2001 and has varied in scale since78 on may 25 2005 the us department of defense announced it was temporarily suspending the joint recovery operations ostensibly due to force protection concerns over the safety of us search teams which operate without any means of communicating outside north korea defense department statement said the operations would continue after north korea has created an appropriate environment in may 26 congressional testimony deputy assistant secretary of defense richard lawless indicated that the pentagon had asked the north koreans to alter the terms of the search agreement to allow us military personnel way to communicate in emergencies one search team had completed its mission before the announcement was made79 76 estimates vary as to the number whose deaths

options for aid to north korea congress and the administration have variety of options for future assistance to north korea given the suspension of the kedo project the immediate decisions will revolve around food aid particularly given increased demand for food assistance from other areas of the world additionally if talks with north korea over its nuclear program begin and score breakthrough there will likely be consideration of broader economic assistance package as discussed earlier any decision by the united states to apply sanctions impose facto quarantine or economically suspend or terminate its current aid would be expected to have limited economic effect on north korea because in the shorttomedium term china andor south korea which place high priority on maintaining north koreas stability could increase their own assistance to compensate table 6 in the appendix shows the dramatic increase in the south korean governments expenditures on engaging north korea since the june 2000 summit between kim jongil and kim dae jung the bulk of these funds which are in the 500 million per year range constitute direct or indirect assistance to the dprk moreover in addition to aid beijing and seoul are by far north koreas largest trading partners see table 5 food aid options options for food aid policy include provide food aid unconditionally the core humanitarian argument for continuing aid regardless of the north korean governments actions is that major reduction in assistance could lead to another famine proponents of continued assistance take issue with criticism that international aid enables the north korean government to divert resources to the countrys military and elite they argue that because humanitarian priorities are unlikely to dictate the north korean regimes priorities foreign assistance is the only hope for feeding the bulk of the population at least in the 79 continued subcommittee on asia and the pacific crs31 immediate term80 many also argue that food aid provides an opportunity for exposing north koreans to the outside world by virtue of the permanent and reasonably extensive monitoring presence maintained by the wfp and other aid groups an additional diplomatic benefit of providing food aid unconditionally is that it might weaken criticism in south korea of the bush administrations policy toward the dprk us food shipments lend support to president bushs oftenstated approach of supporting the north korean people despite his concerns about the regime81 discontinue food aid this option has been proposed both on security and humanitarian grounds cutting off food assistance could be used as part of an isolation strategy or an attempt to trigger the collapse of the north korean regime the effects of the united states suspending food assistance may be undercut however by increased shipments from china or south korea from humanitarian perspective sending food to north korea arguably diverts limited supplies of food aid from other needy and more accountable countries furthermore as discussed above some argue that the volume and consistency of international aid has enabled the north korean government to avoid importing food allowing it to spend hard currency on other items82 options between these extremes include establish external linkages condition future food aid on progress in political and securityrelated talks such as negotiations regarding the norths nuclear programs emphasizing geostrategic concerns might lead to greater immediate cooperation in certain negotiations from pyongyang china and japan have had some shortterm successes in linking their food assistance to north korean cooperation on other issues in chinas case it appears to have helped secure north koreas participation in various rounds of sixparty talks for japan promises of food aid have helped in on resolving some issues of north koreas abductions of japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s however in both the japanese and chinese cases it is not clear that the provision of food has induced significant changes in north koreas overall behavior on security issues likewise the huge us provision of food aid in 1999 may have helped obtain an inspection of the suspected nuclear site at kumchangri but it did not prevent north korea from pursuing 80 hyder in north korea first save lives 81 see for

paved with good intentions the ngo experience in north korea praeger publishers westport ct forthcoming 2003 p 7 crs32 separate uranium enrichment nuclear program additionally this approach runs the risk of encouraging the north korean government to believe it does not need to comply with humanitarian relief groups demands any attempts to link food aid or sales to foreign policy or national security objectives would have to be reconciled with recent congressional and executive efforts to delink the two83 establish internal linkages by conditioning future food aid on improvements in access and monitoring as usaid director andrew natsios has argued in the past84 establishing such internal linkages however is unlikely to induce much change in north korea so long as it is dwarfed by unmonitored chinese and south korean assistance maintain the status quo of hybrid approach to food aid in theory the administration essentially has adopted hybrid approach of giving base amount of aid unconditionally and linking food above this amount to progress in monitoring and other items related to the relief effort the administrations relatively loose application of its official policy however shows the difficulties in practice of divorcing humanitarian assistance from the overall security environment 83 in 2000 congress passed and president clinton signed into law the trade

wfp86 us ngos operate under particularly tight scrutiny they are not permitted to maintain permanent offices inside north korea additionally numerous south korean ngos operate in north korea often with financial backing from seoul few relief groups report they have overcome many obstacles to monitoring assistance particularly gaining access to aid recipients and using their own koreanspeaking staff the more successful us ngos appear to be relatively small affiliated with us religious groups and focused on ongoing niche areas such as rebuilding north koreas health care system rather than on emergency relief87 these organizations relative degree of success may be partly attributable to the size of their operations which allows some to set up their own distribution system independent of the public distribution system and to deal principally with more cooperative local north korean officials some of these advantages might be negated if the groups began to receive large amounts of funding from the us government additionally ngo representatives report that they were hard hit by the dprks tightening of restrictions in the fall 2004 past us publicprivate initiative yielded mixed results similar to those reported by the wfp from 1997 to 2000 the us government provided over 155000 mt of food aid to be distributed by the private voluntary organization consortium pvoc which

the us has several options including resume heavy fuel oil payments continue to make payments for kedos operational expenses but not for heavy fuel oil suspend all payments to kedo or push to

prohibit aid for north korea some assert that any energy assistance provided should be nonnuclear in nature arguing that nuclear reactors are illsuited to meeting north koreas energy needs because

problems and discussions on normalizing usnorth korean relations that would include lifting the remaining us sanctions and removing north korea from the list of terroristsupporting countries north korea rejected the proposal as sham provide agricultural support assistance this could help reduce north koreas chronic dependence on outside aid by boosting its domestic agricultural output90 many european ngos and some us groups have moved from providing relief to rehabilitating the countrys agricultural system according to one study the prospects for success of these efforts are not likely to make substantial progress unless the north korean government allows development workers greater access to the north korean population and abandons its priority of attaining selfsufficiency in food91 some observers counter that focusing on selfsufficiency distracts from what they argue is the most efficient solution to the food security problem importing more food from abroad92 provide other types of humanitarian assistance north koreas health care system has been devastated by the collapse of the countrys economy at the same time decade of food shortages has led to the prevalence of opportunistic diseases including tuberculosis which was believed to have been eradicated from the dprk in the 1970s some relief ngos have had more success in obtaining north korean cooperation in the
