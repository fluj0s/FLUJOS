claims background and proposed legislation summary in november 1998 us insurance regulators six european insurers international jewish organizations and the state of israel agreed to establish the international commission on holocaust era insurance claims icheic icheic was tasked with identifying policyholders and administering payment of hundreds of thousands of holocaustera insurance polic ies alleged never to have been honored by european insurance companies it ende d its claims proce ss in march 2007 having facilitated the payment of just over 300 million to 47353 claimants an additional 190 million was allocated to humanitarian f und for holocaust survivors and holocaust education and remembrance throughout its existence icheic was criticized including by some members of congress for delays in its claims process for conducting its activities with lack of transparency and for allegedly honoring an inadequate number of cl aims although they acknowle dge initial delays in the claims process icheic supporters am ong them the bush administration and european governments argue that the process was fair and comprehensive especially given the unprecedented legal nd historical complexities of the task members of congress have shown longs tanding interest in seeking to obtain compensation for holocaust survivors and their heirs for unpaid insurance policies hearings before the house committee on government reform between 2001 and 2003 exposed broad criticism of icheic and legislation proposed in the 107th109th congresses sought to provide survivors alternative legal mechanisms to pursue claims these proposals were never enacted and were opposed by us administrations which considered icheic the exclusive vehicle for resolving holocaustera insurance claims icheics closure and growing concern about the wellbeing of aging survivors now predominantly over 75 years old ve reignited congressional interest in holocaustera insurance and other

on jewish material claims against germany claims conference marked the first and most significant of series of postwar west german initiatives which have resulted in total german payments both from the government and private sector of an estimated 93 billion 63 billion euros to jewish and non jewish victims of na zi crimes and their heirs1 while most agree that germany will never be able to adequately compensate for nazi atrocities the compensation nd restitution efforts of successive german governments have b een widely commended2 the governments of other western european countries known to have collaborated with the nazis also undertook co mpensation efforts in the years after the second world war however with th possible exception of those in the netherlands these efforts are generally thoug ht to have been less comprehensive than west germanys in the years following the war these countries whose economies had been devastated tended to argue th at germany should assume responsibility to compensate for nazi crimes the communist governments of east germany and central and eastern europe offered minimal restitution ndor compensation if any3 the fall of the berlin wall 1989 and co llapse of the soviet union 1991 led to renewed efforts by jewish organizations holocaust survivors and the us and israeli governments to obtain compensation for survivors who had lived or

that up to billions of dollars worth of assets seized by the nazis from individual citizens and deposited in private and na tional banks throughout west ern europe had never been returned in march 1997 the first classac tion lawsuits focused exclusively on the issue of unpaid holocaustera life insurance policies were filed in new york the so called cornell class action against 16 european

played an im portant role both in securing support for and impeding subsequent legal challenges to the governmentnegotiated settlements the clinton administration took the l ead in facilitating broad compensation agreements each with insurancerelate d components with german austrian and french companies and their governments the clinton administration was also involved in negotiating ttlement with swiss banks although us officials contend that lack of swiss government involvement weakened that agreement and led to heightened international critic ism of switzerland according to stuart eizenstat the clinton administrations lead official in the negotiations the damaging effects of wave of international criticis m of switzerland arising from its perceived poor handling of the swiss bank affair led the german austrian and french governments to proactively seek to resolve pending lawsuits against companies in their countries and stem the possibility of future lawsuits5 each of these

official us endorsement it was believed could ensure that future lawsuits or challenges to the settlements would have difficulty standing up in us courts6 background on insurance issues insurance markets in preworld war ii europe were well veloped with many policies going further than simply comp ensating for property damage or providing benefits to family in the case of the policyholders death in addition to providing death benefits these policies often acted as savings vehicles similar in some ways to what are known as whole life insurance policies in the united states today for example life insurance policies were often purchased intending to provide for sons education or to provide for dowry upon th marriage of daughter such policy might have run for 20 years with the policyholder committing to make periodic payments and the insurance company committing to pay certain sum known generally as the face value of the policy at the end of the 20 years or in the case of the death of the policyholder such policy generally w ould have cancellation provisions that would allow policyholder to obtain surrender value prior to the policys intended end or if policyholder wished to keep the contract but not pay further premiums it could be converted to paid up status which would result in smaller face value at the end of the policy in the runup to and during the conduct of world war ii the nazi government made concerted effort to confiscate assets belonging to jews in germany and in various occupied countries7 at first these efforts we re largely indirect such as placing high taxes or fees on those emig rating which necessitated the liquidation of many insurance policies later the confiscation was more direct with for example insurance companies being required to pay insurance proceeds from claims8 or the cash values directly to the government initial postwar efforts in western eur ope to honor unpaid insurance policies primarily life insurance belonging to holocaust victims are widely considered to have been far less comprehensive than other compensation and restitution programs several of the countries home to compan ies known to have so ld such policies including germany austria switzerland and the netherlands passed laws in the 1950s and 1960s attempting at l east partially to honor th policies however variety of factors led these efforts to fall short these included uncertainty regarding the present value of the policies difficulties with verification of policy ownership disagreement over how to compensate the many jews who were forced to either cashhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34348crs4 9 statement of mr herbert hansmeyer member of the board of management of allianz ag washington conference on holocau stera assets 1998 op

the case with postwar settlement issues german and dutch companies are thought to have done more than others in addressing unpaid insurance policies after the war in the late 1990s german insurance giant allianz went so far as to claim it had honored appr oximately 70 of its wartime policies sold in germany either before the war ended or through its partic ipation in other post war compensation programs9 critics dispute allianzs claim arguing that policyholders were often grossly undercompensated bot h during the war and with greatly devalued currency in the wa rs aftermath othe r countries home to companies known to have sold insurance policies throughout the nazi reich such as france and belgium did not administer any insurancerelated compensation programs until the 1990s and to this day the italian government appears to have involved itself in the ma tter minimally if at all historians agree that of all holocaust victims jews were most likely to have owned substantial life and othe r insurance policies effort s to honor unpaid insurance policies have focused almost exclusively on jewish victims the fact that many such jews lived and purchased policies in ce ntral and eastern european countries primarily poland hungary nd czechoslovakia which later became part of the soviet bloc proved to be an additional and significant complicating factor in post war efforts to have the polic ies honored many of the comp anies that sold insurance in these countries longer exist howev er several western european companies which accounted for significant portion of the central and eastern european markets continue to operate today specifically the italian company generali is known to have been very active in centra l and eastern europe however generali and others have argued that responsibility to honor these policie s was transferred to staterun insurance entities by way of the state takeover and nationalization of the industry under communist rule10 the international commission on holocaust era insurance claims icheic in 1997 in response to increasing claims against european insurance companies operating in the united states the national association

to the following principles claimants would not be charged to file claim icheic would evaluate claims based on relaxed standards of proof given that significant number of potenti claimants did not possess policy documentation claimants would not be re quired to name specific insurance company or provide documentation of an insurance policy and icheic and participating insurance companies would

on icheic us administrations have consistently endorsed iche ic as an important and unprecedented mechanism to provide support and compensation to individuals whose insurance claims were believed unlikely to have been satisfactorily resolved through existing legal channels accordingly the clinton administration sought to secure funding for icheic and its claims proce ss as part of the broader compensation agreements it negotiated with the german austrian and french governments in the late 1990s in exchange for financial co mmitments made to icheic by german and austrian companies by way of these agreements the clinton administration agreed to endorse icheic as the exclusive m echanism for resolving unpaid holocaustera insurance claims in addition the administration sought to grant participating german companies socalled legal peace from further action agai nst them in us courts although the us federal government could not forbid us citizens from pursuing legal action against the companies it did commit to file statement of interest encouraging dismissal of any future legal action against german companies in the united states16 this commitment appears to have effectively

holocaustera insurance claims excellent cept but inept implementation jewish political studies review spring 2005european governments the legal implica tions of both the commitment to legal peace and the supreme court decision are discusse d in more detail below in the section entitled litigation of holocaustera insurance claims key points of contention despite receiving the support of us administrations icheic was broadly criticized including by members of congress18 critics put forward the following charges that icheics administrative and claims processes suffered from lack of transparency and oversight that icheic often failed to live up to its commitment to apply relaxed standards of proof in ssessing claims and that icheic and participating insurance companies failed to make comprehensive policyholder lists available to the public19 since icheics closure critics have emphasized that the roughly 300 million paid out to holocaust rvivors and their he irs falls far short of estimates of the total value of unpaid holocaustera insurance policies which range from 17 to 200 b illion20 icheic proponents respond that icheic administered claimsbased process giving all claims fair cons ideration they argue that the fact that the total amount paid by icheic falls short of some estimates of the value of unpaid policies suggests lack of claimants rather than flawed claims process the icheic claims process management and oversight issues critics contend that icheics claims process suffered from unnecessary and prolonged delays and that thousands of ligible claimants were ultimately excluded from the process due to poor management nd lack of transparency and legitimate oversight contention over icheic manage ment and oversight centers largely on european insurance companies obligations under icheic and the extent to which they were held accountable to meeting th obligations under the terms of the icheic mou ultimate responsibility for ve rifying accepting or rejecting submitted claims rested with the insurance companies as outlined in figure 1 on page 10 icheic staff submitted claims it deemed legitimate to insurance companies which would in turn consult their records to ve rify whether policy existed and whether it had been previously paid although pa rticipating insurers were required to commission and publicize independent audits of

delayed and that lack of an independent re view process allowed room for unfair insurer influence icheic proponents argue that publicly av ailable audits of insurance company participation in the claims process and icheics final results demonstrate that the companies did indeed follow the agreed upon principles in honoring tens of thousands of unpaid holocaustera in surance policies clinton and bush administration officials and others involve d in the process also argue that the icheic claims process with its relaxed st andards of proof and historical research gave potential claimants far better opportunity to resolve claims than they would have received in us court of law in addressing criticism of insurers lack of accountability they emphasize that insurers would not have participated in icheic or any other restitution process without re taining full control over claims decisions furthermore the fact that icheic was incorporated in switzerland and headquartered in london england insula ted the organizations decisions from scrutiny under us law initial congressional concerns regarding problems with icheic administration oversight and its claims process were brought to light during november 2001 hearing before the house committee on government reform during the hearing critics expressed dismay that icheic had not launched its claims process until early 2000 one and onehalf years after the m ou was signed and that yearlong pilot claims process resulted in what some considered remarkably high rejection rates21 icheic was also confronted with complaints of high administrative costs and board secrecy icheic supporters generally acknowledge that the claims process got off to slow and problematic start but argue that initial missteps were addressed and the claims process was ultimately fair and comprehensive in the year following the 2001 congressional hearing an executive monitoring group appointed by chairman eagleburger to investig ate claims handling found widespread mismanagement in insurance company handling of documented claims as result icheic implemented verification system to verify company claims decisions and compelled

november 2007 january 2008icheic research and publication of names one of icheics most contentious and challenging tasks was determining and disclosing lists of jewish holocaust victims who had purchased insurance policies from 19201945 although estimates vary some studies indicate that between 800000 to 900000 polices were sold to eventual jewish victims of the holocaust23 by 2003 icheic s published policyholder lists comprised total of pproximately 520000 jewish individuals who purchased insurance policies in nazi occupied europe24 the german insurance industry provided 363232 policyholder name s over half of the total names published in addition to including records from nongerman companies icheic reports that it carried out extensive archival research in 15 countries that resulted in the discovery of 55079 jewish policy holder names representing about 78000 policies the german insurance association gdv and the german government express confidence that the gdvs

the gdv the list of total policies represented records of 70 insurance companies active in germany during the time period the list of jewish residents was th result of unprecedented archival research in cooperation with the holocaust martyr s and heroes remembrance authority yad vashem in israel and over 100 german archives and sources while most observers praise the german industrys disclosu re of policyholder names some contend that generali and other european insurers avoided disclosing their records often citing privacy concerns for its part generali argues that its contribution of about 45000 names to the icheic list was the product of comprehensive research involving matc h between records of all potentially unpaid policies sold during the nazi era and jewish victims of the holocaust available at yad vashem european insurers uniformly oppose calls fo r companies to disclose lists of all policies in force during the era of the nazi reich in addition to citing privacy concerns they argue that compiling and publishing such lists would be costly and would provide little clarity regarding potential jewish policyholders company policy lists contain information as to pe

germany western and eastern europe available at httpwwwicheicorgpdf pomeroyferras20reportpdfpolicy valuation another central critique of the icheic process is that it paid out relatively low proportion of the va lue of the insurance assets in question the current house legislation on the issu hr 1746 discussed below finds that 12 experts estimate that the value in 2006 of unpaid life annuity endowment and dowry insurance theft from european jewry from the holocaust and its aftermath ranges between 17000000000 and 200000000000 these estimates 17 billion to 200 billion ge nerally have come from critics of the icheic process and advocates for jewish survivors and their heirs26 the insurance companies involved not unsurprisingl have produced estimates that are significantly less in the range of 2 billion to 3 billion icheic itself commissioned task force led by glenn pomeroy then insurance commissioner of north dakota and philippe ferras t hen executive vicepresident of axa insurance to assess the value of holocaustera insurance markets27 the pomeroy ferras report as it is usua lly known lays out in great detail various facts and assumptions around the issue of valuati on including ranges of estimates for each country in the home currency it does t itself give current day number for the value of all unpaid claims although it would be possible to calculate such value using the icheic valuation calculations applied to individual claims these guidelines are discussed below despite the seemingly wide range of estimates betw een 2 billion and 200 billion the basic method for the competin g calculations is largely the same estimate the total amount of insurance held by jews in the relevant parts of europe prior to world war ii subtract the amounts that have been previously paid on these policies and adjust this amount for the intervening 70odd years while the figures for total insurance amounts and the appr oximate jewish population are generally accepted the figures used in most other steps of the calculation are often disputed these include the specific propensity for the jewish population to purchase insurance and the method used to value ssets denominated in historical foreign currencies from the 1930s in current us dollars unfortunately there is often little objective evidence upon which to base th choice of what figure to use perhaps the single factor that can have the widest impact on the range of estimates is the method used to translate the values of insurance policies from the 1930s denominated in european currencies to current day us dollars the first part of this question is what index does one use to adjust for the intervening six or seven decades the answer to this can change th final value dramatically using the us

at bottom privately funded nonprofit entity created among six european insurance companies with certain nongovernmental jewish organizations 32 the court was persuaded neith er by the fact that icheic was assumed to be recognized agent for purposes of carrying out the obligations assumed in the german foundation agreement33 nor by the presumption of both the german government and the various german insurance companies against whom there were holocaust erarelated claims pending in us cour ts that the conclusion of the foundation agreement would bring legal closure to those claims nor seemingly was the court convinced that the arra ngement amounted to valid us foreign policy concern despite the obligation of th department of justice to file statement of interest in all cas involving holocaustera claims against german companies expressing the vi ew that the german foundation is the exclusive forum for those claims and that dismissal is required in keeping with the foreign policy

to preempt california statute imposing additional duties on european insurers garamendi held th at california insurance disclosure laws which require greater disclosure than that required by the icheic are preempted by this foreign policy similarly we must conclude that section 3545 which provides for private actions arising out of holocaust era insurance policies is preempted by the same

failed to compensate significant number of ho locaust survivors andor their heirs and beneficiaries many of those critical of icheic nd suppor tive of the proposed legislation highlight the reluctance of european insurers to disclose holocaustera policy records and contend that public di sclosure of these records could provide valuable evidence to individuals who were either unaware of existing policies or were unable to adequately substantiate claim h r 1746 supporters acknowledge that the standards of proof placed on claimant in us court of law would likely be far more stringent than those exercise d by icheic however they argue that in light of icheics closure the courts re present one of the few if not the only remaining avenues by which to pursue claims furthermore strong sense of distrust regarding icheics application of its rela xed standards of proof and of insurers thoroughness in searching their records appear to have increased hope that public disclosure of holocaustera records could lead to substantive claims those opposed to the proposed legislation including the bush administration european insurance companies and severa l european governments tend to argue that the bills public disclo sure requirement represents violation of individual privacy rights especially those statutor ily mandated in some european countries and that the federal cause of action would both preempt foreign policy decisions of the executive and enable an undesirabl and costly stream of litigation some express strong doubts about the usefulness of publicly disclosing comprehensive policyholder lists arguing both that names alone would provide little if any tangible information on policies themselves and that matching names to survivors may prove difficult inconclusive and contentious for example they point to the prevalence of some names among the jewish community to examples of jews and nonjews having the same names and to sometimes radical changes of spelling from the time names were originally recorded until today furthermore european insurers estimate that publishing and maintaining policyholder lists of tensofmillions of names could be costly endeavor both
