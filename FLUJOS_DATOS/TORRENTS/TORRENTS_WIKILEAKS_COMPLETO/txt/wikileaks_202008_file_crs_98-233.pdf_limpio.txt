debated at length over many years the federal government owns about 20 of us timberlands concentrated in the west and about 30 of u s timber inventory and 44 of the softwood inventory declines in federal harvests in recent years and legislation to end federal harvests have led t concerns about the impacts on forest health and on the economy the national impacts appear to be relatively modest but local and regional effects could be substantial the importance of national forest timber has debated at length for many years the forest service defines timberland as land capable of producing 20 cubic feet of indus trial wood per acre annually in 1992 there were nearly 490 million acres of timberland in the united stat nearly 22 of the total land area another 247 million acres 11 were identified as other forest land lands either less productive than the standard such as interior alaska or reserved withdrawn from potential timber harvesting by adminis trative or legislative action such as wilderness designation timberland and timber supply data have traditionally been reported by four land owner classes as displayed in table 1 the national forests are administered by the forest service for sustained yields of the multiple uses water yields wildlife habitat livestock grazing and recreation and wilderness as well as timber production in 1992 the national forests contained 85 llion acres of timberland 17 of all us timberland the other public cla ss of governmentowned timberland contains all other government owners other federal agencies eg bureau of land management and department of defense states and local governments in 1992 other public timberlands totaled 47 million acres nearly 10 of all us timberlands about quarter of these timberlands are administered by federal agencies another landowner class is the wood products industry timber lands owned by companies that produce lumber plywood and other wood products in 1992 these lands amounted to more than 70 million acres 14 of all us timberlands the last class of t imberland owners is nonindustrial private landowners nipl this class includes l individual and organizational timberland owners who do not own woodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98233crs2 the terms softwoods and hardwoods re commonly used misnomers softwoods are actually1 conifer trees pines firs spruces etc while the hardwoods are angiosperms flowering plants softwoods are generally mediumdensity woods that can re adily be used for construction materials they dry straight and are strong but easy to work with the dominant temperate hardwoods oaks and ma ples are substantially harder more dense than the conifers although som hardwoods such as aspen and cottonwood are relatively soft less dense than conifers as group hardwoods re more variable than softwoods in density and workability and less valuable for construction but many are more valuable for flooring furniture and cabinetryproduct processing facilities thus the class includes not only farmers and other people but also hunting clubs and major corporations that are not part of the wood products in dustry eg companies that own timberlands because of the minerals coal etc located beneath this landowner class is also the largest with nearly 288 million acres of timberland 59 of all us timberlands the timberlands of these various landowners are not d istributed uniformly around the country for example 55 of industrial timberlands are in the south virginia to texas and oklahoma and another 23 are in the north maine to maryland to missouri t minnesota nonindustrial private timbe rlands are even more heavily concentrated in the east more than 87 of nipl timberlands are in the eastern half of the country i n contrast 75 of national forest timberlands are west of the 100 meridian looking atth this situation regionally more than 70 of all eastern timberlands are nipl timberlands with the industry owning another 10 of timber lands in the north and 20 of timberlands in the south in the west governme nt timberlands are relatively dominant accounting for 68 of rocky mountain timberlands and 55 of pacific coast timberlands because of these substantial regional variations the national consequences of changes in the timber supplies can mask important regional and local effects table 1 us timberlands by landowner and region 1992 in millions of acres

inventories at 2495 cubic feet of timber per acrehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98233crs3 see table 3 priv ate timberlands both industrial and nipl have substantially lower in ventories some of this difference is due to the substantial cost to private landowners of holding lands and inventory bu t differing regional landownership patterns also contribute significantly pacific coast timberlands have much higher average inventories than other timberla nds for all landowners as shown in table 3 because 75 of national fores t timberlands are in the west one would expect greater relative

landowners have only 14 of the timberland and 13 of the inventory but provided 33 of the 1991 har vest the relativel low harvests from government lands is due to two factors first for the national forests low avera ge harvests result partly from the regional differences 43 of national forest timberlands are in the rocky mountains which have lower averag harvests than southern or pacific coast timberlands second most government lands must be managed for sustained yi eld of multiple uses including water and recreation as well as timber industrial timberlands are also commonly managed for

relative importance of federal timber this lengthy background is important for understanding the relative importance f federal timber in us timber supply nd lumber production in 1991 us manufacturers produced 332 billion board feet bbf of softwood lumber as shown in table 4 th e2 national forests provided 16 of the soft wood timber cut in 1991 and other federal lands about quarter of other public timberlands probably provided about 12 adjusting for the higher conversion factors for federal lands federal timber accounted for abou t3 21 of the mber used in softwood lumber production in 1991 in addition us wood users imported 117 bbf of softwood lumber primarily from canada while us lumber producers exported 29 bbf of softwood lumber thus us softwood lumber consump tion in 1991 was 422 bbf and f ederal timberlands provided about 16 of the softwood used in 1991 21 of 332 bbf 70 bbf 70 bbf422 bbf 16httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98233crs5 by 1996 the situation had changed us softwood lumber production was 33 3 bbf slightly higher than in 1991 ho wever national forest timber harvests in 1996 were only 44 of 1991 levels assuming that other federal harvests were similarly reduced federal timber accounted for about 9 of the timber used in domestic softwood lumber production in 1996 softwood lumber consumption rose to 499 bbf in 1996 because imports rose to 182 bbf while exports fell to 19 bbf thus federal timberlands pro vided only about 6 of the softwood timber used in 1996 9 of 333 bbf 30 bbf 30 bbf499 bbf 6 possible impacts of ending federal timber harvests bill to prohibit timber harvesting from federal lands the nationa l forest protection and restoration act of 1997 hr 2789 has been introduced in the 105 congress th questions about such legislation have focused on its possible impacts on forest health and on its possible economic consequences possible forest health impacts environmentalists have generally asserted tha t timber harvests are unnatural disturb ances that displace wildlife fragment wildlife habitat and degrade water quality while adding fuel to increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires and to further degrade forest h ealth the wood products industry argues that timber har vesting can be used to reduce accumulated fuels and thus to re duce the risk of catastrophic wildfires while improving forest health by mimicking natural disturbances what is the reality it is difficult to draw conclusions currently forest health t least in the interior west the cascade crest to the black hills is widely acknowledged to be relatively poor but there is lack of agreement on the nature of the problem th possible remedies and the urgency of action the wood p roducts industry has argued that timber mortality on federal lands in the interior west is at unprecedented levels and that immediate act ion is needed to remove dead and dying trees to prevent catastrophic fires the environm ental groups that accept the existence of problem assert that the problem is too many smalldiameter noncommercial trees often of the wrong species and too few big old trees and that the proble m has been developing over decades and will take years or decades to correct anecdotal evidence supports both views the existing data i n forest resources of the united states 1992 do not unambiguously demonstrate an forest health problem but the geographic scale used and the time required to gather and publish the data could obscure the situation both descriptions of the problem are probably true in some localities while neither is universally true timber harvesting can be useful for sites with excess mortality f trees with commercial value research has demon strated that timber harvesting can occur while adequately protecting water quality and fish and wildlife habitat but there is littl evidence to assess performance tim ber harvesting does increase smalldiameter biomass limbs and tops at or near ground level and thus increases the fuel accumulations tha t exacerbate the risk of catastrophic wildfire at least until treatments to prepare the site for reforestation dispose of much of this biomass assuming the funds are available however timber harvesting is not sufficient to addre ss the apparent forest health problem with other treatments eg precommercial thinning and prescribed burning als needed it is unclear whether such treatments could be sufficient to address the fores t health problem without timber harve sting at minimum such an approach would require substantial annual appropriationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98233crs6 darius m adams and richard w haynes the 1980 softwood timber assessment marke t4 model structure projections and policy simulations forest science

ption analysis for 97 forest products paper and diversified companies new york ny morgan stanley co aug 25 1982 p 6it should also be recognized that the risk of catastrophic wildfire has risen over the past few decades and that neither timber harvesting nor eliminating harvesting will sub stantially alter that risk in the near future in severe fire seaso ns burned acreage is still less than 1 of all forested area similarly at the peak of timber harvesting less than 1 of federal forestlands were logged in any year furthermore past timber harvest sites d burn and the sev erity depends at least partly on whether the remaining biomass has been treated thus even with return to peak harve sting levels which seems unlikely and the best possible results following timber har vesting it would be years before the risk of cata strophic wildfire was significantly altered possible economic sequences as with environmental impacts estimating the economic impacts is fraught with uncertainty from national perspective economi c impacts of supply changes can be estimated using the price elasticity of demand n studies of the price elasticity of timber demand exist but indirect evidence the pric elasticity of lumber demand can be used to infer timber demand elasticity lumbe r markets are relatively price inelastic the range of longrun price elasticities for lumbe r markets is generally 04 to 03 regionally with an average of about 035 nationally4 this means that 1 drop in supply would result in 35 rise in prices elasticities for factors of production eg timber are usually lower than the price elasticities of the final product according to economic theor they are the product of the demand elasticity for the final product times the percentage of total costs attributable to that input in 1981 timber costs were 66 of the total cost of lum ber production subsequent developments5 eg technological innovation migh t have altered this estimate it is used with the under standing that sign ificant changes ie timber costs being higher or lower percentage of lumber production costs would alter the results at 66 of to tal costs the price elasticity of timber mand would be 023 035 for lumber demand multiplied by 66 023 if applicable over the long run typically decades for w ood products lumber prices would thus be expected rise by about 4 times as much as wood supplies decline therefore i f eliminating timber harvesting from federal lands reduced total timber supplies by abou t 6 then longrun lumber prices would be expected to rise by about 24 projections of this nature are necessarily speculative and caution should be used in applying suc h estimates to any situation many of the data used in these calculations are longrun national totals or estimates and may well be poor indicators of nearterm or of local or regional consequences thus at the national level over the long term eliminating federal timber harvests may have re latively modest economic impacts however because of the regional concentrations of timberland owne rship and timber inventory the local and regional consequences could be substantial because federal timberlands are more than 60 of rocky mountain timberlands and more than 40 of pacifi c coast timberlands see table 1 the impacts are likely to be concentrated in those regions
