foster care funding the federal foster care and adoption ssistance programs are authorized under title ive of the social secu rity act and are funded on an openended entitlement basis each year the administration estima tes how much money will be necessary to reimburse states for the federal share of the eligible foster care and adoption assistance costs they incur under current law and congress ty pically provides this level of funding as part of its annual appropria tions process ultimately however the amount of funding provided for fost er care and adoption assistance under the title ive program must match the amount of eligible claims ma by states under the program this means that if the funds initially appr opriated are not sufficient to pay all the eligible title ive claims submitted by the states then congress is obligated by statute to appr opriate more funds to allow these payments to be made alternatively if cong ress appropriates funds above the level ultimately needed to pay the eligible claims sub mitted by states these excess funds are returned to the treasury for example of the title ive funds appropriated for fy2007 86 million lapsed and were returned to the federal treasury adoption assistance for fy2009 the administration requested 2286 billion in title ive adoption assistance funding of which 2283 billion is estimated as necessary to reimburse state claims under current law the additional 3 million is requested to support the administration s legislative proposal related to adoption assistance see discussion of the presidents title ive legislative pr oposals below the senate appropriations committee recommends 2283 billion which represents full funding of the presiden ts adoption assistance request under current law s 3230 srept 110410 the fy2009 funding sought for adopti on assistance under current law is 127 million more than the amount appropriated by congress for the program last year nearly all of this increase reflects the administrations assumption that the number of adopted children receiving monthly doption subsidies supported by title ive will continue to grow and that on average the amount of these subsidies per child will also increase at rate roughly equal to inflation during fy2009 the administration estimates that the averag monthly number of children receiving federally supported adopti on subsidies will be r oughly 430400 compared to approximately 390200 children in fy2007 the mo st recent year data are available and 228300 in fy20005 the request also reflects recent growth in excess of inflation in administrative costs associat ed with the title ive adoption assistance program the administration notes this increase in adoption assistance administrative costs is recent trend wh ich it seeks to both understand and reverse6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34121crs6 7 for fy2009 the congressional b udget office cbo estimates greater federal foster care budget authority4685 billion would be

represents full f unding of the presidents foster care request under current law s 3230 srept 110410 the fy2009 funding sought for foster care under current law is 132 million less than the amount appropriated by cong ress for the program last year this reduction is based on the administrations assumpti on included in its fy2009 funding request that the number of child ren in foster care receiving monthly maintenance payments supported by title ive will conti nue to decline and that on average the amount of these payments per child will decline in real dollars ie increase by less than the rate of infl ation during fy2009 the administration estimates that the average monthly number of children receiving federally supported foster care maintenance payments will be roughly 203200 compared to approximately 211900 children in fy2007 most recent year data are available and 289000 in fy20007 the amount of foster care funding request ed would have been even less without certain assumptions made by the administration regarding increased administrative costs specifically the administration projected increased federal title ive spending of 76 million in fy2009 because of recently finalized or proposed regulations within this amount the recently finalized rule to imp lement the national youth in transition database nytd is assumed to result in additional federal costs

title ive foster care program to impleme nt this option in fy2009 but asserts that over five years it would be close to cost neutral to the title ive program12 at the same time it estimates that

the administration furt her proposes to make fy2007 the benchmark year in which all adoption incentive base lines would be established under this proposal state that achieve d higher number of adoptions in given category in fy2008 or later year may be eligible for an incentive award finally the administration would require that all incentive funds be spent on purposes of finalizing adoptions or other permanency options current law permits states to spend these award funds on any purpose pe rmitted under title ivb or title ive16 according to the administration the increase proposed for award amounts is made in recognition of the fact that states will have to invest additional resources and devote greater efforts in achieving doptions for the more challenging children who are waiting for adoptions for older ch ildren and special needs children further inflation has eroded the values of the original award structure which was established twelve years ago17 finally with regard to the propos ed change in baseline it asserts that the proposed level will set goals fo r increasing adoptions that better reflect recent changes in the child welfare populati on and ensure those goals are within states reach so there is true fi scal incentive to increasing adoptions18 both hr 6307 fostering connections for success introduced by representative mcdermott and s 3038

budget request however congress has not considered legislation to enact this proposal instead in fy2008 it increased funding for these programs the sena appropriations committee would again provide separate and increased ppropriations for programs in fy2009 recommending 25 million for the childrens advocacy program including related training and technical assistance 15 million for the court

fy2009 budget in brief p 64selected proposals with potential child welfare funding effects states may derive significant funding of child welfare services from federal programs other than those dedicated to child welfare chief among these are temporary assistance for needy families tanf the social service block grant ssbg and medicaid28 for fy2005 the most recent da ta available states reported spending 773 million of their ssbg funds i ncluding funds transferred to ssbg from tanf for child welfare purposes29 the administrations fy2009 budget proposes to decrease ssbg funding by 500 million from 17 billion to 12 billion in fy2009 and it would eliminate the block grant entirely in fy2010 congress has not acted on this proposal to reduce ssbg funding and the senate appropriations committee would provide 17 billion for ssbg in fy2009 the proposed phase out of ssbg is project ed by the administration to result in increased federal title ive spendi ng of 176 million over five years fy2009 fy201330 many children served with ssbg funds are presumably not eligible for title ive funding and thus this increas in federal spending under the title ive program would presumably not cover all of the loss of federal child welfare funds that might be expected from this proposal the administrations fy2009 budget assumes an effect ie increased federal spending on title ive foster care spending due to the recently finalized rule on medicaids targeted case ma nagement tcm option dis cussed above as is true with the ssbg proposal however not all children who may be r eceiving tcm benefits via state child welfare agency would be eligible for title ive so this assumed increase in federal t itle ive support is not expected to replace all of the current state child welfare agency tcm spending congress has enacted moratorium on implementation of the tcm rule until april 2009 but that moratorium specifically permits certain parts of the rule related to some foster care costs to be implemented see s ection 7001a3b of pl 110252 finally the fy2009 budget documents do not assume any cost to the title ive program related to separate rule that would clarify the meaning of the rehabilitative services option under the medicaid program31 child welfare advocates and administrators have ex pressed concern that the proposed rule which among other things would specifically exclude medicaid claims under this option for the provision of therapeutic foster care would impact state child welfare agency budgets pl 110252 section 7001a2 ex tends previous moratorium on

substance b see table note c each year the appropriations for title ive foster care and adoption assistance include an advance amount to permit hhs to make payments for the first quarter of the next year for purposes of annual comparison the full amount appropriated including advance amounts is described as part of funding made available each year d in its fy2007 budget the administration initially requested 4757 billion for the foster care program and 2044 billion for the adoptio n assistance program assuming current law at that time these are the amounts that are comparable to the funding levels shown in the table for fy2005 and fy2006 the fy2007 appropriation amount shown is different then the initial fy2007 request because the appropriation amount was finalized in february 2007 pl 1107 and is based on the amount of funds acf expected it would need as of that month which was less then the amounts earlier requested the amount shown in the presidents request column includes 14 million in funding related to legislative proposals for payment of title ive foster care claims under current law the administration requests 4449 billion and this is the amount recomme nded by the senate appropriations committee f the amount shown in the presidents request column includes 3 million in funding related to legislative proposal for payment of title ive adoption assistance under current law the administration requests 2283 billion and this is the amount recommend ed by the senate appropriations committee g funding provided for this program is often stipulated in appropriations statute as available for awards in more than one year h although reduced from the presidents initial request the amount appropriated for doption incentives in fy2008 coupled with funds still available from the fy2007 appropriation for this account is now expected to be sufficient to make fu ll adoption bonus awards to the states i includes funds proposed or appropriated for home visitation initiative j program also authorizes 1 setaside of appropriated funds for allotment to tribes and migrant programs k neither pl 110161 nor the joint explanatory statement accounting the bill hr 2764 that became that law indicate how funds are to be divided betw een the infant and special needs adoption awareness components of the program the division shown here is based on share of total program funding provided to each component by hhs l program authority for these grants is included in capta but annual funding is setaside out of the crime victims fund as provided by the victims of crime act pl 98473 as amended m as was the case in its fy2008 budget the administration did not request specific amounts of funding for these programs in its fy2009 budget instead it stated that the programs may be funded out of its proposed new child safety and juvenile justice program
