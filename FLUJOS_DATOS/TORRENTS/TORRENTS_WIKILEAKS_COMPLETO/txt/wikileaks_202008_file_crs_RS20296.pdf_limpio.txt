volunteers mileage reimbursement pamela j jackson specialist in public finance government and finance division summary in the 110th congress several bills s 403 s 1220 hr 606 and h r 2020 include proposals to alter the mileage deduc tion allowed for charitable purposes many proposals would allow nonprofit organizations to reimburse volunteers without income tax consequences for mileage driven for ch aritable purposes up to the business mileage rate set at 485 cents per mile for 2007 the taxpayer is precluded from taking charitable deduction if heshe is reimbursed by the nonprof it entity current law allows nontaxable reimbursements by charities up to the charitable mileage rate of 14 cents per mile the primary arguments in favor of the tax law change include tax simplification for both charities and volunteers and the incentive effect encouraging volunteers to use their automobiles in performing charitable rvices especially in those cases where volunteers claim the standard duction it is also argued that the provision shows the governments support for and willingness to help in financing socially desirable activities the primary arguments voiced by opponents are that the provision may be abused that some volunteers may be ove rcompensated for automobilerelated expenditures and that the adoption of th proposals will reduce federal tax revenues in all cases the taxpayer receives greater monetary benefit from reimbursement than from the deduction whether at the 14 or 485 cents per mile rate this report will be update d as legislation progre sses through the congress current law charitable contributions made by i ndividuals to charitable organizations1 are deductible from income for those taxpayers who itemize deductions charitablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20296crs2 2 internal revenue code 170 does not specifically state that charitable contributions are limited to money or property thus while congress has not clearly stated that contributions of time or services are not to be allowable as deductions ne ither has it affirmed that they are however since 1920 the treasury department has ruled cons istently that there was deduction available for the value of services rendered the courts have upheld the treasury departments position 3 congress first set deductible 12 cents per mile rate as part of the deficit reduction act of 1984 pl 98369 the rate was raised to 14 cents per mile under provision contained in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 4 the mileage rates were 29 cents per mile for the sevenday period of august 25 to august 31 2005 and 34 cents per mile from september 1 until the end of 2005 5 section 111 of the bill would have enacted new section 139a of the internal revenue code 6 the business mileage rate was 405 cents for most of tax year 2005 it was set at 485 cents for the last four months of that yeardeduction is available for the value of any services rendered by volunteers2 however volunteers are permitted to deduct their out of pocket expenses incurred in providing donated services when those expenses are not reimbursed as one example when volunteer uses hi s or her passenger au tomobile including vans pickups and pane l trucks for charitable purposes standard charitable mileage rate deduction of 14 cents per mile is provided under law3 alternatively the taxpayer may deduct actual outofpocket expens in either case the volunteer is allowed to deduct other directly related expend itures such as parking fees and tolls however if the taxpayer uses the standard deduction inco tax deduction for ch aritable contributions is currently available there are income tax consequences when the volunteer is reimbursed by charitable organization so long as the reimbursement does not exceed 14 cents per mile reimburseme nts above the 14 cents standard mileage expense rate are included in the taxable income of the volunteer special rules were included in the katr ina emergency tax relief act of 2005 pl 10973 for taxpayers who use their persona l vehicle for charitable work related to hurricane katrina the standard mileage ra for hurricane katrina charity work was increased to 70 of the standard business mileage rate in the case of reimbursements for the use of volunteers passenger automobile us ed in katrina relief efforts the exclusion applied up to the standard business mileage ra at that time the rate was 485 cents per mile both of these provisions were ffective for the period august 25 2005 through december 31 20064 taxpayers making use of th provisions were required to substantiate that expenses were incurred in providing relief related to hurricane katrina substantiation typically included written record of the date of service the number of miles driven the names of charitable organi zations served the locations where the services were provided nd the charitable purposes proposals for change in the 109th congress title iii of s 6 the care act of 2005 included provision5 that would have allowed charitable entities to reimburse volunteers for automotive expenses up to the optional standard mileage allowance permitted for businesses6 under this proposal such reimbursements would not be included in the income of the volunteerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20296crs3 7 specifically hr 606 the volunteer emerge ncy responder fair mileage act of 2007 proposes to exclude from the gross income of voluntee r firefighters and emergency medical responders reimbursements of automobile operating expenses incurred for the benefit of volunteer fire department and to allow such volunteers to duct such automobile operating expenses using the higher business mileage rate instead of the standard charitable rate to the extent of reimbursements other deduction or credit woul d be allowable with regard to those same automotive expenses if passed into law the provision would have been effective for tax years beginning after the date of enactment likewise s 315 proposed this same tax treatme nt for reimbursed amounts paid to volunteers by charitable organizations in the 110th congress legislation hr 2419 hr 1827 includes measures to provide that reimbursements for costs of using passenger automobiles for charitable purposes are excluded from income the reimbursements are allowed only if they are limited to the amount of the standard busin ess mileage rate hr 606 proposes similar measures7 related to these reimbursable proposal s are proposals which call for higher charitable contribution mileage deduction that rate has not been increased since 1997 in the 110th congress s 403 s 1220 and hr 2020 propose to equalize the standard mileage rate for charitable purposes with that for business purposes this equalization was enacted temporarily in 2005 in response to hurricane relief efforts in the gulf region discussion the rationale of current law for the lower mileage allowance applicable for charitable purposes is that only directly attributable automotive expenses should be deductible therefore portion of the costs for general maintenance or repair of the automobile depreciation or other costs such as insurance state or local tags or registration fees are includable in the current charitable standard mileage allowance such costs are included and account for the hi gher mileage rate for business purposes the reasoning underlying the provision is th at these indirect co sts are not incurred primarily to provide charitabl services and ther efore should not be reflected in the standard rate for charitable purposes in support of the proposed provision to allow reimbursements greater than the charitable contribution mileage rate proponents argue that when charitable organizations make reimbursements greater than 14 cents per mile and up to the business mileage rate allowing full exclusion would simplify return filing for both the charitable organization information returns and the volunteers income tax returns who receive reimbursements it is asserted that the pr ovision would help finance socially desirable activity and that without charitable incentives the federal government would be pressured to assume some activ ities now provided by charities further proponents maintain that the provision could reduce the compliance problems faced by the internal revenue service for whom it is not cost effective to audit taxpayers when only small dollar amounts are involvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20296crs4 8 us congress joint committee on taxation estimated budget effects of title xii of hr 2419 the heartland habitat harvest and horticulture act of 2007 jcx308 110th cong 2nd sess washington gpo 2008 p 7 9 first the deductions current value is the ta xpayers marginal tax rate multiplied by 14 cents per mile for example in 2005 married taxpaye r filing joint return with income between 59400 and 119950 has marginal tax bracket of 25 the value of the deduction for 100 miles of charitable travel not related to hurricane katrina would be 350 14 x 1001400 x 25 under current law if the taxpayer were reimbursed for such travel at 14 cents per mile rate the value would be 14 the maximum reimbursement under the proposal for 100 mile trip would be 4850in the case of proposals to increase th charitable contribution mileage deduction it has been noted that the statutory rate has not been increased since 1997 while automotive costs have risen substantially it is often expressed that the increase would encourage charitable activity the primary arguments against the proposed changes are that it may be abused may overcompensate volunteers for th eir automobile related expenditures and that the provision will reduce federal revenues the joint committee on taxation estimated that adoption of the reimbursement provision would result in the loss of 2 million over the fiveyear fiscal period from 2008 2012 and 4 million over the period 200820178 perhaps an unintended result of the gislation is that volunteers may request reimbursement rather than seeking an inco tax deduction in all cases the taxpayer would receive greater monetary benefit from reimbursement9 if the reimbursement provision is enacted into law it may be argued that the charitable standard mileage deduction rate should be raised to the business mileage rate to provide if not equality balance
