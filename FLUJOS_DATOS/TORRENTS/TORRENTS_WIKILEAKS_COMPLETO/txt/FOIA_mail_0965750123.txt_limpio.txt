from s fred singer singersepporg to raymond s bradley rbradleygeoumassedu subject reyour msg about climateenergy policy date tue 08 aug 2000 115523 0400 cc mannvirginiaedu pjm8xrootboynhescom xfloweddear ray you sent this oped letter to editor about the need to convert the us from carbonbased economy to hydrogenbased economy i cant guess why you wanted to know your views but it does help to better understand what motivates your scientific work and judgment it also throws some doubt about your impartiality in promoting the hockey stick temperature curve that number of us have been critical of in any case i doubt if espousal of this energy policy will help bp and arco discover source of hydrogen somewhere you quote the progressive business council approvingly we accept the views of most scientists that enough is known about the science and environmental impacts of climate change for us to take actions to address its consequences and from bp chairman the time to consider the policy dimensions of policy change is not when the link between greenhouse gases and climate change is conclusively proven but when the possibility cannot be discounted and is taken seriously by the society of which we are part i note that bp and arco are still out there exploring for oil they dont seem to be quite ready yet to put real money where their mouth is you call for the us to take leadership in stabilizing the climate perhaps the government will turn to you to learn how to do this far less ambitious goal would be to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of co2 according to the ipcc this would require an emission reduction of 60 to 80 percent with respect to 1990 worldwide have you ever considered the consequences of such policy assuming it could really be adopted best wishes fred at 1034 am 8100 0400 you wrote washington dc in august 1997 few months before the kyoto conference on climate change the global climate coalition gcc helped launch massive advertising campaign designed to prevent the united states from endorsing any meaningful agreement to reduce global carbon emissions this group included in its ranks some of the worlds most powerful corporations and trade associations involved with fossil fuels the campaign effectively undermined public support of us efforts to lead the international effort to stabilize climate while the public image of the gcc was that of unified group there was dissent john browne chairman of british petroleum on may 19 1997 announced that the time to consider the policy dimensions of policy change is not when the link between greenhouse gases and climate change is conclusively proven but when the possibility cannot be discounted and is taken seriously by the society of which we are part we in bp have reached that point bp withdrew from the global climate coalition dupont had already left the following year royal dutch shell left in 1999 ford withdrew from the gcc company spokesman noted over the course of time membership in the global climate coalition has become something of an impediment for ford motor company to achieving our environmental objectives in rapid succession in the early months of 2000 daimler chrysler texaco and general motors announced that they too were leaving the coalition this accelerating exodus reflected the conflict emerging within gcc ranks between firms that were clinging to the past and those that were planning for the future some of the exiting companies such as bp amoco shell and dupont joined progressive new group the business environmental leadership council which says we accept the views of most scientists that enough is known about the science and environmental impacts of climate change for us to take actions to address its consequences membership requires companies to have programs for reducing carbon emissions bp amoco for example plans to bring its carbon emissions to 10 percent below its 1990 level by 2010 exceeding the kyoto goal of roughly 5 percent for industrial countries dupont has already cut its 1990 greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent and plans to reduce them by 65 percent by 2010 there is growing acceptance among the key energy players that the world is in the early stages of the transition from carbonbased to hydrogenbased energy economy in february 1999 arco ceo michael bowlin said weve embarked on the beginning of the last days of the age of oil he then discussed the need to convert our carbonbased energy economy into hydrogenbased energy economy with the organization that so effectively undermined us leadership in kyoto longer dominant player in the global climate debate the stage is set for the united states to resume leadership of the global climate stabilization effort raymond s bradley professor and head of
