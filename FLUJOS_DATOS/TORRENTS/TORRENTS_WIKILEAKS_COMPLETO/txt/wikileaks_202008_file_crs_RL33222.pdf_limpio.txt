provided nearly 3 billion in grants annually to israel over the years israel has developed an advanced industrial economy which according to the world bank places it among the top 50 richest nations in terms of per capita income between cyprus and slovenia respectively with israel becoming more economically selfsufficient former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu told joint session of congress in 1996 that israels need for economic aid would be reduce d over time in 1998 israel proposed gradually eliminating the 12 billion economic aid and increasing the 18 billion in military aid by 60 million per year over 10year period beginning in the year 2000 subsequent appropriations for israel included cuts of approximately 120 million in economic aid and increases of 60 million in military aid each fiscal year strong congressional support for israel has resulted in israels receiving benefits that may not be available to other countries for example israel can use us military assistance both for research and development in the united states and for military purchases from israeli manufacturers in addition all us foreign assistance earmarked for israel is delivered in the first 30 days of the fiscal year most other recipients normally receive their aid in installments congress also appropriates funds for joint usisraeli missile defense programs in august 2007 the bush

for decades the united states and israel have maintained strong bilateral relations based on number of factors including strong domestic us support for israel shared strategic goals in the middle east concern over iran syria islamic extremism shared democratic values and historic ties dating back to us support for the creation of israel in 1948 us economic and military aid has been major component in cementing and reinforcing these ties although there have been occasional differences over israels settlements in the west bank and gaza strip prior to the 2005 disengagement and israeli arms sales to china successive administrations and many lawmakers have long considered israel to be reliable partner in the region and us aid packages for israel have reflected this sentiment us military aid has helped transform israels armed forces into one of the most technologically sophisticated militaries in the world us military aid for israel has been designed to maintain israels qualitative edge over neighboring militaries since israel must rely on better equipment and training to compensate for manpower deficit in any potential regional conflict us military aid portion of which may be spent on procurement from israeli defense companies also has helped israel to build domestic defense industry which ranks as one of the top ten suppliers of arms worldwide for many years us economic aid helped subsidize lackluster israeli economy though since the rapid expansion of israels hitech sector in the 1990s sparked partially by usisraeli scientific cooperation israel is now considered fully industrialized nation with an economy on par with some western european countries consequently israel and the united states agreed to gradually phase out grant economic aid to israel in fy2008 israel will longer receive bilateral economic support fund esf grants it had been largescale recipient of grant esf assistance since 1971 the use of foreign aid to help accelerate the middle east peace process has had mixed results the promise of us assistance to israel and egypt during peace negotiations in the late 1970s enabled both countries to take the risks needed for peace and may have helped convince them that the united states was committed to supporting their peace efforts promoting israelipalestinian peace has proven to be far greater challenge for us policy makers as most analysts consider foreign aid to be tangential in solving complex territorial issues and overcoming deeply rooted mistrust sown over decades critics of us aid policy particularly some in the middle east argue that us foreign aid exacerbates tensions in the region many arab commentators insist that us assistance to israel indirectly causes suffering to palestinians by supporting israeli arms purchases in the past the united states reduced loan guarantees to israel in opposition to continued settlement building but it has not acted to cut israels military or economic grant aid

the second largest recipient of us aid in the middle east will receive corresponding increase in us military assistance over the same tenyear period military analysts speculate that the increase in us assistance will facilitate potential israeli purchases of the most sophisticated us equipment including possible sale of the f35 joint strike fighter jsf2 under the terms of the agreement israel will still be able to spend 26 of us assistance on israelimanufactured equipment according to under secretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns who signed the memorandum of understanding on us military assistance we consider this 30 billion dollars in assistance to israel to be an investment in peace in longterm peace peace will not be made without strength peace will not be made without israel being strong in the future of course our objective as country and our specific objective as government is to contribute to that peace peace between israel and the palestinian people the creation of an independent palestinian state willing to live side by side in peace with israel and general peace in the region that has eluded the israeli people for 59 years but which is we hope the destiny of the israeli people as well as the arab peoples of the region our policy in this entire region is dedicated to that final objective 3 the administration timed the announcement of the new tenyear aid agreement to coincide with separate deal to sell additional sophisticated weaponry to saudi arabia and other gulf countries since then us officials have repeatedly stressed that us policy toward israel is based on maintaining israels qualitative military edge over its arab neighbors nevertheless there is some concern in congress over the possible sale to saudi arabia of precisionguided joint direct attack munitions jdam which were sold to israel in 2007 israel historically has opposed us arms sales to saudi arabia however israeli prime minister ehud olmert expressed some support for the saudi arms deal when he remarked in july 2007 we understand the need of the united states to support the arab moderate states and there is need for united front between the us and us regarding iran 1 during negotiations over the new aid agreement israel had wanted larger portion of fmf up front the administration insisted however that because there was lim ited additional funding in the foreign aid budget for large increases in military assistance the united states lacked the fi scal flexibility to dramatically increase israels aid all at once ultimately the administrations incremental approach won out 2 in october 2007 the jerusalem post reported that the united states had agreed to supply the f35 joint strike fighter to israel as early as 2012 according to one
