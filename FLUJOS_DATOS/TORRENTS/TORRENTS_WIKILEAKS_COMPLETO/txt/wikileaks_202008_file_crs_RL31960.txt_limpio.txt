vaccinate military personnel and frontline civilian health workers against smallpox 3 months after the vaccination program officially began and 7 weeks after senator gregg introduced the administration smallpox vaccine injury compensation proposal president george w bush on april 30 2003 signed the smallpox emergency personnel protection act of 2003 pl 10820 compensation had emerged as major obstacle to the implementation of the administrations smallpox vaccination program soon after it began the number of workers volunteering for vaccination was far smaller than the white house had anticipated one frequently cited reason was the concern of health workers that they would not be compensated if they experienced adverse reactions to the vaccine under the administrations original plan vaccinees who suffered adverse consequences and sought redress had two options apply to their states workers compensation program or sue the federal government for negligence some members from across the political spectrum favored responding with legislation while they differed on what should be in that legislation there was bipartisan agreement that given the presidents request that health and safety workers volunteer for vaccination the federal government should guarantee to protect them against the possible adverse effects of smallpox vaccination some legislators articulated twofold rationale it is right to protect volunteers and to recruit those volunteers it is necessary this report first presents the reasons some members of congress health care worker organizations and others felt legislation was necessary summarizes the range of approaches that congress considered and describes the smallpox vaccine injury compensation provisions congress actually passed finally it presents issues that congress might consider if it revisits the new legislation need for legislation on december 13 2002 president bush announced his decision to vaccinate military personnel and frontline civilian health workers against smallpox the department of defense began the process in early january 2003 and as of march 31 crs2 2003 has vaccinated over 350000 military personnel1 the civilian program which is voluntary in contrast to the military program did not begin until january 24 2003 to coincide with the start of liability protections provided by congress in the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 to smallpox vaccine manufacturers and the institutions and individuals who administer the vaccine the president had hoped to vaccinate 500000 civilians but by june 6 2003 only 37478 civilians had been immunized2 to explain the reluctance of many health workers to volunteer to be vaccinated many including senator gregg3 pointed to the absence of compensation program for people who are injured by the vaccine until the mid1970s when the world health organization announced the eradication of naturally occurring smallpox it was accepted that in the face of endemic infection the side effects of the smallpox vaccine4 are dwarfed by the benefits of immunization it is difficult for some however to accept the risks of vaccineassociated illness and death when the risk of infection is perceived as theoretical the president backed by many health and defense experts sought an immunized core of firstresponder and publichealth personnel as public good allowing treatment and vaccination of larger groups should smallpox infections appear at the same time many public health officials infectious disease experts lawyers and health care personnel unions noted the need for compensation mechanism the administration has said that it expected workers compensation programs to cover claims for the rare but anticipated side effects of the smallpox vaccinations5 soon however people noticed gaps in this approach other than the program that covers federal workers workers compensation in the united states is handled at the state level scopeofemployment and lineofduty definitions differ as do rules of eligibility coverage and benefits in general courts have found that workers compensation is available for injuries resulting from employmentrelated vaccination6 however not all employees are covered by workers compensation 1 assistant secretary of defense dod smallpox vaccination program as of mar 31 2003 link at cdc website httpwwwcdcgovodocmediasmpxrprthtm

cover the worker and not an individual whom the worker because of the workers injury injures this latter is concern in planning for smallpox compensation because of the potential for secondary transmission of vaccinerelated infection to contacts of those vaccinated furthermore even for workers who do qualify for workers compensation the lost income benefit of most of these programs is twothirds of income up to yearly cap employers are the primary contributors to workers compensation funds and would be acquiring new burden if called upon to cover smallpox vaccine injuries7 some suggested that the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 provided access to compensation through the federal tort claims act but it addresses only injuries associated with negligence although necessary in certain circumstances this coverage is not suitable for the injuries anticipated from the nonnegligent administration of vaccine8 components suggested for legislation month after the president announced the vaccination program and 1 week before the liability protection provisions from the homeland security act were to begin the institute of medicine of the national academies issued letter report9 in response to questions from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the expert committee made two compensationrelated recommendations that cdc and its state and local public health partners immediately work to clarify each states workers compensation programs position on coverage for smallpox vaccinerelated injuries and illnesses for workers covered under their programs that cdc and the department of health and human services support all efforts some of which might be administratively or legislatively bold and creative to bring this issue of compensation for smallpox vaccine adverse reactions including those reactions that occur despite nonnegligent manufacture and administration of the vaccine to speedy resolution p 9 6 continued

the american public health association apha and the national association of county and city health officials issued joint press release urging congress to create national program to protect individuals or their survivors from the costs of illness disability and death associated with vaccine injury10 in march 2003 press release apha specified the need for compensation of medical costs lost wages nofault system that could provide quick compensation health insurance and the more basic assurance that health care would be available to those without health insurance or with inadequate coverage11 in oral and written testimony to the senate health education labor and pensions help committee and in press releases representatives of employee unions suggested numerous components for congress to consider in creating smallpox vaccine injury compensation program12 some items appeared on many lists some remained the focus of one speaker one set of points involved vaccine policy not explicitly related to injury compensation policy yet the recommendations fit within discussion of compensation these included free confidential prevaccination screening for contraindications consistent prevaccination education freedom to decline vaccine without employment discrimination access to free medical treatment availability of countermeasures such as vaccinia immune globulin often referred to as vig to vaccine effects safe needle use liability protection of vaccinee for injury of patients need for active and ongoing surveillance and reporting and sufficient federal funding to

seiu jan 8 2003 crs5 beyond the testimony taken by the senate help committee several existing compensation programs appear to have provided models for legislation existing federal compensation programs in addition to relying on workers compensation and traditional health insurance policies congress has devised several national programs to meet unique compensation needs in particular sets of circumstances usually involving the concept of nofault these programs have defined benefits funding structures and eligibility rules two the public safety officers benefits psob program and the national vaccine injury compensation nvicp program are particularly relevant because they appear as model structures for the smallpox vaccine compensation injury proposals public safety officers benefits program administered by the bureau of justice assistance in the department of justice the psob program provides onetime payments to survivors of public safety officers who are killed and to officers who are permanently and completely disabled in the line of duty13 the administration based its proposal on this structure the public safety officers benefits act pl 94430 initially covered state and local law enforcement officers and firefighters subsequently congress added federal law enforcement officers and firefighters members of federal state and local public rescue squads and ambulance crews federal emergency management agency personnel and state local and tribal emergency management and civil defense agency employees14 at its 1976 inception psob provided only death benefit in 1990 the program added the permanent total disability benefit15 the act established the payment level at 50000 in 1976 in 1988 the benefit level was changed to 100000 pegged to increases in the consumer price index 42 usc 3796 the total benefit payment for either death or permanent total disability allowed in 2003 is 262100 benefits are reduced for individuals receiving certain other death or disability benefits certain benefit programs reduce benefits if psob payment is received psob benefits are not subject to federal income or estate taxes16 the psob death benefit program was designed to offer peace of mind to men and women seeking careers in public safety and to make strong statement about the value american society places on the contributions of those who serve their 13

in potentially dangerous circumstances17 congress in keeping with that intent established the psob benefit as supplement rather than as an insurance or compensation program psob manages claims administratively rather than within legal framework because the program does not include lostincome benefits or longterm survivor support it need not debate questions such as projected earnings or other claims that might require review and appeal procedures although the smallpox vaccine compensation program in pl 10820 is based on the psob structure the smallpox vaccine injury compensation program does include longer term medical and lost income benefits and therefore will require different structure to efficiently accommodate the complex determination of the possible range of claims following smallpox vaccine injuries national vaccine injury compensation program in response to public concerns about vaccine safety and manufacturer concern about liability congress enacted the national childhood vaccine injury act ncvia of 1986 pl 9966018 core piece of that act is the national vaccine injury compensation program vicp begun in 1988 to handle vaccine injury claims in nofault nonadversarial and consequently more streamlined manner vicp covers the vaccines that cdc through the national vaccine program and the advisory committee on immunization practices recommends for routine administration to all children in the united states although located in the health resources and service administration hrsa of the department of health and human services hhs vicp administration is actually shared among hhs the us court of federal claims and the us department of justice19 proposal for smallpox vaccine injury compensation introduced as hr 865 by representative waxman based its plan on the vicp the basic tool of the vicp is its table of injuries for each covered vaccine the table lists each specific injury and the time period relative to vaccination during which that injury must have occurred in order to be considered for compensation if person presents claim that corresponds to listed vaccine injury time period item vicp is to assume that that persons injury was caused by that vaccination in theory this streamlines the entire claims process claims involving other injuries from listed vaccines or any injury from other vaccines require proof that the vaccine aggravated or caused the condition for vaccinerelated injury vicp allows reasonable compensation for past and future unreimbursable medical custodial care and rehabilitation costs actual and projected pain and suffering and emotional distress capped at 250000 lost earnings and reasonable attorneys fees and costs for vaccinerelated death vicp awards 250000 to the estate of the deceased and

authorized the use of federal tax dollars for compensation awarded for vaccination that occurred before the program began and authorized an excise tax on every dose of covered vaccine to cover

adversarial process the us court of federal claims handles its claims the programs extensive experience gained over its 15year existence is concentrated on compensation for injuries incurred by children how well it could adapt to the adjudication of adultfocused compensation issues such as temporary lost income or dependent survivors is not clear others standard government programs of compensation include benefits to service disabled veterans and workers injured on the job occasionally congress acts to ensure compensation for specific groups of people or their survivors in specific circumstances of death injury or medical condition examples include the programs instituted to compensate individuals seen as having been injured by the swine flu vaccinations in 197622 veterans of

senate s 719 senator gregg initially offered the smallpox compensation provisions as title i of s 15 bill that also included the administrations proposal for project bioshield and changes to vicp faced with senator kennedys intention to offer 75 amendments to the smallpox compensation title28 help committee chairman gregg deleted title i at the markup on march 11 2003 and used it as the basis of s 71929 s 719 proposed compensation program to cover people health care and other workers who volunteered with smallpox vaccinerelated injury subsequent to vaccination or contact with vaccinated person in response to the hhs secretarys declaration of need it included timeframe for claims assigned regulatory and administrative responsibility to the hhs secretary allowed judicial review of the secretarys decisions excluded medicareeligible people from the medical care benefit and made benefits secondary to most other coverage benefits categories under s 719 included medical lost employment income and death and permanent total disability the medical benefit covered medical items and services as reasonable and necessary to treat covered injury compensation for lost employment income would be twothirds of lost income for person with dependents and 75 otherwise the proposed total lifetime benefit for lost employment income was 50000 the coverage would not cover the first five lost work

committee markedup s 719 on april 2 2003 the version it ordered reported included an amendment offered by senator mikulski to authorize the secretary of hhs to award grants to states to administer the smallpox vaccine and provide related education screening and medical surveillance of vaccinees the committeeapproved bill did not include three amendments that senator kennedy offered one covered elements of medical care disability and lost income benefits the amendment 1 would have specified that covered medical care include such services as rehabilitation special education custodial care and special equipment and 2 would have struck the provision in s 719 that excludes medicareeligible people from any smallpox vaccine compensation medical benefit senator kennedys amendment also introduced new categories that would qualify for disability benefits permanent disfigurement and permanent partial disability for lost employment income compensation senator kennedy would have 1 maintained the committee bills twothird or threequarter lost income benefit but calculated the base income taking into account future earnings especially significant to child injured by the smallpox vaccine 2 modified the restriction on receiving death benefits and lost income benefits by allowing the lost income benefit to continue for the life of the spouse or until minor children reach the age of 22 and 3 increased the lifetime cap from 50000 to 75000 senator kennedys second amendment would have allowed the secretary flexibility in applying the 180day window in which to receive the vaccine and be eligible for benefits in this program his third amendment sought to change the authorizing language of the reported bill into authorizing and appropriating language making the funding mandatory rather than discretionary the senate help committeereported bill was not brought to the senate for vote house hr 1770 hr 1463 and hr 865 representative burr the vicechair of the house energy and commerce committee introduced hr 1463 on march 27 2003 replacing hr 1413 that he had introduced on march 25 2003 both versions closely followed the administration proposal which also formed the basis of s 719 the house republican leadership brought hr 1463 which had not been discussed in committee directly to the house floor on march 31 2003 it lost 184206 84 votes short of the twothirds vote required under suspension of the rules its content however formed the basis of the bill that was enacted into law some house democrats had offered significantly different proposal in hr 865 representative waxmans smallpox vaccine compensation and safety act of 2003 that bill differed from the administration proposal both in its treatment of elements common to it and in its inclusion of elements not mentioned both contain the basic provisions for compensation for the costs of medical care permanent and total disability and death and cover both the vaccinee and individuals infected crs10 following contact with vaccinee30 the major differences involve the mechanism established for adjudication of claims whether the authorized appropriation is mandatory or discretionary and the level of benefits this report includes details of hr 865 because its alternative approach serves to identify issues that may resurface as the new compensation program is implemented hr 865 is patterned after vicp which is structured differently from psob on which the administration program is modeled while requiring the secretary to issue implementation regulations the proposed vicpmodeled program would rely on special masters appointed in the us court of federal claims to hear claims hr 865 would allow for actual rather than percentage of lost wages and does not cap the benefit it would provide paid leave for the first 4 days out of work to cover the period before the lostincome disability benefit begins hr 865 would provide permanent disability benefit of unreimbursed actual lost wages and unreimbursed medical costs not subject to any limitations plus onetime 250000 payment for noneconomic damages hr 865 would award death benefit of 850000 hr 865 would require the secretary to make grants to state and local governments to help meet the costs of their smallpox vaccination activities the bill text specifies that each state agrees to provide such medical assistance as may be medically necessary this differs from the new laws making the secretary responsible for not only the overall program but also all implementation decisions finally hr 865 would mandate appropriations in addition to authorizing them in addition hr 865 would go beyond establishing mechanism to compensate people whom the smallpox vaccine injures hr 865 addresses others concerns outlined by worker groups such as needle safety requirements access to free medical care paid sick leave for up to four days and reimbursement of those costs to non federal employers prohibition against discrimination against an employee who declines or is ineligible for vaccination procedures for filing complaints and judicial review funding to states to cover cost of mandatory state activities in prevaccination education and screening and post vaccination surveillance and treatment and establishment of uniform national reporting system of adverse reactions to the vaccine and report to congress from the secretary of health and human services hr 876 was referred to the energy and commerce committee with further action following negotiation members reached the compromise that representative burr introduced as hr 1770 the smallpox emergency personnel protection act of 2003 on april 11 2003 the full house and then the full senate passed it that day hr 1770 reflected revisions of hr 1463 s 719 ordered reported from the senate 30 bill introduced by senator daschle at the beginning of the 108th congress s 6 includes section titled smallpox injury compensation program and would authorize 750 million in fy 2004 for compensation it does not offer the program details that these others present crs11 help committee selected language that senator kennedy had offered in committee as amendments to s 719 and items raised in negotiations by others president bush signed the smallpox emergency personnel protection act of 2003 on april 30 2003 pl 10820 the smallpox emergency personnel protection act of 2003 the new law addresses injuries incurred from activities of an immunization plan declared by the hhs secretary as national response to threat of biologic agent attack on the united states it covers injuries that the secretary finds to be vaccine related that occur in people who volunteer for vaccination under that plan or people who are infected after contact with those volunteers the new law specifies compensation for three things 1 medical expenses 2 lost employment income due to temporary and permanent partial and total disability and 3 death administrative mechanisms the new compensation program uses the psob program as its base and adapts the structure of that program to address concerns specifically related to smallpox vaccine injuries the secretary of health and human services will establish regulations and will run the compensation program the law permits judicial review of the secretarys actions it also directs the secretary to promulgate and revise when desired vaccine injury table listing specific conditions of presumptive causality meaning that if someone had one of those conditions and had received the vaccine in certain time period the law would presume causal connection in this respect it uses the vicp model the secretary may also consider claims regarding other adverse effects the law directs the secretary to develop process that an individual could use to request reconsideration of the secretarys determination responding to concerns raised by senator kennedy the final version of the legislation gives the secretary flexibility when requiring that claims to this compensation program be made within specific time periods relative to vaccination symptom identification and changes in eligibility this compensation program applies to injuries related to the secretarys declared response plan detailing actions to be taken in preparation for possible smallpoxrelated emergency during the period prior to the identification of an active case of smallpox either within or outside the united states31 civilian participation in that plan must be voluntary screening for contraindications to vaccination must also be voluntary but it must be offered the enacted legislation does not include senator mikulskis amendment that was accepted by the help committee in the 31 42 usc section 239 amended by section 2 of pl 10820 crs12 markup of s 719 although it does direct the secretary to ensure appropriate post inoculation medical surveillance benefit levels medical care pl 10820 directs the hhs secretary to provide payment or reimbursement for medical items and services as reasonable and necessary to treat covered injury of an eligible individual including the services appliances and supplies prescribed or recommended by qualified physician which the secretary considers likely to cure give relief reduce the degree or the period of disability or aid in lessening the amount of monthly compensation section 264 the legislation includes more detailed description of medical items and services than had hr 1463 and s 719 it also does not include the senate bills exclusion of medicareeligible individuals from the new programs payment for medical care it does however maintain the requirement that its benefits be secondary to other federal other government and private payors eg private health insurers state workers compensation programs and medicare lost employment income for lost employment income resulting from the covered injuries of covered person the program would provide subject to certain caps twothirds of the usual employment income which includes income from selfemployment if the person injured had one or more dependents that rate would increase to 75 of usual employment income the law but not the predecessor bills specifies that employment income refers to income at the time of injury as with the medical care benefits to be provided by this program lost employment income benefits are to be secondary to other federal governmental and private programs to provide employmentbased benefits the program will pay lost employment income compensation in addition to payment for covered medical care but survivors cannot receive both lost income and death benefits the lost income compensation begins after 5 missed work days person considered by the program to be permanently and totally disabled could receive up to 50000 per year in lost employment income compensation for disabilities that are temporary or partial the lifetime cap accrued at up to 50000 per year is the amount 262100 in may 2003 set by the psob legislation payments subject to the lifetime cap if appropriate would continue until the injured person reaches age 65 death survivors benefit the smallpox emergency personnel protection act of 2003 pl 10820 provides onetime lumpsum death benefit in the amount specified by the psob program now 262100 any death benefit to survivors would be reduced by the amount that the smallpox vaccine injury compensation program had paid as lost employment income benefits to the deceased neither could this death benefit be in addition to psob disability or death benefit the death crs13 benefit would however be made in addition to any payment or reimbursement for medical care it had made to that person when survivor is minor the legal guardian can choose between receiving lump sum death benefit the amount in may 2003 is 262100 or the calculated amount of lost employment income compensation 75 of actual income at the time of the injury up to 50000 per year until the youngest dependent survivor reaches age 18 appropriations while congress was considering smallpox vaccine injury compensation bills both houses issued their fy 2003 emergency supplemental packages pl 10811 the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act 2003 included 42 million for hrsa to administer the smallpox vaccine injury compensation program in addition to the 100 million it provided through the public health and social services emergency fund to cdc for the smallpox vaccination program32 pl 108 20 authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2003 through 2007 and does not include language appropriating funding in advance of appropriations acts next steps assess in discussing the need for legislation many members and their constituents described the absence of smallpox vaccine injury compensation package as major obstacle to volunteering will the new law make people more likely to volunteer has the end of the war in iraq lessened the sense of urgency that may have compelled the congress to enact pl 10820 an announcement from cdc the week after the bills passage might also influence volunteer recruitment the agency now estimates the nation needs only 50000 immunized public health and health care people to be prepared for smallpox outbreak not the 500000 figure that had been made up by summing the estimates that each state had submitted to cdc in december33 this new target is closer to the 39000 who have already volunteered for vaccination but congress does not know 32 the senate appropriations committee version passed apr 3 2003 included 35 million for smallpox vaccine administration the house appropriations committee had earlier included in its war supplemental bill 50 million that would go for smallpox

clarify regardless of the size of the program the hhs secretary may need to clarify details that the law does not explicitly cover in order to implement the law examples include definitions regulatory treatment of standards of medical evidence and federal tax law the law describes contact case as iii the individual has been in contact with an individual who is or who was accidentally inoculated by covered individual34 what evidence of contact will the secretary require how would an unvaccinated person who nevertheless appears with vaccinia infection demonstrate that for example particular anonymous subway rider was the source of infection because vaccinia infection would come only from vaccinia vaccine source it may not be necessary for compensation determination to show that the person had contact with someone who had received the vaccine knowing the chain of contact would be important however for public health reasons the law gives the hhs secretary authority to create the table of injuries to list injuries presumed by law to be vaccinerelated because the rules and art of causal inference that epidemiologists use do not easily line up with legislative needs to assign responsibility drafters of legislation turn to phrases such as preponderance of the evidence standard taking into consideration of relevant medical and scientific evidence35 or credible evidence for the association is equal to or outweighs the credible evidence against the association36 the scientists language includes an uncertainty that the laws presumptions override whether the new legislation
