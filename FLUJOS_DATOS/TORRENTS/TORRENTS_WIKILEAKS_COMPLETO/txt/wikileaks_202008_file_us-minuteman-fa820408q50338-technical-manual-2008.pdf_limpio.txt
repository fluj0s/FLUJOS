must be replenished if refrigerant is not visible in the liquid eye on the cylinder when the liquid valve is open note the supply tank should be connected with lowloss refrigerant hose which contains an integral shutoff valve at the end connected to the tank close both the liquid and vapor valves on the tank b if the tank is connected with lowloss refrigerant hose with shutoff valve go to step d if the tank is not equipped with such hose close valve v7 note venting of the refrigerant vapor contained in the hose connecting the tank to the test bench is allowable under section 608 of the clean air act however any nonshutofftype refrigerant hoses should be changed to lowloss type hoses to minimize refrigerant venting during future tank replacements c slowly loosen the hose connection on the tank allow the pressure to bleed off before disconnecting the hose d close the shutoff valve at the end of the hose connecting the tank to the test bench remove and replace refrigerant supply tank 533 vacuumpumpservice contaminated oil is the most common cause of poor performance and the contamination is controlled to great extent by gas ballast operationavoid extended operation with the gas ballast valve closed oil can be visually checked by draining small quantity into clean container and inspecting for solid or liquid contaminants periodically and when found to be contaminated the oil must be changed when servicing the vacuum pump also make the following inspections remove the guard figure 51 72 and inspect the belt for wear and adjustment belt should ﬂex about the thick ness of belt with normal thumb pressure midway between pulleys b turn the pump clockwise by hand observe mechanical interference but an increase in required force at angle where discharge occurs if required force indicates cylinder is ﬂooded causing hydraulic lock rock the pump pulley by hand to force the oil out the pump will ﬂood if the vacuum break valve solb 68 fails to open c when pump is operating observe that oil is about midway in sight glass 71 when inlet pressure is low and that oil level changes with large changes in vacuum indications if there are discernible oil level changes oil pas sages within the pump may be obstructed 5331 changing the oil open both drain valves 73 remove the ﬁller plug and oil mist eliminator 69 and remove the drive belt guard after the oil drains turn the pump pulley clockwise few turns by hand to clear all oil from cylinder close the drain valves the oil capacity of the pump is 113 pints or 2113 ounces pour about seven ounces through ﬁller plug hole and the remainder through the hole from which the oil mist eliminator was removed check that ﬁller plug and gasket are clean and in good condition and reinstall plug with gasket and the oil mist eliminator if oil was badly contaminated it may be necessary to ﬂush the pump by changing the oil one or more additional times with short operating period between changesto33d917891 5425332 oil mist
