counterterrorism goi external subject mossad chief to codel corzine some foreign fighters beginning to leave iraq classified by polc ambassador daniel c kurtzer for reasons 14b an d d 1 s summary mossad chief meir dagan told codel corzine march 13 that israeli and us thinking on iran largely tracks adding that he believes the eu dialogue with iran will ultimately fail dagan said that israel has evidence that some foreign fighters have returned home from iraq perhaps indicating that the tide may be starting to turn in the us battle against the insurgency there he worried however that these militants countries of origin in particular saudi arabia lebanon syria and sudan are illequipped to control the returning jihadis who might then pose threat to stability in the region and ultimately to israel end summary iran 2 c senator jon corzine accompanied by senate staff member evan gottesman the ambassador polres and poloff notetaker met with mossad chief meir dagan march 13 acknowledging that there are at times differences in analysis of the facts dagan stressed that it is similarities rather than differences that are at the heart of the goius intelligence relationship particularly on iran the facts themselves are not in dispute dagan continued adding that the us and israeli assessments of irans intentions and plans are largely in accord iran has decided to go nuclear dagan said and nothing will stop it dagan predicted that the eu dialogue with iran will not succeed and that the issue of irans nuclear ambitions would eventually go to the security council iraq foreign fighters heading home 3 s in response to the senators question dagan said that the tide may be starting to turn in iraq with regard to foreign militant activity dagan said israel has evidence that foreign fighters originating from tajikistan uzbekistan syria and yemen have arrived back in their home countries and he assumes that some had returned to saudi arabia as well dagan predicted that as with men who fought in afghanistan during the 80s and 90s these returning militants would stay in touch with each other forming network based on their common experiences in iraq 4 s stressing that israel has assets in iraq other than friendly relationship with the kurds dagan said that israels interest is more in the impact the jihadis from for example jordan and saudi arabia will have once they return to their countries of origin although he predicts egypt and jordan will do all right dagan said he is less confident that governments in saudi arabia lebanon syria and sudan are sufficiently wellequipped to face down the domestic challenge these returning militants will pose the combination of their military training and the absence of strong governments willing and able to confront these men could have devastating impact on israel by causing chaos in their home countries he added dagan predicted that these jihadis will have less of direct impact on palestinians because palestinians are already well aware of militant views and opinions via internet chat rooms furthermore dagan said he feels that most palestinians are not searching for foreign flags such as alqaeda under which to rally because those inclined to do so are already being wellmobilized under existing groups in the west bank and gaza lebanon 5 c dagan opined that hizballah will never make the transition to purely political party in lebanon since the organization remains very dependent on its jihadi orientation noting that even the recent hizaballahsponsored march in beirut has not deterred the lebanese from pressing for full syrian withdrawal dagan advised the us to remain firm in its demand for complete pullout and attributed the willingness of the lebanese people to rise up to us action in iraq essential to use all assets in the fight against terrorism 6 c dagan said it is essential to combine all types of intelligence assets rather than relying exclusively on human intelligence or signal intercepts to counter terrorist threats terrorist organizations have been seeking to obtain wmd as matter of course and unlike countries that wish to acquire these weapons as deterrent nonstate actors would be more inclined to actually use them in dagans opinion asked about the relationship between illicit activities such as narcotic or arms trafficking and terrorism dagan confirmed that terrorist organizations try to fund their activities by criminal means adding that credit card fraud and counterfeiting are also methods favored by these groups weapons originating from yemen and sudan are smuggled into the territories through egypt for sale as well as for use by militants dagan said 7 u codel corzine did not have an opportunity to clear this message visit embassy
