6406c09 shspec22 the cycle of action its interpretation on the emeter the most confused maligned area around is the auditor and the cycle of action it is difficult subject because it is all over the gpms it is not natural you scientologists being cut above the naturalness of normality of course see something slightly wrong in the whole idea of time and its forward progress in his auditing lrh found himself in an interesting state looking at zero or absence of time he found it not wholly pleasant because without time there is lot of other stuff missing he had pressure on the face that turned out to be not from something but from utter nothingness there this was very peculiar it was an escape from the timestream which at the same time was more natural than being in the timestream at one time thetan was quite capable of moving back in time to straighten out goofs then he slipped into the time stream and has been moving along with it ever since you therefore have natural antipathy for the idea that time is there or that something has beginning middle and an end because this cycle is an authoritative action laid down by time but you are processing in the physical universe through and across the agreement of the physical universe you are apparently going along with the timestream and processing bank that lays the timestream in with an axe you are trying to resolve subject the bank that is cycles of action to terrible degree mary baker eddy erred by shooting for too high gradient as long as you are processing through mest you must take account of the cycle of action even though it is not true at the highest levels unless you pay attention to this you jam the bank and the pc will get into horrible difficulties high ta etc the proper precise order of things is very important particularly at lower levels of things especially with regard to the bank the bank is fiendishly precise the pc has to come up through confusion to confront this much order one of the keynotes of order and the bank is that things have beginning continue and have an end there the cycle of action is violated in the pc the order of his bank is violated and therefore it doesnt asis so the road out follows the cycle of action where the auditor has nothing to do with the cycle of action he has trouble because he has thrown the pc below the fiendish demands of the bank we have found empirically that what you have to do is to parallel the cycle of action there is detriment involved in doing so every time you process pc without paying attention to the cycle of action you are processing the pc against the bank as result the bank will jam which will be manifested on the emeter as high ta and badlyacting needle pc who is not running well has first and foremost violated the cycle of action this is broad enough statement to be fairly meaningless unless you get more details you could also say that the reason case isnt living right is that the cycle of action is being violated there are two ways in which cycle of action can be violated in life 1 too slavish an obedience to it where the individual was out of agreement with it in the first place but is forced to follow it 2 ignoring it all the blessings of the machine age lie in the first zone dont follow cycle of action to the extent of overwhelming someones power of choice oddly enough there is one zone where persons power of choice can be overthrown and he can be improved by following cycle of action repeatedly to point where the person is used to it you will then begin to asis enough bank to compensate for the loss of power of choice that you started with which will when return you could force pc through sop 8c against his power of choice but only so long as you repeated the cycle of action it isnt the persons power of choice that gives him reactivity power of choice and selfdeterminism get imprisoned in reactivity cycle of action is the prison so following and running and running out cycle of action will bring about nothing but freeing of power of choice whether the pc consents to it or not you have the determinism of the thetan his power of choice versus the fiendish cycle of action and precision of the bank and this universe the biggest overwhelm and loss of power of choice in this universe is in time this universe is trap because having started here you inevitably get to there that is an overwhelm because there is nothing that you can do about it the thetan knows that wherever he may be in space at 855 in ten minutes he will be at 905 matter how much he protests you can do something about being moved in space so space is less overwhelming hence movement in space from point to point b is smaller gradient you can approximate the action of time with the cycle of action progress through time is paralleled by the cycle of action it is very close to process you might call make some time this is very funny process you can start the pc at point and move him to point b and have him run into confusion between distance and time he has the illusion of moving through time in doing this drill one differentiates space from time and thus obtains new level of observation and freedom this improves the individuals power of choice at least to the degree that he has increased freedom to observe as person gets out of overwhelm relative to something he can perceive what is happening to it instead of what it is doing to him ow in its essence has never been understood ow is not lesson in morality it is lesson in causality it is really lesson in what power of choice have you exercised in life however it is hard to get someone to admit that he has done something wrong because society tries to get him to restrain admission of overts which is big overwhelm justifications refute the cause of the individual to justify is to state that one had power of choice and therefore not being responsible committed overt in running justifications you are getting the pc to own up to having been cause when you go for overts you are going up against the social mores as the point of overwhelm you just choose this as the point of overwhelm society tries to get the individual to withhold overts in an effort to suppress him in lower level processing youre choosing society as the point of overwhelm of the pc and you are running ow you want the individuals revolts against this overwhelm as an expression of his power of choice some point of agreement with society can be found in the course of running ow that will undo attention from society the mechanism is 1 one does things 2 one cant own up to them 3 one then gets caved in on because of this you could ask what third dynamic activity have you gone along with weirdly enough this would eventually lead into overt acts the individual gets free to the degree that he can step back and look at the situation when we apply this sort of process to the sixth dynamic we get much more subtle level one that is much less easily perceived freedom from the timestream freedom from the cycle of action time and the cycle of action are so woven into the pc regradless of what level he is at that even your address to the third dynamic junior though it is to the sixth dynamic is involved with the sixth dynamic the pc is shooting someone across space standing on matter in an action across time there is sixth dynamic agreement that is overwhelming this is going on matter what the pc is doing so in processing person if you violate that to an enormous degree by outcyclesofaction the person wont know what it is that is being violated but his tolerance of that violation is terrible there are quits few cycles of action that you could violate one is the auditing comm cycle that is the first one that shows up on meter even on lowlevel pc the dirty needle you get expresses the jamup of energy in the pcs bank because of the violation of that cycle of action there is disagreement with the reactive bank when the cycle of action is violated the meter measures energy manifestations taking place in the pcs bank if the pc has one erg of attention or awareness and you are asking him to confront 8000 gallons of reality he wont be able to do it for instance if you take nonscientologist and tell him that he is the source of all his problems he cant confront it on the other hand if guy has tons of awareness or attention available and you ask him to confront one pint of reality he is going to view it as pretty unimportant just look at the horrible conflict between russia and the us yes well what about it so what when the individuals attention level and the reality to be perceived are more or less balanced cognitions occur you could violate some things which wouldnt be expressed on the meter because they would be above the pcs reality but violating the comm cycle will be real to the pc another cycle of action that you could violate is process cycle of action this one is expressed not on the needle but on the ta so 1 the auditing comm cycle is expressed on the needle 2 process cycle of action is expressed on the tone arm if you get ta motion on something you have found an overwhelm that the pc can potentially get on top of providing that you dont leave him in state of halfoverwhelm but complete the process cycle if you get ta going on some subject or area and keep on the subject until there is more ta action you have done completed cycle of action on the subject at that point the pc will longer be overwhelmed by the subject if the subject is real to him at all it will register on the ta at least slightly and the pc will be able to overcome the overwhelm that he has experienced in that area he will process to wins as long as you dont leave him in state of halfoverwhelm on the subject by failing to complete the cycle of action he will object to not being brought through it and the meter will react by freezing up it wont freeze up immediately but it will freeze up as you continue to leave unflat processes behind you can go on past the point where ta action has ceased people dont usually err in this direction more often they take an hour to get the subject in full view and the ta well started and then they quit this goes against both the pcs selfdeterminism and the cycle of action of the bank which is what locks up the ta the trick is to find the point at which ta action ceases if the pc is stuck you can go back through his folder and complete the old cycles of action that were incomplete when you do this the bank will unjam dont ask yourself what will produce ta action on this pc that is an easy question what you should be asking is what has produced ta action process in the direction of arc let the pc tell you about his problems long enough to find something that moves the ta and then get into that with an inarc process or something about solutions always flatten what has moved the ta matter how long ago it happened flatten what you get ta motion on this cycle of action is the only zone or area where you can overwhelm the pcs power of choice legitimately dont evaluate for him but finish your cycles of action you can be smooth and slippy about it direct the pcs attention back into the area and run the process to flat point find out what is real to the pc before you start by getting him to itsa on anything and watching for ta eg on the white form if you are having trouble getting ta on new pc and you cant find any unflat processes from his earlier auditing you still want to know what has given ta action if it wasnt an earlier process or something in life suspect immediately that the pc was involved in some other practice analogous to scientology that did get ta but was left unflat now crank up the sensitivity to 128 and ask what other mental practice have you been in and watch the needle like hawk be specific ask all kinds of things and sort out what cycle was incomplete there flatten the earlier practice when you find it get the ta off of it all you have to do if you dont get ta action on the pc is find out what gave him ta action that wasnt completed if he is an old pc suspect not an earlier practice but objectivetype processes when looking over auditing for unflat processes you may find lot of them and have to choose which one to start with in this case you have to be careful especially if you are advising someone else what to audit case supervising where you have less control and ease of observation on the things you check you want to be more certain and take fewer risks under these circumstances and one thing that you can be certain of is that any objective process that gave ta will give ta if it is unflat the objective process is the one thats most likely to have stuck the guy because its right here in the physical universe and its closest to the sixth dynamic subjective processes are the least likely to have hungup ta the pc could have cognited later on subjective process in the course of running something else in advising auditors case supervising give advice that is very downthemiddle and certain and if the auditor tells you that it didnt work find out in what way he failed to take your advice meter manifestations at level vi are different from the level iv ones you are used to ta action taking some time to occur or run out below level li but two to three sessions worth of ta at levels 0iv occurs in ten to fifteen seconds at level vi and thats all the ta action there is to be had you dont even see all the ta action that occurs some of it doesnt go through the meter the ta action flattens fast at higher levels dont overrun the guy you will drag in ta from somewhere else if you do if you let the pc go on and on you will get ta action from the next item or bank which violates the cycle of action all the bank objects to at level vi is overrun the cycle of action being extended beyond its end if you overflatten ta action you get an exaggeration of the dirty needle that looks like small rock slam sharpedged dirty needle tocky needle the dirty needle expresses ta action prevented from being completed the tocky needle results from taking more charge off an item then is really there it expresses the fact that the ta action is all completed if you continue you can finally drive it to stuck needle and stuck ta when you ask am i invalidating correct lineup the needle smooths out if you are dealing with the thing that enforces cycle of action on the pc and on life it objects to cycle being overrun it resists created cycle of action that isnt really there if an item has been left charged new item wont read properly until you clean it up suppose you havent left anything charged but the new item is suppressed or something in this case when you look for an earlier charged item the needle will go tocky all the bank objects to at level vi is the cycle of action being extended beyond its proper end the bank raises hell when you create cycle of action that wasnt there the needle will show you that this is happening by getting tocky and you can indicate the overrun and continue to the next cycle
