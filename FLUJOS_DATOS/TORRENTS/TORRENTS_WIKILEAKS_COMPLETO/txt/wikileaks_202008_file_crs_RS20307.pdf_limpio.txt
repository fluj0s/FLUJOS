summary federal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes mandatory minimums demand that execution or incarceration follow criminal conviction they cover drug dealing murdering federal officials and using gun to commit federal crime they circumscribe judicial sentencing discretion they have been criticized as unthinkingly harsh and incompatible with rational sentencing guideline system yet they have also been embraced as hallmarks of truth in sentence and certain means of incapacitating the criminally dangerous among the bills introduced in the 106th congress some would have created new mandatory minimums several would have enlarged existing mandatory minimums others would have eliminated existing mandatory minimums and some would have adjusted existing mandatory minimums in other ways the only proposed mandatory minimum enacted came in the form of piggyback statute which extended to overseas misconduct by military dependents and contractors the preexisting mandatory minimums applicable in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states 18 usc 3261 types of mandatory minimums mandatory minimum statutes come in many stripe s including some whose status might be disputed the most widely recognized are those that demand that offenders be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than designated term of imprisonment some like the drug trafficking mandatory minimums are triggered by the nature of the offense others like the three strikes provisions by the crimina l record of the offender few members of this category are somewhat less mandatory than others several of the drug related mandatory minimums in this category for instance are subject to safety valve that may make their minimum penalties less than mandatory for small time nonviolent first time offendershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20307crs2 1 eg 18 usc 1651 whoever on the high seas commits the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations and is afterwards brought into or fond in the united states shall be imprisoned for life emphasis added 2 eg 18 usc 1201 awhoever unlawfully seizes confines inveigles decoys kidnaps abducts or carries away and holds for ransom or reward or otherwise any person if death of any person results shall be punished by death or life imprisonment most observers would include within this category capital crimes made punishable by death life imprisonment or imprisonment for any term of years the suggestion that sentence of imprisonment for zero years is sentence any term of years being inconsistent with the intent of congress given the seriousness of the offense to which the sentence attaches on the other hand most probably would not characterize as mandatory minimum any capital or flat sentence statute that permitted imposition of fine as an alternative sentence see eg 18 usc 1589 emphasis added if death results from violation of this section the defendant shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or life 3 eg 18 usc 2 whoever commit an offense against the united states or aids abets counsels commands induces or procures its commission is punishable as principala second generally recognized category of mandatory minimums consists of the flat or single sentence statutes1 closely related are the capital punishment statutes that require imposition of either the death penalty or imprisonment for life2 the piggyback statutes make up third class the piggyback statutes are not themselves mandatory minimums but sentence offenders by reference to underlying statute with mandatory minimums or otherwise3 the final and least obvious group is comprised of statutes whose violation results in the imposition of mandatory minimum term of imprisonment by operation of law or more precisely by operation of the sentencing reform act and the sentencing guidelines issued in its name this category includes many felonies punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years and most felonies with maximum penalties in excess of 5 years we have omitted discussion of the proposals in this category in the interest of brevity constitutional boundaries the constitution precludes mandatory capital punishment statute s woodson v north carolina 428 us 280 1976 and sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crimes for which they are imposed harmelin v michigan 501 us 957 1992 united states v bajakajian 524 us 321 1998 otherwise the enactment of mandatory minimums is matter of policy rather than constitutional prerogative proposals in the 106th congress the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act of 2000 publ 106523 appears to be the only mandatory minimum sentencing proposal enacted in the 106th congress it extended the proscriptions covering murder kidnaping assault and other common law crimes committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states including the mandatory minimums to comparable misconduct when committedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20307crs3 4 18 usc 3261a who ever engages in conduct outside the united states that would constitute an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year if the

minimum penalties for drug trafficking from 5000 grams to 500 grams for large scale trafficking and from 500 grams to 50 grams for trafficking on smaller scale so that 100 to 1 sentencing ratio that
