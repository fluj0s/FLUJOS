and took the historic step of stripping alem an of his immunity from prosecution bolañoss reform efforts are being thwa rted however as the liberal party is working against his government and is trying to obtain the former presidents release and reduce bolaños powers or remove him from office the oas and us and other foreign governments expresse d concern that charges of electoral fraud made against bolaños and efforts to impeach him are thr eats to the constitutional order the oas has sent several highlev delegations to nicarag ua since october 2004 and continues to remain engaged there to help preserve the countrys democratic institutions in january 2005 the central american court of justice called on the nicaraguan legislature to suspend proceedings for ratifying amendments to the

however respect for human rights has improved and human rights observers longer accuse nicaraguan governments of systematic human rights violations according to the state departments 2004 report on human rights practices the nicaraguan government generally respected the human rights of its citizens however serious problems re mained including alle gations of extrajudicial killings and torture by security forces the government punished some members of security forces who committed human rights abuses but according to the report degree of impunity persisted other human rights problems incl ude violence against women and children trafficking in women and girls for sexual exploitation and discrimination against indigenous people laborrelated human rights violations incl ude violation of worker rights in free trade zones widespread sexual harassment in the workplace and child labor the government worked with domestic and inte rnational organizations to get thousands of children out of the workforce and into school according to the report the national minimum wage did not provide decent standard of living for worker and family amounting to less than 141 m onth which is what the government estimates is the cost of basic basket of goods for an urban family the report also noted that although the labor code seeks to bring nicaragua into compliance with international standards for workplace hygien and safety the relevant ministry lacks adequate staff and resources to enforce th provisions and working conditions often do not meet international standards resolution of

nicaragua is transit zone for narcotics traffic from south am erica to the united states and europe196 the report lists nicaraguas location d eep endemic poverty lack of government presence throughout much of the country p aucity of government funds available for law enforcement and the number of people still wellarmed from the 1980s civil war as factors making nicaragua attractive to drug traffickers its vulnerable banking system makes it potential target for money laundering as well the state department describes nicaragua as strong ally in counternarcotics activities whose cooperation with the drug enforcement administration has been ongoing and effective since 1997 the nicaraguan na tional police have made significant achievements in the seizure of cocaine nd heroin and in operations against local drug distribution centers nonetheless their effectiveness is hampered by limited resources and an ineffective and corrupt judicial system gunrunning to guerrillas in colombia is also problem in nicaragua as it is in many central american countries and in mexico in november 2001 arms supposedly exchanged between the nicaragua n and panamanian police forces ended up

united states trade and investment linkages between the two countries began developing in the early 1980s as nicaragua gained duty free access to the us market for the majority of its products under the caribbean basin initiative these linkages were strengthened by the passage of the caribbean basin trad partnership act pl 106200 title ii which provides caribbean basin nations with naftalike

use up to 100 million square meters per year of cloth from nonus noncentral american suppliers to make apparel products that would still enjoy duty free access to the us economy despite these positive observations skeptics have noted that nicaraguans had little bargaining leverage in the cafta negotiations200 moreover despite some protections for nicaraguan farmers us producers will be able to export 10 times as much yellow corn to nicaragua than in years past unable to compete against competition from capital and technologyinte nsive us farmers unemployment in the agricultural sector in nicaragua will increase in the short term and must be replaced by new employment in the manufacturing sector number of specific sensitive issues arose in the negotiations which are summarized below environment nicaragua has significant amount of environmental legislation in place anchored by general law on the environment and natural resources passed in 1996 the nicaragua ministry of environment nd natural resources marena regulates national policy on th management and protection of the countrys natural resources additionally nicaragua is party to 57 multilateral regional and bilatera l environmental agreements wh ich include the convention on biological diversity the convention on the international trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna and the kyoto protocol despite these conservation efforts and the fact that nicaraguas environment benefits from relatively abundant forest re serves and low population density deforestation and lake contamination threaten its environment between 1990 and 2000 nicaragua had the second highest rate of deforestati on among its central american neighbors deforestation resulting in soil erosion s increased the countrys

continues to be plagued by unemployment and underemploym ent rates as high as 40 to 50 along with declining confidence in union lead ers this has eroded the strength of the nicaraguan labor movement half of the unionized labor force belongs to militant sandinista labor unions nicaragua is party to 54 internati onal labor organization conventions and agreements including the 1998 declarati on of principles and fundamental labor rights although th 1996 labor code removed many restrictions on trade union rights the nicaraguan labor ministry ac knowledges that it still takes about six months for union to go through all the pr ocedures necessary to hold legal strike203 as result there has only been one lega l strike since 1996 and companies continue to exact severe reprisals against illegal
