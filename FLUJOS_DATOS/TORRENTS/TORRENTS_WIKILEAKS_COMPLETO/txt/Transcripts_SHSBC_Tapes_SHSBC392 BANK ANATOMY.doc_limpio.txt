bank anatomy lecture given on 14 july 1964 applause thank you very sorry to keep you waiting its not my fault its regs clock laugh thats correct it said its wrong so ill have to turn on the clock in head whats the date audience 14 july 14 july the 14thwe have new student stand up and take bowtom morgan and somebody we have seen before retreadingjean jacques scalance alright ill have to make up for it by being very interesting having bored you to death sitting there ten or fifteen minutes with nothing to do well i think im just going to give you right off the cuff all of you right now rundown on exactly what the track and bank looks like and here at the lower levels particularly restimulated and particularly the newcomer on the thing why the best thing to do is to turn it off is to just run on through class vi thats the best way to turn all that restimulation off and laughing and when youre class vi go right on through to ot that turns all the restimulation off laugh now lets just give you very rapid fire lecture and reg will be cursing in his beard because hed want camera on this particularly but i will do it all again with fillips and furbelows very interesting doing things with furbelows laugh and heres the way it sits theres thing called the reactive mind the total composition of the reactive mind consists of the following factors are we away laugh alright it has locks it has secondaries it has engrams got that alright in addition to those locks secondaries and engrams one of the most notable facts that it has which comes to view once you start is implants implant gpms and then various forms and varieties and that sort of thing and they make little black masses that are quite interesting to collide with and they can be run on almost anybody and actually comprise the implant gpm comprises class v old dianetics dealt with the locks secondaries and engrams and class v deals with these implants and their various ramifications implants are interesting in that they very often have engrams in the midst of them you run half an implant and somebody slips off the post and something like that hes got an engram and somebody getting him back on the post you know that kind of thing in other words theres all of that still exists in the mind and that those those implants go along with dating you can date implants very easily go along with other whole track phenomena and theres two branches then to the whole track phenomena which belongs at class v and one of those is implants and the other one is engrams and various types of engrams go back all the way along the track and theres some rather unbelievable time spans involved in all this it goes very very long it you can get dates of trillions to the one thousand three hundred power that is date which you would spend the rest of your life writing that its just cyphers that go on and on and on im exaggerating when i say the rest of your life but it would just go on and on and on and on now because people have been implanted and because implants exist and so forth then it is very easy for someone to get confused about what is called an actual gpm and the actual reactive bank because he immediately conceives that it has been done to him and is all mixed up on the situation and he is very likely to believe that an implant and gpm are the same thing now if you want to become very ill several methods of becoming ill will be covered in todays lecture if you want to become very ill indeed why just start going around and saying that actual gpms are are implants if thats if you want to get sick that is the best way i know of to go about it and if you want your pc to get good and sick why have your pc start arguing around about this without you suddenly chipping in and saying now when was the first time you considered this you know and just run it out as series of considerations right now and hell come off of this wild kick because hes going to make himself terribly ill if he says that actual gpms are simply implants now we are not interested in whether they were implanted or not implanted im just telling you one marvelous method of getting sick you understand im not saying even what they are im just saying thats nice way of getting sick now therefore we get down to class vi and weve covered everything else now except of course the fact that what youre auditing up to class iv is the destimulation of the things you erase at class v and vi you want to know what these classes are all about what classes i to iv are devoted to auditing which destimulates those things which are erased at classes v and vi you understand therefore there are only two erasure classes and those are v and vi and there are four destimulation classes so that you never try to erase anything actually its quite incidental but you really do get erasures accidentally of little odd bits on classes i to iv there is small amount of erasure that does take place but the moment the that the auditor tries to erase something while auditing in those classes with their processes he is in immediate trouble ill give you an of idea how this is ill show you the difference of classes you say to somebody you say you say you dont feel well alright whats the matter oh you got headache alright well now recall the first time you ever tried to get this headache cared for recall an earlier time you tried to get the headache cared for is more exact command because he wont give you the first time the first time and he gives you something and gives you something and gives you something and all of sudden his headache disappears well now youve youve destimulated youve destimulated wheres the headache well it actually isnt out there lurking waiting to pounce again but if it comes back slightly nobody should be very surprised because having done this exercise of asking him for his considerations about headaches or what hes done for headaches or how headaches have been handled by him and so forth or what hes done to headache we dont care what we ask him or how we asked him for these considerations dont get this mixed up with ow i just heard crosswise in your head that you had its any recall process see which would lead to banishment of headache matter what you did and then you found out that he had banged his head on the corner of kitchen sink at the age of five he got rid of his headache slightly see so then you decided to really find out where this headache came from and you found out that he was banging his head on the corner of the kitchen sink and then you said well now alright about banging your head on the corner of the kitchen sink when you were five how did the room look at that time what was said at that time and boy hes got that headache back with exclamation points you understand now youve destimulated that same incident when you simply asked him for some considerations you destimulated in general the whole subject of headaches but then you have come back and try to erase this you see now youre gonna go through and scrub out what you have assigned the cause of the headache to be youre going to erase that thing and hes going to get nice headache back now the funny part of it is you could go on through and erase it only to find out that it really wasnt when he banged head on the kitchen sink at the age of five it was when he fell out of the perambulator at the age of three so you have now erased that and this would all be better and then you could find out that it wasnt that at all but in his last life time he was really shot in the head when he kicked the bucket so that puts you back into the last immediate past death now were gonna run all this out from one end to the other i see some of you have been over this road and there would be an astonishing return of of perception and he would feel pretty good about this and so forth but either you did terribly even nice smooth job of auditing the whole way and you could keep running this back now let point out to you that the second you went into that past death you moved into class v it was at that precise instant it was perfectly alright to handle banging his head on the corner of the sink in this life time youre youre perfectly good auditor but you moved out of classes i to iv even on what little you can erase in those classes see youve moved out of that youve gone on to whole track one more life time than this one and youre on whole track and youre in class v thats the way we classify it these days dont you see you got business being there these days because of this interesting fact it is absolutely factual that an auditor smoothly auditing can go back and erase enough of those engrams we did it in dianetics enough of those engrams to make that headache go away and be good and the fellow not bothered with it at all further more this is perfectly true but the number of incidents im putting you all into focus with regard to the reactive mind the number of those incidents which added up to headache may well be in the billions which is why we departed from dianetic into scientology technology and thats the exact reason why there is bridge between dianetics into scientology whatever else anybody wants to assign to it whether historical reasons or anything else that is the great big milestone on the road the discovery that there could have been billions of engrams on the track each one of them capable of causing headache and to get rid of all of those engrams in times and terms of auditing in view of the fact that man is only here for seventy years at crack to get rid of all those in pc was not feasible it wasnt that the technology was not doable as matter of fact we recently improved the technology you could run an engram now by plotting its time and spotting its duration and boy if you got those two right pictures turn up all in 3d this poor guy hes never had picture before in his life see you do that engram technique that we developed here year or so ago i got i finally got whipped out and so on and boy hes got visio and hes got the lot see all you have to do is do an accurate spotting of the time of the engram find its exact duration and move him up some place toward the beginning of the thing and on go the lights see and youre away so the big problem of erasing engrams the pc had visio or sonic that was dealt with and there is such technology but it still doesnt solve this other auditing factor the auditing factor is is billions of incidents exist on the persons track which could cause headache see lets say youve got chronic headache well also in running this you find out he also has chronic foot ache and it has more billions you see so all of this becomes infeasible it is not doable simply because the auditor hasnt got enough time to handle that many incidents it is not now that they could not be handled you understand but he hasnt got enough time to do it you could take this technology of erasing engrams and take ninetyeight percent of your pcs and go ahead and run engrams on those pcs with this technology and they would very soon begin to fly but that is an erasure technique and to achieve any finite end within the lifetime of the pc and yourself due to the quantity involved becomes impractical thats why and thats why the shift in dianetics and scientology and thats why these other approaches thats erasure so erasure from i to iv it is not that it couldnt be done its that you havent got time to do it and you can do more for the pc by destimulation that youre simply keying these things out in other words park them over in their proper area without paying too much attention to them in other words the indirect approach to these billions of engrams was simply to destimulate the pc on the subject of keying them in in this lifetime and you find quite remarkably that this is highly workable destimulation as opposed to erasure now there is then the dividing line between i to iv and v to vi v and vi is those early ones are simply because you can turn off somebodys headache and then if you dont try to erase anything thats what ive been trying to teach you here if you dont try to erase anything if you dont push him back into the bank and you dont crowd him back into it with some nonsense or gobbledegook of some kind or another well i didnt get that would you go over it again that was what well i didnt quite understand this oh its well its alright but the auditor is just being too something or other hes concentrating the pcs attention on the backtrack see and he says oh well that happened when you were five alright what did you say you put your head up against oh your head hit hit hit sink alright what sink where were you living at that time well youve done the exact approach that has long since been designed on how to get somebody into an engram and if of course hed go into the engram at that time and your job is actually to destimulate not erase you see that now oddly enough you can still destimulate after youve done all this you just pick this session now youve obviously made locks on the incident and this session dont you see so you just ask him when was the first time we started to talk about it in this session what considerations have you had about it in this session you go all over it again and magically if you audited that very smoothly and destimulated this session why all of that would fly back into the background again and once more he would be rid of it so we have two distinct classes of auditing and we have two distinct things which are handled and therefore all auditing between i and iv is the handling of locks especially the lock known as keyin i wont bother to go into nomenclature in this lecture if you dont know those words look them up so its handling locks so i to iv isnt handling the raw meat of life and we have omitted number v because it now isnt necessary and this brings us visavis staring into the lions feted breath thats vi so what youre doing now is transition from sweetness and light of one i to iv the spring sunlight pattering on the freshly born leaves pan pipes trilling in the distance the full volume ride of the valkyries with transition done in dark cave with red bloods and spots and if this is something of shock to your steady factors well fine i would be very happy if it were possible to put you through the two or three years of training necessary to come up the whole gradient so its not necessary to come up to those whole years so the thing to do is just brace yourself for shock take it on the chin and plow on you understand so actually all of your auditing up to iv is destimulation handling the little keyins and locks my momma spanked and i considered at that time that i hated women you know ah gee somehow i feel suddenly better about about thats not what its about see do military drum doing muffled rums and hes going off to the executioners block the somatics with confront requiredpretty tall pretty tall big jump big jump for pc big jump for an auditor i just want to show you theres section missing in the training and tech but it is possible for you to make that jump and it is possible for the pc to make that jump without an awful lot of stuff providing you do i to iv well and thats the area that you got to do well now what have you got to do in i to iv in i to iv you just got to raise his cause level so when he eventually begins to confront the real raw meat of the reactive mind he can asis it if he cant confront it he cant asis it if his willingness factor is too low his cause factor is too low if his cause factor is too low he cant look out enough from where he is to asis anything in front of him weve had other lectures on this particular subject that is not new ground so your thing to do there is just raise up his cause levelthen throw him to the lions alright its something like the russians trained their troops for world war ii they took this fellow and they showed him how to handle submachine gun heel strip it put it back together again fire it and then sent him to the front lines that was his total military training see and then his survive became soldiers laughing so this is heroic see effort being made at all to do anything very gradient about this and this brings us right down with more gradient than that to the reactive bank basic the basic raw meat of reactive bank is the gpm and the gpm is caused of masses and significances as you will find in other materials and has certain forms and sizes and my lecture mainly concerns its patterns here today now there are people around that tell you naw ron must be wrong ive never seen any mass in gpmsoops wellmassgpmmuttering so i wonder why im so hot well if youre running straight down instead of the center of gpm and youre running dead on which you can do now of course you never see anything the second you begin to see anything you must realize something has been skipped the only time anybody ever sees anything theres something wrong you jumped gpm well all of sudden youre gonna have visio you jumped an item well youre gonna have nice visio on the item you jumped because its not going to be behind you or ahead of you or to the left or the right or someplace do you see this now in the final analysis gpm is composed of mass and significance and its located and so forth but you dont have to worry about it being too thoroughly about it being timed because it really doesnt matter what time its timed because it is timed and one of the reasons why its very difficult to find the top of the bank or the bottom of the bank and so forth and that sort of thing is because it is time itself so you try to find the top of the bank and well that would be the part which was made last yes how can there be last when this is the thing which has made it first and the last in other words the characteristics which you normally assign to objects in their position location and age these characteristics are gone when you get into gpms now you can say yes it runs in this order oh yes it does and youd better run it in that order and you can say well it starts here and it goes there and so forth well thats simply sort of on the basis its easiest to start here and go there dont you see because there was start and there was stop but there is significance of starting and stopping in it and if it werent for any gpms there wouldnt be any significance of starting and stopping how do you like that see the thing exists in space but the gpm is what makes the space for itself to exist in see it has age but it itself makes its own age chuckle so therefore we say this is the first endword well we have said that this is the first thing about the thing that makes first you see it wouldnt necessarily be first engram see there couldnt be first endword really this is why the wits are is very difficult to grasp at first glance because you see everybody trying to grasp it is tremendously influenced by it and the considerations people have of things are caused by these considerations and significances which are in the gpms you see its snake eating up his own tail its that kind of problem the snake ate himself up and disappeared well thats really what happens when you run gpm now if the consideration then the consideration of time the consideration of space energy all the various things of which gpm is composed are contained as significances in gpm very very puzzling so somebody trying to understand life sitting down on mountain top some place in lower jesus or some place jerusalem excuse and hes contemplating his navel or something and trying to get the hot dope he gives you all sorts of things if he starts to get close to the truth then the things he utters appear to be idiocies see if he gets close to the truth like there really is universemary baker eddy there is universe all is infinite mind isnt it true its very very very true but that doesnt prevent christian science from being the leading religious faith you find on the rosters of insane asylums see its truth which isnt quite true enough to save the bacon of the persons faith truth must be truth it must be all the way truth now anybody who is studying slowly and so forth gets caught up in this factor that you cant go part way to truth the most suicidal activity that you can engage upon is to go part way to the truth youve got to go all the way to the truth there are half truths about the most dangerous thing you can have anything to do with is half truth there are people have understood this that little knowledge is dangerous well thats actually not very well applied thats not even very well stated and it certainly isnt the same sense of what im saying here truth can be half way approached if you got that far and didnt go any further you would fall flat on your face and be in quite mess if you set out to shoot the moon there is nothing sillier than going into perihelion around it for the rest of your life chuckle youve got to land on the moon there is substitute for totality with regard to truth in other words youve got to know all of it and this is this im trying to field philosophy the bugdeammerbum the famous witch doctor from lower scrambula he puts his foot on this line and he says there really is time and he doesnt go any further than that he teaches everybody there really is time hes put himself and everybody around him with one foot on the banana peel and the other in the grave see he hasnt told them why there is time see he hasnt told them anything and all hell do is everybody goes around saying well there is time so it doesnt matter but yet echoing in around in their skull is the fact that its true there is time that is truth but it is so little of the truth without somebody going the whole way it actually becomes quite dangerous the whole race would then simply go in apathy and that would be the end of it and that is what has happened in almost all philosophies that i have ever heard of see they get some corner of some truth and then they dont walk down that road and they go further than this you see and they sit around on mountain tops regarding their navels and they do weird odd ball things and they wonder why theyre not getting any better if they know so much well the reason theyre not getting any better even though they know so much is because they started on the road to truth and they never made the passage and theyre something like shipwrecked ship theyre high and dry on that reef and theyre never gonna go any further but having gone that distance it wrecked them now this in itself is soul chilling this pronounces something quite interesting to you you can say well we started into scientology yeah you started on road toward truth didnt you the only fatal thing you can do if you know this about your pcs and you know it about those around you and you know it about some of them fallen by the wayside you instinctively feel it having started ceasing to go is one of the most fatal things they could do now you look at this with some sadness because its actually very fatal action but let call to your attention something else it isnt that scientology got you started on the road to truth you started on the road long time before youve been on that road when you sat down in the amphitheater when you sat down in the amphitheater in greece and listened to somebody saying philosophically yippity yappishly that something is the end of the road and kronos actually devours his own children and therefore the whole universe is circular and whatever else is being said you started on the road to truth and you can speculate along this particular direction what is the truth in this matter what is the true composition of this universe what is my true identity who am i what do i consist of where do i come from of course nearly everybody has asked that question of himself since hes little child you started on the road to truth thats dangerous unless you walk the whole road that roads got to be walked because the character of the gpms themselves admit of halfway measures you key in of one of these gpms and you key in series of gpms you get them all roiled up and then you dont do anything about them youre in the soup they contain the end all of all explanations contained in the gpms are the explanation of the universe in which we live their identity everything everything is composed of the impetus all of these very things in other words the philosopher busy philosophizing and having himself ball on the subject and coming up to some conclusion lets take einstein einstein was walking on this road he had finally gotten up to point where he was trying to integrate life into his other equations and he was groping groping groping and he left one of the most remarkable he left one of the most thoroughly remarkable messes for ages forward to figure out that you ever cared to have anything to do with when he died he had bunch of consultations in other words he was going towards the everything of everything in other words he was going towards something that explains everything and he hadnt arrived any closer than bunch of symbols having figured out his various equivalents of constants and speeds of light matter energy space and time having figured these out he was trying to squeeze life into this somehow or other and he left an awful hodge podge of figures which everybody worships back where he was princeton i think it was and theyre busy trying to do something with this now and its all very complex and its all very something or other in fact everybody around there is half way spinning what the devil were these last equations that einstein wrote he was just trying to integrate life with the universe thats everybody would say an over simplification it isnt thats more truthful statement thats closer to the truth than they are he was just trying to integrate life and the universe and that and that thats all the old encyclopedia britannica says in order to understand space and time you had better understand the mind because its very often very possible that space and time are simply generated by the mind how do we know interesting thats in the 1890 edition of encyclopedia britannica marvelous insight very well put i noticed it hasnt been followed by anybody else you notice that science today says the mind is so in error it is so inaccurate is so this that it is just nothing in mechanics at all but mass is all and the mind is nothing see the universe is everything and the material things in existence are this and then he is just spontaneous combustion from mud and this is all he is and hes just lousy bum and you talk to one of these boys and their whole orientation is in this direction he will say oh computer oh well computer never makes mistake this is the run it puts out all these marvelous things look at these marvelous things human mind agh human being agh muttering yeah listen to these boys ive tried once in while timidly for to say who feeds the data to this computer what feeds the data to this computer and get an answer out of it and who inspects that answer after it has been printed but the mind the being the person the individual yaghyaghyagh they cant get this point at all see in other words theyve got now the cake is more important than the baker see youve got an endall cake thats selfgenerated and sprang spontaneously from the cook pot but baker the cake is greater than the baker dont you see so in studying r6 the first thing we have to recognize with vividness is that were dealing with the baker not the cake were dealing with the thing that makes it not the thing that is made weve got to recognize that and thatll explain great many failures auditors have when they begin to approach r6 and its auditing techniques they pay all their attention to the mass the gpm the significance and to hell with the pc well in actual fact if you dont pay attention to the pc and his reaction by keeping in good auditing comm cycle by doing good arc break assessments when you got bypassed charge by first and foremost taking care of the pc by making absolutely certain the pc doesnt have any ptps at the time hes being audited making sure of all these little points keeping that pc in good communication handling that very nicely making sure that all the items read the pc is satisfied that they have read that the pc is cheerful and happy about this then youve just got an endall cake and you got baker and its the baker youre trying to handle and its the baker youll be left with after the cake has been et so you take good care of the baker so few pieces of cake get chipped up well thats not very important as long as you take care of the baker an individual is an individual and now you find this inherent in early scientology teachings where it was taught more instinctively than factually you see it was taught more on basis of general knowingness i knew how these things were youll find that the being the individual had generated the universe and part of that universe is the gpm and the gpm in its generation then restrained him and compelled him to covertly go on making the rest of the universe unbeknownst to himself and compelled him by his own generation to go on making it the gpm see so youre not quite sure when you first look at this thing which way is which is the cart drawing the horse or the horse drawing the cart you know when you first look at it you will say wowscience modern science has said well its all cake and theres baker see well lets take it up little bit further the first trouble youre going to have and that is is the course is is is the cart being drawn by the horse or is the horse being drawn by the cart or who is running what and as the pc begins to look at this he actually can accept intellectually hes making this thing that is smacking his face in but he cant put any part of it into actual subjective reality so its point you dont force down his throat it will eventually begin to dawn on him he gets to be further and further on gradient of cause over the gpm in spite of the fact that cause itself is an endword the point is here he gets to be actually more and more cause over this gpm see everytime youre falling across real significant significance or something that is absolutely necessary to do anything about anything with youre also colliding madly with gpms you understand youre colliding with the meaningness of gpm in some way shape or form in any human action and in any part of or action about this universe it really doesnt matter much what corner you approach of livingness or life in view of the fact that livingness and life is created by the individual through the gpm he creates the gpm and it creates it but hes long since forgotten he created the gpm it looks to like you see he would say it looks to like the cake you know is creatin the rest of the kitchen chuckle why he will then not be able to very intelligently grasp the fact that every time he tries to address any corner of existence he starts to feel strange or peculiar well naturally any corner of existence is already capped with gpm because if it wasnt it wouldnt be there so all of sudden guy is just thinking thought see thinking thought at random alright that is either lock on rootword or lock on an endword see one or the other its lock on rootword or lock on an endword thats it i dont care what thought you just thought if you thought any at all so you mustnt get into some weird you mustnt get into some weird oddball contest of trying not to think in some way in such way as not to restimulate gpm that doesnt happen to be possible theres particular reason for you i already went over this rolley coaster here few weeks ago it was relatively short time ago i had to decide what this was all about and i had to get down and work it all out very carefully and i did you see and thats the conclusion i came to that he built universe through the formation of gpm and he couldnt think any thought to amount to anything but didnt amount to anything he couldnt think any thought that could impinge on one one way or the other i made an actual test it wasnt intentional its with causation i was telling you about cause level and i had this struggle about trying to form communication about cause level and i said well i dont i knew that cause and so on was an endword in gpm well get on to what end words are and so forth in just moment well i knew that it was an end word and therefore i tried to get around it by saying causation erase the causation of pc and i tried to get around it also by using causativeness to increase the causativeness of being and by the time id carefully written the bulletin which you have carefully scouting this on causation and causativeness i was sick as pup it wasnt that i was restraining anything or anything i was simply miswording an endword so i went back i went back and scrubbed all that and simply put cause down there well knowing that it was an endword you dont want to keep repeating an endword at somebody when youre giving them auditing commands you can get out to an outer perimeter lock and thats what you want to keep repeating like done well thats very nicedone done thats good what have you done thats good withholdno thats rootword because every time you say withhold youre going to keyin directly and immediately some other portion youre gonna keyin somebody faster than youre easing him up dont you see so its best in an auditing command to use an indirect action but in the discussion of communication of anything if you try to escape the significance of an endword or the significance of rootword if you try to escape these things and not mention them all you do is suppress them and the final result is is youre practically around the bend so the best answer is the hell with it say them do them not with repetitive auditing command not in constant hammer pound of an auditing command but careful review shows that you cant escape this particular thing and it shows that when youre trying to be technical that departure from the exact statement is liable to make you sicker than an approach to the exact statement then that says where you sit and where you think now the number of rootwords and endwords which you hear battered about every day laid end to end would be longer than the queen elizabeths passage from new york to london every cocktail party on there all they do is bat about large numbers of rootwords and endwords now the worse off person is in actual fact the more he will talk in rootwords and endwords sanity if it is anything at all would be the gradient scale of destimulated rootwords and endwords and insanity would be the command value of the rootwords and endwords over the individual not their restimulation but their command valuethat would be insanity if rootwords and endwords have disproportionate command value over the individual you can say hes insane now thats thats interesting too because insane of course is an endword but you have to step outside the basic considerations but quite in addition to adding both the universe and personalities and reactions and so forth the individual is still quite capable of independent thought and the reason you have dianetics and scientology is totally attributable to the fact that ive been walking to very marked degree outside the perimeter of reactive thought while considering these various things now thats very interesting we got some place you see and didnt get detoured into it even though we were dealing with and very often using it now take the very step with which you workarc affinity is an end wordreality is an endwordcommunication is an endword there are three endwords in row all the way down early on the track and theoretically it should make everybody sick as pups because its so early you know you destimulate the charge of them now youre living right in the middle of the fourth lightning if you live in this universe and youre actually further from it in scientology than you are if you were out digging ditch somewhere because believe that foreman when he comes down the line is going to speak nothing but rootwords and endwords hes going to be pretty batty on the subject this little jazz musician is that something boy thats nowhere all in expletives but theyre you get the idea theres vast difference here theyre dead on dramatizing theyre completely unwitting it would be quite another thing for you scientologist to be dead on wittingly i know when im using root words and when im using end words to very very marked degree if i hadnt been aware of one before if i ponder one too hard ill get warm when i notice that im getting rather warm i say well what do you know i wonder if thats root word i wonder if thats an endword alright its root word what do you know must be root word because it wouldnt add up any other way i found out that the resistance to and the flinch from these things is what does the damage not the use thats very subtle point for you to know in class vi very subtile so get that point down very well its the flinch from you see its the suppression of it causes you to feel dizzy and woggy and sick at your stomach and invalidation of is what causes pain invalidation of course too is an endword but that causes pain if you want to make somebody hurt like crazy just get him to get down and say that it isnt true that there is goal of something or other something or other which is real goal you see or say it isnt true there is such an end word and hes getting real excited about it and the next confounded thing you know hell feel like hes being sawed up by butchers powered beef saw what happened well the liabilities then are the liabilities of contest with and dramatization of contest with is your greatest liability as student even though youre afraid of something youre still in contest with it it is that and you are you afraid to do these things walking the chalk line about them being careful in consideration of them and those sort of things well thats thats where the damage comes then you say oh brother thats nowhere thats really nowhere you know thats i wonder what the hell im thinking nowhere for you know whats all this nowhere tah must be an end word ah its nowhere you know get the get the delicate shift here see alright so youre gonna keep saying nowhere and make yourself sick at the stomach and so forth and restimulate the endword nowhere alright that isnt going to worry you until you suddenly realize you are saying nowhere and to that degree dramatizing the thing and then say you mustnt because it is an endword now you get that subtle one because thats where you go over niagara falls in barrel its right at that point see you say well i shouldnt be saying that because dont you see now ive taken new look at all this so you find out after conversation with somebody or other that youre absolutely reeling youve been talking about these things and the room goes out of plumb and so forth so it does so what now you really want to make it go out of plumb well i mustnt really discuss this anymore well youve knocked it all out of plumb with your locks you see that now you find yourself dramatizing these things every once in while but its only not to eventually catch yourself i dont expect you not to dramatize them theyre only still here so youre dramatizing something about space and matter thats for sure and time is passing so you must be dramatizing collectively something about time alright well lets figure this little other tiny nuance you all of sudden find that youre sitting there saying tsk problems problems problems problems now wait minute i must have an end word or something in restimulation see even though its next week before you find that out see and then not make the mistake of saying well i mustnt say problems any more to myself see because the recognition of it is enough you dont have to prevent the future because thats an endword too laugh so the gist of the situation is that youre surrounded with these things and all youve done to date until you collide with them in study is simply dramatize them now whats happening to you is youre finding out what youve been dramatizing your face every once in while will be rather red on this subject i myself pushed myself away from an auditing session just very mildly pushed myself from an auditing session and walked around the room for little while once and i came back and i sat down and i went over there wasnt anything wrong i was getting reads everything was just fine and i went over everything under the sun moon and stars that i could go over and tried to compare everything that i had done and everything i hadnt done and i was looking for this and that and all of sudden it occurred to i wonder what im trying to do here why am i reviewing everything that has happened here you see and then it suddenly struck that the next goal up that i was about to run was to create problems i had simply been sitting there fearing problems i laughed at myself and ran the next pair that was the next one coming up and i wasi was creating problemslike mad laughing you know what i mean you cant actually expect not to do it if you didnt do it you wouldnt be part of the universe dont you see your advance is to some degree measured by your recognition of what you yourself are doing and real recognition comes about when you realize that youre making these things up and of course about that time they will cease to now theres trap in all this of the tremendous quantitativeness of them there appear to be so many that you become exhausted the figures on this are variable theres slight variation in these figures but the best figures i have is 268 roots and 268 endwords that makes it square there are 18 ris in gpmproper line plot268 root words in one series and 268 endwords or 268 serieses now if you multiply this one times the other youll find then there are in excess of 23000 gpms now that of course is so staggering theres such an astonishing number that it makes you feel rather quivery on subject of ive got to audit all these out and its taking us session or in some cases its taking us two sessions to run out gpm and were doing turn about type auditing and i actually am only getting three sessions week and im running one and one half gpms week and there are 23000 of them to run out so i can expect to be ot of course at the end of something on the order of 33000 weeks or something like this and 33000 weeks divided by 52 gives you the nu oh my god well of course its not the way it goes this would be good pedantic mathematics but it doesnt happen to be an accurate situation once youve got your plot well oiled in youre spending less and less time in trying to find your way down the bank dont you see once youve got ninety percent of this work by the way well im not quite yes id say ninety percent of the work has been done on the organization of this the consecutive adjacent goals and the consecutive adjacent endwords are are still in state of polish theyre mostly known dont you see but they could be wiggled or wobbled to be here or be there or be something of the sort dont you see but the trick was to get the pattern of course the biggest trick was to find out it was there at all but to get the pattern of this thing took over year and half of some of the wildest most troublesome stuff i have ever been through very gruesome i look now on an auditor who cant find few synonyms hes got one hes got one to spit you know he cant find the next goal which is to expectorate i rather look at this as being rather poor because the next goal to spit is to of coursethis is not proper rootwordthe next goal to spit would of course be to expectorate see its to spit cats the next goal is to expectorate cats you see and the next goal to it would be to spitee cats very imaginative youve got to run is next to to gallop you see to travel fast to speed theyre just all tied together the same word same word and its got to be checked out and the best thing to do this with is one of these new rodell word finders theyre only available in the united states and theyre very very fancy theyve had lot of college professors working on the thing and they were nicely keyedin and they practically laid the bank out in this thing unwittingly and unknowingly and you look up list of synonyms brother it will find the next door cousin in most of the cases what gives you trouble is you sometimes have prepositions and conjunctions in the goal usually just prepositions and you have to bend your wits around little bit you get goal likethis is not proper one but ill just give you formto run away from cats see so what is the basic the basic rundown here is the pattern the pattern has been found and that is the most important part of any of this is the pattern because you see there could have been trillions of patterns possible the bank is so charged it is so full of locks that almost anything runs almost anything reads its the woof and warp of life you can walk your way through to what is the central pattern of all thisforms auditing research papers which if stacked up here on this platform would reach from the very far end of that platform to height of about two feet or three feet all the way over to the other end of the platform just single sheets of paper notes and records of running possible combinations and it is actually quite agonizing to run these things backwards and upside down and wreck yourself like fire drill so its very difficult to find this pattern youre being punished all the time for trying to find the right pattern dont you see there is half way road to truth dont you see gpm of which you have all of the items which is properly worded and so forth runs like hot butter providing you havent skipped too many or something thats thats that easy but the gpm of which you have one word missing or one preposition missing runs with pure agony see this is good you have to be dead on were getting us to point where we could be dead on but its very difficult and that bridge has been very well crossed and were very glad to be back the listing the auditors are being asked to do at the present moment is just sign the adjacent consecutive gpm wording see that hes got there now they dont vary everybody has the same pattern they all start in the same place and they all end in the same place and they all have the same wording some people have some holes in the track however where ages past they have tried to chew up gpm and get free and therell be little holes where just half of gpm here and there is badly chewed up and your most greatest liability there is running into an arc break that occurred maybe thirteen trillion years ago the greatest liability is the arc break with the bank thirteen thousand years ago you all of sudden are running down the trackthis is rather rare but im just telling you what the score isyou get half way through this thing the gpm everythings running fine and all of sudden its all running bad and you wonder whats going on and you trace it up and the guy is looking at this or that and he can see things and hes upset about something or other and you find out that thirteen trillion years ago in an enthusiastic ambitious moment he decided to he found this one to bite this one in half and tried to do something about it and chew it up and of course he had the wrong goal and the wrong items sometimes you get read on an arc break assessmentwrong goal wrong item and you find out it was in yesteryear they were wrong goal wrong item it had nothing to do with your auditing it was some little self auditing this boy had done thirteen trillion years ago or more you got the idea you occasionally run into this so youve been trying to buck these things for long time of course in several thousand of them theres maybe one half of one gpm chewed up so this doesnt compose much of problem but you can run into them so people have been at it and trying to do things about these things for long time they havent gotten any place theyve gotten themselves stuck in trying to list something without meter and without auditing discipline and without knowing the pattern and so forth they just pull in lot of endwords on themselves and theyve been unhappy ever since the most recent incident i know of was about 139 years ago sitting on the side of mount pernasus cussin these dam things messed them all up pulled them all out of sequence just cussin them finally saw that there were these masses so i couldnt see the escape from the masses so i couldnt properly exteriorize i started cussin them youll find out this sort of thing has occurred person of course gets into this state he doesnt know what these are he doesnt know what theyre all about he doesnt know what theyre composed of and hes already been bit two or three times when hes collided with these things so he doesnt want to know too much about them well he has to know them dead right before they are completely painless and safe to live with you have to go the whole road to truth now they are very very simple in essence the whole pattern is extremely simple i can tell you in very brief space of time ill write it down here root word lets lets lets be happy about the thing the endword although it sometimes doesnt sound very normal is always noun and rootword is always verb of some kind or another so weve got something like this weve got complete gpm and this is what you know as own goal and that sort of thing lets go over this and its to eat cats lets lets get this now to eat cats we notice here that we are on the end of this thingcatsand that is an endword and because that is an endword there are going to be 268 or there abouts gpms all ending in cats in row you may not be at the beginning of it you may not be at the end of it but you know that theyre all in row theres 268 root words which end in cats and theyre all consecutive and in sequence see we got to eat catsto dine on cats you seeto consume catsto digest cats itll probably be your next type of thing just tiny bit of shift you see goes from eat to digest and theres gonna be three like to digest cats you see but theyre all gonna be cats cats cats cats and its gonna be out there for 268 gpms now gpm consists of 18 ris those ris in 2 rows of 9 in each row and they begin with the goal as an ri at the bottom and they run on to the top and im not gonna bother to tell you the line plot right now but the line plot is posted in the theory room 18 ris in this line plot and one of the main difficulties you get into is the line plot is itself and the endwords are themselves and the rootwords are themselves and they dont much cross so if you had in the line plot edible cats which we dont have you see but if you had in the basic line plot edible blanks see you would then get to eat cats would read as goal because it reads off the line plot as lock but it would check out as lock if youre smart and clever and work hard and ask several times most of the reasons you fail to check is you you fail on checking you dont ask the second time you dont ask what it is and you dont ask where it is ask if youve missed anythingyou dont add that to your checkouts and thats when you miss on checkout and then you find out theres four hundred and sixtyfive dozen reasons why you shouldnt have run that gpm that you were busy running but you you just didnt ask the question so of course now the pcs in trouble and so forth it wasnt consecutive it was improperly worded is this an actual goal you ask you get read well if you get read once the pc might have just breathed you see hard or he might have had heat wave hitting at that particular moment or something like that so one read oh puff one read phooey you dont buy anything on one read the question is can you make it read again then you say is this correctly worded actual gpm sometimes you got some knuckleheaded pc that insists well you found out once why should you be asking again you find out that all of your repeat questions and so forth are being suppressed so you just have to handle that as an auditing problem hes got duplication or something like that stuck as an endword dont you see he doesnt want any duplication in his vicinity so whats this whats this cats thats an endword thats an endword there are approximately apparently 268 of these things and they go plusminus and it would be something likecats and catlessnessesor something like that see or it would be something opposite to cats we dont much care whats opposite to cats its what is opposite to cats that would appear on the end plot but its something thats definitely opposednot not dogs you understand dogs as beingness is opposed to cats this is this is the endword but it would be an absence of cats dont you see the endword isnt an absence of cats but thats what the endword would mean and you would express something likecatlessnessor something you see its the opposite and but what makes it difficult is that its only the endwords which go positivenegative and that gets very confusing and thats very upsetting but they go plusminus in groups now if you have something to do with positions or locations and so forth this just runs on endlessly youve got all kinds of pluses and minuses with regard to to positions and locations and since the most assessable accessable endwords that you will collide with on pc the most the best endwords you collide with on pc are according to what ive seen anyway is here herenot plural but hereand that of course has just above ittherewhich is the opposite to here dont you see and those are your pair of actuals and go this way now theres these 268 of these endwords and they go to the middle of track and then the sequence of plus and minus reverses on the wordnowwhich is in the middle of track heres the beginning of track up this end if you wanna have this end its at this end and now is in the middle of the track and the present is at the furthest end of the track now the present just beyond it has the absent that makes life more interesting youd never find anything here has several more toward pt but they all have to do with this kind of thing you see most of them do have to do with this kind of thing theyre plus and minus but what im trying to show you is that the middle of track of now has got an earlier on one side and later on the other side of it so its actually used twice as positive which switches the order which switches the order of positivenegative so that before pair to this now the earlier half of the endword series just dont consider anything but this endword see the earlier half of this endword series has the negative further away from the top of the bank the negative is further away from the top of the bank and the positive is nearer the top of the bank by one you see but the now up here to here the negative this causes tremendous grief thats why i didnt find it at first the negative is closer to the top of the bank than the positive the positive is further away from the top of the bank you understand in other words they do switch because the center endword uses double its double used positive now you see has two negatives so if you work that out youll see thats very simple thats very simple if you just write down plus as the middle of the track and then minus closer to pt and then minus further from pt and then alternate pluses and minuses both directions then youll find out that of course the first half of the track is opposite the other half of the track as far as the plusminuses are concerned you got that alright that is the way the endwords lie and whats difficult about it particularly difficult about it is the fact that the track is really basically circular but youll find out that there is thing which answers up to being the top of the bank and you can get the pc into lot of trouble if you run the quote beginning of the bank before you run this end of the bank you understand now but there really isnt any you got it for some particular reason when time was finally plowed into it and so forth why here operates as top or first thing to run now of course operates as the middle of the bank something you wont get to until youre half done and the present is the last thing you will run out and of course those three things tend to lock up on each other which keep the bank with you all the time adroit isnt it and of course you dont find these negatives because of the obvious see you found here so of course you dont have there see then you get things like everywhere and elsewhere see thats another pair so its pretty hard to navigate through these endwords if you dont know the pattern but that is the pattern of these endwords and its its pretty easy to do its positivenegative proposition there is numerical repeats it doesnt go twentyone earlier as the negative or so forth that trick isnt there its just its common just as ive given it to you its rather ordinary you could sketch it out on piece of paper theres just middle of the track and the negative on each side of that plus word comes on out to the ends and of course theres half of 268 endwords this way from now and half of them the other way from now so its elementary then they they tend to curve around and lock up and it makes the track look truncated at goals because goals thats the big obsessive one see and it makes the track look truncated at that point and the track will answer up as truncated and is runnable at that point but it isnt necessary to run it that way see it doesnt really matter cotton pickin confounded doggone where you run any of this as long as you dont run it blind in other words you say were running the fifteenth endword in sequence from the top of the bank and telling the pc that it is the top of the bank will turn on somatic because youve misplaced it dont you see because that restimulates placement and you get the somatic from placement dont you see but if you just sawed into it and then you found out how many end words there were above it and you said well were running the fifteenth endword the pc would say alright and you go on and run it and you do run it you got the idea its nice to run it all in order but if you cant run it all in order dont run it blind know what youre missing see know what youre missing in order to run it so anyway the net gain of that is that is the pattern of the end words and then these are the rootwordsto eateat here we call the second word just for lack of something because its needed in the line plot as the second word and the to is just gratuitous but to eat you see to eat is the root what we call the root and we did say rootword who cares whether we use word or not see thats the root and theres 268 of these roots and you get one endword its got 268 roots pocketapocketapocketa pocketa 268 roots and they all go in the same order and they have the same sequence of roots and theyre in the same consecutive order for every endword so if youve got cats you got these same 268 words for cats if youve got dogs its the same 268 words in that same exact order for dogs dont you see this makes all kinds of interesting mathematical computations and so forth you can take any random endword almost and add these rootwords to it and it sounds very very significant indeed you see that so theres always this same sequence of roots always the same and that is the same 268 see the only thing that changes then in essence series is this 268 roots with one endword and the only thing that really changes in gpms then since the line plot is the same for every gpm all 23000 plus or whatever the figure is well the only thing that ever changes in the gpm is the endword and that only changes every 268 roots so its sort of slow freight see slow shift now the line plot is the independent items which fit to eat cats now weve gotten it down to to eat cats and that itself is little bunch of mass and significance which is composed of 18 separate items two columns of 9 each which are in opposition to each other and bring each other about and those 18 items each one always has the same form and it changes just with the goal you are using so if you had just as an incorrect example but nevertheless an example of it you have edible blanks see why in the line plot why this simply transposes into edible cats if you had an end word elsewhere it would be edible elsewheres it would become plural if its not already plural as an endword the plurals are all taken care of in this its not difficult so you have edible elsewheres see and this line plot simply repeats in every one of the 23000 gpms its just substitution you know of what goal it does have itself and its always the same and its always in the same sequence and it always comes together that way and it brings each other about and locks each other in and that line plot is so composed as to lock together gpm and gpm b in other words gpm b is expressed in gpm as bottom pair and in gpm b the bottom items of gpm are expressed in its top pair in other words these are nicely intermingling so we have an item at the top and an item at the bottom which directly refer to the adjacent gpm see so thats what keeps it keeps it gripped together see and then those endwords in sequence they dont really grip together beyond shutting off from one and getting the idea the next one and approaching it and thats where they grip together its sort of travel thing see guy decides for gpm after gpm well were gonna leave here now were gonna shove off were gonna skip it were gonna get out of here were gonna depart yeah i better i better i better scram and so forth and then eventually magnitudinously thinks of the next one and its first gpms are just getting the idea there might be another one and considering this for while and pondering and looking at it for while and deciding he would do something toward it and then approaching it and then getting near it and then eventually walking around and arriving at it you get the idea and eventually hes there and there might be some trick interlocked between them but i wouldnt rule it out totally but i havent found one ive just found these two adjacent gpms go smoothly together that is entirely the total pattern of the bank there is nothing more in the reactive bank than that these things run by the discipline of scientology and you have to take very good care of the baker because the bakers making all this and you never have to run out 23000 gpms for the excellent reason sooner or later hes going to cognite hes doing it and thats the end of it he can give you false cognition that hes doing it and still have his head knocked off by the masses he can sit back and decide to decide hes doing it you see so therefore itll all go away wont do him any good it happens when it happens not before and actually its pretty long gruesome arduous run and its run today by platens it can be run easily by platens nothing to it just cut pieces of cardboard with the pattern of the gpm written on the tops of the cardboard and just fill in one word cut them out with razor blade and platen is an lshaped hole nine lshaped holes in series with the your bottom part of the hole is what you write your data in you just put them on an 8 x 13 sheet of paper and you dont even have to write all items you go pocketapocketa pocketa when you first start in you better write out the items but theres the theres the whole composition of the track theres the gpm the auditing technology which runs it its very very smooth auditing and draws it to an exact drain of charge of each one of these things in turn and the charge goes away very fast usually in one or two big reads and you position it one way or the other and eventually why you get in your x step its very rapid and frankly running with platen and so forth you can dispense with one of these things about one minute if you got up to one minute and so forth thats 23000 minutes to ot at the absolute outside because you never get to the 23000 minutes sooner or later the guys gonna say well the hell with that im making it all up at that point hes gotta fly out of his body and straighten up the auditing room chairs by taking him out of his state but dont let anybody get away with the idea well i realize im causing all thesecaugh caugh things and youll see that by the way thatll be very frequent i know i know people so any how know them and love them live with them and straighten them out for the various reasons but they do have their foibles and they will crowd it garbled they will push it they will get anxious alright and that is the total composition of the bank and there isnt anything else in the bank that you need to worry about because there isnt anything else in the bank because all engrams locks secondaries and this is why we dont run them implants and all other such brica bracs theta traps all the rest of these things of course theyre all sitting as locks on the gpms now you say well we can expect to go on and find the gpms theyre sitting on locks someplace yes theyre sitting theyre all locks on thing called thetan thank you very much
