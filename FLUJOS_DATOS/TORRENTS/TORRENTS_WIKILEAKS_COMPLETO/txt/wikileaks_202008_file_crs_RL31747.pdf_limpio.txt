the legislation states were required to determine how to measure the core i ndicators and to propose levels for each indicator states then were supposed to negotiate with ed to establish performance target levels for each year as previously mentioned perkins ii included some accountability measures but given the significant increase in data collection and reporting required by perkins iii the data systems used by states to meet the requirements of perkins ii generally were inadequate for meeting the new requi rements ed reported that early in 1999 none of the states was able to establish baseline performance measures for all of the core indicators required by perkins iii55 as result states developed measurement systems and collected ba seline data during py1999 the flexibility of perkins iii allowing states to select performance measures that were most appropriate for meeting their goals and that could be incorporated into existing state systems resulted in multitude of

longitudinal study of youth 1997 are underway 65 cte concentrators were define d as students who earned at least three carnegie credits in 1 of 11 specific labor ma rket preparation areasgiven the increased accountability for results required under nclba it is possible that vocational education course taking may be reduced to accommodate increased student participation in core academic classes the nave final report found that vocational educa tion courses account for an increasingly smaller share of the overall high school curriculum63 because academic course work has increased substantially over time students were able to maintain their level of enrollment in vocational education cour ses by increasing the overall number of courses or credits that they were taking if education reform s necessitate students taking additional academic courses howev er students may longer have room in their schedules to continue to enroll in the same number of vocational education

english reading or language arts mathematics science foreign languages civics and government economics arts history and geographyenroll full time are more likely to complete degree than those who enroll part time66 qualifications of vocational education instructors perkins iii does not legislate specific qualifications for vocational education instructors it does however require that states specify how comprehensive professional development will be provided for vocational and technical education staff both states and local grantees are required to use funds to provide professional development perkins iii also requires that the national evaluation of vocational and technical education examine the prepar ation and qualifications of teachers of vocational and technical and academic curricula in vocational and technical education programs as well as shortages of such teachers section 114 c3biii congress has been increasingly concer ned about improving teacher quality67 the nclba for example placed major emphasis on teacher quality according to guidance released by ed the new focu s on teacher quality is natural extension of the emphasis on standards and accountability the legislation establishes specific criteria for what constitutes highly qualified teacher holds full state certification or has passed the state teacher licensing exam and holds teacher license holds at least bachelors degree and has demonstrated subject matter competency in each of the academic subjects in which the teacher teaches in manner determined by the state and in compliance with section 9101 23 of esea68 vocational education teachers are not required to meet these criteria unless they also teach core academic subject69 because any teacher providing instruction in core academic subject mu st meet the definition of highly qualified teacher for example if vocational education teacher also teaches course in chemistry for which students receive science credit the teacher must be licensed or certified byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31747crs26 the state have at least bachelors gree and have demonstrated subject area competence in chemistry special populations the carl d perkins vocational edu cation act of 1984 pl 98524 placed substantial emphasis on making vocational pr ograms accessible to all individuals and providing programs for members of speci populations stat were required to use portion of their grants to provide vo cational education services to meet the special needs and enhan ce the participation of individuals with disabilities disadvantaged individuals adults needed training or retraining single working parents or homemakers individuals participa ting in programs to promote sex equity in vocational education and incarcerated individuals perkins ii eliminated most of these setasides for special populations but required states and local recipients to assure the members of these populations be given equal access to highqua lity programs local recipi ents were required also to spend federal funds for the combined objectiv of services for special populations and program improvement these popul ations included academically and economically disadvantaged and disabled students limited english proficient students students in programs to eliminate sex bias and individuals in correctional institutions under perkins ii states were eligible to retain 85 of their total grant for state programs and state leadership of this f unding prescribed percen tages had to be set aside to provide programs for special popul ations states were required to use 105 of these funds to provide programs for si ngle parents displaced homemakers and single pregnant women not less than 7 for these programs and for sex equity programs not less than 3 for these prog rams an additional 1 of these funds had to be set aside for programs for criminal offenders states were also required to use state administration funds to pr ovide at least 60000 for sex equity coordinator perkins iii defines special populations as individua ls with disabilities individuals from economically disadvantaged families individuals preparing for nontraditional training and employment sing parents and sing pregnant women displaced homemakers and individuals with other barriers to educational achievement eg limited englishproficient individuals while this definition is similar to the definition of special popul ations found in perk ins ii perkins iii eliminated most of the remaining set as ides for special populations included in perkins ii instead states are permitted to retain up to 10 of their total grant for state leadership activities states are required to use 10 of state leadership funds 1 of the total grant to serve individuals

and 150000 of state leadership funds for services to prepare individuals for nontraditional prog rams and employment in which members of one gender comprise less than 25 of the workforce states may use the remaining funds to provide re quired and allowable services among the required uses of these funds however is provision that states meet the needs of special populations and support programs that evaluate the outcomes for these students the nave final report examined coursetakin g patterns based on student characteristics including disability gender and income at the secondary level somewhat disproportionate share of st udents with disabilitie s participates in vocational education70 at the postsecondary level enrollment rates for individuals with disabilities in vocationa l or academic major are similar71 traditional gender disparities in vocational coursetaking continue to exist at both the secondary and postsecondary level for example at the postsecondary level 88 of students enrolled in electronics programs are male while 91 of those enrolled in registered nursing are female other fields of study are more balanced for example 55 of those enrolled in computer programming are male and 53 of those enrolled in businessfinance are female72 the report also examined courset aking patterns based on socioeconomic characteristics researchers found that s econdary schools enrolling high percentages of students from lowincome families have higher rates of student participation in secondary vocational ducation courses than other secondary schools73 t t h postsecondary level single parents compose larger share of subbaccalaureate vocational students than academic students74 national assessment of vocational education perkins iii authorized f unds to carry out research development dissemination evaluation and assessment capacity building and technical assistance with regard to the vocational and technical educati on programs under this act section 114 c1a in june 2004 the results of portion of this research agenda were released in the national assessment of vocational education final report to congress the naves conclusions about vocational education include75 the impact of vocational educa tion on secondaryschool student outcomes is mixed the most notably positive outcome is onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31747crs28 76 ibid p xxvii 77 for summary of the naves recommendation see nave final report pp 280295increased earnings in the short and mediumterm in other areas vocational education appears to have impact eg on academic achievement or negative imp act eg on completion of fouryear college degree current perkins act strategies fo r improving vocational education such as integrating academic nd vocational education and linking secondary and postsecondary voca tional education may be too vague and unfocused to have much impact few schools have comprehensivel implemented the techprep program more often only select ed components of techprep are implemented as part of broader vo cational education programs as result techprep efforts now ove rlap substantially with those of regular vocational education76 postsecondary vocational educa tion also has positive impact on earnings this impact is greatest for those who earn credential such as an associates degree from community college however completion rates are low for example less than 40 of students who entered postsecondary voca tional education program in 1989 with the goal of earning an associates degree had earned such by 1994 five years later the perkins performance measurement systems appear to have hadlimited impact on program improvement so far this is due to difficulties in collecting valid and reliable performance data and in reporting consistent results within states the naves recommendations include 77 clarify focus and limit the objectives of the perkins act by for example separating components of the act dealing with secondary and postsecondary activities eliminate separate techprep prog ram and fold t hose activities into the postsecondary component of the act streamline the accountability requireme nts of the act to reduce data collection and reporting burden and to focus on limited key objectives
