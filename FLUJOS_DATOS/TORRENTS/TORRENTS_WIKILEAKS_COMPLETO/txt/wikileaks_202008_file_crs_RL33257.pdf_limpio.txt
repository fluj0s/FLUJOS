hsas are one way people can pay for unreimbursed medical expenses deductible s copayments and services not covered by insurance on taxadvantaged basis hsas can be established and funded by eligible individuals when they have qualifying high deductible health plan hdhp ie high deductible insurance with deductible in 2008 of at least 1100 for selfonly coverage and 2200 for family coverage qualifying hdhps must also limit outof pocket expenses for covered benefits to certain amounts with some exceptions eligible individuals ca nnot have other health insurance coverage hsa tax advantages can be significant for some people contributions are deductible or excluded from income that is taxable if made by employers withdrawals are not taxed if used for dical expenses and account earnings are tax exempt unused balances may accumulate without limit hsas were first authorized in the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 however other tax advantaged accounts for health care expenses have existed for some time flexible spending accounts fsas which many empl oyees can use began spreading in the 1980s once the internal revenue service irs established clear guidelines archer medical savings accounts msas precu rsor of hsas became available for limited number of people starting in 1997 health reimbur sement accounts hras made available by so employers were approve d for taxexempt status in 2002for an overview of the similarities and differences of these accounts see crs report rs21573 taxadvantaged accounts for health care expenses sidebyside comparison by bob lyke and chris l peterson also see internal revenue service publication 969 health savings accounts and othe r taxfavored health plans when coupled with highdeductible health plans these accounts are part of what some call consumerdriven health plans one objective of these plans is to encourage individuals and families to set money aside for their health care expenses another is to give them financial incentive for spending health care dollars prudently still another goal is to give them the means to pay for health care services of their own choosing without cons traint by insurers or employers since hsas are relatively new the extent to which they will further these objectives is not yet known among other things it remains to be seen how many people will eventually establish accounts how much they will contribute to them and how much they will carry over to subsequent years their effect on health carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33257crs2 1 sections 1201b through 1201i amend number of other code provisions that affect the tax treatment of hsas contributions to account s and other related matters some of the rules summarized in this report are governed by these provisions rather than section 223 2 as of september 2008 some of the official guidance was available online at httpwwwtreasurygovofficespublic affairshsatechnicalguidanceuse is largely speculative as is their effect on insurance and health care costs however many individuals and employer s are interested in hsas and additional information about them is emerging continually this report provides summary of the pr incipal rules governing hsas covering such matters as eligibility qualifying health insurance contributions and withdrawals it will be update d as the rules change either by legislation or regulatory action for current information about legisl ative proposals to change hsa rules see crs report rl33505 tax benefits for health insurance and expenses overview of current law and legislation by bob lyke and julie m whittaker crs report rl32467 health savings accounts by bob lyke chris peterson and neela ranade provided comprehensive analysis of hsas and the issues they raised as of march 2005 th at report will not be updated hsa rules rules governing hsas are laid out pr imarily in section 223 of the internal revenue code and guidance issued by the in ternal revenue service irs section 223 of the code was enacted by the medi care prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl 108173 section 1201a1 the section has been amended twice first by the gulf opportunity zone act of 2005 pl 109135 section 404c and then by the tax re lief and health care act of 2006 pl 109 432 the irs has issued guidance about hsas in number of notices revenue procedures and revenue rulings since then2 hsas are affected by other rules as we ll for example whether an expenditure is qualified medical expense is governed by section 213d of the internal revenue code and irs guidance on it aside from exceptions pertaining to the purchase of health insurance section 223 does not change these rules the summaries of the principal hsa rules that follow do not provide all details or cite supporting documentati on further information might be obtained by referring to the statutory provisions cited above to irs and othe r government publications or to growing body of secondary analyses what is an hsa an hsa is taxexempt trust or cu stodial account established for paying qualified medical expenses of the account be neficiary accounts may be established with banks and insurance companies or with other entities approved by the irs tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33257crs3 3 individuals should be able to find out from their insurer whether their hdhp is qualifying coverage they need not apply to the irs or other government agency for determination 4 individuals remain eligible to establish and contribute to hsas after becoming eligible for medicare provided they do not enro ll in either part or part bhold individual retirement accounts ira s or msas in addition other tities may request approval to be an hsa trustee or custodian insurance companies that offer qualifie d high deductible health plans hdhps often also establish hsas for the policy holders however there is federal requirement that hsas be established by the entity that provides the health plan individuals interested in establishing an hsa must locate an entity that accepts the accounts they cannot simply deem an ordinary savings account to be an hsa who may have an hsa individuals are eligible to establish nd contribute to an hsa if they have qualifying hdhp and disqualifying cove rage as discussed under the next two headings whether someone has qualifying hdhp is determined as of the first of each month thus person might be eligible to contribute to an hsa in some months but not others3 for example if someone firs t enrolled in an hdhp on september 15 their hsa eligibility period would be gin on october 1 of that year individuals cannot be enrolled in medicar form of disqualifying coverage which generally occurs at age 654 they cannot have received veterans administration medical benefits another form of disqualifying coverage within the past three months other than benefits for preventive care or from disregarded coverage for the latter see exceptions to disqualifying coverage in the section on what is disqualifying coverage below on the other hand individuals can be eligible even if they have access to free or reduced price health services at an onsite employer clinic provided the clinic does not offer significant benefits individuals are not eligible if they ma be claimed as dependent on another persons tax return tax depe ndency is determined on early basis this might not be known until the end of the year individuals may keep their hsas once they become ineligible thus individuals do not lose their hsa or the right to access it by turning age 65 or by obtaining insurance with low deductib however they could not make contributions until they become eligible once again individual members of family may ve their own hsas provided they each meet the eligibility rules just described they can also be covered through the hsa of someone else in the family for example husband may use his hsa to pay expenses of his spouse whether or not she has qualifying coverage and whether or not she has her own hsa the husband might use his hsa to pay the spouses expenses even if she has disqualifying coverage individuals may have more than one hsa accounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33257crs4 5 this and other hsa inflation adjustments are based upon the consumer price index for all urban consumers published by the us partment of labor sec 304 of pl 109432 provides that the measurement period for hsa inflation adjustments is the 12month period ending on march 31 of the prior year according to rev proc 200829 issued june 2 2008 the applicable 2009 amounts are 1150 for selfonly coverage and 2300 for family coverage 6 similarly the irs ruled that until janua ry 1 2006 plan could qualify as hdhp even continuedwhat is qualif ying health plan health plan must meet several tests to be qualified it must have deductible above certain minimum vel and it must limit outofpocket expenditures for covered benefits to more than certain maximum level these two tests are described immediately below in addition qualifying health plan must provide general coverage substantially all of its coverage cannot be through what the statute calls permitted insurance eg coverage for only partic ular disease or certain other coverage eg vision care this rule prevents individuals from making hsa contributions when the only insurance they have is high deductible coverage for narrow class of benefits more details on permitted insurance and these other forms of coverage are provided under the heading what is disqualifying coverage minimum deductible for selfonly coverage the annual deductible in 2008 must be at least 1100 for family cove rage it must be at least 2200 these amounts will be adjusted for inflation rounde d to the nearest 50 in future years5 only usual customary and reasonable charges for covered benefits are taken into account in determining whether deductibles are met premiums are not included in meeting the deductible though copaymen ts may be at the option of the hdhp the minimum deductible requirement does not apply to preventive care the exception is established in the statutory language which does not define the term however irs regulations provide that preventive care includes but is not limited to periodic health evaluations including sts and diagnostic pr ocedures ordered in connection with routine examinations routine prenatal and wellchild care immunizations tobacco cessation programs obesity weightloss programs and various screening services drugs and dications can be included when taken by person who has developed risk factors for disease or to prevent its recurrence in general preventive care does not include services or benefits intended to treat existing illnesses injuries or conditions an exception is allowed when the treatment is incidental to the preventive care service and it would be unreasonable or impracticable to preform another service prescription drugs are not exempt from the minimum deductible whether they are treated like other benefits in the high deductible insurance pl an or have different deductibles and copay requirements in order to allow health plans time to adjust to this requirement the irs delayed its effective date until january 1 20066httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33257crs5 6 continued if state law required that certain benefits be provided without deductible or below the minimum annual deductible extensions beyond that date were limited to certain non calendar year health plans 7 according to rev proc 200829 issued june 2 2008 the applicable 2009 amounts are 5800 for selfonly coverage and 11600 for family coverageprescription or other discount cards do not disqualify individuals from meeting the minimum deductible requirement similarly individuals are not disqualified by coverage under an employee assistance prog ram disease management program or wellness program provided th program does not provide si gnificant benefits in the nature of medical care or treatment outofpocket limit for selfonly covera ge the annual limit on outof pocket expenditures for cove red benefits must not exceed 5600 in 2008 for family policies the limit must not ex ceed 11200 these amounts will be adjusted for inflation rounded to the nearest 50 in future years7 these limits should not be interprete d as ceilings on all outofpocket expenditures for health care premiums for the hdhp and other insurance would be extra as would payments for benefits not covered by insurance even for covered benefits the limits would apply only to payments for usual customary and reasonable charges on the other hand both deductibles and copayments must be taken into account in determining whether the limits are exceeded the outofpocket limit rule does not preclude hdhps from imposing reasonable lifetime limits for example 1 million on plan benefits what is disqualifying coverage while covered by qualifying hdhp indivi duals generally must not have other coverage that is not high deductible and that provides c overage for any benefit under their high deductible plan for example individuals with qualifying hdhp are not eligible to establish or contribute to an hsa if they are also covered under spouses low deductible policy for th same benefits if th spouses policy were high deductible the individua l could contribute to his or her own hsa however eligible individuals may have permitted insurance which is insurance under which substantially all c overage relates to liabilities incurred under workers compensation laws tort liabilities or liabilities related to ownership or use of property such as automobile insuran ce insurance for specified disease or illness or insurance that pays fi xed amount per day or other period of hospitalizati on in additi on eligible individuals may have coverage through insurance or otherwise for accidents disability vision care dental care or longterm care as mentioned above the permitted insurance and other coverage describedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33257crs6 8 in private letter ruling plr 200704010 january 26 2007 the irs provided guidance on how broad permitted insurance and other coverage can be without being deemed disqualifying coverage while private letter ru lings are not precedent they are often useful indicators of the tax analysis the irs applies to particular issue 9 health care flexible spending accounts gene rally are also funded through salary reduction agreements however they have number of restrictions that do not apply to hsashere do not provide the genera l form of coverage to be considered qualifying health plan for purposes of hsa eligibility8 eligible individuals may also have flexible spe nding accounts and health reimbursement accounts provided these accounts are for limited purposes for example dental services or preventive care provide reimbur sement for services covered by the hdhp only after the qualifyi ng deductible is met or are used in retirement however coverage under any flexible spending account is allowed during the accounts 2½month grace period afte r the end of the year leeway which employers may allow provided the balance in the account is zero or is transferred to the hsa who may contribute to an hsa contributions to hsas may be made by ligible individuals as well as by other individuals or entities on thei r behalf thus individuals may contribute to accounts of eligible family members and employers may c ontribute to accounts of eligible employees contributions can also be made by state governments contributions by one individual or entity do not preclude contributions by others provided that the tota l of all contributions asi from those classified as rollover contributions does not exceed annual contribution limits contributors ca nnot restrict how hs funds are to be used for example employers may not limit hsas just to certain medical expenses let alone just to medical expenses alone even for funds they contribute account owners always can make withdrawals for any purpose thoug h nonqualified withdrawals are subject to taxation as discussed below when and how may contributions be made to an hsa contributions to hsas may be made at any time during calendar year and until the filing date without extensions for fede ral income tax return s normally april 15 of the following year thus contribu tions could occur over 15½ month time span eg from january 1 2008 through april 15 2009 provided they do not exceed the allowable annual limit described below hsa contributions may be made through cafeteria plan salary reduction agreements that is benefit arrangemen ts established by employers under which employees accept lower takehome pay in exchange for the difference being deposited in their account9 the irs has determined that salary reduction agreements must allow employees to stop or increase or decrease their hsa contributionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33257crs7 10 individuals who make additions to their hsas under these circumstances must maintain their hsa eligibility for the following year except in cases of disability or death otherwise the additions are included in gross income in determining federal income taxes and also are subject to 10 penalty tax 11 the applicable annual limits apply to total c ontributions to the hsa from all sources eg from individuals and employers not counting ro llover contributions as discussed in the text applicable limits are reduced by the am ount of any contributions individuals make to their medical savings accounts the same year 12 individuals who make additional contributions under this rule must maintain their hsa eligibility for the following year except in cas of disability or death otherwise the additional contributions are included in gross income in determining federal income taxes and also are subject to 10 penalty tax 13 according to rev proc 200829 issued june 2 2008 the applicable 2009 amounts are 3000 for selfonly coverage and 5950 for family coveragethroughout the year as long as the chan ges are effective prospectively however employers may place restrictions on these elections if they apply to all employees the irs has also determined that these agreements allow employers to contribute amounts to cover medical expenses that ex ceed employees current hsa balances subject to maximum amounts the employees had elected to contribute provided the employees repay the accelerated contributions before the end of the year individuals may make one time contributions to their hsas from their traditional or roth individual retirement accounts ira s subject to the annual contribution limits described below and limited onetime rollovers fro m balances in each of their flexible spending accounts and health reimbursement acc ounts which are not subject to those limits10 contributions to hsas must be made in cash contributions of property are not allowed how much may be contributed to an hsa two types of contributions may be made to hsas regular and catchup both have annual limits that are cal culated on monthly basis for each month during the year when individuals are eligible they may contribute or have others contribute on their behalf up to onetwelfth of the applicable annual limit11 for example an individual who is eligible for january thr ough july could contribute seventwelfths of the annual limit for that year however i ndividuals who are elig ible during the last month of the year are treated as if they were eligible for the entire year thus allowing them to contribute up to the annual limit12 contributions need not actually occur mont hly one contribution can be made for the entire year provided it does not exceed the sum of the allowable monthly limits regular contributions the annual contribution limit in 2008 for selfonly coverage is 2900 the annual limit for fa mily coverage is 5800 the limits will be adjusted for inflation rounded to the nearest 50 in future years13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33257crs8 14 the comparability requirement is in section 4980g of the internal revenue code which references rules for msas in section 4980e the irs issued final regulations for comparability on july 31 2006 71 federal register 43056 and april 17 2008 73 federal continuedin the case of married couple if one spouse has family insurance coverage both will be treated as if they have only that coverage the monthly contribution limit will be divided equally between them unle ss they agree on different division catchup contributions these contributions ma be made by individuals who are at least 55 years of age but not ye t enrolled in medicare in 2008 they may contribute an additional 900 the annual catchup amount will increase by another 100 in 2009 when it will be 1000 these amounts are not indexed for inflation rollovers account owners may rollover ba lances from one hsa to another without being restricted by the annual contribution l imits or affecting new contributions if the owner withdraws f unds and deposits them in another account only one rollover is allowed each year deposits must be made within 60 days in order for the transfer to be considered ro llover if instead an hsa trustee transfers funds to another there is limit on the num ber of rollovers allowed each year hsa trustees are not obligated to accept either owner or trustee rollovers onetime limited rollovers are also allowed of termination balances in flexible spending accounts and hea lth reimbursement accounts the rollovers must be made by employer transfers interaction with medical savings accounts the annual limitations just described are reduced by the amount of an contribution individuals make to their msas in the same year msas are precurs ors to hsas that were authorized under the health insurance portability and accountab ility act of 1996 pl 104191 eligibility was limited to people who either were selfemployed or were employees covered by high deductible insurance pl an established by employers with 50 or fewer workers individuals are permitted to rollover msa balances to their health savings accounts excess contributions contributions exceeding annual limits might occur for number of reasons including failure of employees to take account of employer contributions early deposits that incorrectly anticipated continuing eligibility and mathematical errors if an excess contribution and any earnings on it are withdrawn by the filing date without extensions for the federal income tax return for the year the individual will not be subject to penalty otherwise the excess contribution will be subject to 6 excise tax each year until it is withdrawn comparability requirement employers are not required to contribute to employees hsas but if they do the contributions must be comparable14 generallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33257crs9 14 continued register 20794 failure to comply subjects the employer to an excise tax 15 cafeteria plans allow employees to choose among certain nontaxable benefits or levels thereof and cash governed by section 125 of the internal revenue code they have their own nondiscrimination rules contributions must be the same dollar am ount or the same percentage of the hdhp annual deductible adjusted to reflect the proportion of the year the employees have worked varying employer matching contributions which might differ by how much an employee puts in satisfy the comparability requirement only if employee contributions are made th rough cafeteria plan15 if employers allow some employees to transfer flexible spending account or health reimburseme nt account balances to their hsas they must allow any elig ible individual cove red under their hdhps to do so employers may accelerate part or all of their contributions for employees who have incurred qualified medical expenses that exceed the employers cumulative contributions to that point in the year accelerated contributions must be available on an equal and uniform basis to all eligible employees employers may limit contributions just to employees who participate in the employers hdhps however if they make contributions to employees who participate in other hdhps they must make comparable contributions to all employees with hdhps different treatment is allowed for fulltime and parttime employees and for self only and several types of family coverage larger contributions may be made for nonhighly compensated employees than for highly compensated employees as defined by the internal revenue service employees covered by collective bargaining agreements may be disregarded the comparability requirement does not apply to hsa contributions to people who are not considered employees includi ng independent contr actors partners in partnership and sole proprietors what is the tax treatment of hsa contributions individuals who contribute to their hsas may claim deduction on their federal income tax the deduction is abovetheline that is it is made in determining adjusted gross income it may be taken by all taxpayers even those who claim the standard deduction instead of itemizing deductions deduction may be claimed for one time contribution from an ira though the ira distribution is not taxed as it ot herwise might be or for rollovers from msas other hsas or flexible spe nding account or h ealth reimbursement account contributions made by employers are excluded from gross income of employees in determining their income tax liability in addition employer contributions arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33257crs10 16 if an individual is selfemployed contribu tions are not taken into account in determining net income from selfemployment as cons equence they are not exempt from social security and medicare taxes 17 qualified medical expenses are described generally in section 213d of the internal revenue code they include expenditures for spouse and dependents even if they are not eligible to have an hsa themselves irs publication 502 medical and dental expenses provides good overview the principal purpos of section 213d is to describe which expenses may be taken into account in determining the itemized deduction for medical expenses however qualified medical expenses under section 213d also include overthe counter medicines ie medici nes available without prescription for which deduction is not allowed 18 the irs considers payments for longterm care insurance to be qualified expenses even if the hsa is funded through salary reduction agreement under cafeteria plan notwithstanding the explicit provision in section 125f of the internal revenue code prohibiting cafeteria plans from in cluding longterm care insurance the rationale is that it is the hsa that is paying for the insurance not the cafeteria planexempt from social security and medicare taxes for both employers and employees16 social security taxes are 62 of wa ges up to 102000 in 2008 medicare taxes are 145 of total wages in addition empl oyer hsa contributions are exempt from federal unemployment insurance taxes if employees contribute to their hsas through salary reduction cafeteria plan s the contributions are considered to be made by the employer and are exempt from these three employment taxes state income taxes generally follow federal rules with respect to deductions and exclusions however some stat may elect different treatment what is the tax treatme nt of hsa withdrawals withdrawals from hsas are exempt from federal income taxes if used for qualified medical expenses described in section 213d of the internal revenue code17 except for health insurance while payments for health insurance are considered qualified expenses under section 213d they generally are not qualified for purposes of hsas withdrawals thus accounts cannot be used to pay some or all of the premiums of the associated hdhp however payments for four types of insurance are considered to be qualified hsa expenses 1 longterm care insurance18 2 health insurance premiums during peri ods of continuation coverage required by federal law eg cobra 3 health insurance premiums during periods the individual is receiving unemployment comp ensation and 4 for individuals age 65 years and older any health insurance premiums including medicare part b premiums other than medicare supplemental policy withdrawals not used for qualified medi cal expenses are included in gross income in determining federal income taxes they also are subject to 10 penalty tax the penalty is waived in cases of disability or death and for individuals age 65 and older there is requirement as th ere is for qualified retirement plans that individuals begin to spend down acc ount balances at certain agehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33257crs11 19 this rule applies even if the nonspouse desi gnated beneficiary is someone whose medical expenses could have been paid from the account such as dependent child 20 however trustees and custodians may not ac cept contributions that exceed the annually adjusted dollar amounts eg 2850 and 5650 and allowable catchup contributionsthere is time limit on when hsa withdrawals are made to pay or reimburse payments for qualified expenses provided adequate records are kept however hsas may not be used to pay expenses incurred before the hsa was established hsa withdrawals are not subject to nondiscrimination provisions applying to selfinsured medical reimbursement plans what happens to hsas at death if surviving spouse is the designated beneficiary of an hsa it becomes an hsa for that widow or widower if someone other than surviving spouse is the designated be neficiary the hsa is terminated as of the date of death and the fair market value becomes taxable income to that person19 if there is designated beneficiary the remaining assets become part of the estate and the fair market value becomes taxable income to the deceased individual on the final return in these instances amounts included in gross income are reduced by qualified expenses incurred by the deceased before death and paid within one year what administrative provisions apply to hsas the irs has proposed model forms that banks insurance companies and other approved entities can use as trust or custodial agreements with eligible individuals the proposed agreements which are not manda tory provide safe harbor definition of these institutions responsibilities among other things the proposed forms clarify that trustees and custodians may rely on account owners representations about their age that they are covered by hdhp and that their contributions do not exceed the maximum allowed20 in addition th proposed forms state that trustees and custodians are not responsible for determining whet her distributions ar used for medical expenses hsa funds may be invested in investments approved for iras such as bank accounts annuities certificates of deposit stocks mutual funds and bonds however trustees and custodians need not make ava ilable all of these options there is requirement that funds be inve sted in vehicles that do not lose value hsa funds may not be invested in life insurance contracts or most collectibles ie tangible property administration and account maintenance fees may be withdrawn from the hsa in which case they will not be considered taxable income or paid separately in which case they will not be taken into account with respect to contribution limitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33257crs12 21 department of labor field assistance bulletin 20041 april 7 2004

plans fact sheet by hinda chaikindtrustees and custodians may place reasonable restrictions on the frequency and minimum amount of hsa distributions are hsas covered by erisa the employee retirement income security act erisa establishes requirements for employee benefit plans among other things it establishes reporting disclosure and fiduciary st andards for employers supe rceding state laws on these matters benefit plans with minimal employer involvement are exempted the us department of labor dol has determined that hsas generally will not be considered erisa plans even if em ployers open and make contributions to the employees accounts provi ded employer involveme nt is otherwise limited21 for the exemption to apply employers must not limit employees ability to move funds to another hsa impose additional conditions on using hsa funds make or influence investment decisions regarding hsas re present that hsas are employee welfare benefit plans established by the employer or receive any payment or compensation in connection with hsas the dol has also determined that certa in cash contributions offered by hsa trustees or custodians as an incentive to establish an hsa are not prohibited transaction under erisa22 what state requirements apply to hsas states do not have to approve hsas for them to become available within their jurisdictions however individuals cannot establish or make contributions to hsas unless they have qualifying hdhp states might not allow the sale of insurance that meets the conditions for these plans if they require all insurance to include certain benefits with or low deduc tibles and if those benefits do not fall within the irs definition of preventive benefits the ir s granted waiver until january 1 2006 that temporarily allowed insurance in these stat to be considered hdhps giving the states time to change their laws this regulatory barrier does not apply to employers that selfinsure since erisa generally exempts their plans from state insurance mandates23 it does apply to employers that purchase insurance from insu rance companies as well as to insurance that is sold in the individual market and small group markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33257crs13 24 for more information see the department of the treasurys general explanations of the administrations fiscal year 2009 revenue proposals february 2008 p 2526what are the administra tions current proposals the presidents fy2009 budget includes number of proposals regarding hsas all of them would require modificati ons to current statutory language24 allow health plans with 50 coinsurance to qualify as high deductible health plans allow any medical expense incurred on or after the first day of hsa eligibility to be considered qualified expense even if incurred before the hsa is established allow larger contributions from employers for chronically ill persons allow family coverage to include coverage where each individual can receive benefits once they have reached the minimum deductible for an individual allow both spouses who are eligible individuals to contribute the catchup contribution to single hsa owned by one spouse and allow contributions to hsas to be made by individuals covered by an fsa or hra but offset the maximum allowable hsa contribution by the level of fsa or hra coverage conclusion as of september 2008 nearly all the rule s needed to implement hsas have been issued however as hsas become more common and new health plan arrangements emerge additional questions are arising prompting the need for further guidance at some point congress may want to cons ider whether changes to hsa rules are warranted in light of information about who has them and how much is in their accounts consideration might also be give n to what role if any hsas have in proposals to reduce the number of the unins ured and to implement other health care reforms
