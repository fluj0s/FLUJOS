trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites background and issues summary the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites has been ratified by 167 nations including the united states it regulates the international trade in animals and plants that may be threatened by trade cites entered into force in 1975 and currently regulates the trade of approximately 28000 species of plants nd 5000 species of animals many believe that cites has been success citing th at species listed under cites has gone extinct in the last 30 years others be lieve that cites alt hough successful has had implementation difficulties such as the lack of enforcement and implementation regulations in some party nations protected species are organized under ci tes into three appendices species in appendix i are threatened with extinction and trade in these species is prohibited for commercial purposes appendix ii contains species not necessarily threatened with extinction but which require controlled trade to prevent population declines for species protected in appendix iii at least one c ountry has requested other countries to assist in regulating trade originating in that country the endangered species act implements cites in the united states and contains provisions for prot ecting rare foreign species the however protects species based on several criteria that may threaten their survival cites focuses solely on the threat of trade to speciess survival further cites allows for the trade in species if trade is not detrimental to the survival of the species the may allow imports of foreign endangered species if trade enhances the survival of the species in their native country in the united states comparisons of wildlife protection under the and cites may be an emerging issue for congress some argue that the regulations on importing some foreign species may i nhibit conservation efforts in foreign countries that rely on funds generated from wildlife trade others respond by noting that cites is focused only on the trade in endangered species rather than the overall protection and conservation of the species such as in the issues

laws protect wildlife differently gao04964 washington dc sept 2004 hereafter referred to as gao protected species report the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites background and issues introduction the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites is an international ag reement among national governments it aims to ensure that the international trade in plants and animals does not threaten their survival the united states signatory to cites is the largest importer and exporter of wildlife products in the estima ted 5 billion world wildlife trade industry the united states share of the world wildlife trade is between 1 billion and 2 billion per year1 the implementation and enforcement of cites is of interest to congress because of the prominence of the united st ates in the international wildlife trade congress provides oversight on us activities related to cites by holding hearings on us recommendations for cites as well as providing appropriations for conservation programs that aim to impr ove the populations nd habitats of some species listed on cites the most recent conference of the parties cop for cites was held june 2007 veral decisions regarding the listing of species were discussed including denying proposal to review restrictions on whales listing species of sawfish and the european eel denying listing proposals for some species of sharks and coral appr oving some trade in ivory before nineyear ban and addressing tiger farming and illegal logging the next cop will be held in doha qatar in 2010 this report provides background information on the structure of cites the enforcement of cites in the united states and implementing issues related to cites background the origins of cites can be traced to the 1960s during international discussions about the world trade of wild life and wildlife products and its effect on wildlife populations in 1963 the interna tional union for conservation of nature and natural resources iucn called for an international convention on the trade in animal species and their products firs t draft of the convention was produced inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32751crs2 2 gao protected species report p 91964 and in 1973 cites wa s signed by 21 nations in washington dc cites entered into force in 1975 after 10 countries ratified the agreement as of february 2008 there are 172 signatories to cites cites is applied to species whose popula tions may be significantly harmed by international trade species are first identified as needing protection and then assessed for the risk trade poses for the species survival cites regulates trade through series of import and export permits corresponding to the degree of protection there are approximately 5000 species of animals and approximately 28000 species of plants listed under cites the administrative bodies of cites are the secretariat the conference of the parties cop and the management and scientific authorities of each country the parties i signatory countries meet generally every two years at cop to evaluate the implementation of the treaty and consider efforts which woul d improve cites success in the united states the implementing legislation for cites is the endangered species act 16 usc 1531ff the office of management authority oma and the office of scientific authority osa of the fish and wildlife service fws in the department of the interior doi exercise the responsibilities of the management and scie ntific authorities enforcem ent responsibilities for cites are shared in varying levels by the fws division of law enforcement and the animal and plant health inspection service aphis and the customs service in the department of homeland s ecurity the noaa fisheries in the department of commerce also has small role in cites enforcement classification into appendices and the permit system under cites species that are thought to be in need of protection are identified by the parties and then their trade is regulated through export and import permits among the criteria used to consider sp ecies for listing under cites are 1 trade in the species 2 population size of the sp ecies 3 quality of habitat used by the species 4 extent of the area where the species is distributed 5 number of subpopulations and their size and 6 reproductive potential2 when party is interested in including deleting or changing the appendix of species under cites it must submit propos to amend the listing based on set of criteria to adopt an amendment base d on proposal twothirds of the parties voting must vote in favor the set of criteria used to justify changes in the listings have evolved over the years when cites took effect in 1975 several species had already been identified for inclusion in the appendices at the first cop criteria for including species under cites were pr omulgated and included the submission of data on population size and range of the species in 1994 new criteria for listing species under cites were adopted these criteria include meters based on the level of internationa l trade of the species distribu tion and population size of the species nature and intensity of threats faci ng the species eg habitat loss diseasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32751crs3 3 criteria presented are based on summary provided by the gao protected species report pp 2122 4 w wijnstekers the evolution of cites 7th edition geneva cites secretariat switzerland 2003 hereafter referred to as the evolution of cites 5 to view the text of cites see httpwwwcitesorgengdisctextshtml accessed feb 1 2008 6 reexport certificate is granted for ppendix i species being exported from country that previously imported it for example if the united states imported species from kenya where it was listed originally then exported it reexport permit would be necessary this would also include items s ubsequently converted to manufactured goodsand pollution management of the species conservation of the species in its range country and consultations with other countries where the species are found3 there are three appendices in cites th at correspond to different levels of protection from international trade under cites any species subspecies or geographically separate popul ation of species can be listed once listed under cites species can be traded between countries only with the proper permits permits are given if trade is not expected to be detrimental to the survival of the species certificates of exemption are granted when trade in species meets specified set of criteria for exemption4 see exemptions below for further discussion article ii of the treaty pr ovides conditions under which species are to be included in each appendix5 appendix i the most stringent restrictions on trade are for species listed in appendix i for appendix i article ii states appendix i shall include all species threat ened with extinction which are or may be affected by trade trade in specim ens of these species must be subject to particularly strict regulation in order not to endanger further their survival and must only be authorized in exceptional circumstances cites generally prohibits commercial international trade in specimens of these species circumstances under which these sp ecies can be traded include scientific exchange breeding or educational progra ms both an import and an export permit or reexport certificate6 are required for the limited trade allowed for species in appendix i for example in the recent co p countries agreed to allow namibia and south africa to kill and export five black rh inoceroses year with proceeds of the sale and hunt to be provided for black rh inoceros conservation programs the black rhinoceros is an appendix i species appendix ii according to article ii appendix ii species are all species which although not necessa rily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilization in compatible with thei r survival and b other species which must be subject to re gulation in order that trade in specimens of certain species referred to in subparagraph of this paragraph may be brought under effective controlhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32751crs4 trade in appendix ii species is less restrictive than trade in appendix i species and exchange is permitted for commercial purposes if trade will not be detrimental to the species in the wild for example trade of appendix ii species requires only an export permit from the country of or igin unless the importing country has imposed additional requirement s which is allowed under cites in certain cases cites treats individuals or pa rts of appendix i species as appendix ii species if they have been bred in captivity or artificially propa gated in addition an introduction fromthesea certificate is required for the import of appendix i or ii specimens taken from the high seas outside of any countrys jurisdiction appendix iii appendix iii species classified under cites include all species which any party identifies as being subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for the purpose of preventin g or restricting exploitation and as needing the cooperation of other parties in the control of trade international trade of appendix iii species may require one of the following three documents 1 export permit grante d for species coming from the country that listed it 2 reexport permit granted for appendix iii species being exported from country that previously imported it or 3 certificate of origin for appendix iii specimens that are being exported from c ountry other than the listing country for example if the united states wished to allow the export of turtle dove hatched in the us certificate of origin would be issued because the species was originally listed by ghana certificate of origin requires that the specimens were legally obtained from within the exporting country th ere is requirement to show that the trade in the specimen would not be detrimental to the species survival since it was not from the listed population permit regulations appendix i specimens re quire both an import and export permit for trade between party nations if nonparty nation is involved the party nation must provide the appropriate import or export permit depending on the trade of the species appendix i specimens acquired abroad by individuals outside their country of usual residence may not be imported into the united states without cites permits permit under cites is not required for domestic trade within party nation importing or exporting hunted animal trophies are the dominant use of wildlife according to permit applications issued in 2003 see figure 1 if party enters reservation the transaction does not require permit from or into the country taking the reservation but would require permit from the importing or exporting country if it is cites signator reservation for particular species can occur when party detracts from the lis ting of species in question because it finds the listing of the species unacceptable the party is required to abide by the rules of the convention with regard to ev ery other species excep t for those on which it has taken reservation til reservation is removed th at party is treated as nonparty state by other signator ies for trade in that species switzerland and liechtenstein have registered the mo st reservations 53 and 45 respectively these reservations are prima rily for bird species amphibians and some mammals iceland norway ja pan and palau have listed reservati ons for several marine species the united states has

2002 346 p hereafter referred to as policing international trade source gao protected species report exemptions in some situations certificates of exemption may be issued in lieu of permits certificat of exemption are issued for preconvention specimens or for species that are part of scientific exchanges preconvention specimens are those specimens acquired before the species was listed under cites scientific exchange is the noncommercial exchange of specimens between registered scientific institutions further management authorities may waive the permit or certificate requirement for specimens that are part of traveling zoo circus plant exhibition or other traveling exhibition administration of cites the administration of cites is divided into the secretariat the management and scientific authorities and the confer ence of the parties the secretariat is housed within the united nations envir onment programme in geneva switzerland and is funded by par ties through trust fund the s ecretariat has broad range of duties that include organizing meetings of the parties preparing reports on the meetings and publishing annual status repor ts the secretariat is also responsible for undertaking scientific nd technical studies that w ill contribute toward implementing cites7 each party to cites is responsible for creating its own management and scientific author ities the

of citesthe specimen was obtained throug h the violation of any domestic laws living specimen will be prepared and shipped in manner not detrimental to its health or welfare an import permit has been granted for appendix i species before an export permit can be granted the import of specimens on ppendix i is primarily for non commercial purposes and the necessary advice from the scientific authority has been issued management authorities must also keep records of trade care for species in transit and designate exit and entry poi nts for trade among other things the functions of scientific authorities are defined in part by cites and the party among other things scientific authorities are required to determine whether imports or exports of cites species will have harmful effect on the conservation status of species the intended facility for caring an imported live specimen of listed animal is adequately equipped to conserve and care for it and import restrictions for specimen to the country should be propos ed because trade may have negative effect on the status of the species in th wild or because the introduction of the specimen into the country would present an ecological threat to native species conference of the parties the conference of the parties cop convenes every two to three years at these meetings the parties vote on adopting amendments to appendices i and ii re view the progress of the convention in meeting its goals and make recommendati ons for improving cites taking actions on substantive proposals or making major pr ocedural changes usually requires two thirds vote by the parties however many other decisions are made by consensus8 attendance at the cop is not limited to party members observers are invited to attend and generally incl ude nonparties to cites the united nations and its agencies nongovernmental organizations and any international or national body government or not that is technically qualified in protec tion conservation or management of wild fauna or flora9 while all present can participate only party members can vote there have been 14 cops since the convention convened in 1973 the most

commissions ban on commercial wha ling continues therefore whale species will be subject to the cites periodic review process prowhaling countries anticipated that reviews of listed whale species would result in more relaxe d trade and harvest restrictions several species of sa wfish and the european eel were listed under cites however some species of sharks were not listed and some species of coral were not uplisted to appendix ii as proposed by the united states single sale of lega lly obtained ivory from healthy elephant herds was approved for four african range states this sale was granted before nineyear ban on ivory sales is to be implemented this sale is in addition to 60ton sale of ivory granted to range states in 2002 raising captive tigers for international trade in tiger parts was rejected by cites member countri china was urged to phase out its commercial tiger farms several other terrestrial animals were also considered for listing uplisting and downlisting under cites new timber species was added to the list of cites protected species the trade in brazilwood will now require cites permits although exports of bows for musical instruments are exempted proposal to uplist cedrula to appendix ii was withdrawn enforcement of cites the enforcement of cites is primarily the responsibility of the party countries parties are required to enact and implement legislation that will prohibit trade that violates the treaty as well as provide for penalties for violations and the confiscation and where feasible the return of illega lly traded specimens under article v iii other enforcement activities are listed and include 1 designation of ports of entry and exit for species 2 care for living specimens 3 maintenance of detailed records on the import and export of listed sp ecies and 4 preparation of biennial report on the regulatory measures taken to force the provisions of the treaty party countries are also allowed to adopt stricter domestic meas

parties from the inception of the treaty to cop13 many of the changes for new regulations explain procedures and requi rements already in effect specific requirements related to documentation and reporting of activities and definitions of new terms among other things according to fws cites and the endangered species act the implements cites in the ited states although the and cites have legal distinction many sp ecies are included in both the and cites lists making these lists overlapping but not identical the protects approximately 1830 sp ecies of which 560 species are in foreign countries under the the secretary of the interior is authorized to consider actions taken by foreign g overnments or agencies on species when determining if foreign species should be listed further the secretary must make determinations for listing species based on the best available scientific and commercial data which may include foreign sources and taking into account efforts by foreign governments and agencies14 currently the fws reviews foreign species under the listing criteria and goes through required regulatory and public comment process before listing foreign species under the although there are similarities between cites and the in listing and protecting species several f undamental differences exist the and cites have similar rationales for listing species namely that there is threat to the survival of the species under cites this threat is specifically associated with the harvesting of the species or their parts for internati onal trade although ot her parameters may be considered under the consideration of the threat to survival is broader and includes factors such as habitat loss disease and predation as well as trade andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32751crs10

hereafter referred to as the draft policy 17 draft policy 18 ibidconsumption many species fall under both these defi nitions of threat and consequently are listed under both the and cites this does imply that species listed under both lists have qual levels of protection for example the canadian wood bison is listed under appendix ii in ci tes yet is listed as endangered under the thus us hunter could gally hunt wood bison in canada but not import his trophies into the united states without permit from both the united states and canada species that are not prohibited fo r trade under cites yet are listed as threatened or endangered under the can be imported to the united states if they meet requirements of 10 or 4d of the and have cites pe rmits if they are listed under cites section 10 of the llows for the secretary to issue permit for the take of an endangered species when it 1 is incidental in conducting an otherwise lawful activity 2 is shown to enhance the survival of the affected species in the wild or 3 is for scientific pur poses for example 10 permits have been issued for the import of endangered giant pandas cheetahs and asian elephants for scientific research and genera lly not for incidental take15 section 10 allows permit requests for importing sport hunting tropies however such requests are routinely denied according to the fws16 under cites exceptions for sporthunting trophies under quota are sometimes granted for taki ng species listed under appendix i and ii if it is determined to ve detriment to the population section 4d under the authorizes the creation of special rules for conserving threatened species under 4d the secret ary of the interior may issue rules for threatened species that deviate from the protections given to endangered species including rules which may permit so trade in the species or its products otherwise threatened species generally have all legal protections allocated to endangered species under this author ity the fws has issued several rules pertaining to threatened species under the that ar also listed as appendix ii species under cites the fws has lifted im port bans and in some cases allowed the import of sporthunted trophies of some threatened species when it was shown that regulated trade would be an incentiv for developing conservation programs in the species countries of origin17 for example some species of saltwater crocodiles listed as threatened under the have 4d rule that allows for the import of body parts from managed populations this rule was implemented under the premise that limited trade in crocodile body part s would encourage the development of conservation programs in their native country18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32751crs11 19 for other examples see the gao endangered species report p 34 20 incidental take permits make it legal to take listed species under certain circumstances to obtain permit landowner must prepare habitat conservation plan hcp approved by the fws to protect endangered species on the landowners property by entering into an hcp landowners can receive an incidental take permit whereby they can take an endangered species if they are engaged in otherwise lawful activity eg such as land clearing 21 for summary of the arguments for and against stricter domestic measures see the gao protected species report pp 3641 22 draft policythe protection of species listed as endangered under the and listed in appendix i of cites is not equivalent cites allows for the trade in endangered species if trade is not detrimental to the surv ival of the species the requires that importing endangered species have ne t result of enhancing the survival of the species for example ch eetahs are appendix i species under cites and listed as endangered under the under cites some countries have been allowed to participate in the limited trade of sport hunted cheetahs because it was shown that this trade would not be detriment to the population under the however the fws has not issued permits for importin g sporthunted cheetah trophies because their take has not been shown to enhance th survival of the species in their range country19 limited take of endangered species under the and cites is allowed in some cases where the objective is scien tific research conser vation or education further under the permits that allow incidental take during otherwise lawful actions may also be granted20 many have suggested that these fundamental differences between regulation under cites and the demonstr ate that the is stricter than cites with regards to species protection the issue of whether or not to have stricter domestic measures compared to cites for foreign endangered species is an ongoing debate21 according to the gao some proponents of stricter domestic measures argue that cites is focused only on the trade of endangered species rather than the overall protection and conservation of the species eg protec ting habitat within the range country further some argue that stricter domestic measures will facilitate enforcement and allow the united states to focus its protec tion efforts on species without seeking the consent of other parties others argue that stricter domestic enforcement discourages developing countries from creating conser vation programs that would benefit from trade in protected wildlife species the fws has addressed this issue by proposing policy that would allow limited trade in foreign endangered species if funds used to obtain those species are invested in conservation programs to enhance the species survival22 the proposed policy to issue enhancement of survival permits has been met with controversy some supporters believe that the policy is one of the few ways the united states can provide incentives for conservation in deve loping countries others have responded to the draft policy with skepticism of its possible benefits for endangered specieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32751crs12 23 ibid 24 gao protected species report 25 ibid 26 policing international trade and argue that the policy is too vague and may spur an increase in smuggling23 further some argue that the policy pl aces too much responsibility in the range country for operating and maintaining conservation programs the department of the interior doi has stated that permits will only be given if substantive conservation program is in place and is enhanc ing the survival of the species final decision on the proposed policy is still pending implementation of cites successes and problems the implementation of cites has generated several success stories along with controversy and problems arguably th success of cites can be summarized with the fact that species listed under cites w ithin the last 30 years has gone extinct successes cites is one of the worlds most widely accepted treaties with over 172 signatories many argue that it s significantly increased monitoring and control of international wildlife trade nd has played part in the conservation of many species that may have gone extinct if freely traded another possible factor in the success of cites is that the listings have steadily increased since its inception some attribute this increase to better monitoring and analysis of trade as well as more participating countries some claim that success of cites is its increased use of sciencebased criteria to consider listings24 although it is difficult to attribute the conservation of species solely to cites several species have noticeably improved since being listed on cites25 for example in 1989 cites banned international trade in ivory which was considered the major cause of declining elephant populations 50 population decline from 19791989 since the ban on ivory some major ivory markets have close d poaching has been reduced and some elephant populations ve steadily recovered problems with implementation although cites has recorded some success several problems with implementa tion remain some of these problems include insufficient enforcement in fore ign countries comple x and controversial species and specimens to monitor low penalties for violations and the use of reservations although parties to the treaty are oblig ated to implement legislation upholding cites and to establish management and scientific authorities some have failed to do so and consequently have not effectively enforced the treaty for example as of 2002 nearly 50 of the parties had not implemented legislation that would sufficiently cover the main responsibilities of cites including 1 establishment of management and scientific authorities 2 prohibition of trade in violation of cites 3 penalties for violations and 4 protocols for confiscating illegally traded specimens26 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32751crs13 27 cites tiger technical mission report geneva switzerland 1999 28 cites secretariat strategic vision through 2005 geneva switzerland 2000 available online at httpwwwcitesorgengnewsenglish20strategiespdf accessed january 22 2007some also argue that many countries l ack the resources to police and monitor international wildlife trade through their c ountry and consider vi olations of wildlife trade low priority in many countri specialized wildlife law enforcement officials do not exist and enforcement of wildlife crimes is not high priority barriers toward effective enforcement in range states include 1 corruption in government which contributes to the inability of range states to monitor and control wildlife crime 2 collusion between wildlife poachers and law enforcement officials and 3 low priority for c onservation in their federal or national governments27 some believe that penalties for cites violations in party nations are not adequate to prevent illegal wildlife trade cites does not provide guidance on the level or types of penalties to impose and how the parties penalize violators varies widely several countries for example do not have penalties fo r illicit wildlife trade cites does however state that violations should at least result in the confiscation of the wildlife and products which itself can be costly penalty the use of reservations by countries to exempt themselves from the regulations associated with species that the party objects to having listed is considered by many to be significant threat to the implementation of cites once reservation is taken the party is treated as nonparty with respect to that particular species and can engage in unrestricted trade with ot her nonparty nations or party nations that have the same reservations reservation can only be ma when country becomes party or when an amendment is adopted yet can be dropped at any time supporters of reservations argue that it provides country with the opportunity to object to the listing of one species without having to withdraw from the entire convention critics however argue that re servations are loophole that can result in the depletion of an endangered species if trade is not controlled further some argue reservations decrease the ability of cites to protect endangered species from excessive trade several of these implementation pr oblems are being addressed by the secretariat for example in the strategic vision of cites through 2005 the secretariat is aiming to increase the capacity of party nations to implement domestic legislation and policies to support cites as well as increase the cooperation and communication among other

biological diversity and the world conservation unionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32751crs14 conclusion the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites of is an international treaty that is steadily gaining acceptance in the world and growing in terms of its appli cation while most believe that the treaty has been effective in curbing the international trade of endangered and threatened species some argue that there are still many issues and problems with the implementation of the treaty the biggest problem according to some is the lack of implementing legislation and hence enforcement mechanisms in several party nations this compromises the effectiveness of the treaty and lowers the value of enforcement and monitoring activities in complying party nations in the united states the comparison between domestic regulations and cites regulations for foreign endangered species may be an emerging issue although fundamental differences in protection and criteria for listing species exist between the endangered species act and cites there seems to be consensus that the has stricter measures than cites however there does not appear to be consensus that stricter measures under the would necessarily be more effective than cites in protecting foreign endangered species attempts to reconcile the programs in some aspects are pending as the fws is reviewing proposed policy to grant enhancement of survival permits under the that woul d follow similar practices already conducted under cites
