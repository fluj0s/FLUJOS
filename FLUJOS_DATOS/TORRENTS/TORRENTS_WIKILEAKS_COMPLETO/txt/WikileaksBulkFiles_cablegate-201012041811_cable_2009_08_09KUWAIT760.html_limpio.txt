disputes be under the aegis s on iran kuwaits head of military intelligence said the fate of iran is in supreme leader khameneis hands he must either compromise with ayatollah rafsanjani or continue to support president ahmadinejad he assessed that the public had crossed the fear line and continued protests against the government were possibility he thought it would be important to see the supreme leaders response to protests continued unrest and government repression may be the catalyst that provokes iranian security forces to crack down align with the masses or fracture c on ct general petraeus noted usg appreciation for recent ct actions by kuwaits interior ministry forces and said passage of comprehensive antiterror legislation would greatly facilitate further efforts c

progress petraeus also thanked the gok for its financial reconstruction and moral support for iraq during oif he urged that the gok continue to remain open to negotiate disputes between iraq and kuwait and hoped that such negotiations would be concluded successfully he assessed that with assistance from its arab neighbors iraq would muddle through towards stability though establishing iraqi stability absorbs great amount of usg focus he reassured the dcos that kuwaiti security would remain priority for the us and also promised that the us would closely coordinate with the gok on working through the logistics of support for the withdrawal of us forces from iraq through kuwait gen petraeus said iraqi pm malikis visit to washington would provide an opportunity for discussion on issues of concern to kuwait such as compensation borders and recovering the remains of kuwaiti prisoners still missing from the 1990 invasion and iraqi occupation general petraeus briefed the dcos on levels of violence in iraq noting that the surge of us forces fighting sidebyside with iraqi forces that now number nearly 650000 has contributed greatly to growing stability us combat forces have completed

expertise 3 c in response the dcos who was personally held as pow during the iraqi invasion expressed desire to rebuild relations with iraq but echoing the policy of the gok said that all

discussion on iran asserted that the future of iran and its relations with its regional neighbors is in the hands of supreme leader grand ayatollah khamenei the direction in which khamenei will lead iran in this postpresidential election era will largely depend on whether he forges compromise with ayatollah ali akbar rafsanjani or continues to pull the puppet strings of president mahmoud ahmadinejad alhadhoud said the iranian public in staging mass protests in the wake of the elections had crossed the fear line the next test for iran will be to face the future reactions of the iranian revolutionary guard corps irgc and to what extent the irgc the basij militia and the regular army are ordered to maintain security he questioned whether the irgc would hold ranks with khamenei or begin to sympathize with the iranian masses should further crackdowns be instigated as happened with the iranian army when it fractured and many joined the mass student protests in the 1979 islamic revolution alhadhoud predicted that such tripwire to tip the balance would be the arrest of presidential challenger mir housein mousavi the dcos also mentioned kuwaiti understanding that iran was supporting shia in the gulf and extremists in yemen gen petraeus asked for assistance in determining if iran was in particular supporting the alhouthi in yemen 5 s gen petraeus assured the dcos that

individuals of mutual concern he conveyed to the dcos that passage of comprehensive ct legislation would greatly facilitate further cooperation in this critical area general petraeus observed that

bilateral defense cooperation agreement signed in 1991 renewed in 2001 had proved mutually beneficial and that the usg is inclined to renew it in 2011 he also said that he was looking forward to the
