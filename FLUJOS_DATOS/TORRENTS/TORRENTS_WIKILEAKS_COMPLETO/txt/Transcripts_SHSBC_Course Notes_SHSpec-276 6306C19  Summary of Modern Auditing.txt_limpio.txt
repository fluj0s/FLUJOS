6306c19 shspec276 summary of modern auditing processes fall into categories according to which case conditions they handle cases deteriorate as they go down the time track one factor against which they deteriorate is confront and the other factor is duplication confront has to do with willingness and duplication has to do with ability as the pc becomes less willing to confront he becomes less able to duplicate similarly processes are allowed to deteriorate and fade out of use through failure of willingness to confront and ability to duplicate cchs for example went out for five years through getting down into the effort band there was duplication you would have very exact sort of process if you ran what are you able tounable to duplicate along with other flows you add more legs to it as the case needs more complexity highscale case not being much troubled by flows could go far on one leg only you can get different viewpoints on different flows also this can give you ta action where you might not otherwise get it you add enough brackets to get ta there is perfect way to run brackets since the number of available flows is virtually infinite the idea of flows is something that monitors all case levels and breaks its back around level 4 above level 4 any or all flows could be run person well downscale below level 4 almost at the bottom can only run one flow such person cant function on any other dynamic than the first he cant conceive of another viewpoint though he needs to run more than one flow there is problem here this is problem of the dynamics how many can person function on there are many facets of processing by which you could match up case to its ideal process you might be able to figure out the perfect process mathematically but there is the point about the need for workability that we mustnt lose sight of process should not be perfect it should be complex enough to be workable the complexity factor also goes into the number of processes you need we should not emulate modern science modern science is method of precisely determining overwhelming nonsense we also have to determine the common denominators present in all cases the processes that have survived the development of scientology are those that have broad workability they include arc the midruds buttons and common incidents on the time track the common denominators of all cases kraepelins list of psychiatric case types is ridiculous it is like saying i am auditing betty so it is betty case type or well everybody is george case type in the first case you get too many case types in the second case you get too few there is middle ground this is finite number of case types classified according to their behavior in auditing sessions and larger but still finite number of processes it is only useful to divide cases up into case types so that you can match them up to the processes the case types are based on behavior in session not in life you get finite number of them then match them up with processes that raise the pc upscale you cant expect auditors to memorize more than few types of auditing processes perfectly if you expect more of auditors than this they end up mixing types and styles of auditing and you get hash repetitive processing seems easy now that you are familiar with it in fact any type of processing you have learned well presents particular problem cchs got badly learned they are kid glove type of process since cases that get cchs exclusively are low on the effect scale and cant tolerate being mauled about lrh tells an anecdote about dropping cchs because they werent getting results then giving tvd and discovering that one knew what he was doing they had utterly alterised the process it was then that he stopped just creating new processes and began to insist on perfect duplication of what had already been developed we stopped accumulating process types when lrh found out that it was variation that made processes and process types stop producing results people shifting from the original type of process would then apparently bring about need for new process type process types are dependent on how many you can keep in line how to keep processes in line and working is more important factor than you might think when process seems to have stopped working you will find that variations from the original have crept in the simpler process types tend to survive better than the more complicated ones they are also perhaps easier to keep in line in their unvaried form but even the simpler ones will drift out of line process can die when it is too simple and gets used very seldom reach and withdraw is good example of this type of process it works at level 8 and is the only type of process you could use on an animal processes that work very slowly also tend to get dropped since they are seldom run to flat point so you dont see results we dont really know how much reach and withdraw processes can do processes can vanish because of disrespect we use one diffidently arc processing disappeared for awhile because of this that they are the only workable processes for certain type of case gets lost and so those cases get lost reach and withdraw is one of these it is slow but sure and it is almost lost from lack of respect for its potential there are lots of processes in the band of reach and withdraw that are ignored book and bottle hangs right in between reach and withdraw and cchs it contains duplication like the latter but is the former type of process lots of cases wont move unless run on these processes they wont move on cchs we mustnt lose processes we have been pressing so much at the top of the scale of cases that the bottom has been neglected so these lower scale processes have dropped out the next division in processing is what the auditor knows is wrong with the case vs what can be done with the case these can be two very different things modern processes have nothing to do with what is wrong with the case the viewpoint of curing specific conditions by specific processes is an outmoded viewpoint left over from old medical practices one must run what the pc can run and not fixate on curing that is sort of q and ii case with temporary relapse into heavy problems may not be able for the moment to be run on problems repetitivetype process therefore you had better be able to undercut problems processes if case is dramatizing something that something is not real to the case that is guiding rule of processing what you are guided by is not are we handling what is obviously wrong with him but does the case respond to the process that is being run on the case 1e does the case get ta when the ruds for the session are in you must of course check that 1 the session ruds are in 2 flows are in line 3 the process is not already flat or unsuitable for instance speaking of flows most of the stuff we run eg the helatrobus implants are motivators so if you had ta and it ceased after you had run several flows the flows may be getting stuck we are interested in increasing the capabilities of the case he should at least be getting easier to audit because that means that he is getting more responsive to external orders getting more capable of viewing his track and pictures getting into less trouble getting better at locating bpc the case would be getting more done per session too auditors tend not to notice that case is paining and winning because they are too close to the case and they dont observe the slow gradient the way to spot it is to notice how the case was month ago if the case is progressing well if he is interested in and happy doing what he is doing dont change it unless there is ta for long time give ta motion time to develop also it may take several sessions to establish the pcs case level run engrams using the precise system and commands given the precision of the system tends to develop the pcs precision on the track dont word the item too adventurously make it finite enough so that there is hope of reaching basic it should be something he is worried about and can reach if you run chain of being held still you are asking for lots of still points which may be hard to get to the root of what you validate you produce with the exception that getting the pc to confront what he doesnt want to lets him take over the automaticity of producing it so it stops being produced modern processes are built on and monitor the degree of withdrawal of the person into himself and those things that will lead the pc out from himself so he is longer so restricted thus reach and withdraw is the most basic action you should have some idea about types of processes how and why they work and what case level they are most effective on and you should get good at estimating where the case must lie and upgrading the case from that point always run the case little steeper than it thinks it should be run the reaction of the case in terms of protest or arc break has almost bearing on whether what you are running is the right process you look amidst the yap yap and see if the pc is running the auditing command protest is common denominator of the whole track and this universe it is how the thetan makes pictured it is more fundamental than duplicating
