states issues for us policy 2006 summary the usled war to overthrow saddam hussein virtually ended iraqs ability to militarily threaten the region but it s produced new and unanticipated security challenges for the persian gulf states s audi arabia kuwait bahrain qatar oman and the united arab emirates the gulf states which are all led by sunni muslim regimes fear that shiite iran is unchecked now that iraq is strategically weak the gulf states strongly resent that proir anian shiite muslim groups and their kurdish allies who are not arabs ve obtained preponderant power within iraq this has led most of the gulf states particularly saudi arabia to provide only halting support to the fledgling government in baghdad nd to revive the focus on usgulf defense cooperation that characterized us gulf relations during the 1990s the new power structure in iraq has d political repercussions throughout the gulf region particularly as sunnishiite violence in iraq has come to overshadow direct insurgent violence against us forces as the key threat to iraqi stability the sunnishiite tensions in iraq apparently are spilling over into the gulf states shiite communities particularly that in bahrain have been emboldened by events in iraq to seek additional power and sunnishiite tension in the gulf states is said by observers to be increasing some shiite communities which view themselves as long repressed are attempting to benefit politically from the bush administrations focus on promoting democracy and political reform in the region domestically all of the gulf states are undertaking substantial but gradual economic and political liberalization to deflect popular pressure and satisfy us calls fo r reform however the reforms undertaken or planned do not aim to funda mentally restructure power in any of these states the bush administration advocates more rapid and sweeping political and economic liberalization as key to longterm gulf stability and to reducing support in the gulf states for terrorist groups such as q aeda the administration is funding civil society programs in the gulf states f unding that is not necessarily welcomed by the gulf leaderships but it is also pr omoting the bilateral free trade agreements that most of the gulf leaders seek the bush administration also is working to maintain or improve post september 11 cooperation with the gulf states against qaeda some gulf states allegedly tolerated the presence of q aeda activists and their funding mechanisms prior to the september 11 attacks fifteen of the nineteen september 11

jeopardizing the security of the gulf monarchy states which collectively backed iraq similarly the united states tilted toward iraq in that war to defeat the radical islamist threat posed by irans islamic revolutionary governme nt which came to power in february 1979 after ousting the usbacked shah iran and the united states fought minor naval skirmishes during 19871988 at the height of the iraniraq war during one such skirmish operation praying mantis april 18 1988 the united states fought day long naval battle with iran that destroyed almost half of irans largest naval vessels on july

casualties the iraniraq war ceased in august 1988 after irans forces collapsed from series of successful iraqi offensives and iran accepted security council resolution 598 amounting to an iraqi victory in the war httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31533crs2 2 the missiles were supplied by russia but iraq enhanced their range to be able to reach tehran which is about 350 miles from the iraq border the

of the use of chemical weapons in the conflict between the islamic republic of iran and iraq april 25 1988 the iraniraq war victory emboldened sadda m hussein to assert himself as the strongman of the gulf he invade d and occupied kuwait on august 2 1990 asserting that he did so because ku wait and uae were overproducing oil and thereby betraying iraq by lowering worl d oil prices ot hers believe saddam hussein wanted to position iraq to control directly or indirectly oil exports from the gulf to liberate kuwait the united states deployed over 500000 us troops joined by about 200000 troops from 33 other countries that war operation desert storm january 16 februa ry 27 1991 resulted in the death in action of 148 us service personnel and 138 nonba ttle deaths along with 458 wounded in action the 1991 gulf war reduced iraqs conventiona l military capabilities roughly by half but prior to operation iraqi freedom march 2003 iraq was still superior to iran and the gulf states in ground forces the gulf is one of the few theaters wh ere weapons of mass destruction wmd and ballistic missiles have been used in hostilities iraqs missile chemical nuclear and biological programs accelerated during the iraniraq war were among the most sophisticated in the third world at the time of iraqs invasion of kuwait israel was sufficiently concerned about iraqs nuclear program that it conducted an airstrike against iraqs frenchbuilt osir ak nuclear reactor on june 7 1981 temporarily tting back iraqs nuclear effort during the iraniraq war iraq fired enhanced scud missiles at iranian cities2 and iran fired its own scud missiles at iraqi cities as well in the socalled war of the cities on ten occasions during the iraniraq war iraq used chemical weapons against iranian tr oops and kurdish gue rrillas and civilians killing over 26000 iranians and kurds3 investigation missions found that iran also used some chemical weapons agai nst iraq during the war although irans capability was less advanced than that of iraq during that period4 during the 1991 gulf war iraq fired 39 enhanced scud miss iles at israel us ally and 39 enhanced scud missiles on targets in saudi arabia one iraqi missile fired on coalition forces on february 25 1991 during sert storm hit us barracks near dhahran saudi arabia killing 28 military personnel and wounding 97 weapons inspectors dismantled much of iraqs wmd infrastructure during 19911998 but they left in 1998 due to iraqi obstructions and without clearing up major unresolved questions about iraqs wmd new inspections began under threat of us force in november 2002 but were nded after the bush admin istration and its allies determined that iraqs regime was not fully disarming and that it was necessary to overthrow the regime by force operation iraqi freedom oifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31533crs3 the dual containment approach of the 1990s during 19931997 the clinton administra tion articulated policy of dual containment an effort to keep both iran and iraq weak rather than alternately tilting toward one or the other to preserve power balance between them during this period saudi arabia and ku wait were primarily concer ned about the conventional threat from iraq and saw iran as counterwe ight to iraqi power the states of the lower gulf were further from iraq and tended to view iran as greater danger than iraq bahrain in 1981 and again in 1996 the latter period of substantial shiite inspired unrest openly accused iran of plotting to destabilize that c ountry by supporting radical shiite movements ther in 1992 the uae became alarmed at iranian intentions when iran asserted complete control of the largely uninhabited persian gulf island of abu musa which iran and uae shared under 1971 bilateral agreement all the gulf states improved relations with iran significantly at the end of the decade particularly after the may 1997 elec tion of the relatively moderate president mohammad khatemi who curtailed irans support for shiite dissident movements in the gulf states despite the rapproc hement which was ma tched by unsuccessful attempts by the clinton administration to open direct talks with khatemis government the united states continued to try to constrain irans wmd programs but with mixed success unlike iraq which was the target of sanctions after it invaded kuwait iran faced mandatory in ternational restrictions on its imports of advanced conventional wea pons or of dual use tec hnology civilian goods useful for wmd some of irans wmd programs made significant strides during the 1990s reportedly with substan tial help from russia china north korea and other countries and entities such as the network of pakistani nuclear scientist aq khan the dual containment policy also had little success in curbing irans or iraqs support for international terrorism iran s been on the us list of terrorism state sponsors terrorism list since 1984 the lis t was created in 1979 iraq was on the terrorism list during 19791982 and again from 1990 until the usled overthrow of saddam hussein over the past decad the state departme nts annual report on terrorism has described iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism the islamic regime in iran d held american diplomats hostage during november 1979 january 1981 seizure for which iran has not apologized the proiranian lebanese

involved in the june 1996 bombing in saudi arabia of the khobar towers housing complex for us military officers in which 19 us airmen were killed alt hough some indications from the september 11

kenneth katzmaniraqs former regime was on the terrorism list and publicly supported palestinian violence against israel according to the september 11 commission report neither iran nor saddams iraq was linked to the september 11 attacks and neither had an opera tional relationship with q aeda however press accounts say that some qaeda activists fleeing af ghanistan transited or took refuge in both countries including qaedairaq leader abu musab alzarqawi5 and there apparently were some limited contacts between qaeda and the saddam hussein regime the new government in iraq whic h consists of political leaders who are generally well disposed toward the united states was removed from the terrorism list on september 24 2004 observer is pr edicting that iran will soon be removed from the us list of state sponsors of terrorism terrorism list the postsaddam gulf threat profile6 the gulf threat profile has been altered but not nece ssarily reduced by the overthrow of saddam husseins regime in iraq the fall of saddam had initially generated sense of relief among the gulf states because the conventional and wmd threat posed by iraq was essentia lly ended however clear us gulf security architecture has emerged and the gulf states now sense new and different threats although major security crises ve erupted in any of the gcc states since saddams fall others note that in the past crises have erupted on short notice including saddam husseins invasion of ku wait and the internal unrest in bahrain in the 1990s neither of whic h were widely predicted iran strategically strengthened first and foremost the gulf states believe that the strategic weakness of postsaddam iraq has emboldened iran to take more active role in gulf security and to seek to enlist the gulf states in an iranled gulf security structure iran has long coastline and wellhoned sense of nationhood it was not created by colonial powers and believes it is entitled to major role in gulf security all of th gulf state fears about iran have been compounded by the iranian presidency of hardliner mahmoud ah madinejad he has appointed to key positions longtime associ ates from his career in the revolutionary guard and basij militia both bastions of hardline sentiment and armed force and sponsors of radical activity in the gulf in the past however to date gcc leaders have leveled specific alle gations of renewed iranian meddling in the gcc states and the gulf leaders have been receivi ng visiting iranian leaders including ahmadinejad yet gulf and us concerns continue that further progress on irans wmd programs particularly its nuclear program could embolden iran to try to intimidate the gulf states qatar for example is wary that iran might try to encroach on its giant natural gas north field which the two share in response in 2006 the gulf states and the united states have renewe d and expanded discussions on some of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31533crs5 7 krane jim us seeks to bolster its gulf ties boston globe may 23 2006 joint defense initiatives that have been deemphasized in the past five years7 some of these steps are discussed in the secti on on defense issues below many us experts believe that the gcc states woul d likely back us action including military action to halt or set back irans nuclear pr ogram despite fears of iranian retaliation against them for any us military move against iran at the same time iran is not perceived as militarily able to move in force across the gulf to invade any of the gulf states even if the united states were not present in the gulf to block such move senior us military officials say iran could use its coastal missiles patrol boats mines aircraft submarines and other capabilities to try to block the strait of hormuz the ke oil shipment route but us officials express confidence that the us military presence in the gulf could quickly overwhelm irans relatively older equipmen t and thwart any such iranian action others argue that even failed iranian attempt to block the strait could raise shipping insurance rates and drive up oil prices to unprecedented levels shiite communities emboldened compounding the threat perception of the gulf states is the rise of shiite islamist factions in postsaddam iraq particularly revered clerical leader grand ayatollah ali alsistani the supreme council of the islamic revolution in iraq sciri the dawa islamic call party and the faction of radical young cleric m oqtada sadr the shiite islamists have dominated iraqs two elections for parliament in january and again in december 2005 the rise of iraqi shiite parties are reportedly prom pting growing shiite demands for power in the gulf states themse lves as shown in the appendix several of the gulf states have s ubstantial shiite popula tions in bahrain they are majority about 60 but most gulf shiite co mmunities consider themselves under represented in government and lacking key opportunities in the economy bahraini shiite groupings including those that boycotted 2002 parliament ary elections are planning to compete in the october 2006 parliamentary electi ons in the hopes of asserting shiite rights against the sunnidomin ated government there to prevent the emergence of sunnishiite tens ions that have erupted in iraq bahraini leaders have begun reconciliation efforts such as ending the distinction between sunni and shiite mosques and encouraging joint worship kuwaits concerns are also high ev though shiites about 25 of kuwaitis are well integrated into the political system radical factions of an iraqi shiite islamic party the dawa party attacked the us and french embassies in kuwait city in december 1983 and attacked the amirs motorcade in may 1985 injuring him slightly although kuwaiti fears of resumption of such activity have faded kuwait remains wary of potential shiite militance and has engaged iraqs shiite clerics and provided about 500 million in humanitarian aid to iraq through kuwait based humanitarian operati ons center kuwait has pled ged to send an ambassador to baghdad although ambassador has been named to date in saudi arabia there is acute fear of potential shiite unrest in part because shiites are concentrated in the eastern provinces where many of saudi arab ias oil fields are located and in which much of its oil export infrastructure is based resenting shiite domination in iraqhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31533crs6 8 meyer josh us faults saudi efforts on terrorism angeles times january 15 2006 saudi arabia has disbursed little of its 1 billion in aid pledges to iraq and it has not committed to appointing an ambassador to iraq spillover from iraq battlefield prior to the us intervention in iraq the gulf states had predicted that ousting saddam would not necessarily produce stability in iraq and several were re luctant to support it for the most part gulf leaders publicly indicated that they would only s upport us attack if such action were authorized by the united nations and had broad international s upport two of the gulf states kuwait and qatar were more openly supportive of the us position and both hosted substantial buildups of us for ces and equipment that were used in the offensive against iraq kuwait which str ongly wanted to see the former invader saddam hussein overthrown hosted the bulk of the personnel and equipment used in the ground assault saudi arabia was the most vocally opposed to us offensive against iraq even though the prospect of the overthrow of sa ddam hussein held out the possibility that the 6000 us personnel that were based there in antiiraq containment operations would be able to part that redeploy ment happened after saddams fall judging from the final statement of the 26th gulf cooperation council summit in abu dhabi uae december 2005 the gulf leaders are expressing concern that spillover from the iraq war could be worse than they had anticipated some sunni islamist insurgents have tried or succeeded in entering some of the gulf states particularly kuwait to commit acts of retribution against the gulf governments or to try to attack us forces staging fo r deployment into iraq the sunni militants perceive the gulf governments even thoug h they are sunniled as traitors for having backed or acquiesced in the us invasion of iraq and ouster of saddam hussein the gulf states believe that part s of iraq might become safe haven for sunni islamic militants if the united states were to wit hdraw militarily from iraq an outcome that the gulf states fear could result if us casualtie s continue to mount this issue is discussed in greater dept h in the final section of this paper at the same time efforts by the gulf states to promote ethnic and sectarian balance in iraq might be increasing the potential for spillover from iraq saudi arabia and possibly other gulf states are said to have tacitly permitting some saudis to enter iraq to assist the sunni insurgency there observers say there is an active debate in the kingdom about whether to provide more active support to the sunnis but that king abdullah has decided against it out of concern that doing so would stimulate iran to step up aid to shiite gr oups in iraq us military officers say that saudi fighters accounted for about lf of the foreign insurgents k illed in iraq in 20058 in november 2004 26 radical saudi clerics issued pronouncement calling on iraqis to fight usled forces in ira q although the saudi religious establishment subsequently contradicted that

the gcc states since the 1991 gulf war although some in congre ss have expressed re servations about sales of few of the more sophisticated weapons and armament packages to the gu lf states in recent years some members believe that sale s of sophisticated equipment could erode israels qualitative edge over its arab neighbor s if the gulf states were to join joint arab military action against israel or transfer weapons to frontline states but few experts believe that the gulf states would do so others are concerned that some us systems sold to the gulf contain missile technology that could violate international conventions even if they were to do so successive us administrations have maintained that th gulf states are too dependent on us training spare parts and armament codes to be in
