ncs needed to improve in the area of inter nal controls the project coordinator was responsible for preparing the financial reports au thorizing and approving expenditure and making cash disbursements similarly the manual accounti ng system needed to be enhanced although the expenditure was analysed according to the unhcr bud get structure accounting ledgers were not used also the filing system was deficient which rendered the retrieval of supporting documents cumbersome the representation has requested ncs to establish ppropriate internal control mechanisms and set up proper filing system the

response provided by the office was generally satisfactory with number of emergency experts ployed from headquarters and from the region to deal with the situation the representation exp erienced however number of shortcomings due to funding constraints and the lack of expertise by implementing partners for example from an approved administrative budget of us 571000 in m ay 2005 only us 270000 had been released by the end of the year also due the hap hazard nature of funding and the unpredictable nature of the emergency it has been difficult to at tract staff of the right calibre to the field 12 other difficulties experienced by the repr esentation in accra and its field office in ho included the lack of adequate office and communicat ion equipment for example the land cruisers procured in june 2005 were still not equipped with codan radios by the end of the year also there was lack of basic security equipment and devices at the field office in ho the representation stated

the colour of the vehicles delivered was different from unhcr standard colour specifications of white or light blue 3 14 oios recommended that the representation c omply with unhcr procurement procedures and that approval be sought from the lcc or hcc whe n their respective procurement thresholds so require and prior to committing unhcr funds the representation explained that the purchase orders were issued ahead of the approval of the hcc because the toyota land cruisers were fast moving commodities in ghana the supplier would t have kept the vehicles without firm commitment 15 the representation further pointed out that it made great deal of effort during the emergency to ensure adherence to the rules and regu lations but that circumstances made it practically impossible to follow them to the letter d security and safety 16 security at the field office in ho needed improvement recent security mission by the assistant field security advisor and the administra tive officer

was need to implement minimal security measures this would in clude perimeter fence installation of fire extinguishers metal detectors and electric generat ors since the audit the representation

required to make it fully compliant the represent ation also said that it would not be able to carry out the required upgrades unless additional funding was provided administration 17 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr representation in ghana generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under

manual chapter 6 32 the total budget amount and the obligation level cannot be exceeded increased exp enditure against specific budget chapter necessitates reduced expenditure under another chap ter oios noted however that the representation exceeded its procurement of nep by 3 4 per cent and temporary assistance by 19 per cent 19 the representation explained that budgetary overrun s were caused by payments made by headquarters on behalf of the representation which was not taken into account in the system by notional vouchers this information was not forwar ded to the representation despite request to headquarters oios could not be provided with information to pport this request despite this oios would highlight that it was the responsibility of the representation to adequately follow up with headquarters to obtain complete data and hence ensure full control over its annual budget and expenditure 4 20 the representation stressed the fact that it mainta ined adequate budgetary controls and the only reason for the perceived budgetary overruns wa s the time lag for information sharing from headquarters they firmly believed that it was up to headquarters to keep the field informed of the expenditure records they reiterated that the information for expenses recorded by headquarters was not provided in timely manner nd sometimes lacked clarity also given that the abcs produced locally by the fmisfoas did not evidence any overexpenditure the representation also explained that it could only be held responsible for the appropriate monitoring of expenses over which it has full control oios agrees that for expenditure incurred at headquarters on behalf of field offices appropriat communication mechanism should be in place to timely inform them of such expenditure oios ex pects that after the rollout of mrsp to field offices such problems should not arise in the mea ntime however it is important that field offices are timely informed of expenditure initiated and in curred on their behalf b wrong coding of expenditure 21 the expenditure was not always correctly c oded to the relevant budget chapter oios found that fuel costs had been charged in various instanc to travel the representation indicated that it has taken action to reverse the errors in the decem ber 2005 accounts v acknowledgement 22 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and
