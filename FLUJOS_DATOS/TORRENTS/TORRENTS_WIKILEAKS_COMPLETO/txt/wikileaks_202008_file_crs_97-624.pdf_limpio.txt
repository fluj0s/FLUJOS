gpo 1993 pp 1213a group of citizens the right to participate w ith full voice in the political affairs of the nation13 state laws many states have laws known as little hatch acts because of their similarity to the federal law which restrict political activity by state employees in 1987 the then house committee on post office and civil service rveyed the attorneys general of the 13 states which had liberalized their political activity laws si nce the 1974 amendments to the hatch act of 11 responses none reported adverse reactions to loosening the restrictions or expressed concern that coercion or impropr iety would result only alabama reported any allegations of coercion four states repor ted an increase in political participation by state employees and none reporte d any increase in prosecutions14 conclusion among the issues that discussions to am end the hatch act covering state or local government officers and employees might be expected to focus on are these whether the availability of federa l funds mandates political activity re strictions whether coercion and patronage would result from liberalized political activity law and whether the little hatch acts are sufficiently strong to pr event the misuse of government authority
