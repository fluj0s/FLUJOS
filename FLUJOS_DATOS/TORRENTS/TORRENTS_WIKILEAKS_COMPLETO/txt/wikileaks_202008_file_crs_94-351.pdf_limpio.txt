summary natos partnership for peace program seek s to encourage eligible states above all the states of the former warsaw p act and the former soviet union to build democracy and undertake greater responsib ilities in international security the program could open the door to but does not promise nato membership us and nato relations with russia are likely to be the determining factor in deciding whether states move from part nership to nato membership the partnership program established at natos summit of january 1011 1994 does not extend the alliances mutual security commitment to members the program requires that member states take steps towards an open defense budget and civilian control of the military and urges them to join with nato in future peacekeeping efforts it establishes an institutional structure in brussels for consultation with nato states as of august 3 1994 22 states had joined the clinton administration and natos initially stated intent was that partnership members would bear the brunt of the programs costs with alliance members contributing little president clinton may alter this course however as he has said he would seek 100 million for the program in the fy1996 budget russia will likely play pivotal role in the programs success or failure russia partnership adherent could use its membership as step to strengthen cooperation with the alliance and former members of the warsaw pact by joining in peacekeeping operations and encouraging di plomatic settlements of international disputes some observers however belie ve that the program opens the door to moscows interference in the affa irs of other partnership states several east european governments expr ess concern that nato by allowing russia into the partnership for peace has established soft yalta in which moscow can influence their future they believe that the united states and its allies may wish above all to avoi d tension with russia and acced for example to russian efforts to dissuade the alliance from ever allowing their entry into nato some critics of the partnership program believe that it may deflect the effort to build european security apparatus by providing moscow with opportunities to influence nato decisionmaking more directly than in the past and by diverting european states from developing new security institutions at moment when the united states is reducing its military presence on the continent in response the administration contends that the end of the cold war presents an historic opportunity to include russia in building democratic europe in which major security decisions are made in concert rather than across ideological or battle lines and that the partnership for peace is vehicle for such decisionmaking they also point out that credible alternative institution to nato exists to insure european securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94351abstract this report examines the origins of nato s partnership for peace pfp program in

1994partnership for peace introduction since the end of the cold war the united states and its nato allies have sought means to give renewed purpose to nato and to bring stability to eastern europe and the states of the former soviet union the nato summit in brussels on january 1011 1994 addressed these issues at the summit the united states endorsed european union eu efforts to build security and defense identity through the western european union weu to provide more flexibility for nato and selected nonnato forces to meet c ontingencies the llies established the combined joint task forces to pe rform missions in and beyond europe1 finally the united states proposed and nato adopt ed the partnership for peace intended to build stability in eastern europe and the former soviet union by outlining plan for greater cooperation in several military and civ ilian spheres between nato members and nonnato states background nato members began to design means for cooperation with the former warsaw pact states during the period when the soviet union was in early stages of collapse in 1991 natos intention was to ddress the security concerns of eastern european countries and to assure former dversaries of assistance in the transition to democratic rule the nacc in june 1991 nato adopted joint us german proposal to establish the north atlantic cooperation council nacc forum for consultation and cooperation and in some ways forerunner to partnershi p for peace consisting of the nato countries and open to former wa rsaw pact states and republics of the former soviet union it now has 38 member s the nacc as group holds general discussions on security as well as consu ltations on implementati on of arms control agreements relations between civilian and military sectors in democracy and means to convert defense industr ies to civilian industries member states also discuss range of environmental issues raised by the reliance on large militaries and defense industries during the cold war it has institutional apparatushttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94351crs2 2remarks by aspin at the atlantic c ouncil washington dc dec 3 1993 p 4nato leadership stated explicitly that the nacc could not be used by east european countries and the former soviet republics as stepping stone to nato membership nato wished to avoid involve ment in instability to its east and did not wish to dilute the alliances military effectiveness with new untried partners some east european states in particular have complained that the consultations are often more than seminars and that their exclusion from nato in the face of turmoil in russia has eroded stability the partnership for peace rising instability in russia beginning in 1992 led to rene wed debate over how to secure principal gain from the end of the cold war the independence of the east european states some european allies such as germany have urged nato membership for selected east eu ropean states as one avenue to that end at the same time russian officials warned that extending natos frontiers to the east would be interpreted in russia as an aggressive and destabilizing move in the fall of 1993 then secretary of defense aspin began to sketch program called partnership for peace secretary aspin said that the united states having seen the iron curtain lifted did not wish to replace it by drawing another line in europe that would exclude russia from new security arrangements2 russian legislative elections in december 1993 made the party of extrem nationalist vladimir zhirinovskiy the largest in the duma the strong popular support for zhirinovskiy stirred the debate over whether future government in moscow might return to imperialist policies and over possible nato initiatives to forestall such policies at the brussels summit of january 1011 1994 nato members endorsed the partnership for peace and opened the program to all nacc members as well as to other csce countries able and willing to contribute the partnerships purpose is to strengthen natos ties with the democratic states to the east under the plan nato will not extend article v protection the nato treatys mutual defense commitment in the

strengthen natos capacity to respond to security contingencies beyond the alliances mission of collective fense and open path to partnership countries for future membership in nat however the united

deci sion to invite country to become nato member after signing the framework document partnership members must then negotiate with nato prese ntation document that scribes how they intend to meet the

path to nat membership but rather as cooperative venture with nato in training for peacekeeping operations others including most east european states view the program as step to reach nato membership5

intention to keep alliance costs minimal in the program the likely heavy expense of bringing new members militaries to standards near those of nato is one factor serving as an impediment to expansion of the alliance us officials have estimated that natos 1994 costs for the program will be 14 million with the united states absorbing one quarter of that amount administration officials testified before congress in february 1994 that minimal longterm costs to the united states and its allies are envisioned in the program6 president clinton while in eastern europe in july 1994 appeared to change course on the issue of costs he told host governments that he would seek 100 million from congress in fy1996 for partnership for peace he indicated that 10 million of that amount woul d be for the three baltic states and 25 million for poland7 partnership members agree in the framework document to fund their own participation in partnership activities including sharing the costs of exercises costs borne by partnership members could be substantial and prove especially difficult to undertake in an era when their economies are restructuring and their publics are opposed to increased defense expenditures for example poland one of the first members now has defense ex penditures at 35 percent of its 1986 levels the polish government has estimated that its participation will co st 22 million annually for the next several years8 russias role russia is pivot around which the debate over the effectivene ss of partnership for peace revolves the policy of the c linton administration for involving russia in european security affairs remains in evolution the policy of not drawing new lines in europe seeks to include russia in new european security arrangements including possible membership one day in nato the administration wishes to persuade russia to play constructive role in europe us officials cite the peace brokered in sarajevo between serbs and bosnians in february 1994 as evidence of such role russias role in the continuing effort to bring peace settlement to all of bosnia is more ambivalent russian officials joined with us and european

other observers saw the russian stance as an indication of moscows intention to back brethren slavs against muslim forces in the larger picture it is possible that russia will selectively utiliz its newly found inclusion in western institutions such as the contact group to b ack potential client rather than pursuing solution deemed equitable nd achieved through consensus the administration has altered its position towards russia as the government of boris yeltsin has voiced right to influence the policies of states in the russian near abroad the former republics of the soviet union in february 1994 secretary of defense william perry said that partnershi p for peace could be used to form protective grouping against russia if things go wrong in moscow russia should pursue legitimate concerns on its borders but not by relying on the old soviet practices of in timidation and domination10 the nato states are sorting through moscows policies towards the near abroad in an effort to determine allied courses of action that will nurture the russian reform movement and deflect the yelts in government and its successors from aggressive steps towards its neighbors some observers believe that russia will not relinquish longstanding efforts to mana ge former soviet republics and parts of eastern europe as spheres of influence this view holds that some russians believe that their country was politically and milita rily diminished by the breakup of the soviet empire the russian center of that empire was confident and assured in dealing with european states when it held european peoples such as the balts under its wing or with central asian states ch as turkey and iran when it controlled republics such as georgia and turkmenistan in this view the logical continuation of such policies today is to exercise influence over european and central asian regions that have escaped moscows dir ect control in the last several years11 russias new postcold war military doctrine emerged in late 1993 its postulates include maintaining influence over the near abroad russia has sent its armed forces into several former central asian republics for peacekeeping purposes russian forces back compliant conservative regimes in countries such as tajikistan uzbekista n and turkmenistan12 in georgia russian forces after aiding rebels against the tblisi government ultimately rescued

countries have declined the offer on july 21 1994 the united states and several of its allies sponsored reso lution which passed approving the russian deployment in georgia the resolution also provided for the presence of observers to monitor the activities of the russian troops13 russia has warned that nato must not seek to exert influence in the former soviet empire its new military doctrine stat that the placing of foreign troops in states adjacent to russia would constitute an immediate threat14 member of yeltsins presidential council charged in j une 1994 that the united states was using nato to preserve and consolidate its military and political leadership in europe the partnership program with the ultimate goal of restricting and disciplining russia itself was but means to this end15 russian officials often describe nato in geostrategic terms the existence of nato forces in new states they contend would represent an extension of the use of resources such as ra ilroads airfields and ports all able to contribute to natos military strength and to diminish russian influence in europe16 russias interest in partnership for peace and eventual membership in nato has ebbed and flowed moscow several times delayed application for partnership status some russian officials say that russia wishes to become integrated in europe the country could benefit from great er access to european and us markets and progress in political reform would be more likely with increased exposure to open political systems in this view russian exclusion from nato would lead to sense that the west seeks to isolate ru ssia should countries such as poland or the baltic states eventually gain entry in the negotiating process leading to russias entry into the partnership some russian officials characterized the program as an affront to russia they contended that nato should give russia special status and consult moscow as an equal on all major security issues in europe nato must treat russia as great power having the right to influence the affairs of unstable states on its borders in order to protect its own interests some wester n officials present during the negotiations compared russian negotiating style to the heavyhanded tactics common during the soviet era and discerned pejorative tone towards russias former warsaw pact allies one observer characterized the russian attitude at the discussions russia wished not to be treated as little country from eastern europe having vulgar quarrels over the backyard fence with its neighbors or as

nato states agreed to consult with russia on major issues such as proliferation and the conflict in the former yugoslavia but did not give mosc ow right of review over nato decision making the alliance and russia agreed to broad enhanced dialogue and cooperation in areas where russia has unique and important cont ributions to make commensurate with its weight and responsib ility as major european international and nuclear power19 secretary of state warre n christopher described the agreement as one promising sixteen plus one discussions between nato and russia but he denied that such an arrangement gives russia higher status than that of other signatories he reiterated ear lier us strictures for improved relations between nato and russia european stability depends on respecting the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of all the states that emerged from the soviet empire we recognize russias legitimate concerns in this region but we have made it clear that country has right to assert role that is inconsistent with international norms20 eastern europe east european states opposed inclusion of russia in the partnership program and continue to oppose its possible inclus ion in nato some officials of east european governments contend russia will joy special status that amounts to soft yalta reference to the allied powers meeting near the end of the second world war where in the absence of east european representatives decisions were made contributing to the postwar divisi on of europe in this view nato is allowing moscow to drive western policy on expansion of the alliance and signalling russia that it may pursue policy of intimidation towards its former warsaw pact allies if it so desires elements of the german government are sympathetic to these east european views some german officials concerned that turmoil in eastern europe will bring flow of refugees and possible instability on its own soil advocate rapid pace of nato expansion that

impede the path to free markets and democracy some critics of partnershi p for peace believe that the program is facto recognition of russian influence in eastern europe one observer contends that the program retards rather than reinforces european unity by keeping east european states at arms length its seeming promis of security through eventual membership in nato masks an unwillingness of the united states and west european nato members to come to the aid of east european states in the event of crisis in so doing it deflects european states from th task of building their own effective security apparatus and more specifically east european states from strengthening such political building blocks as the visegrad group21 us interests beyond eastern europe are so at issue for example the united states wishes to see democracy take root in ukraine as step towards providing stability on russias borders and building state close to the west that abjures the maintenance and use of nuclear weapons ukraine is member of partnership for peace some ukrainian officials believe that inclusion of east european states in nato and exclusion of ukraine would isol ate kiev under russian influence many officials in nato countries believe that geography and russias traditional interests in ukraine and the baltic states also partnership members make the ultimate inclusion of these states in nato unlikely legislation on july 1 1994 senators hank brown nd paul simon offered an amendment to the fy1995 appropriations for foreign operations bill hr 4426 that would allow the president to transfer excess nonlethal defense artic under the foreign assistance act of 1961 to poland hung ary and the czech republic the administration had wished to delete references to speci fic countries that excluded other partnership members including russia the conference committee dropped the amendment and made step in the administrations direction by referring instead to countries like poland hungary and th czech republic the conferees urged the administration to submit legislation consis tent with the security interests of the united states that would make nonlethal defense articles available to such countries however they underscored the intention of the original brownsimon amendment to send clear unambiguous si gnal to the nations of central and eastern europe that are making swift progress to establish democratic institutions that their security and stability is of great importance to the united states22httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94351crs9 congress has had formal role

must follow its normal procedures for ratifi cation of treaties to revise the existing treaty and admit new members conclusion developments in russia together with us and nato policy towards moscow are likely to determine the course of the partnership for peace program today european nato ally favors eventual alliance membership for russia although us officials have left the door open to russias possible entry if russia follows an evolutionary path towards demo cracy and adheres to moderate foreign policy then eventual nato membership for east european states could contribute to building zone of prosperity and stability to russias west development that could further stability in russia itself as well as promote its inclusion in european political framework turmoil in russia th reatening to spill over into neighboring countries could erode stability in eastern europe and make some nato states shy away from extending the security guarantee that nato membership would carry other nato states may draw different conclusion and see natos expansion as way to forestall the spread of instability beyond russias borders partnership for peace could play political role as well the program could provide time for east european leaders to demonstrate that they can contain ethnic conflict move forward to build more tolerant democratic societies and develop productive competitive economie s cooperative peacekeeping efforts in the program could provide an opportunity for them to convince nato publics that their countries can make contributions to european and gl obal security in such circumstances they could strengthen their appeal for nato membership but there is also the possibility that partnership for peace contributes to the redrawing of the map of europe in ways unfavorable to us interests and those of europeans east and west if russia uses its inclusion in the program and for example in csce or in the contact gr oup on the former yugoslavia to exert its influence to keep states under its political sway or to deflect nato from desired course then new lines reminiscent of the old lines of the cold war could be drawn again the stated us policy of prev enting the development of new spheres of influence in europe will ve failed partnership for peace opens the door to russian role in possible nato peacekeepin g and diplomatic efforts beyond the nato treaty area and therefore in building european security should moscow choose narrow defense of russian interests in such role the partnership program could well erode efforts to bu ild that security apparatus quite apart from russias role in european security the united states and its allies continue to grope for clear mission for nato the alliance remains unwilling to assure stability beyond the cu rrent treaty area unless natos mission is further clarified the partnership program remains only first tentative step by the alliance to assume greater res ponsibility for european security
