agreement on detainers the antishuttling provision of the interstate agreement on detainers requires dismissal of receivingstate charges against prisoner who was transported to the receiving state for single day for purpose of arraignment and who was then returned immediately to his original place of imprisonment prior to trial the language of the provision article ive is absolute providing that if trial is not had prior to the prison ers being returned to the original place of imprisonment such charges shall not be of any further force or effect and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice even if the agreement were interpreted to exempt violations that are deemed to be minimis in relation to the agreements purpose the purpose of the return provision cannot be simply to prevent interruption of rehabilitation in the sending state preventing return of the prisoner prior to trial necessarily decreases the time the prisoner will spend in the sending state by requiring the receiving state to pay for the prisoners incarceration the agreement provides the receiving state with an incentive to shorten the pretrial period alternatively the agreements drafters may have believed that the shuttling itself adds to uncertainties that impede rehabilitation viewed against either of these purposes the oneday violation at issue cannot be said to be minimis technical or harmless 90 opinion of court by breyer unanimous in part and joined by rehnquist stevens oconnor kennedy and souter in separate part alexander v sandoval 121 s ct 1511 69 uslw 4250 42401 civil rights act title vi implied private right of action there is implied private right of action to enforce disparateimpact regulations promulgated under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 section 601 of the act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race ethnicity or national origin by recipients of federal financial assistance and section 602 authorizes federal agencies to effectuate the provisions of section 601 by promulgating regulations three aspects of title vi are well established and must be taken as given first private individuals may sue to enforce section 601 second section 601 prevents only intentional discrimination not disparateimpa ct discrimination and third regulations prom ulgated under section 602 that proscribe disparateimpact discrimination are valid even though such discrimi nation is not proscribed by section 601 it does not follow however that private individuals may sue to enforce the disparateimpact regulations because the disparateimpact regulations do not simply apply 601 but go beyond it the private right of action to enforce 601 does not include private right to enforce the regulations that right must come if at all from the independent force of 602 statutory text is the starting point and in this case the ending point httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31060crs2 for ascer taining whether congress has created private right of action the rightscreating language present in section 601 is completely absent from 602 which instead is directed at federal agencies that distribute public funds moreover section 602s express provision for agency enforcement of section 602 through termination of funding and other means suggests that congress intended to preclude remedies not expressly authorized the regulations themselves cannot be read to create right that congress has not created the rehabilitation act amendments of 1986 which abrogated states eleventh amendment immunity from actions brought under title vi did not ratify decisions finding private right of action to enforce disparateimpact regulations the cases relied on did not so hold and the 1986 amendment by its terms applied only to suits for violation of statute not to suits for violation of regulation 54 opinion of court by scalia joined by rehnquist oconnor kennedy and thomas dissenting opinion by stevens joined by souter ginsburg and breyer arkansas v sullivan 121 s ct 1876 69 uslw 3746 52901 fourth amendment pretextual arrest the arkansas supreme court erred in ruling that an arrest of motorist who had committed traffic violation was invalid because it was made for the purpose of searching the motorists car as the court determined in whren v united states 1996 an officers subjective motivation for making traffic stop plays part in probable cause analysis and the same principle applies to custodial arrest the arkansas court also erred in its alternative holding that it may interpret the united states constitution to provide greater protection than does the united states supreme court that position was refuted in oregon v hass 1975 state is free under its own law not under the federal constitution to impose greater restrictions on police activity 90 per curiam concurring opinion by ginsburg joined by stevens oconnor and breyer artuz v bennett 121 s ct 361 69 uslw 4001 11700 habeas corpus aedpa an application for state postconviction relief containing claims that are procedurally barred can be properly filed within the meaning of 28 usc 2244d2 that provision of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 aedpa tolls an applicable limitations period for the time during which prope rly filed application for state post conviction relief is pending an application is filed when it is delivered to and accepted by the appropriate court officer an application is properly filed when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings whether an application has been properly filed is thus quite separate from the question whether the claims contained in the application are meritorious and free of procedural bar it is only individual claims and not the application containing those claims that can be procedurally barred 90 opinion for unanimous court by scaliahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31060crs3 atkinson trading co v shirley 121 s ct 1825 69 uslw 4363 52901 native americans taxation the navajo nations imposi tion of hotel occupancy tax on persons who are not tribal members and who operate hotel on nonindian fee land within the navajo reservation is invalid in montana v united states 1981 the court held that as general matter the inherent sovereignty of indian tribes is limited to their members and their territory neither of the exceptions to the general rule recognized by the court in montana is applicable here tribe may tax or regulate consensual commercial relationships with the tribe or its members but operation of the hotel is not such relationship the generalized availability of police fire and emergency medical services provided by the tribe is patently insuffi cient to sustain the tribes assertion of civil authority over nonmembers on nonindian fee land and the petitioners status as an indian trader cannot by itself support the imposition of the hotel occupancy tax the second exception recognizing tribal jurisdiction over an operation that threatens or has some direc t effect on the political integrity the economic security or the health or welfare of the tribe is also inapplicable operation of the hotel does not endanger the navajo nations political integrity 90 opinion for unanimous court by rehnquist concurring opinion by souter joined by kennedy and thomas atwater v city of lago vista 121 s ct 1536 69 uslw 4262 42401 fourth amendment arrest for minor offense the fourth amendment does not prohibit warrantless arrest for minor offense such as misdemeanor seatbelt violation punishable only by fine in reading the fourth amendment the court is guided by the traditional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures afforded by the common law at the time of the constitutions framing there was uniform rule at common law that prohibited peace officers from making warrantless misdemeanor arrests except in cases involving breach of the peace commentators were divided as to the english rule and in any event there were numerous statutory exceptions there is indication that the constitutions framers intended such limitation the statutes of the colonies and states authorized arrest for various misdemeanors not involving breach of the peace and the historical record that has unfolded since the framing is also inconsistent with any such limitation today the laws of all 50 states the district of columbia and the federal government permit some misdemeanor arrests without breach of the peace the petitioners request that the court mint new rule of constitutional law based on contemporary standards of reaso nableness is rejected responsible fourth amendment balance is not well served by standards requiring sensitive casebycase determinations the proposed rules distinguishing betwe jailable and fineonly offenses for example would be difficult for officers to administer and would require some exceptions such rules are better devised by statute as some states have done the upshot is that there is dearth of horribles demanding redress the petitioners arrest in this case was constitutional although the arrest was humiliating and inconvenient and subjected her to pointless indignity and confinement it was more harmful to privacy or physical interests than the normal custodial arrest and therefore was not so extraordinary as to violate the fourth amendment because the police officer in this case had probable cause to believe that the petitioner had committed crime in his presence by nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31060crs4 wearing seatbelt and by not securing her children in seatbelts the officer was accordingly authorized to make custodial arrest rather than issue citation and to do so without balancing costs and benefits or determining whether or not petitioners arrest was in some sense necessary 54 opinion of court by souter joined by rehnquist scalia kennedy and thomas dissenting opinion by oconnor joined by stevens ginsburg and breyer bartnicki v vopper 121 s ct 1753 69 uslw 4323 52101 first amendment disclosure of illegally intercepted communication federal prohibition on disclosure of the contents of an illegally intercepted electronic communication 18 usc 2511c and parallel pennsylvania law violate the first amendment as applied in this case the defendants talk show host and community activist played part in the illegal interception and obtained the tapes lawfully the subject matter of the disclosed conversation involving threat of violence in labor dispute was matter of public concern ordinarily government may not punish the publication of truthful information about matter of public significance the government has identified two interests alleged to be furthered by the disclosure prohibition that of deterr ing unlawful conduct and that of protecting privacy the governments interest in deterring unlawful conduct is not well served by the prohibition the normal method of deterrence is to punish the person who engages in the unlawful conduct it is quite remarkable to suppress speech by lawabiding possessor of information in order to deter unlawful conduct by some one else also there is empirical evidence that supports the effectiveness of the disclosure prohibition the governments important interest in protecting private communication is well served by the prohibition however and requires balancing against the free speech interests that are impaired in this case privacy concerns give way when balanced against the interest in publish ing matters of public importance there is profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited robust and wideopen application of this principle requires the conclusion that strangers illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the first amendment shield from speech about matter of public concern 63 opinion of court by stevens joined by oconnor kennedy souter ginsburg and breyer concurring opinion by breyer joined by oconnor dissenting opinion by rehnquist joined by scalia and thomas becker v montgomery 121 s ct 1801 69 uslw 4390 52901 appeals required signature on notice when party files timely notice of appeal in federal district court the failure to sign the notice does not require the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal civil rule 11a made applicable to notices of appeal by the appellate rules unquestionably requires that notices of appeal be signed and this means handwritten name or handplaced mark rule 11a also provides however that the omission of signature may be corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney or party either by signing the copy that is on file or by submitting duplicate signed copy the rule was formulated and should be applied as cohesive whole there is basis for distinguishing notices of appeal from other written filings or for applying harsher rule to filings by pro litigants than applies to partieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31060crs5 represented by attorneys the sixth circuit erred in not accepting the petitioners corrected notice as perfecting his appeal 90 opinion for unanimous court by ginsburg board of trustees of univ of ala v garrett 121 s ct 955 69 uslw 4105 221 01 eleventh amendment fourteenth amendment enforcement ada congress exceeded its constitutional power by subjecting states to suits brought by state employees in federal courts to collect money damages for the states failure to comply with title i of the americans with disabilitie s act of 1990 ada such actions are barred by the eleventh amendment congress may through valid exercise of its fourteenth amen dment power to enforce that amendmen ts guarantees by appropriate legislation abrogate the states eleventh amendment immunity from federal court suits for damages the first step in determining whether congress has validly exercised its fourteenth amendment enforcement power is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right that is being enforced the court determined in cleburne v cleburne living center 1985 that legislative classifications governing the mentally retarded should be measured by rational basis review and the same test applies for other categories of the disabled states are not required by the fourteenth amendment to make special accommodations for the disabled so long as their actions towards such individuals are rational the next step is to determine whether congress identified history and pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the states against the disabled the legislative record of the ada however fails to show that congress did in fact identify pattern of irrational state employment discrimination against the disabled the great majority of discriminatory incidents identified by congress do not involve states and the half dozen or so that do taken together fall far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which 5 must be based congress failed to mention states in its legislative findings addressing discrimination in employment and even if pattern of discrimination by states were found the adas remedies would run afoul of the congruence and proportionality limitation the requirement of reasonable accommodation even with the exception for undue hardship far exceeds what is constitutionally required in that it makes unlawful range of alternate responses that would be reasonable 54 opinion of court by rehnquist joined by oconnor scalia kennedy and thoma s concurring opinion by kennedy joined by oconnor dissenting opinion by breyer joined by stevens souter and ginsburg booth v churner 121 s ct 1819 69 uslw 4387 52901 prison litigation reform act exhaustion of administrative remedies the prison litigation reform act which provides that prison inmates must exhaust such administrative remedies as are available before suing over prison conditions requires an inmate seeking only money damages to complete prison administrative process that could provide only nonmonetary relief neither pragmatism nor plain meaning resolves the case while the odds of keeping an inmate out of court are slim if the relief he seeks is unavailable in administrative proceedings there is some chance that being heard will mollifyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31060crs6 passions or that administrative proceedings will weed out frivolous claims available can mean either having sufficient power to achieve an end or whatever is offered remedy can mean either specific relief that is available or the process itself that leads to relief two additional considerations provide clearer pointers to the provisions meaning one is the broader statutory context the word exhausted has decidedly procedural emphasis since one exhausts processes not forms of relief statutory history is the second indicator prior to amendment in 1995 the section at issue required exhaustion of administrative remedies only if those remedi were plain speedy and effective congresss removal of this language especially after the supreme court had emphasized it in ruling that exhaustion was not required if money damages were sought but unavailable administratively confirms the suggestion that congress meant to require procedural exhaustio n regardless of the fit between prisoners prayer for relief and the administrative remedies possible 90 opinion for unanimous court by souter brentwood academy v tennessee secondary sch athletic assn 121 s ct 924 69 uslw 4085 22001 fourteenth amendment state action the regulatory activity of the tennessee secondary school athletic association statewide body incorporated to regulate interscholastic athletic competition among public and private secondary schools should be treated as state action the nominally private charac ter of the association is overborne by the pervasive entwinement of public institutions and public officials in its composition and workings and there is substantial reason to claim unfairness in applying constitutional standards to it whether actions may fairly be attributed to the state is necessarily factbound inquiry interscholastic athletics plays an integral part in public education in tennessee and the association is the entity relied upon to regulate competition the association is overwhelmingly composed of public school officials 84 of its members are public schools and the principal part of its funding derives from gate receipts from member schools this entwinement of public school officials from the bottom up is complemented by entwinement from the top down representatives of the state board of education sit on the associations committees as nonvoting members the state boards rules are enforced by the association the state board allows students to satisfy its physical education requirements by participating in interscholastic athletics sponsored by the association and the associations employees are covered by the states retirement system the pervasive entwinement present in this case requires finding of state action regardless of whether alternative tests for state action are satisfied the association did not establish that countervailing values should outweigh finding of state action 54 opinion of court by souter joined by stevens oconnor ginsburg and breyer dissenting opinion by thomas joined by rehnquist scalia and kennedy buckhannon bd care home inc v west virginia dept of hhr 121 s ct 1835 69 uslw 4350 52901 attorneys fees catalyst theory the catalyst theory is not permissible basis for the award of attorneys fees under the fair housing act or the americans with disabilities act both of which authorize award of attorneyshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31060crs7 fees to the prevailing party the catalyst theory would allow recovery of fees by party who has failed to secure either judgment on the merits or court ordered consent decree but who has nonetheless achieved the desired result because the lawsuit brought about voluntary change in the defendants conduct the courts prior holdings interpret prevailing party to mean one who has been awarded some relief by the court as is the case with judgment on the merits or settlement agreement enforced through consent decree the catalyst theory falls on the other side of the line by allowing an award where there is judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties circuit court precedent and dicta in supreme court decisions cannot overcome the plain language of the statute and the courts prior holdings legislative history of the civil rights attorneys fees awards act which also authorizes awards to prevailing party is at best ambiguous the argument that the catalyst theory is necessary to prevent defendants from unilaterally mooting an actio n before judgment in order to avoid paying attorneys fees is speculative and unsupported by evidence moreover the catalyst theory is clearly not formula for ready administrability 54 opinion of court by rehnquist joined by oconnor scalia kennedy and thomas concurring opinion

substantially equivalent to grandfathered predicate device is preempted by the medical device amendments to the food drug and cosmetic act policing fraud against federal agencies is not field which the states have traditionally occupied and consequently presumption against preem ption applies the comprehensive federal statutory scheme amply empowers the fda to punish and deter fraud against the

of offlabel usage of medical devices complying with the fdas detailed regulatory regime in the shadow of 50 states tort regimes would dramatically increase the burdens facing potenti applicants in

partial manual recount of the vote for presidential electors violates the equal protection clause by allowing arbitrary and disparate treatment of members of the electorate when state legislature confers on its citizens the right to vote for presidential electors that right to vote is fundamental and equal protection applies to the manner of its exercise in this case the equal protection violation inheres in the absen ce of specific standards to ensure equal application of the intent of the voter standard applied by the florida court there were various respects in which unequal treatment could result from implementation of the florid courts order the standard for accepting or rejecting contested ballots might vary not only from county to county but indeed within single county from one recount team to another one county changed its evaluative standards during the counting process manual recount does not treat overvotes in the same manner as undervotes the court certified partial total from one county and the order did not specify who would recount the ballots because the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities this decision is limited to the present circumstances in which state court with the power to assure uniformity has failed to provide minimal procedural safeguards because it is obvious that recount that complies with these constitutional requirements could not be conducted without substantial additional work and because there is time left to do so and still comply with the requirement of florida law that election contests be completed by december 12 the date specified in 3 usc 5 the judgment of the florida supreme court ordering recount to proceed is reversed 54 remedy 72 equal protection

submission of county election returns to the secretary of state and thereby allowed time for manual recounts authorized by florida law the judgment of the florida supreme court is vacated and the case is remanded so that the florida court can clarify the extent to which it relied on the florida constitution as circumscribing the florida legislatures authority under

arbitration clause tribes waiver of immunity from suit must be clear and in this case the tribe has waived its immunity with the requisite clarity the contracts arbitration clause provides for contractrelated disputes to be resolved by binding arbitration and for awards to be reduced to judgment in accordance with the applicable law in any court having jurisdiction the contracts choiceoflaw clause which provides that the law of the place where the project is located shall govern makes it plain that the oklahoma state court in which the suit was filed had jurisdiction to enforce the award and that the parties effectively agreed to confirmation of the award in accordance with the oklahoma uniform arbitratio n act that act authorizes state courts to enter judgment on an arbitration award the tribes effort to interpret the arbitration clause narrowly as merely waiving the right to court trial of contractual disputes is unavailing the arbitration regime has real world end and the contract specifically authorizes judicial enforcement of the arbitral award the tribes argument that clear waiver cannot be established by form contract is also rejected the contract is not ambiguous

to all water that flows through multipurpose federal project operated only in part for flood control the appropriate focus is on the character of the waters that cause the relevant damage and the purpose of their release rather than on the overall project purposes to characterize every drop of water that flows through an immense federal project as flood water simply because flood control is among the purposes served by the project unnecessarily dilutes the language of the statute the ninth circuit erred therefore in ruling that the plaintiffs action for damages resulting from operation

contracts of employment of seamen railroad employees or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce excludes contracts of employment of transportation workers but not employment contr acts of other workers engaged in interstate or foreign commerce the words any other class of workers engaged in commerce constitute residual phrase that follows explicit reference to seamen and railroad employees this wording calls for application of the ejusdem generis canon of construction which provides that general words following specific words in statutory enumeration should be construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to the specifical ly enume rated objects application of the canon is supported by other sound considerations the phrase engaged in commerce has been interpreted to be more limited than other possible formulations eg affecting commerce and involving commerce the fact that the commerce power was construed narrowly when the faa was enacted in 1925 does not mean that congress used the phrase engaged in commerce in order to regulate to the full extent of its power and the court refuses to treat the phrase as variable standard that can expand as interpretation of the power expands the congressional decision to exempt workers over whom the commerce power was most apparent was not irrational by 1925 congress had created special dispute resolution procedures for seamen and was in the process of doing so for railway workers and might well have preferred to address the needs of other categories of transportationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31060crs11 workers in similar manner there is need to assess the legislative history of the exclusion provision 54 opinion of court by kennedy joined by

adult business this situation is different from that presented in erie v paps am there the entity that terminated its adult business had prevailed in the lowe r court and dismissal based on mootness would have left the defendant city with the ongoing injury of an invalidated ordinance here the adult business has left the fray loser and dismissal does not leave the city under the weight of an adverse judgment also an applicant denied renewal application is not in the same position as an applicant for an initial license the typical concern of renewal applicant is not the speed of court

comember of job application review panel made an offensive remark violated title vii the courts precedents establish that sexual harassment is actionable under title vii only if it is so severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment this one isolated incident cannot remotely be considered extremely serious besides alleging that she was punished for complaining about the alleged sexual harassment the respondent also claimed that she was punished for filing charges with state and federal authorities this second claim rested solely on temporal proximity between the protected action and the alleged retaliatory action causality can be established by temporal proximity only if the events are very close in time yet the 20month period

concern in issuing renewing and revoking video poker licenses is regulatory the government does not allege that the petitioner defrauded the state of any money and the fact that the state has

postconviction or other collateral review within the meaning of 28 usc 2242d2 and therefore did not toll the limitations period under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa the word state applies to the entire phrase postconviction or other collateral review in contrast with several other provisions of aedpa which refer to state or federal postconviction proceedings congress did not insert the word federal into 2242d2 if congress includes particular language in one section of statute but omits it in another it is generally presumed that congress intended the dispa rate treatment there is likely explanation for congresss omission of the word federal other than that congress did not intend for petitions for federal review to toll the limitation period to read the provision as applying to federal petitions would render the word state insignificant if not wholly superfluous on the other hand the phrase other collateral review need not refer to federal collateral review in order to have independent meaning operative effect can be given to the phrase if it is limited to state collateral review there are forms of collateral review eg challenges to the validity of civil commitment or civil contempt orders that are not criminal in nature and hence are not forms of postconviction review also states employ diverse terminology to refer to forms of collateral review that are available finally interpreting 2242d2 as inapplicable to federal petitions is consistent with aedpas purposes of promoting comity finality and federalism 72 opinion of court by oconnor

truck driver who twice tested positive for marijuana in this case the award suspended the driver for three months and required further substanceabuse treatment and testing prior to reinstatement the employer asked federal district court to vacate the arbitrators award arguing that the award contravened public policy against operation of dangerous machinery by workers who test positive for drugs the award implemented the governing collective bargaining agreement so the award must be treated as if it were part of the agreement collective bargaining agreements that are contrary to public policy are unenforceable but any such public policy must be well established and clearly ascertainable in laws or legal precedents here the applicable law is the detailed regulatory regime of the omnibus transportation employee testing act of 1991 and dots implementing regulations that regulatory regime reflects complex remedial aims that not only disfavor employee drug use andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31060crs16 favor drug testing but also promote rehabilitation of employees who use drugs the arbitration award therefore is not contrary to these several policies taken together neither congress nor the dot secretary has seen fit to mandate the discharge of worker who twice tests positive for drugs and the court is hesitant to infer public policy that goes beyond the

state law that has connection with or reference to such plan the court looks both to the objectives of erisa and to the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans here there is an

moreover the washington statute is expressly preempted by erisa erisa directs the fiduciary to administer the plan in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan and to make payments to beneficiary designated by participant or by the terms of the plan while the washington law contains an optout provision the burden on plan administration would be hardly trivial since plan administrators in effect would have to maintain familiarit with the laws of all 50 states the presumption against federal preemption of state family and probate law is overcome because congress has

campaign act is not facially invalid under the first amendment insofar as it limits the amount of money that national or state committee of political party may spend in coordination with its own candidate for the senate or house of representatives beginning with buckley v valeo 1976 the court has distinguished between limits on political contrib utions which have been upheld and limits on political expenditures which require closer scrutiny in colorado i 1996 the court invalidated limits on independent expenditures by political parties campaign spending that is coordinated with candidate however can closely resemble contribution to that candidates campaign the limitation on coordinated spending applicable to individuals and nonparties does not impose such unique burden on parties that constitutional exception is required the governments argument that coordinated expenditures provide mean s of circumventing the contribution limits outweighs the partys argument that coordinated expenditures are essentialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31060crs17 to the partys principal mission of electing its candidates the partys argument that party is so joined at the hip with its candidates that its spending must necessarily be coordinated with candidates is at odds with the history of nearly 30 years under the act there is little evidence to suggest that limits on coordinated spending have frustrated the ability of political parties to support their candidates moreover in addition to electing candidates parties act as agents for pacs and others who seek to produce obligated officeholders the same test applicable to contributions therefore applies and there is adequate evidence to sustain the limit as being closely drawn to match the important government interest in combating political corruption under the act contributor is limited to 2000 in contributions to one candidate but may give 20000 to national party committee supporting the candidate absent the requirement that most of the partys spending on candidates behalf be done independently the inducement to circumvent would almost certainly intensify coordinated expenditures of money donated to

to the police these tests were performed without the informed consent of the patients this case differs from previous cases in which the court has recognized an exception to the warrant requirement for drug testing justified by special needs divorced from states general interest in law enforcement the critical difference lies in the nature of the special need asserted as justification in this case the central and indispensable feature of the policy from its inception was the use of law enforcement to coerce the patients into substance abuse treatment the beneficent purpos does not justify special needs exception when the immediate objective is to generate evide nce for law enforcement purposes because law enforcement always serves some broader social purpose virtually all suspicionless searches could be justified under the special needs doctrine were it tied to ultimate rather than immediate objective moreover principles of knowing waiver require that state employees who seek to

provide foundation for their lessons there would be establishment clause violatio n in allowing the club access the neutrality principle would not be offended since the club seeks nothing more than to be treated neutrally the meetings were to be held after school hours were not sponsored by the school were open to any student who obtained parental consent and were to take place in forum available

government in trust for the tribe the default rule is that title to land beneath navigable waters passes from the united states to newly admitted state if there is claim that submerged lands have been reserved by the united states prior to statehood then congressional intent contro ls the first inquiry is whether congress intended to include submerged lands in prestatehood reservation and the second issue is whether congress intended to defeat the future states title to the submerged lands in this case the intent to include submerged lands within the reservation for the coeur dalene tribe is conceded and the issue is whether congress recognized the reservation in way that demonstrated an intent to defeat state title agreements to include portion of the lake within the boundaries of the reservation were concluded prior to statehood but were not ratified by congress until after statehood nonetheless congressional intent to retain title to the submerged lands for benefit of the tribe is evidenced by the history of congressionally authorized negotiations with the tribe congresss objectives were to extinguish aboriginal title in lands outside the reservation but to obtain tribal interests only by tribal consent the intent was that anything not consensually ceded by the tribe would remain for the tribes benefit passage of the bill confirming the reservation was delayed past enactment of the statehood bill only because of need to conform house and senate bills and not due to uncertainty over the scope of the reservation congressional actions after statehood reinforced

clear congressional intent to apply retroactively its repeal of the attorney generals section 212c waiver authority to aliens who like the respondent had entered plea agreement before enactment of

program the legal services corporation lsc program on the other hand was designed to facilitate private speech not to promote governmental message the governments message in litigation is delivered by government attorney while the lsc lawyer speaks on behalf of his or her private indigent client moreover the restrictions on lsc advocacy distort the usual functioning of the judiciary and are inconsistent with accepted separationofpowers principles an informed independent judiciary presumes an informed independent bar yet the restriction prohibits speech and expression on which courts must depend for the proper exercise of judicial power the restriction operates as an attempt to exclude from litigation those arguments and theories congress finds unacceptable since the likely effect of lsc attorneys withdrawal from case is to leave the indigent client unable to procure other counsel and hence unable to challenge the validity of the welfare laws this illustrates another contrast with

current offense is felony that involved the carrying possessi on or use of firearm is permissible exercise of the discretion conferred by 18 usc 3621e2b section 3621 directs the bureau to offer appropriate substance abuse treatment to prisoners who have treatable substance abuse condition and in subsection e2b also provides that the period of incarceration of prisoner convicted of nonviolent offense may be reduced by the bureau if that prisoner has successfully completed treatment program the regulation as amended in 1997 does not purport to define the term prisoner convicted of nonviolent offense but instead relies upon the discretion conferred on the bureau to exclude enumerated categories of inmates congress use of the permissive may rather than the mandatory shall means that the bureau has the authority but not the duty to grant early release to nonviolent offender who has completed the drug treatment program chevron analysis applies congress has not spoken directly to the precise question and the bureaus interpretation is reasonable both in taking account of preconviction conduct and in making categori cal exclusions congress has manifested concern for preconviction behavior by denying eligibility to violent offenders and the bureau may reasonably consider other preconviction behavior nor has congress limited the bureau to casebycase assessments the bureau may resolve issues of general applicability through rulemaking finally the bureau reasonably concluded that an inmates prior involvement with firearms while committing felony suggests readin

cigarettes in addition to providing that statement other than that mandated by the fclaa shall be required on any cigarette package it also provides that requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarett the massachusetts regulations targeted at youth exposure to cigarette advertising are based on smoking and health within the meaning of the fclaa concern about youth exposure is intertwined with concern about smoking and health the fact that the regulations govern location rather thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31060crs26 content of advertising does not remove them from the preemption language which covers all state requirements and prohibitions similar massachusetts restrictions applicable to advertising of smokeless tobacco and cigar products are not preempted fclaas preempt ion provision applies only to cigarettes however these outdoor advertising and pointofsale restrictions applicable to smokeless tobacco and cigars violate the first amendment because they do not satisfy the fourth step of the central hudson test for regulation of commercial speech that step requires reasonable fit between the means and ends of regulation yet the regulations are not narrowly tailored to achieve such fit the 1000 foot restriction on outdoor advertising sweeps broadly and imposes particularly onerous burdens in some instances it would result in nearly complete ban in urban areas and applies regardless of the size and degree of visibility of the sign the pointofsale restriction on signs appearing below height of five feet does not advance the states goal of limiting youth exposure to advertising and does not constitute reasonable fit since not all children are less than five feet tall and those who are certainly have the ability to look up and take in their surroundings still other regulations that restrict sales practices by cigarette smokeless tobacco and cigar merchants by barring the use of selfservice displays and prohibiting sampling or promotional giveaways withstand first amendmen t scrutiny these restrictions regulate conduct for reasons

of independent judgment the boards interpretation of this language to mean that employees do not use independent judgment when they exercise ordinary professional or technical judgment in directing less skilled employees would insert startling categorical exclusion into statutory language that does not suggest its existence the breadth of this limitation would virtually eliminate supervisors

further told that an affirmative answer to all three questions would result in imposition of the death penalty supplemental instruction however directed consideration of mitigating circumstances including any aspect of the defendants character or record if the jury determined that the mitigating evidence made life sentence more appropriate than death sentence then the jury was to give negative finding to one of the three special issues this supplemental instruction made the jury charge as whole internally contradictory and placed lawabid ing jurors in an impossible situation jurors could give effect to the supplemental instruction only by changing truthful yes answer to one of the three special issues to an untruthful answer and by doing so they would violate their oath to

individual on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the privileges of any place of public accommodation and the pga tour and qualifying rounds fit comfortably within title iiis coverage the adas definition of public accommodation expressly includes golf course and among the privileges offered by the tour are those of competing in the qualifying rounds and playing in toursponsor ed tournaments the argument that title iii is inapplicable because it applies only to clients and customers seeking services and not to those providing the services is rejected even assuming that title iii is so limited it is appropriate to consider golfers who pay to compete in the qualifying rounds and if successful participate in tour events as clients or customers of the tour such competition is privilege that the tour makes available to members of the general public prohibited discrimination under title iii is defined as failure to make reasonable modifications necessary to afford privileges to disabled individuals unless making such modif ications would fundamentally alter the nature of such privileges golf cart is reasonable modification that is necessary if the respondent is to play in golf tournaments allowing the respondent to use golf cart would not fundamentally alter the nature of the events use of carts is not itself inconsistent with the fundamental character of the game of golf the essence of the game is shotmaking and there is nothing in the rules of golf that forbids the use of carts or penalizes golfer who uses one nor is the tours walking rule an indispensable part of tournament golf the tour itself permits carts in its first two qualifying rounds and also in its seniors tournaments the purpose of the walking rule is said to be to inject the element of fatigue into the game but even if the rule is effective in that regard the ada mandates an individualized inquiry because the walking rule is at best peripheral to the nature of the game it may be waived in individual cases without working fundamental alteration because the district court found that the respondent endures greater fatigue when using cart than ablebodied competitors do by walking the rule may be waived in his case without impairing the rules purpose 72 opinion of court by stevens joined by rehnquist oconnor kennedy souter ginsburg and breyer

the award of compensatory and punitive damages in employment discrimination cases based on sex religion or disability section 706g of the civil rights act authorized courts to order reinstatement with or without back pay this language was patterned on section 10c of the national labor relations act which had been interpreted to allow awards of backpay up to the date of reinstatement this form of backp ay to the extent that it occurs after the date of judgment is known today as front pay the 1991 law provided for recovery of compensatory and punitive damages in addition to any relief authorized by section 706g and further provided that compensatory damages shall not include backpay or any other type of relief authorized under section 706g becau front pay was type of relief authorized under section 706g it is excluded from the meaning of compensatory damages under section 1981 there is logical difference between front pay in lieu of reinstatement and front pay prior to

migratory birds this migratory bird rule is not fairly supported by the cwa congress did not acquiesce in the 1977 isolated wetlands rule by rejecting bill that would have narrowed the statutory definition to traditionally navigable waters since there is persuasive evidence that the bill was proposed in response to the corps claim of jurisdiction over isolated waters or that the bills failure indicated congressional acquiescence congress did not ratify the 1977 rule by enacting an amendment to section 404 that authorized state administration of permit programs governing waters other than those used in or capable of use in interstate commerce other waters may simply have been reference to nonnavigable waters adjacent to traditionally navigable waters chevron deference to the administrative interpretation is inappropriate where that interpretation invokes the outer limits of congress power and where there is clear indication that congress intended that result 54 opinion of

specific limitation the sixth amendment which assures an accused the right to the assistance of counsel in all criminalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31060crs37 prosecutions is offense specific this means that criminal suspect who has been charged with one offense and who is represented by counsel for purposes of defending that charge is not protected by the sixth amendment from police interrogation about other offenses for purposes of this rule the definition of an offense is not necessarily limited to the four corners of charging instrument rather the blockburger test applicable to double jeopardy applies if the same act or transaction constitutes violation of two distinct statutory provisions the test is whether each provision requires proof of fact which the other does not the court sees constitutional difference between the meaning of the term offense in the contexts of double jeopardy and of the right to counsel in this case police interrogation of suspect about his involvement in murder of burglary victims was permissible at time when he was represented by counsel on the burglary charge but when murder charges had been brought as defined by texas law burglary and capital murder are not the same offense under blockburger 54 opinion of court by rehnquist joined by oconnor scalia kennedy and thomas concurring opinion by kennedy joined by scalia and thomas dissenting

intending never to honor that option is violation of section 10b of the securities exchange act of 1934 which prohibits the use of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of security the secret intent not to honor the option amounts to misrepresentation within the meaning of section 10b and implementing rule 10b5 the fact that the agreement was oral does not exclude it from the acts coverage case law holding the act inapplicable to misrepresentations that dissuade potential buyer from buying is not controlling since in this case an option was actually sold the secret reservation rendered that option value less and therefore implicated section 10bs policy of full disclosure concerni ng sale finally the case is not simple dispute over ownership or breach of contract but rather involves claim of fraudulent misrepresentation 90 opinion for unanimous court by breyer traffix devices inc v marketing displays inc 121 s ct 1255 69

under the lanham act trade dress is secondary meaning of product when its design or packaging attains distinctiveness which serves to identify the product with its manufacturer or source the person who asserts trade dress protection has the burden of proving that the matter sought to be protected against copying is not functional an expired patent can have an important bearing on trade dress

the jury understood the instruction to allow conviction without proof beyond reasonable doubt does not qualify under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa as new rule of constitutional law that has been made retroactive to cases on collateral revie w by the supreme court the consequence is that habeas corpus petition relying for the first time on cage v louisiana fails to qualify for an exception to aedpas general rule requiring dismissal of petitions that assert claim not previously presented new rule is made retroactive by the supreme court only if the court holds it to be retroactive the court has not held that the cage rule is retroactive the cage decision itself did not make the rule retroactive and the courts decision in sullivan v louisiana 1993 held only that cage error is structural ie that it is not amenable to harmlesserror analysis and will always invalidate the conviction nor did sullivan make clear that retroactive application is warranted through application of principles set forth in teague v lane 1989 which recognized an exception for watershed rules implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding the

federal insurance contributions act fica and the federal unemployment tax act futa awards of back wages should be attributed to the year in which they are actually paid and not to the year in which they should have been paid both statutes refer to wages paid during calen dar year because the court in social security board v nierotko 1946 interpreted the same phrase in the social security act to permit an allocationback rule for backpay the court cannot say that the fica and futa provisions have plain mean ing that precludes allocation of backpay to the year it should have been paid ordinarily identical statutory language is given the same interpret ation each time it appears nierotko however does not compel symmetrical construction the concerns about worker eligibility for social security benefits that underlay nierotko have relevance in the tax setting where the concern instead is fiscal administrability although some inequities and anomalies can result from application of the yearofpayment rule and there is some tension between the twin aims that the tax provisions be both efficiently administrable and fair the regulations and the agencys interpretation

compensation of federal judges shall not be diminis hed during their continuance in office prevents the government from collecting social security taxes but not medicare taxes from federal judges who held office before congress extended those taxes to feder employees the clause does not prevent congress from imposing nondiscriminatory tax laid generally upon judges and other citizens but it does prohibit taxation that singles out judges for specially unfavorable treatment the courts decision in evans v gore 1920 is overruled insofar as it held that the compensation clause prohibits congress from applying generally applicable nondiscriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges the potential threats to judicial independence that underlie the comp ensation clause cannot justify special judicial exemption from commonly shared tax there is good reason why judge should not share the tax burdens borne by all citizens the medicare tax extended to all federal employees in 1982 is such nondiscriminatory tax that may be applied to federal judges the 1983 extension of the social security tax to thensitting judges however is different matter the 1983 social security law gave 96 of federal employees total freedom of choice about whether to participate in the system andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31060crs40 structured the system in such way that virtually all of the remaining 4 of employees except the judges could opt to retain existing coverage by requiring thensitting judges to join the social security system and pay social security taxes the 1983 law discriminated against judges in violation of the compensation clause this constitutional violation was not cured when congress in 1984 increased judges salarie s by an amount greater than the amount of social security

by the united states customs service is not entitled to judicial deference under principles set forth in chevron v nrdc 1984 but instead is eligible to claim respect under skidmore v swift co 1944 the applicable statute authorizes the customs service to fix the classification and duty rate for merchandise under rules and regulations prescribed by the secretary of the treasury those regulations in turn authorize classification by ruling letters that describe the merchandise determine the appropriate classification and specify the corresponding tariff ruling letters are not subject to notice and comment before being issued and may be modified or revoked without notice any of the 46 portofentry customs offices as well as customs headquarters may issue ruling letters chevron deference is appropr iate if congress has conferred authority on an agency to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute as when the agency conducts adjudication or noticeandcomment rule making the customs ruling letters bind only the parties to the ruling not third parties and thus fall short of the kind of rulemaking with force of law that merits chevron deference instead the ruling letters are best treated like interpretat ions contained in policy statements agency manuals and enforcement guidelines under skidmore some deferenc can be accorded these less formal agency actions based on considera tion of such factors as their persuasive force the complexity of the regulatory scheme and the specialized expertise of the agency 81 opinion of court by souter joined by

exception for medical marijuana there is medical necessity exception to the prohibitions in the controlled substances act on the manufacture and distribution of marijuana whether or not medical necessity can ever be defense when the applicable federal statute does not expressly provide for it and such defense would entail social balancing that is better left to congress the defense cannot succeed when congress itself has made determination of values congress has done so in the controlled substances act the structure of the act which divides drugs into five schedules and imposes different restrictions depending in part on whether the drug has an accepted medical use reinforces this conclusion by placing marij uana in the most restrictive schedule schedule i congress necessarilyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31060crs41 determined that the drug had currently accepted medical use in treatment in the united states the act consistently treats all schedule i drugs alike whether the drugs have been placed in schedule i by congress or have been so categorized by the attorney general and the cooperative offered convincing explanation for why drugs placed on the schedule by congress should be subject to fewer controls than those placed there by the attorney general the canon of constitutional doubt has application because the statute is not ambiguous on this point the ninth circuit erred in ruling that the district court had discretion to recognize medical necessity exception although district courts have broad discretion in formulating equitable relief they may

consumer information act violates the first amendment by imposing mandatory assessments on mushroom handlers for the purpose of funding generic advertising to promote mushroom sales even if it is accepted that commercial speech is entitled to less protection than other speech there is basis in supreme cour t precedent for sustaining the compelled assessment in glickman v wileman brothers elliott 1997 the court upheld similar assessment imposed on california fruit growers but the program sustained in glickman differs in most fundamental respect from the mushroom program there the mandated assessments were ancillary to more comprehensive program restricting marketi ng autonomy while here there is broader regulatory system in place unlike the marketing scheme upheld in glickman the mushroom program contains marketing orders that regulate how mushrooms may be produced and sold exemption from the antitrust laws and nothing else that forces mushroom producers to associate as group to make cooperative decisions but for the assessment for advertising the mushroom growing business is unregulated 63 opinion of court by kennedy joined by rehnquist stevens scalia souter and

in this country justifies indefinite detention the choice is not between imprisonment and living at large but rather between imprisonment and supervised release cases allowing detention of aliens at the border are inapplicable since the due process clause unavailabl to aliens at the border and elsewhere outside the united states protects all persons within the united states including illegal
