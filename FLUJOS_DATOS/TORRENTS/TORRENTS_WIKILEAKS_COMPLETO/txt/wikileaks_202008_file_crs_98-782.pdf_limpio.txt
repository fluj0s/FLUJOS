more than naftas first five and onehalf years between january 1 1994 and september 28 1999 approximately 259618 workers were certified as potentially suffering naftarelated job losses these data are sorted by state earlier versions of this report also included table which sorted these data within states by business indicating for each business its products reason for certification and industry because of its increasingly unwieldy size this table has been dropped from this report however these data for any state are available from crs by calling the author at 77753 in addition between january 1994 and the end of december 1998 nearly 710000 net jobs were created from new exports to mexico and canada these figures are sorted by state in all six tables present the data from varying perspectives including major industries of job certifications and major industries of increased exports to mexico and canada this report is generally updated once or twice

states nafta the trade agreement between the united states mexico and canada appears to have served primarily to accelerate traderelated job trends that were already ongoing thus any reference in this report to effects of nafta is really reference to effects since nafta since nafta went into effect january 1 1994 both imports from and exports to mexico and canada have increased boosted by reductions in tariff nontariff and investment barriers particularly in mexico us job gains and losses from trade with mexico and canada stem from changes in trade in 1998 the value of trade with mexico was slightly more than half the value of trade flows with canada since nafta went into effect through the end of 1998 exports to mexico and canada combined have increased 64 while imports have increased by 78 between 1993 and 1998 the annual merchandise trade deficit with canada increased from 13 billion to 24 billion while 1 billion surplus with mexico evolved into 17 billion deficit the us trade positions with both mexico and canada worsened in 1998 over 1997 job gain data cover naftas first five years and job loss data cover naftas first fiveandahalf years measuring job gains and losses from trade with nafta partners is an inexact process job loss and job gain data were derived from different methods and databases and therefore are not comparable in addition job loss figures represent the outside limit of rather than actual job losses that is they represent total employment at plants where workers have been certified to receive naftatransitional adjustment assistanc naftataa benefits only 2030 of these workers actually collect benefits trying to further apportion these job gains and losses by state compounds the problems thus the figures come with strong caveats nevertheless they provide some useful information moreover estimates of naftarelated job gains and losses are small relative to total us employment approximately 259618 workers were certified between january 1 1994 and september 28 1999 as potentially suffering nafta related job losses this represents less than the number of jobs created in single month in 1998 on the other hand an estimated

years what has been the effect of the north american free trade agreement nafta on jobs in individual states nafta the trade agreement between the united states mexico and canada appears to have served primarily to accelerate trade related job trends that were ongoing before nafta thus any reference in this report to effects of nafta is really reference to effects since nafta one broad observation that can be made is that since nafta went into effect in january 1994 both imports from and exports to mexico and canada have increased boosted by reductions in tariff nontariff and investment barriers particularly in mexico1 us job gains and losses from trade with mexico and canada the uss first and third largest trading partners stem from changes in trade flows but are also affected by domestic increases in productivity since nafta exports to and imports from canada have each increased by about 55 60 this has resulted in relatively suggests few net job effects from trade with canada exports to and imports from mexico however have more or less doubled exports less and imports more than doubled this suggests some sectoral job losses from production shifts to mexico however since about twothirds of the increase in imports is covered by an increase in exports net job effects are estimated to be relatively small in relation to overall us employment2 in fact naftas overall effect on the us economy has been relatively small foreign trade itself accounts for about 14 of us gross domestic product gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98782crs2 3economists continue to debate what level the fullemployment rate of unemployment should be many believe unemployment rates below 55 suggest an excess demand for labor during the past several years unemployment rates have dipped to under 45 the lowest they have been since the late 1960s 4 the lengthy table included in previous versions of this report that listed each certified business in each state together with reasons for certification has been omitted because of size however these data for any state are available from crs by calling the author at 7 7753and trade with mexico and canada represents roughly onefifth all us trade larger effects on the overall us economy result from structural changes taking place as companies shed employment due to trade and other economic factors at the same time however the us economy is both dynamic and robust as jobs are eliminated in one industry they are added in another the united states as jobcreating nation is the envy of many develope d countries particularly canada and many european nations where employment growth has stagnated in recent years and where unemployment is in some cases oneandahalf to two times the us rate this report provides estimates on naftarelated job effects included by state are estimates of job gains covering naftas first five years and potential joblosses covering roughly naftas first fiveandahalf years state export data from which job gains by state are derived are available only annually measuring job gains and losses from trade with nafta partners is an inexact process trying to further apportion these job gains and losses by state compounds the difficulties thus these figures come with strong caveats first the terms job gains and losses are to certain extent misnomers in an economy operating at full employment trade results in neither net job gains nor net job losses only in relocations from less efficient to more efficient industries economywide job gains balance out job losses however at the industry and firm level job gains from trade will not likely equal job losses from trade 3 second it should be emphasized that jobeffect estimates included in this report were developed by different methods and are arguably incomplete and incompatible in particular job losses captured by department of labor dol certifications arguably both underestimate and overestimate the actual number of job losses from nafta for reasons mentioned below job gains while perhaps reasonably reflective of actual job gains from exports at the national level are not as accurate at the state level for reasons discussed below estimated job losses 4 the dol certifies the eligibility of workers to apply at the state level for benefits under the naftatransitional adjustment assistance naftataa program the certification identifies potential dislocated workers who if separated from their jobs would be eligible for training and income replacement benefits because either imports from mexico and canada contributed importantly to their job loss or their plant relocated to mexico or canada hence the certified nafta job losses are but subset of total job losses from nafta they include only those job losses for whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98782crs3 5 the dol office of trade adjustment assistance keeps several different lists of numbers reflecting workers certified under the naftataa program thus totals in table 1 do not continuedthe displaced worker applied for benefits and direct linkage to trade with mexico or canada or shift in production to either of these countries can be verified however naftataa certification figures may overestimate job losses among certified workers this is because not all workers certified actually lose their jobs in fact recent data from the department of labor suggest that as few as 20 30 of the certified workers actually collect naftataa benefits the others who were precertified may either not have actually lost their jobs may have found another job in lieu of needing benefits or for other reasons may not have collected their benefits table 1 naftataa certification by reason january 1 1994september 28 1999 reason for certificationcases workers of all

jobs supported by goods and services exports 198394 p 27 suggests that approximately two additional jobs support each manufacturing job by producing intermediate inputs capital goods and transportation and other services to the goods going to market the naftataa program covers some workers whose job loss is indirectly linked to trade with mexico or canada for example workers in business which supplies company directly affected by trade with mexico or canada others however whose supplier relationship is less direct may slip between the cracks 7data published by the department of commerce economics and statistics administration included in november 1996 report us jobs supported by goods and services exports 19831994 and updated by separate data release show that the number of jobs supported by 1 billion in merchandise exports was 15123 in 199314361 in 1994 13774 in 1995 13258 in 1996 and 12755 in 1997 the average annual decline in the number of jobs supported by billion dollars worth of exports is about 4 thus the estimated figure for 1998 is 12 245while certification figures may overestimate some potential nafta job loses they may miss others other workers whose job losses may be related to nafta but who are not counted in the naftataa figures include the following major groups 1 primary job losers who for some reason either did not apply for naftataa benefits or b applied and were rejected because they did not meet the criterion for certification eg trade with mexico or canada contributed somewhat rather than importantly to their job loss 2 some secondary job losers who typically account for more than half the total number of job losers in supplier or distributor industries who for reasons similar to 1 above were not certified to receive naftataa benefits and 3 other job losers whose job loss is less directly related to nafta6 some workers may be able to claim loss of jobs due to nafta even though other factors may be involved for example some argue that laborintensive jobs are shifted out of the united states to mexico because the us job market is tight and mexico has ready supply of workers willing to work for lower wages estimated job gains naftare lated jobgain estimates are based on department of commerce doc data the doc publishes data on the number of total jobs in the economy supported by exports this figure is derived through an inputoutput model which incorporate s outputperworker ratios for each subindustry thus the model estimates jobs added to the economy when output for any given sector increases doc data on all jobs supported by total merchandise exports can be used to derive the average number of jobs supported by 1 billion in merchandise exports each year the number of jobs supported by 1 billion in exports declines each year because of productivity gains and inflation7 table 3 p 7 includes two measures of job gains from exports one is gross number it focuses only on jobs created by new exports each year the other is net number it takes into consideration jobs created by new exports and jobs lost by productivity gains among workers producing for export both before and sincehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98782crs6 nafta went into effect thus the net figure measures the difference between all workers needed to produce exports to mexico and canada in 1998 and all workers needed to produce exports in 1993 gross and net numbers would be identical if productivity gains and inflation did not reduce the number of workers required to produce given dollar value of exports each year more detail on the mathematics of this is included in the appendix p 14 results of the gross and net measures of naftarelated job growth are shown in table 3 figures in table 3 are derived using data from two sources 1 doc state export data included in appendix table 6 p 11 and 2 doc averages of jobs supported by exports listed in footnote 6 from these numbers it can be estimated that increased merchandise exports to mexico and canada combined during naftas first five years 1994 through 1998 have created approximately 1212357 gross exportrelated jobs in the united states table 3 total it can also be estimated that when job losses from productivity gains among those producing for export before and since nafta are additionally taken into consideration new exports since nafta have added to the total number of workers producing for export to mexico and canada combined only about 709988 net jobs estimated numbers of net jobs in each state which support total exports to mexico and canada for 1993 and 1998 are included in columns 5 and 6 of table 7 for the country as whole the net jobsfromnewnaftaexports figure covering the period 19941998 is less than twothirds the gross figure 59 however net job gains may be much higher percent of gross job gains in specific states whose export levels started out small and increased since nafta went into effect see for example in table 3 alaska right hand column where the net figure is 76 of the gross figure for alaska exports initially at low level grew by 172 between 1993 and 1997 as can be seen in appendix table 6 p 11 it should be emphasized that estimates of jobs supporting exports in each state in table 3 are only very rough estimates and not an accurate reflection of actual jobs supporting exports for two reasons first state export data on which these figures are based reflect total sales not value added by each state second the jobs supportingeachbilliondollarsworthofexports figure includes jobs both directly and indirectly involved in manufacturing the merchandise since more than half the jobs are indirect either upstream primarily supplier or downstream primarily distribution and indirect jobs can be carried out anywhere in the country they are not necessarily attached to the state which the export figures representhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98782crs7 table 3 job gain by state estimated number

198394 op cit p 27perspective on naftarelated job effects as mentioned data on job losses and job gains due to trade are derived from different methods and data bases they are therefore incompatible and comparisons between the two could be inaccurate estimates presented above on naftarelated job losses are relatively small the more than 259618 workers certified as of september 28 1999 as potentially suffering naftarelated job losses represent less than the number of us jobs created in single month in 1998 according to the department of commerce8 roughly half of all jobs supporting exports are included in the manufacturing sector this suggests that of the approximately 710000 estimated net jobs gained from trade with mexico and canada between 1993 and 1998 about 355000 would be in manufacturing after four straight years of decline just prior to nafta during naftas first four years manufacturing jobs increased from about 18 to almost 187 million the nafta related estimated job gain in manufacturing represents about 50 of all manufacturing jobs gained between 1993 and 1998 therefore it can be argued that nafta may have made significant contribution to the manufacturing employment turnaround to complete the larger picture tables 4 and 5 identify major industries of potential job loss and export gains since nafta job gains from increased exports have not been estimated for specific industries because the number of jobs supported by each billion dollars worth of exports varies by industry several industries identified by boldface type and by an asterisk are included on both lists these are electronics transportation equipment nonelectrical machinery apparel paper products and scientific instruments this suggests that certain less efficient parts of these industries are being shifted to mexico and canada while more efficient parts are expanding domestically the apparel industry is the biggest potential job loser with 28 of all naftarelated potential job losses electronics is second with 13 as mentioned at the beginning of this report in an economy operating at full employment trade results in neither net job gains nor net job losses only in relocations from less efficient to more efficient industries job gains from trade with mexico and canada under nafta do not necessarily have to equal job losses from such trade under nafta even before

naftarelated job growth column 7column 4 note see p 14 for the algebraic formula by which these figures were calculatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98782crs14 algebraic formula relationship between gross and net jobs created from new exports since nafta this section sets forth the equation that quantifies the relationship between the gross and net methods for calculating job changes from trade with mexico and canada since nafta went into effect gross and net job changes are included in table 3 p 7 and table 7 p 12 the estimated gross number looks only at the increase in the dollar value of exports each year in billions and multiplies it by the number of workers required to produce billion dollars worth of exports it ignores any decline in employment of those already working to produce exports which occurs because productivity growth renders them redundant or longer necessary the net number looks at the total value of exports each year in billions of dollars and multiplies that by the number of workers required to produce billion dollars worth of exports the estimated number of net workers added to the payrolls to produce exports for each state calculated in this way reflects three things 1 additions to the number of workers because of an increase in exports 2 subtractions to the number of workers from productivity gains that occurred during that year and b inflation meaning that fewer items produced would represent the same value as the previous year for any state the difference between the two numbers gross and net is equal to the sum for each of the years 1994 1995 etc of the value of exports in billions to mexico and canada combined in that year times the number of jobs supporting each billion dollars worth of exports which are lost to productivity and inflation in that year mathematics of calculation let symbols represent values as follows lg gross jobs supporting new exports to nafta partners 19931998 ln net number of jobs supporting new exports

following equation showing the difference between the number of jobs supporting billion dollars worth of exports and the value of exports for the beginning and end years 2ln jfxfjixi to find the difference between the gross and net numbers of new jobs created from trade with mexico and canada since nafta went into effect equation 2 is subtracted from 1 thus for any state for any year the difference between the gross and net estimates of jobs created from new exports to mexico and canada combined since nafta went into effect represents the sum total of the number of jobs held by previously employed workers producing exports which are subsequently lost to productivity growth
