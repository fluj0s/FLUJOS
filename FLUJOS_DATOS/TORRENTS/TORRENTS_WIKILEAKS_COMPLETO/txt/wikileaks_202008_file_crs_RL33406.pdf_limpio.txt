offering pros and cons of each see crs report rl31692 medical malpractice liability refo rm legal issues and fiftystate survey of caps on punitive damages and noneconomic damages by henry cohen 2 this report will hereinafter refer only to s 22 but everything it states about s 22 applies equally to the parallel provisions of s 23medical malpractice bills s 22 and s 23 109th congress medical malpractice suits are governed for the most part by state law s 22 109th congress the medical care access pr otection act of 2006 or mcap act would impose federal standard s on some aspects of medical malpractice suits but it would leave other aspects to continue to be governed by state law unlike other pending medical malpractice bills such as hr 5 and s 354 s 22 would not apply to products liab ility suits ie it would apply only to medical malpractice suits against healthcare providers not to its against manufacturers or sellers of defective medical products that cause in jury s 23 the healthy mothers and healthy babies access to care act is identical to s 22 except that s 23 would apply only to suits alleging malpractice in connection with obstetrical or gynecological goods or services this report summarizes the ma in provisions of s 22 and s 231 preemption of state laws although medical malpractice litigation is governed by state law it affects interstate commerce which means that the us constitution article i section 8 clause 3 would permit congress to regulate it and to preempt state laws that regulate it s 22 and s 23 109th congress would impose federa l standards on some aspects of medical malpractice litigation but would leave other aspects to continue to be governed by state law2 even with respect to those aspects of medical malpractice litigation on which s 22 would impose federal standards it would not preempt every state law s 22 would not preempt any state law that imposes greater procedural or substantive protections such as shorter statute of limitations for health care provider or health care institution and it would not preempt any state law that permits and provides for the enforcement of any arbitration agreement related to health care liability claim 11c2 s 22 would also not preempt any state law whether effective before on or after the date of enactment of this act that specifies particular monetary amount of compen satory or punitive damages or the total amount of damages that ma be awarded in health care lawsuit regardless of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33406crs2 3 on this point s 22 follows hr 5 but not s 354 which would preempt state caps that are higher than s 354s this provision of s 22 raises the question of whether state that wishes to have cap may enact cap that is so high say 1 billion that it is effectively cap and thereby not be subject to the bills cap 4 for information on statutes that place nonfederal employees under the ftca see crs report 97579 making private entities and individuals immune from tort liability by declaring them federal employees and crs report rs20984 public health service act provisions providing immunity from medical malpractice liability both by henry cohenwhether such monetary amount is greater or lesser than is provided for under this act 11b3 in short s 22 would preempt only those state laws that are more favorable to plaintiffs than s 22 would be except that s 22 would not preempt state caps on damages whether such caps are higher or lower than the bills s 22s cap on caps on damages in other words would apply only in states that presently have caps and would cease to apply in states that subsequently enact caps s 22 contains one other preemption provi sion which states that the bill would supersede chapter 171 of title 28 united stat code to the extent that such chapter 1 provides for greater amount of damages or contingent fees longer period in which health care lawsuit may be commenced or reduced applicability or scope of periodic payment of future damages than pr ovided in this act or 2 prohibits the introduction of evidence regard ing collateral source benefits 11a chapter 171 is the federal tort cla ims act ftca 28 usc 1346b 2671 2680 which authorizes suits against the ited states for torts including medical malpractice committed by federal employees in the scope of their employment and for torts committed by nonfederal employees who by statute ar deemed federal employees for liability purposes4 the ftca also immunizes federal employees and those deemed federal employees from liab ility under state tort law the ftca except for certain matters such as its statute of limitations applies the law of the state where the tort occurred if s 22 becomes law then in medical malpractice suits against the united states its provisions would apply with respect to the items specified in the bills language that is quoted in the first senten ce of the previous paragraph the first of these items is damages so s 22 would supersede the ftca to the extent that the ftca provides for greater damages th an s 22 the ftca however does not provide anything with respect to damages rather it applies the relevant state law on damages under s 22 then if the ftca called for application of cap on damages that is higher than s 22s then s 22s cap would apply thus under s 22 if the defendant is not the united states then s 22s caps on damages would not preempt higher state caps but if the defendant is the united states then s 22s caps would preempt higher state caps with respect to the other items specified in the bills language quoted in the first sentence of th previous paragraph s 22 would treat the united states the same as ot her defendants s 22 would preempt state law only if it is more favorable to plaintiffshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33406crs3 5 the phrase other than health care institu tion does not appear in the parallel sections of hr 5 and s 354 and these bills never permit noneconomic damages in excess of 250000 except that hr 5 like s 22 would not preempt state caps even if they are higher than s 22s section 38 of s 22 would define health care institution as an entity licensed under federal or state law to provide health care services 6 section 5c1 provides that for purposes of applying the cap on noneconomic damages an award for future noneconomic damages shall not be discounted to present value this apparently means that if jury awards 260000 in future noneconomic damages and such amount could be paid in the form of an nnuity that costs 240000 the higher figure would control and the future noneconomic damages would be reduced to 250000 not to 240000 7 see crs report rl31721 punitive damages in medical malpractice actions burden of proof and standards for awards in the fifty states by henry cohen cap on noneconomic damages section 5 of s 22 would impose 250000 cap on noneconomic damages in any healthcare lawsuit regardless of the number of parties other than health care institution5 against whom the action is brought or the number of parate claims or actions brought with respect to the same ccurrence if final judgment is rendered against healthcare instituti on then it may be subject to up to 250000 in noneconomic damages which apparently means that the claimant could recover up to 500000 in noneconomic damages if fi nal judgment is rendered against more than one healthcare institution each in stitution may be subject to up to 250000 in noneconomic damages except that the total amount of noneconomic damages apparently recovered from all such ins titutions in such lawsuit shall not exceed 500000 which apparently means that th claimant could recover up to 750000 in noneconomic damages as noted above these caps would apply only in states that have cap before enactment of s 22 and that do not enact one subsequently6 economic damages refer to objectively verifiable monetary losses 36 that result from an injury such as medical expenses lost wages and rehabilitation costs s 22 would not cap economic damages lthough it would not prevent state from doing so see the last phrase in 11b noneconomic damages refer to pain and suffering loss of consortium and all other nonpecuniary losses of any kind or nature 314 both economic nd noneconomic damages are compensatory damages 34 as opposed to punitive damages which are awarded for the purpose of punishment or deterrence 315 punitive damages burden of proof standard for award cap section 8a provides that punitive damages may be awarded if otherwise permitted by state law if the claimant proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant acted with malic ious intent to injure the claimant or deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury that the defendant knew the claimant was substantially certain to suffer s 22 would thus preempt state law regarding the burden of proof and standard for awarding punitive damages except in states that provide greater prot ection for defendants7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33406crs4 section 8b2 would impose cap on punitive damages of 250000 or two times the amount of economic not of all compensa tory damages awarded whichever is greater as with s 22 s cap on noneconomic damages the cap on punitive damages would apply only in states that have cap before enactment of s 22 and that do not enact one subsequently liability for prescribing or dispensing drugs etc section 8c provides that health care provider who prescribes or who dispenses pursuant to prescription drug biological product or medical device approved by the food and drug administra tion for an approved indication of the drug biological product or medical device shall not be named as party to product liability suit in other words if h ealthcare provider had not been negligent in prescribing or dispensing product then he or she could not be sued merely because the product was defective this provision appears to be the only one in s 22 that would grant immunity from liability as oppos ed merely to limiting it this immunity would appear to have limited practical import however because under state law if healthcare provider is sued for distri buting defective product he or she may bring prior sellers into the suit and the first seller the manufacturer will usually end up paying the damage award s 22 would not prevent person who is injured by defective product from bringing products liability suit under state law against manufacturer or seller and such suit would not be affected by s 22 if however the injured party wished to sue healthcare provider for negligence in prescribing or dispensing the product then the injured party would have to do so in separate lawsuit to which s 22 would apply eliminating joint and several liability section 5d would eliminate joint and several liability in medical malpractice suits joint and several liability is the commonlaw rule that if more than one defendant is found liable for plaintiffs injuries then each defendant may be held 100 liable with joint and several liability the plainti ff may not recover more than once but may recover all of his or her da mages from fewer than all liable defendants with any defendant who pays more than its share of the damages entitled to seek contribution from other liable defendants under s 22 each defendant would be liable only in direct proportion to such pa rtys percentage of responsibility and if one defendant was for example insolven t then other defendant would have to pay the insolvent defenda nts share of damages the main argument for eliminating joint and several liability is that it allows plaintiff to recover his or her entire da mage award from deep pocket defendant who may have been only minimally liable the main argument for retaining joint and several liability is that it is preferable for wrongdoer to pay more than its share of the damages than for an injured plaintiff to recover less than the full amount to which he or she is entitledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33406crs5 modifying the coll ateral source rule the collateral source rule is the commonlaw rule that allows an injured party to recover damages from the defendant even if he is also entitled to receive them from third party collateral source such as healthinsurance company an employer or the government to abolis h the collateral source rule would be to require courts to reduce damage awards by amounts that plaintiff receives or is entitled to receive fro m collateral sources often collateral source such as hea lth insurer or the government has by contract or statute right of subrog ation against the tortfeasor the person responsible for the injury this mean s that the collateral source takes over the injured partys right to sue the tortfeasor for up to the amount the collateral source owes or has paid the injured party lthough the collateral source rule may enable the plaintiff to recover from both his insu rer and the defendant if the collateral source has right of subrogation then th plaintiff must reimburse the collateral source for the amount it paid him if the collateral source rule were eliminated then the defendant would not have to pay the portion of damages owed or paid by collateral source and the collateral source would not be able through subrogation to recover the amount it paid the plaintiff in the medical malpractice context therefore eliminating the collateral source rule would benefit liability insurers at the expense of health insurers and other colla teral sources because it would deny injured parties the portion of their damages awards from which th ey would have reimbursed their collateral sources section 7 of s 22 would provide that except where there is right of subrogation the amount of damages would be reduced by the amount of collateral source benefits less any insu rance premiums or other paym ents made by the claimant to obtain such benefits thus under s 22 if there is right of subrogation then plaintiff as at present could not recove r twice because he would have to reimburse the collateral source if there is right of subrogation then the plaintiff could not recover twice because s 22 would preclude him from doing so s 22 in this respect would benefit defenda nts but would not affect collateral sources because it would benefit defenda nts only in cases in which co llateral sources would have right of subrogation anyway limiting lawyers contingent fees contingent fee is one in which lawyer instead of charging an hourly fee for his services agrees in exchange for repres enting plaintiff in tort suit to accept percentage of the recovery if the plainti ff wins or settles but to receive nothing if the plaintiff loses payment is thus tingent upon there being recovery plaintiffs agree to this arrangement to afford repres entation without having to pay anything out ofpocket lawyers agree to it despite the risk of not being compensated because the percentage they receive if th ey win or settle usually from 33 to 40 generally amounts to more than an hourly fee wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33406crs6 8 s 22 does not call this provision statut of limitations statute of limitations is typically an affirmative defense which mean s that the defendant must raise it if the defendant fails to raise it then the plain tiff may sue regardless of how much time has passed see eg federal rule of civil proce dure 8c s 22 could be construed to be statute of limitations or it could be construed to place the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show that his or her injury ccurred within the time period allowedsection 6a2b of s 22 would impose cap with sliding scale in medical malpractice cases 40 of the fi rst 50000 the plaintiff recovered 33 of the next 50000 25 of the next 500000 and 15 of any additional amount expert witnesses section 6c of s 22 would prescribe qua lifications to be an expert witness in healthcare lawsuit an expert witness would have to be appropriately credentialed or licensed by state typically treat the condition at issue be substantially familiar with applicable standards of care be physician if the plaintiffs claim involves treatment that was recommended or provided by physician and be an expert in the same specialty or subspecialty as the defe ndant unless the standards of care in the two are similar federal statute of limitations the statute of limitations the period within which lawsuit must be filed for medical malpractice suits under state law is typically two or three years starting on the date of injury sometimes however the symptoms of an injury do not appear immediately or even for years after malpractice occurs many states therefore have adopted discovery rule under which the statute of limitations starts to run only when the plaintiff discovers or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered his injury or sometimes his injury and its cause section 4a of s 22 provides that except as otherwise provided in this section the time for the commencement of health care lawsuit shall be 3 years after the date of manifestation of injury or 1year after the claimant discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury whichever occurs first8 section 4b however adds that th time for commencement shall not exceed 3 years after the date of mani festation of injury except in cases of fraud intentional concealment or the presence of fo reign body which has therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect in the person of the injured person these two subsections rather than imposing time limitation that begins on the date of injury or on the date of discovery of the injury would cut off the right to sue upon the earlier of two different periods three years and one year that begin respectively on the date of ma nifestation of injury and disc overy of the injury s 22 defines neither term but it s eems to intend that if the injury is discovered through an xray or blood test for example be fore it becomes manifest ie beforehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33406crs7 9 the date on which the plaintiff discovers th injury may refer to the date on which the plaintiff learns the nature of the conditi on that caused the symptoms which will not necessarily be the date on which he learns that the condition was caused by medical malpractice keep in mind that he bill refers to discovering the injury not to discovering the cause of the injury 10 this provision of s 22 is similar to ctions 2 and 3 of hr 420 the lawsuit abuse reduction act of 2005 which passed the house on october 27 2005 see crs report rs21931 lawsuit abuse reduction act of 2005 by henry cohen and kenneth r thomas 11 this provision of s 22 might not apply if st ate has statute rather than court rule that is similar to rule 11symptoms appear then the statute of limitations would be one year if by contrast symptoms appear before the injury is discovered then the statute of limitations may be three years or it may be less than three years9 suppose that symptoms appear six months after the malpractice occurs and the injury that caused those symptoms is discovered six months after th at the plaintiff would have to sue within one year of discovery which would be 18 months afte r manifestation and two years after the malpractice occurred section 4c provides that an action by minor must be commenced within three years from the date of manifestation th ere is alternative discovery period except that if the minor is younger than 6 the action must be commenced within three years of manifestation or prior to the minors eighth birthday whichever provides longer period thus minor who is younger than 5 on the date of manifestation will have more than three years to file suit rule 11 sanctions rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure which are published in title 28 us code provides that federal cour t may impose sanctions on attorneys law firms or parties who among other things f ile frivolous claims or defenses or file pleading written motion or other paper for any improper purpose such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation the sanctions that court may impose include an order to pay penalty into court or if warranted for effective deterrence an order directing payment to the opposing party of some or all of the reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses incurred as direct result of the violation such sanctions shall be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated section 4d of s 2210 provides that whenever federal or state court determines that there has been violation of rule 11 or similar violation of applicable state court rules11 in healthcare liability action the court shall impose sanctions that shall include an order to pay the other part or parties for the reasonable expenses incurred as direct result of the violation and that are sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or compar able conduct by others similarly situated and tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33406crs8 12 none of the italics used in quotations in fro m this section of the report are in rule 11 or in s 22 13 annotation propriety and effect of structured settlements whereby damages are paid in installments over period of time and attorneys fees arrangements in relation thereto 31 alr4th 95 96compensate the party or par ties injured by such conduct12 the words italicized above indicate the significan ce of this subsection of s 22 sanctions would be mandatory and it would be ma ndatory that they include orders to pay the opposing sides reasonable expenses in addition ch orders would have to be in amounts sufficient to deter repetition rather than merely limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition in addition these changes unlike rule 11 would apply in state court rules as well as in federal courts another change that this subsection of s 22 would make is that whereas rule 11 authorizes sanctions against attorneys law firms or parties that have violated or are responsible for viol ation of rule 11 s 22 would require sanctions against attorneys law firms or pro litigants that have violated or are responsible for violation of rule 11 pro litigant is one who represents himself without an attorney s 22 thus in cases of violations of rule 11 or similar state court rules would not require sanctions against litigants with attorneys in healthcare liability actions but it would require sanctions agains t litigants without attorneys it seems uncertain whether it would allow rule 11 to continue to authorize sanctions against litigants with attorneys in healthcare liability actions ie it seems uncertain the extent to which s 22 would preempt rule 11 in this respect periodic payment of future damages traditionally damages are paid in lump sum even if they are for future medical care or future lost wages in recent years however attorneys for both parties in damages actions have occasiona lly foregone lumpsum settlements in favor of structured settlements which give the plaintiff steady series of payments over period of time through the purchase of an annuity or through selffunding by an institutional defendant13 section 9 of s 22 provides that in any health care lawsuit if an awar d of future damages without reduction to present value equaling or exceeding 50000 is made against party with sufficient insurance or other assets to fund periodic payment of such judgment the court shall at the request of any party enter judgment ordering that the future damages be paid by peri odic payments in any health care lawsuit the court may be guided by the uniform periodic payment of judgments act promulgated by the national conferen ce of commissioners on uniform state law although this provision states that an award of future damages shall not be reduced to present value to determin whether it equals or exceeds the 50000 minimum necessary for party to require the court to order periodic payments ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33406crs9 14 victor schwartz doctors delight attorneys dilemma legal times healthcare law supplement feb 28 1994 at 30does not state whether the amount of th award of future damages would be converted to present value not to requi re such conversion could be very major change significantly reducing awards if it is intended to allow defendant to pay for example 1 million award over 10 year period at 100000 year on the other hand if it requires the jury award to be converted into present value terms an annuity with present value of 1 million the reform doesnt mean that much as practical matter the defendant woul d be paying the same amount as before14 the defendant that is would have to spend 1 million for an annuity that as it earned interest over the years of its distri bution would yield the plaintiff more than 1 million had the defendant paid the plai ntiff lump sum of 1 million then the plaintiff could have purch ased that same annuity effect on federal vaccine legislation section 10 of s 22 provides that the bill would not preempt title xxi of the public health service act which is the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 42 usc 300aa1 300aa34 and would not affect part c of title ii of the public health service act which is th smallpox emergenc personnel protection act of 2003 42 usc 239239h
