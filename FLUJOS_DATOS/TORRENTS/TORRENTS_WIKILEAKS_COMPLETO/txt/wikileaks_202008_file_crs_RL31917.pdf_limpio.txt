against children sentencing within the federal criminal justice system is governed to large extent by united states sentencing commi ssions sentencing guidelines congress authorized the commission to construe and maintain the guideline system in order to eliminate the disparity that unguided j udicial sentencing di scretion might produce the guidelines establish series of steps calibrated according to the seriousness of the violation beneath the statutory maximu m provided for particular offense and above any applicable ma ndatory minimum sentence the guidelines process is essentially score card process most federal crimes have been assigned an individual guide line that provides base offense level1 and that adds or subtracts offense levels to account for the presence of specifically identified aggravating or mitigating circumstances the final offense level score requires sentence within one of six rela tively narrow sentencing ranges the six ranges vary in severity according to the extent of the offenders criminal record heretofore sentencing cour t might depart from the applicable guideline sentencing range either upward impose more vere penalty or dow nward impose less severe penalty if it f ound that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of kind or to degree not adequately take n into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines 28 usc 3553b the acts amendments to the guideline process added during debate in the house 149 cong rec h2420437 daily ed mar 27 2003 appeared to have been the product of department of justice concerns over the extent of downward departures the house judiciary committ ee hearings on the amber alert proposal hr 1104 were held in c onjunction with consideration of proposal that included change in the standard of appellate review in sentencing guideline cases hr 1161 during those hearings the depar tment of justice recommended changes in the structure of the guidelines to redu ce the number of downward departures found in federal case lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31917crs2 hr 1161 contains certain additional provis ions not found in the senate bill in particular section 12 of the bill would enact longoverdue reforms to address the growing frequency of downward departures from the sentencing guidelines this is especially problem in child pornography cases much of the damage is traceable to the supreme courts decision in koon v united states 518 us 81 1996 in koon the court interpreted the sentencing reform act to require appellate courts to apply highly deferential standard of review to departure determinations by sentencing judges the court also disapproved the practice whereby appellate courts had previously determined that certain grounds of departure were impermissible instead the court held that any factor not explicitly disapproved by the sentencing commission or by statute could serve as ground for departure in an appr opriate case as determined by the district court in its discretion under koon judges who dislike the sentencing reform act and the sentencing guidelines have significant discretion to avoid applying sentence within the range established by the commission and it is difficult for the government effectively to appeal in such cases consequently the rates of downward departure have steadily accelerated since koon moreover koon s expansion of the permissible grounds of departures had led to growing trend of increasingly vague grounds of downward departure section 12 of hr 1161 would provide muchneeded and longoverdue reform by establishing that decisions to depart from the godliness are to be reviewed under novo standard of review to that extent koon would be explicitly overruled while we enthusiastically support this measure we do not believe it goes far eno ugh we strongly urge the subcommittee to include appropriate language that would overrule both of the key holdings in koon specifically the bill should include language that would prohibit departures on any ground that the sentencing commission has not affirmatively specified as permissible ground for downward departure in doing so the bill would effectively overrule koon on this point as well hr 1104 the child abduction prevention act and hr 1161 the child obscenity and pornography prevention act of 2003 hearing

judiciary the committee reported out hr 1104 but not hr 1161 or any language addressing the justice departments c oncern over downward departures hrept 10847 2003 during debate however representative feeney offered an amendment that incorporated sentencing guideline modifications into the bill and that echoed the sentiments of the justice department mr chairman this amendment addresses longstanding and increasing problems of downward departures form the federal sentencing guidelines according to the testimony of the department of justice this is especially problem in child pornography cases although the guidelines continue to state that departures should be very rare occurrences they have in fact proved to be anything but increasingly the exceptions are overriding the rule the department of justice believes that much of this damage is traceable to the supreme courts 1996 decision in koon versus the united states in the koon case the court held that any factor not explicitly disapproved by the sentencing commission or by statute could serve as grounds for departure so judges can make up exceptions as they go along this has led to an accelerated rate of downward departures judges who dislike the sentencing reform and the sentencing guidelines now have significant discretion to avoid applying sentence within the range established by the commission and it is difficult for government to effectively appeal such cases the amendment i offer today contains number of provisions designed to ensure more faithful adherence to the guidelines so defendants in cases involving child pornography and sexual abuse receive the sentences that congress intended 149 congrec h2422423 daily ed mar 27 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31917crs3 the amendment passed and the

act which makes the guidelines generally binding on courts but does not ex cise 18 usc 3553b2 which makes the guidelines binding in sentencing for convicti ons for certain child crimes and sexual offenses subsection b2 could arguably be read to independently require court to follow the guidelines in convictions under the various listed child and sexual offenses however we see unique feature of guidelines sentences for child crimes and sexual offenses that would prevent them from violating the sixth amendment in the same manner as guidelines sentences for other crimes for this reas on we suspect that the supreme courts failure to excise the entirety of section 3553b was simply an oversight 11 ussg 5k11 upon motion of the go vernment stating that the defendant has provided substantial

crimes made subject to the more demanding downward departure requirements seems to have been based both on th subject material of the legislation and concern over th extent of downward departures in the type of cases selected the conference report observed that those convicted of sexual abuse received downward departure in over 16 percent of the cases and trial courts granted reductions below the guideline rang of those convicted of sexual abuse by an astonishing 63 percent from the guid eline range for those convicted of pornography andor prostitution related offenses trial courts departed from the recommended guidelines over 18 percent of the time reducing these defendants sentences by staggering 66 per cent hrept 10866 at 589 2003 the supreme court in united states v booker 125 sct at

extent of the decrease ordinarily should depend on the reasonableness of the defendants actions and on the extent to which the conduct would have been less harmful under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be ordinarily coercion will be sufficiently serious to warrant departure only when it involves threat of phy sical injury substantial damage to property or similar injury resulting from the unlawful action of third party or from natural emergency the commission considered the relevance of economic hardship and determined that personal financial difficulties and economic pressures upon trade or business do not warrant decrease in sentence 14 ussg 5k216 if the defendant vol untarily discloses to authorities the existence of and accepts responsibility for the offense prio r to the discovery of such offense and if such offense was unlikely to have been di scovered otherwise departure below the applicable guideline range for that offense may be warranted for example downward departure under this section might be considered where defendant motivated by remorse discloses an offense that otherwise would have remained undiscovered this provision does not apply where the motivating factor is the defendants knowledge that discovery of the offense is likely or imminent or where the fendants disclosure occurs in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the defendant for related conduct 15 ussg 5h14 an extraordinary physical impairment may be reason to impose sentence below the applicable guideline range eg in the case of seriously

extraordinary physical impairment may be reason to impose sentence below the applicable guideline range only if and to the extent permitted by 5h14 voluntary disclosure of an offense14 and for
