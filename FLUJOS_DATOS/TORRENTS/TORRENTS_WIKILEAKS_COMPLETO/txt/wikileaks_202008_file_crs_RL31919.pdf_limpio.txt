the fact act signed on december 4 2003 includes inter alia number of amendments to the fair credit reporting act aimed at preventing identity theft and assisting victims26 generally these new provisions mirror laws passed by state legislatures and create national standard for addressing consumer concerns with regard to identity theft and other types of fraud27 credit card issuers who operate as users of consumer credit reports are required under new provision of the fcra to follow certain procedures when the issuer receives request for an additional or replacement card within short period of time following notification of change of address for the same account 28 in further effort to prevent identity theft other new provisions require the truncation of credit card account numbers on electronically printed receipts29 and upon request the truncation of social security numbers on credit reports provided to consumer30 consumers who have been victims of identity theft or expect that they may become victims are now able to have fraud alerts placed in their files31 pursuant to the new provisions consumer may request fraud alert from one consumer reporting agency and that agency is required to notify the other nationwide consumer reporting agencies of the existence of the alert in general fraud alerts are to be maintained in the file for 90 days but consumer may request an extended alert which is maintained for up to seven years the fraud alert becomes part of the consumers credit file and is thus passed along to all users of the report the alert must also be included with any credit score generated using the consumers file and must be referred to other consumer reporting agencies 32 24 15 usc 1681n 15 usc 1681o 25 pl 108159 section 156 26 pl 108159 for
