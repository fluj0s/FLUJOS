divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32500proposals for intelligence reorganization 19492004 summary proposals for the reorganization of th united states intelligence community have repeatedly emerged from commissions and committees created by either the executive or legislative branches the he retofore limited authority of directors of central intelligence and the great influence of the departments of state and defense have inhibited the emergence of majo r reorganization plans from within the intelligence community itself proposals to reorganize the intelligence community emerged in the period immediately following passage of the na tional security act of 1947 pl 80253 that established the position of director of central intelligence dci and the central intelligence agency cia recommendations have ranged from adjustments in the dcis budgetary responsibilities to the actua l dissolution of the cia and returning its functions to other departments the goals underlying such proposals have reflected trends in american foreign policy and the international environment as well as domestic concerns about governmental accountability in the face of hostile soviet union early intelligence reorganization proposals were more concerned with stions of efficiency in the cold war context of the 1950s number of recommendations sought aggressively to enhance us covert action and counterintelligence capabilities the chairman of one committee charged with investigating the nations intelligence capabilities army general james h doolittle argued that sacrificing americas sense of fair play was wholly justified in the struggle to prevent soviet world domination following the failed invasion of cuba at the bay of pigs the unsuccessful results of intervention in vietnam and the watergate scandal investigations by congressional committees focused on the propriety of wide range of heretofore accepted intelligence activities that incl uded assassinations and some domestic surveillance of us citizens some forcefully questioned the viability of secret intelligence agencies within democratic society these investigations resulted in much closer congressional oversight and more exacting legal framework for intelligence activities at the same time the growth in technical intelligence capabilities led to an enhanced but by means predominant leadership role for the dci in determining comm unitywide budgets and priorities with the end of the cold war emerging security concerns including transnational terrorism narco tics trafficking and prolif eration of weapons of mass destruction faced the united states some statutory changes were made in the mid 1990s but their results were not farreaching in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 attacks and the iraq war some

statutory framework for the managerial structure of the united states intelligence community including the central intelligence agency cia and the position of director of central intelligence dci f undamental intent of th is legislation was to coordinate and to certain extent centralize the nascent intelligence efforts of the united states as an emergent superpower in the face of hostile soviet union in addition the act provided the cia with the ability to assume an operational role by charging it with performing such other functions and du ties related to inte lligence affecting the national security as the national secur ity council may from time to time direct1 in 1947 the foundation of the present day intelligence community consisted only of the relatively small intelligence components in the armed services the departments of state and the treasury th federal bureau of investigation fbi and the fledgling cia since 1947 however the intelligence community has greatly expanded in size nd acquired much broader ra nge of responsibilities in the collection analysis and dissemin ation of foreign intelligence2 the us intelligence community is defined in the national security act as amended it currently includes the following central intelligence agency national security agency defense intelligence agency national geospatialintelligence agency national

information and coast guard3 beginning in january 1948 numerous independent commissions individual experts and legislative initiatives have examined the growth and evolving mission of the intelligence community proposals by these groups have sought to address perceived shortcomings in the intelligence communitys structure management role and mission these proposals have ra nged in scope from basic organizational restructuring to the dissolution of the cia in 1948 and 1949 tw executive branch co mmissions examined the intelligence and operational missions of th cia and identified funda mental administrative and organizational loopholes in pl 80253 by the 1950s however the physical growth and evolving mission of the intelligence community led subsequent commissions to broaden the scope of their proposals to include the enhancement of the dcis communitywide authority and the establishment of executive and legislative branch intelligence oversight committees unlik the intelligence investigations of the 1970s and 1980s these early studies were primarily concerned with questions of efficiency and effectiveness rather than with issues of legality and propriety following the vietnam war and wate rgate investigat ory bodies became increasingly critical of the national intellig ence effort beginning in the mid1970s the impetus shifted to the legislative branch where investigatory committees led by senator frank church and representative otis g pike issued broad range of proposals including the separation of th dci and cia director positions dividing the cias analytical and operational respons ibilities into two separate agencies and the establishment of congressional oversight committees in 1976 and 1977 respectively recommendations by the these committees led to the establishment of the senate select committee on intelligence ssci and the house permanent select committee on intelligence hpsci these committees were heavily involved in the investigations into the iranc ontra affair of the mid1980s with the end of the cold war and in the wake of the aldrich ames espionage case both the executive and legislative br anches undertook studies to determine the future roles capabilities management and structure of the intelligence community these studies include such issues as the need to maintain the cia as separate entity the extent and competence of us count erintelligence ci efforts and the managerial structure of intelligence com ponents in the armed services and the department of defense dod compre hensive examination of the dcis roles responsibilities authorities nd status was also undertaken in an era of budgetary constraints and shifting po licy concerns these studies also examined personnel issues allocation of resources duplication of services expanded use of open source intelligence oscint and the need for maintaining covert action ca capability the results of this effort were reflected in organizational adjustments made by the intelligence authorization act for fy1997 pl 104293 but some observers have subsequently concluded that this legislation did not go far enough and that in

security act of 1947 to be soundly constructed but not yet working well9 the report identified fundamental organizational and qualitative shortcomings in the national intelligence effort and the newly created cia principal concern of the task force was the adversarial relationship and lack of coordination between the cia the military and the state department it suggested that this resulted in unnecessary duplication and the issuance of departmental intelligence estimates that have often been subjective and biased10 in large measure the military and state department were blamed for their failure toconsult and share pertinent information with the cia the task force recommended that positive efforts be made to foster relations of mutual confidence between the cia and the several departments and agencies that it serves 11 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32500crs5 12 arthur b darling the central intelligence agency an instrument of government to 1950 university park pa pennsylvania

intelligence the eberstadt report supported the integrati on of all clandestine operati ons into one office within cia under nsc supervision to alleviat concerns expressed by the military who viewed this proposal as encroaching upon th eir prerogatives the report stated that clandestine operations should be the responsibility of the joint chiefs of staff jcs in time of war15 in examining the daily workings of the cia the task force found the agencys internal structure and personnel sy stem not now properly organized16 this led to recommendations for the adoption of clearer lines of

highlighting the cias and by implica tion the dcis failure to take charge of the production of coordi nated nationa l estimates24 the report went on to argue that the cias current trend in secret intelligence activities s hould be reversed in favor of its mandated role as coordinator of intelligence25 the dulles report was partic ularly concerned about the personnel situation at cia including internal security the hi gh turnover of employees and the excessive number of military personnel assigned to the agency26 to add continuity of service and the greatest assurance of independence of action the report argued that the dci should be civilian and that military appointees be required to resign their commissions27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32500crs7 28 dullesjacksoncorrea report pp 34

the professionalism of the service intelligence organizations and urged that the cia provide greater coordination28 this led to recommendation for increased coordination between the dci and the director of the federal bureau of investigation fbi in the arena of counterespionage in turn the report r ecommended that the director of fbi be elevated to membership in the intelligence advisory committee iac whose function was to help the dci coordinate intelligence and set intelligence requirements29 the principal thrust of the report was proposed largescale reorganization of the cia to end overlapping and duplication of functions similar to the eberstadt report the dulles study suggested incorpor ating covert operati ons and clandestine intelligence into one office within cia in particular the report recommended that the office of special operati ons oso responsible for the clandestine collection of intelligence and the office of policy coor dination opc responsible for covert actions be integrated into single division within cia30 accordingly the report recommended repl acing existing offices with four new divisions for coordination estimates resear ch and reports and operations the heads of the new offices would be included in the immediate staff of the dci so that he would have intimate contact with the daytoday operations of his agency and be able to give policy guidance to them31 these recommendations would become the blueprint for the future organization and operation of the presentday cia summary of the truman administration intelligence investigations the task force on national security organization was almost immediately eclipsed by the dullesjacksoncorrea repo rt that found sympathetic ear in the white house on july 7 1949 the nsc dopted modified version of the dulles report and directed dci roscoe h hillenkoetter to be gin implementing its recommendations including the establishment of single operations division at cia in 1953 the oso and opc were merged within the cia to form the directorate of plans dp dp was designated the di rectorate of operations do in 1973 although the eberstadt report was not as widely read among policymakers as the dulles study it did play principal role in reorganization efforts initiated by dci walter bedell smith in 1950 the two repor ts and the lessons learned from fall of china to the communists and the unexpected north korean invasion of south korea in june 1950 prompted smith to create an intelligence evaluation board called the board of national estimates bne designed to review

described the evolution of the intelligence community and its then current functioning the report initiated the official use of the term intelligence community33 until that time the us had sought to

provide independent oversight of intelligence activities that were normally kept secret from other parts of the government35 the full commissions report elaborated on this by recommending the establishment of both congressional oversight committee and presidential advisory panel the task force also expressed c oncern about counterintelligence and recommended systematic recheck ing of all personnel every five years to make sure that the passage of time has not altered the trustworthiness of any employee and to make certain that none has succumbed to some weakness of intoxicants or sexual perversion36 in addition the task force recomme nded that the cia replace the state department in the procurement of fo reign publications and for collection of scientific intelligence37 finally there were number of housekeeping recommendations such as the need to cons truct an adequate cia headquarters to improve linguistic training and to raise the salary of the dci to 20000 annually38 the doolittle report 1954 in response to the establishment of the second hoover commissions task force on intelligence activities presiden t eisenhower sought and secured an agreement for separate report to be presented to him personally on the cias directorate of plans that now had re sponsibility for both clandestine intelligence collection and covert operations accordingly in july 1954 eisenhower commissioned lieutenant general james doolittle usaf to report on the cias covert activities and to make any recommendations calculated to improve the conduct of these operations39 on september 30 1954 doolittle submitte d his 69page classified report directly to eisenhower declassified in 1976 the doolittle report contained forty two recommendations the report began by summarizing

must develop effective espionage and counterespionage services nd must learn to subvert sabotage and destroy our enemies by more clever more sophisticated and more effective methods than those used against us it may become necessary that the american people be made acquainted with understand and support this fundamentally repugnant philosophy40 the report went on to recommend that ev ery possible scientific and technical approach to the intelligence problem be ex plored since the closed society of the eastern bloc made human espionage prohibitive in terms of dollars and human lives41 in examining the cia doolittle found it to be properly placed in the organization of the government furtherm ore the report found the laws relating to the cias functions were sufficient for the agency to meet its operational needs ie penetration of the soviet bloc42 the report went on to issue several recommendations calling for more effici ent internal administration including recruitment and training procedures b ackground checks of personnel and the need to correct the natural tendency to over classify documents originating in the agency43 it also called for increased c ooperation between the clandestine and analytical sides of the agency and recommended that the inspector general operate on an agencywide basis with aut hority and responsibility to investigate and report on all activities of the agency44 finally the report mentioned the need to provide cia with accommodations tailored to its specific needs and to exercise better control accountability of ex penditures in covert projects shortly after submitting the written report general doolittle voiced his concern to president eisenhower over the potential difficulties that could arise from the fact that the dci allen dulles and the secr etary of state john foster dulles were brothers and might implement policies without adequate consultation with other administration officials45 brucelovett report 1956 in

criticized the cia for being too heavily involved in th irdworld intrigues while neglecting the collection of hard intelligence on the sovi et union reportedly bruce and lovett went on to express concern about the lack of coordination nd accountability of the governments psychological and political warfare program stating that charge is made for failure the report claimed that one other than those in cia immediately concerned with their dayto day operation has an detailed knowledge of what is going on47 these operations asserted bruce and lovett were in the hands of horde of cia

criticized the close relationship between secretary of state john foster dulles and his brother dci allen w dulles due to the unique position of each brother the repor t apparently expressed concern that they could unduly influence us foreign polic according to their own perceptions49 the report concluded by suggesting that th us reassess its approach to covert action programs and that permanent

mmissions report and general doolittles findings two new nsc directives 54121 and 54122 were issued pertaining to covert activities in marc h and november 1955 respectively together these directives

invasion force and exposing direct us involvement the fiasco led to two official examina tions of us invol vement and conduct in operation zapata the first the taylor commission was initiated by president john f kennedy in an attempt to ascertain the overall cause of the operations failure the second the kirkpatrick report was an internal cia i nvestigation to determine what had been done wrong the taylor commission on april 22 president kennedy asked general maxwell ta ylor former army chief of staff to chair highlevel body composed of attorney general robert kennedy former chief of

sentiment and ultimately overthrow the cuban government or iginally intended by the eisenhower administration as guerrilla operation zapata was supposed to operate within the parameters of nsc directive 54122 that called in part for plausible us deniability however in the kennedy administration the operation grew in size and scope to include fullscale military invasion involvi ng sheepdipped b26 bombers supply ships and landing craft52 the report found that the magnitude of zapata could not be prepared and conducted in such way that all us support of it and connection with it could be pl ausibly disclaimed53 in large measure the report blamed the operations planners at the cias directorate of plans for not keeping the president fully informed as to the exact nature of the operation however the re port also criticized th state department jcs and the white house for acquiescing in the zapata plan that gave the impression to others of appr oving it and for reviewing successive changes of the plan piecemeal and only within limited context procedure that was inadequate for proper examination of all the military ramifications54 the taylor commission found the operation to be illconceive d with little chance for ultimate success once underway however the report cited president kennedys decision to limit overt us air s upport as factor in the cefs defeat55 this decision was apparently reached in orde r to protect the covert character of the operation the report criticized this decisi on by stating that when an operation had been approved restrictions designed to pr otect its covert char acter should have been accepted only if they did not impair the chance of success56 the failure in communication breakdown in coordination nd lack of overall planning led the taylor co mmission to conclude that the executive branch of government was not organizationally prepared to cope with this kind of paramilitary operation there was single authority

more of the detached perspective of managementconsultant the kirkpatrick report was viewed as personal attack against the cia and dci dulles the 170page report remains classifi ed however in 1972 kirkpatrick published an article in the naval war college review that apparently reflected the findings of his report60 in particular kirkpatrick criticized the zapata planners at the directorate of

the oper ation frenzied kirkpatrick accused the cia of playing it by ear and misleading the president by failing to inform him that success had become dubious61 in kirkpatricks view the cia bore most

required to permit you to carry out your primary task as dci62 the johnson administration 19631969 major investigations of the in telligence community were conducted under president lyndon b johnson

problems as the lack of strong central intelligence community leadership that could consider the relationship between cost and substantive output from national perspective66 schlesinger found that this had engendered fragmen ted departmental intelligence effort to correct these problems schlesinger considered the creation of director of national intelligence dni enhancing th dcis authority and establishing coordinator of national intelligence cni who would act as the white houselevel overseer of the intelligence community to provide more direct representation of presidential interest in

result of the nixon directive was the establishment of the intelligence community staff ics in 1972 created by dci helms the ics was meant to assist the dci in guiding the communitys collection and

two hoover commissions and devoted greater attention to intelligen ce issues although it made reference to the need to correct occasional failures to observe those standards of conduct that should distinguish the behavior of agencies of the us government71 the commissions approach was marked by an emphasis of the value of intelligence to national security policymakin g and was on the whole

observers the murphy commission did not believe that this situation should be changed fundamentally it is neither possible nor desirable to give the dci line authority over that very large fraction of the intelligence community that lies outside the cia at the same time it recommended that the dci have an office in close proximity to the white house and be accorded regular and direct contact with the president the commission envisioned dci delegating cons iderable authority for managing the cia to deputy while he devoted more time to community wide res ponsib ilities the commission also recommended that the dcis title be changed to director of foreign intelligence73 the commission provided for ot her oversight mechanisms viz strengthened pfiab and more extensive review prior to their initiation and on continuing basis thereafter of covert actions by highlevel interagency committee it argued that although congress should be tified of covert actions th president should not sign such notifications since it is harmful to asso ciate the head of state so formally with such activities74 it was further recommended that intelligence requirements and capabilities be established at the nsclevel to remedy situation in which the work of the intelligence community becomes larg ely responsive to its own perceptions of what is important and irrelevant information is collected sometimes drowning out the important75 it also recommended that this process be formalized in an officially approved fiveyear plan consolidated foreign intelligence budget should also be prepared approved by an interagency committee and omb and submitted to congress although the importance of economic inte lligence was recognized the commission did not see need for intelligence agencies to seek to expand in this area rather it suggested that the analytical capabilities of the departments of state treasury commerce agriculture and th council of economic advisers should be significantly strengthened the commission noted the replacement of the board of national estimates by some eleven national intelligence officers nios who were to draw upon analysts in various agencies to draft national intelligence estimates nies this practice was criticized because it laid exce ssive burdens on chosen analysts and because nies had in recent years been largely ignored by senior officials presumably secretary of

escape searching criticism during the era of the vietnam war and watergate disputes over national security policy focused attention on in telligence activities in 1975 media accounts of alleged intelligence abuses some stretching back over decades led to series of highly publicized congressional hearings revelations of assa ssination plots and other alle ged abuses spurred three separate investigations nd sets of recommendations the first was undertaken within the executive branch and was headed by vice president nelson rockefeller other investigations we re conducted by select committees in both houses of congress the senate effort was led by senator fr ank church and the house committee was chaired by representative otis pike these investigations led to the creation of the two permanent intelligence committees and much closer oversight by the congress in addition they also produced number of recommendations for reorganization and realignment within the intelligence community established by executive order 11828 on january 4 1975 the commission on cia activities within the united states was chaired by vice president rockefeller and included seven others appointed by president ford including thenformer governor ronald reagan the commissi ons mandate was to investigate whether the cia had violated provisions of the na tional security act of 1947 precluding the cia from exercising internal security functions the rockefeller commissions 30 recommendations76 included number of proposals designed to delimit cias authority to collect foreign intelligence within the united states from willing sources nd proscribe collection of information about the domestic activities of us citizens to strengthen pfiab to establish congressional joint intelligence committee

nagerial questions per after extensive and highly publicized hearings the committee made some 183 reco mmendations in its final report issued april 26 197678 the principal recommendation was that om nibus legislation be enacted to set forth the basic purposes of national intelligence activities and defining the relationship between intelligence activities and the congress criticizing vagueness in the national security act of 1947 the committee urged charters for the several intelligence agencies to set forth general organizational structures and procedures and delineate roles and res ponsibilities there should also be specific and clearly defined prohibitions or limitations on intelligence activities the effort to pass such legislation would consume c onsiderable attention over number of years following the completion of the work of the church committee number of recommendations reflected the committees views on the appropriate role of the na tional security council in di

personnel system with more established analysts being brought in at middle and upper grades nior positions should be established on the basis of analytical ability rather than ad ministrative responsibilities analysts should be encouraged to accept temporary assignments at other agencies or on the nsc staff to give them an appreciation for policym akers use of intelligence information

expenditures in the presidents budget and that the total sum budgeted for intelligence be disclosed the committee recommended that transfer s of funds be prohibited between agencies or departments involved in in telligence activities reprogramming of funds within agencies would be dependent upon the specific approval of congressional oversight and appropriations committees the same procedures

goldwaternichols depa rtment of defense reorganization act of 1986 the two versions of the initiative s 2198 and hr 4165 102nd congress differed in several respects but the overall thrust of the two bills was similar both proposals called for the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32500crs30 creating director of national in telligence dni with authority to program and reprogram inte lligence funds throughout the intelligence community including the defense department and to direct their expenditure and to task intelligence agencies and transfer personnel tempor arily from one agency to another

creating separate dir ector of the cia subordinate to the new dni to manage the agencys collection and covert action capabilities on daytoday basis consolidating analytical and estimative efforts of the intelligence community including analysts from cia and some from dia the bureau of intelligence and research inr at the state department and other agencies into separa office under one of the deputy dnis this aspect of the proposal would effectively separate cias analytical elements from its collection and covert action offices creating national imagery agency within the department of defense dod to collect exploit and analyze imagery these tasks had been spread among several entities the house version would divide these efforts into two new separate agencies and authorizing the director of dia to task defense intelligence agencies dia nsa the new imagery agency with collection requirements and to shift func tions funding and personnel from one dod intelligence agency to

directives provided the dci authority to task intelligence agencies outside the cia nd to approve budgets and reprogramming efforts in practice however this author ity had never been fully exercised

intelligence and managing the community would fail to support the dod the way it needed to be supported with intelligence since ive come over to the central intelligence agency side of the

argued the relations have been good112 the following february the senate intelligence committee met to consider the nomination of james simon as assistant dci for administration at the hearing the

career specialties and more j oint tours in other agencies that would be designated as careerenhancing the thenvice chairman of the senate intelligence committee senator richard shelby submitted additional views that also advocated organizational changes in the intelligence community119 shelby argued that the fragmented nature of the dcis authority has exacerbated the centrifugal tendencies of bureaucr atic politics and has helped ensure that the ic responds too slowly and too disjointedly to shifting threatsaccordingly the office of the dc i should be given more management and budgetary authority over ic organs and be separated from the job of the cia director120 further shelby argued that the basic structure of the national security act needs to be reexamined to separate central analytical functions from resource hungry collection responsibilities that make ag encies into selfinterested bureaucratic players shelby acknowledged that creating true dci would entail removing dozens of billions of dollars of annual budgets from the defense department and depriving it of ownership over its combat support organizations in contemporary washington bureaucratic politics this would be daunting challenge dod and its congressional allie s would make such centra lization an uphill battle to say the least121 shelby also recalls the goldwaternichols precedent in urging that the intelligence community be restructured but cautions that the intelligence community should not be reformed sole ly to meet the terrorist threat we need an intelligence community agile enough to evolve as threats evolve on continuing basis hardwiring the ic in order to fight terrorists i should emphasize is precisely the wrong answer because such an approach would surely leave us unprepared for the

principal recommendations made public on july 22 2004 address the organization of the intelligence community the commission argues that with current authorities the dci is responsible for community

standards for the information infrastructure and personnel123 the 911 commission recommends the establishment of national counterterrorism center nct c responsible for both joint operational planning and joint intelligence and the position of director of national intelligence in addition to overseeing various intelligence centers the dni would manage the national foreign intelligence program and oversee the agencies that contribute to it the community management staff would report to the dni the dni would manage the agencies with the help of three deputies each of whom would also hold key position in one of the component agencies deputy for foreign intelligence would be the nowseparate head of the cia deputy for defense intelligence would be the under secretary of defense for

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32500crs40 conclusion the efforts of committees commissions and individuals to encourage restructuring of the us intelligence community have led to numerous changes through internal agency direction presid ential directives and executive orders and new statutes the general trend has been towards more thorough oversight both by the executive branch and by congressional committees the position of the dci has been considerably strengthened and dcis have been given greater staff and authority to exert influence on all parts of the community they have not however been given line authority over agencies other than the cia and the influence of the defense department remains pervasive some have argued that in the light of the intelligence communitys inability to provide warning of the september 2001 attacks on the world trade center and the pent agon and inaccurate intelligence estimates about iraqi weapons of mass destruction the need for reorganizing the intelligence community has become selfevident othe rs argue that many of the reforms that have been proposed could ma ke matters worse the issue appears to be moving higher on the congressional agenda specifi c legislation to reorganize the nations intelligence effort including s 2845 is cu rrently under consideration and the 911 commissions recommendations are receiving widespread interest
