from viva banzon vivabanzonnoaagov to thomascpetersonnoaagov subject re ersst date thu 08 oct 2009 144811 0400 cc tom wigley wigleyucaredu tom karl thomasrkarlnoaagov phil jones pjonesueaacuk ben santer santer1llnlgov richardwreynoldsnoaagov derekarndtnoaagov hello everyone additional info provided belowviva ersst refers only to the ocean temperature fields smith et 2008 described the updates to create ersst version 3 this included the use of in situ and satellite data the paper also presented updates to the land surface temperature lst product and culminated in the computation of the merged landocean surface temperature product however since ca nov 2008 satellite data was removed from the analysis and was called v3b but the methodology is essentially the same as in the paper the reason was that there was residual cold bias in the satellite data this caused problems for users concerned with rankings we do not handle the page for the lst and merged st product and perhaps there should be more coordination among these webpages we have noticed the confusion about the ersst v3 and v3b in several articles are in the process of updating the webpage the in situ data used for the ersstv3b is icoads the current v3b was computed using icoads release 24 17842007 in july 2009 new release was made with additional data pre1900s and during the war years but we have plans yet to reprocess it is during such reprocessing that we will include any missed data operationally we run the code on the 3rd of each month using the available gts data the baseline for the ersst anomalies is 19712000 for the lst the ghcn box averages are provided to us as anomalies already so i am not sure what the baseline is i just started 3 months ago so i have not worked lot on the merged product codes yet in the programs there is an adjustment of the lst anomaly to 19712000 base so the final merged st anomaly has 19712000 base period the best practice would be to reconstruct the original st by adding the 19712000 base then compare or adjust or change baselines as you please btw my last name is banzon r alas i am not related to the 261st richest person note the opinions expressed in this

sitting next to here in southern spain and also checking email explained what you are working on and it sounds like potentially very insightful analysis i wish you luck viva branson ccd is our newimproved keeper of ersst we sometimes refer to her as dick reynolds version b dick is ccd as well she will be able to answer your questions more accurately than i but if i recall correctly from talking to them monday to avoid confusion they are trying to only make the latest and therefore best version of ersst available so the version you downloaded should be 3b but viva can verify this for you i dont know which reference is currently the recommended one to use decade ago ncdc did global land analysis and global ocean analysis and then combined them with weighting of 3070 this could also arguably be the most accurate way to combine spatially incomplete data so that the world is not inappropriately weighted more towards the ocean than land which tends to have larger gaps once we used tom smiths more spatially complete analysis we went with simple global average while the data are more spatially complete they are not complete data are set to missing over sea ice much of the world north of 75n and antarctica viva and i are currently reevaluating options for those last two ersst is updated monthly the sst portion is already updated for september and the land portion will wait another week or so for more data to come in i realize ive been assuming you are using ersst as shorthand for ncdcs merged landocean data set equivalent to hadcru if youre only asking about ssts viva and dick are the people to ask the base period used for calculation of anomalies from the grid box mean of ersst is i believe the 30 years 196190 as that had the most data so if you are using gridded field that is the relevant number though viva can verify my memory on the dates but when we make global averaged temperature time series we adjust the time series up or down so that the zero line is the mean of 19001999 viva dick do you have anything to add or correct tom ive also ccd deke arndt the head of our climate monitoring branch because if you find this confusing he will probably want to make sure the web pages you read are made clearer regards tom p original message from tom wigley 3wigleyucaredu date thursday october 8 2009 216 am subject ersst dear toms could you please clarify few things for 1 is the currently downloadable ersst data version 3 or 3b it seems to be 3b but the web page is not entirely clear in one place it says that v3 will be used from july but elsewhere it says 3b will be used from july if it is v3b then does this mean that the smith et reference is not quite appropriate 2 is ersst spatially complete i think not if it were then nhsh2 should equal gl but this is not the case im sure you know that hadcru uses nhsh2 for the global mean arguably superior to straight global area average it seems odd that this issue has been glossed over 3 how often will ersst be updated i presume you are aware that hadcru updates annually to get the late data in it seems that ersst only updates with new numbered versions so it misses late data giss is worse 4 what is the reference period i think i saw somewhere on the web page that it is 190099 but methodologically perhaps it is difficult to define reference period thanks tom references 1 mailtovivabanzonnoaagov 2
