and industry division summary congressional policymakers are seeking way to accelerate the nations transition to digital television dtv and to expedite the transfer of certain radio frequency channels from the broadcast industry to public safety and commercia l users later than 2009 the congressional budget office s informally estimated value of 125 billion from auction proceeds for these comme rcial channels many believe the amount could be higher broadcasters are holding this valuable spectru m channels 5269 but would be required to relinquish it after th transition to dtv is achieved without hard deadline the transition to digital television has been delayed and the spectrum has not been made available for other uses congress anticipates applying some of the proceeds received from auctions of the spectrum to be cleared to help meet deficit reduction goals passed in hconres 95 consequently some legislation deemed necessary to assure timely transition to digital television was included in the fy2006 budget reconciliation process p l 109171 it includes key provisions essential to the release of spectrum and provides over 7 billion toward deficit reduction the transition to digital television has two major policy components one set of policy decisions is concerned with how best to move television br oadcasters and their viewers to digital technology other key policy

november 15 2005value of the spectrum wireless technology is evolving rapidly nd in recent years the industry has moved into offering highspeed cont entrich services generally known as 3g third generation while at the same time preparing to offer new services using even more advanced technologies the 700 mhz spectrum that is to be relinquished by broadcasters is widely considered to be especially desirable for dvanced wireless services also many states are waiting for the spectrum to be freed in order to follow up on their plans for r obust interoperable public safety co mmunications networks furt hermore digital television represents superior form of technology both in its efficient use of spectrum and the quality of the picture it provides the value of the auction revenue in reducing the budget deficit is also benefit overall the bene fits of releasing spectrum now used for analog tv broadcasting to complete the switch to digital are considered to be substantial outweighing the costs of conversion in considering the potential revenue from spectrum sales reconciliation negotiators could decide to review the probable value of the channels the congressional budget office had set benchmark estimate of 10 billion in re venue from auction of this spectrum2 which it reportedly subseque ntly raised to 125 billion3 other estimates have projected that spectrum auctions in the 700 mhz band would gross 20 billion to 30 billion4 significant factor in valuing spect rum is the size of the market served usually this value is expressed in terms of dollars per mhzpopulation using this methodology value of 165 per mhzpopulati on for example yields potential value of 28 billion for 60 mhz of spectrum at 700 mhz dollar per mhzpopulation estimates for upcoming auctions are derived from results of earlier auctions for similar spectrum this estimated value is then typically increased or decreased depending on assumptions about number of variables the different weight that analysts give to the impact of hardtomeasure market conditions largely explains the range in valuations for example poor economic conditions ma depress all market s and put downward pressure on prices for spectrum just as an exuberant market eager to implement new technology may place an unusually high value on obtaining new licenses the usability of spectrum is an important factor as well there is disincentive to invest in nonperforming asset such as spectrum that is blocked by other users or spectrum that does not serve an immediate market because ne w technology is not ready for deployment in the case of spectrum at 700 mhz some anal ysts have expressed concern that there is significant risk that the spectrum will remain encumbered despite hard dates for the switch to digital thereby tying up resources indefinitelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22306crs4 5 see us government accountability offi ce testimony before the subcommittee on

issues in the current budget resolution is one step in long pr ocess of introducing di gital television dtv technology that extends over more than decade the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 provided that eligib ility for dtv licenses should be li mited in itially to existing broadcasters digital signals cannot be transmitted with existing analog television technology therefore broadcasters were issued additional licenses for new dtv broadcast channels while continuing to broadcast on existing channels during the transition period the old analog licenses were to be returned to the federal government after the transition to dtv in the bala nced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 congress set deadline of december 31 2006 to complete the transition from analog to digital television but allowed several exceptions that can extend that deadline the most critical exception is the establishment of threshold of 85 for the percentage of households by market that must be able to receive digital signals before the licenses for analog broadcasts must be relinquished given the slowerthanexpected rate of adoption for dtv in american homes few believe that the goal of overt heair digital tele vision in 85 of american households by 2006 will be reached as result under the balanced budget act television stations will be able to broadcast both analog and digital signals indefinitely in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act pl 108458 congress expressed its sense that 1 it must act in the first session of the 109th congress to establish comprehensive approach to the timely return of spectrum held by the broadcasters and that 2 any delay in doing this would delay planning by the public safety sector that is to receive some of the spectrum for new communica tions systems section 7501 dtv and consumers key issue in the digital transition is that the millions of analog televisions that rely on overtheair broadcasts will longer work once the

analog sign als are cut off based on an estimate of 50 price to purchase converter box the repor t concluded that the direct government imposed costs on consumers to preserve the usefulness of analog television sets would be 35 billion or more the gao estimated that the cost of assuring overtheair broadcasting by supplying converter boxes to households that only have analog television could total from 460 million to 106 billion pending on number of variables such as the cost of the boxes and the number of households eligible to receive assistance9 the gao cost estimates do not include the cost
