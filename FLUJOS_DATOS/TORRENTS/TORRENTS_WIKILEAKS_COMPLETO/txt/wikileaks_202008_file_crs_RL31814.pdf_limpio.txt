problems affecting the civilian population these have been tied to the consequences of war sanc tions shortcomings of assistance and the deliberate policies of the iraqi regime there seems to be consensus that the current poor humanitarian situation inside iraq could worsen during conflic t though this would likely depend on the nature and duration of the conflict and the extent and quality of humanitarian assistance problems could arise from th following malnutrition and disruption of food supplies inadequate sa nitation and clean water nd reduced health and medical care the consequences of war in iraq could also include potential humanitarian emergency with population m ovements across borders or within iraq itself given the challenge of current conditions in iraq

suffering is due to the sanctions im posed on iraq and how much is due to other factors such as government policies2 in general there seems to be consensus that the humanitarian situation remains precarious and to some observers humanitarian crisis could arise from war3 iraqs population is estimated at be tween 24 and 27 million which includes approximately 35 million children4 according to

onper day set by the secretary general is nearly being reached while this program has improved the situation malnutrition remains serious problem throughout the country especially for children and other vulnerable groups the ra tes of malnutrition in iraqi children have reportedly increased from 187 percent in 1991 to 30 percent decade later10 observers indicate that families cannot make their rations st the full month or need to sell part of them for other necessities this leaves many people without any food stored in reserve and makes them vulne rable to food distribution disruptions now more likely with the march 18 suspension of the offp11 furthermore most of the warehouses that store food in offp are thoug ht by some to be empty which means there are few reserves within iraq12 inadequate sanitation and clean water major cause of unnatural deaths noted by the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr and the world health organization who especially among children is intestinal disease due not only to lack of common medicines and medical equipm ent shortages but also to unsafe drinking water and inadequate sanitation th united nations childrens fund unicef reports that approximately 5 million people are at risk from these factors alone health experts and iraqi doctors say malnut rition and increased early childhood deaths are longer primarily the result of lack of food as they were before the oilforfood program13 intestinal disease can dehydrate children and leave them far more vulnerable this problem is especially severe in rura l areas where people are poor and have little knowledge of prevention part of the problem arises from the fact that many of the electrical generators that run water and wage treatment plants do not work either due to war damage or lack of spare parts decaying electric generators are available for only 70 of the urban wate r treatment plants and 10 of the rural units as result sewage may be dumpe d directly into rivers

iraqis angeles times february 14 2003potential warrelated concerns overview it is widely believed that the current humanitarian situation inside iraq could worsen during conflict though this woul d likely depend on the nature and duration of the conflict and the extent and quality of humanitarian assistance19 problems could arise from malnutrition and disruption of food supplies in adequate sanitation and clean water and reduced health and medical care the impact of war in iraq could also include potential humanitari an emergency with population movements across borders or within iraq itself the united nations and others have explored the likely humanitarian situation in iraq in the event of war20 although any predictions are highly speculative without sense of th extent and duration of war the united nations reportedly expects that 600000 to 145 million refugees and asylum seekers might flee iraq 2 million could become internally displaced and 45 to 10 million inside iraq nearly 40 of the iraqi popula tion could require food assistance within weeks after the onset of hostilities21 leaked documents reportedly show that the organization is expecting 100000 immediat casualties in iraq and increased risk to children due to malnutrition22 however some analysts believe that if the war is brief one casualties could be considerably fewer food security during conflict food security would re main critical concern because of the dependence of the population on the food dist ribution network with more than two thirds of the country receiving food assi stance and many suffering from malnutrition and other health problems this situation could get worse if parts of iraq became isolated and humanitarian agencies could not gain access to these areas military destruction of roads or railways could so destroy the food distribution systems within iraq and disrupt the assistance plans of the international community furthermore in addition to functioning roads fuel would be essential for humanitarian food distribution httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31814crs6 23 ibid 24 supplies amassed along front line of iraqs other war as us military prepares for fighting

particular area of concern is th possibility of largescale population movements an increase in displaced popul ations could quickly multiply the rates of disease and infection to epidemic proportions there are already displ aced persons refugees and other vulnerable groups within iraq who currently require humanitarian assistance and for whom lack of food poor health and other problems would only be intensified some observers have suggested that in th confusion of war or in the context of power vacuum iraqis may initiate revenge killings and seek to resolve grievances through violence or some form of revolt in 1991 some shiites executed baath party officials breakdown of the social orde r could have serious humanitarian impacts bringing increased mortality and serious human rights abuses women could be particularly vulnerable25 depending on the type of warfare many iraqis c ould suffer the unintended consequences of military action or the effects of chemical and biological weapons if used by their government if units of the iraqi army undertook scorched earth policy as they did with the kuwaiti oil wells in the gulf war there could be serious environmental and h ealth consequences

war with less impact on the iraqi people will in part determine the scale of the humanitarian problems how assistance is to be implemented throug h us occupation administration or donor assistance could affect the response to humanitarian problems within this context the type of humanitarian assistance provided can also determine the scale of the problems dod has clearly stated that it is not the lead agency for humanitarian relief beyond creating humanitarian space but it is not known how assistance will be implemented in postwar iraq the role of the us government agencies and ngos and what agencies will coordinate this effort for the united states and the international community46 humanitarian relief activities during war the pentagon has stated that humanitarian agencies may not have access to iraq immediately in the absence of relief agencies the military would have to be prepared to handle the humanitarian issues that may arise further for more effective planning policymakers may need to consider whether humanitarian agencies will have access to all of iraq even those areas expe riencing continued fighting other ngos have questioned wh ether military operational security will impair the communication necessary to evaluate the humanitarian situation and provide assistance humanitarian assistan ce is usually based on nonpartisan need based criteria which can come into conflict with military goals ensuring civilian security and establishing coordination of programs with the military are key issues that must be addressedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31814crs12 47 for example the european union has stated it might be unwilling to fund the reconstruction of iraq if war is declared on iraq without authority eu might

within iraq itself considering the scope of the conflict in recent weeks questions have been raised about the level of preparedness on the part of the united states and the international community for the humanitarian consequences likely to result in iran there are already large refugee populations there are also concerns about the absorptive capacity of neighboring countries whether they can provide adequately for th populations and the impact of refugee flows on stability in the region humanitarian and reconstruction efforts after war congress has been concerned about burde n sharing about how much the united states should pay in relation to other donors the aid priorities and the possible use of oil revenues to offset humanitarian and reconstruction costs still to be determined is the role of the inte rnational donor community and neighboring countries in contributing to immediate post war efforts another area of concern is the time required to transition from humanitarian assistance to reconstruction frustration with slow progress on the gr ound and growing disinterest on the part of the international community are risks in any conflict but particularly in iraq where there is broad interna tional opposition to intervention in the first place47
