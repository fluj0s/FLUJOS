is therefore largely judicial creation having evolved ove r four decades from federal court decisions and guidelines of the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc interpreting title vii s sex discrimination prohibition5 sexual harassment in federally assisted educa tion programs is also prohibited by title ix of the 1972 education amendments6 while title vii and title ix are the primary sources of federal sexual harassment w relief from such conduct has also been sought albeit less frequently pursuant to 1983 of title 42 the federal employees liability act and the equal protection and due process clauses of the us constitution7 two forms of sexual harassment have b een recognized by the courts and eeoc administrative guidelines the first or quid pro quo harassment occurs when submission to unwelcome sexual adva nces propositions or other conduct of sexual nature is made an express or imp lied condition of employment or where it is used as the basis of employment deci sions affecting job status or tangible employment benefits as its name suggests this form of harassment involves actual or potential economic loss such as ter mination transfer or adverse performance ratings as consequence of the employees refusal to exchange sexual favors demanded by supervisor or employer for employment benefits the second form of actionable harassment cons ists of unwelcome sexual conduct that is of such severity as to alter condition of employment by creating an intimidating hostile or offensive working environment the essence of hostile environment claim is pattern or practice of offensive behavior by the employer supervisor co workers or nonemployees so severe or pervasive as to interfere with the employees job performance or create an abusive work environment in 1980 the federal agency responsible fo r enforcing title vii issued guidelines prohibiting both quid pro quo and hostile environment sexual harassment8 the eeoc guidelines focus on sexuality rather than gender in terms of job detriments resulting from unwelcome sexual advances requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical behavior of sexual nature and require that totality of the circumstances be considered to determine whether pa rticular conduc t constitutes sexual harassment9 in addition the eeoc anticipated judicial developments in hostile environment law when it eliminated tangible economic loss as factor and provided that unwelcome sexual conduct violates title vii whenever it has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individuals work performance or creating an intimidating hostile or offensive working environment according to the eeoc guidelines an employer is liable for both forms of sexual harassment when perpetrated by supervisors the em ployer however is liable for harassmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33736crs3 10 id at 160411 11 equal employment opportunity commissi on policy guidance on current issues of sexual

continuedperpetrated by coworker or nonemployees only if the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to t ake immediate and appr opriate corrective action they also recommend that employer s take preventive measures to eliminate sexual harassment and state that employers may be liable to those denied employment opportunities or benefits given to another employee because of submission to sexual advances10 in 1990 the eeoc issued policy guidance to elaborate on certain legal principles set forth in its interpretative guidelines from decade before11 first the later document reasserted the basic dis tinction between qui d pro quo and hostile environment and states that an employer will always be held responsible for acts of quid pro quo harassment by supervisor while hostile environment cases require careful examination of whether the harassing supervisor was acting in an agency capacity12 on the welcomeness issue the policy guide states that contemporaneous complaint or protest by the victim is an important but not necessary element of the claim instea d the commission will look to all objective evidence rather than subjective uncomm unicated feelings to determine whether the victims conduct is consiste nt or inconsistent with he r assertion that the sexual conduct is unwelcome13 in determining whether work environment is hostile several factors are emphasized 1 whether the conduct was verbal or physical or both 2 how frequently it was repeated 3 whether the conduct was hostile or patently offensive 4 whether the alleged harasser was coworker or supervisor 5 whether others joined in perpetrating the harassment and 6 whether the harassment was directed at more than one individual however because the alle ged misconduct must substan tially interfere with the victims job performance s exual flirtation or innuendo even vulgar language that is trivial or merely annoying would probably not tablish hostile environment in addition the harassers conduct should be evaluate d from the objective standard of reasonable person14 in 1999 the eeoc rescinded the employ er liability rules of these earlier documents in line with the faragher and ellerth decisions discussed below the latest guidelines apply the same liability principles to all forms or illegal harassment whether based on race color sex relig ion national origin age or disability prohibited by federal antidiscrimination statutes15 in terms of substantive scope thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33736crs4 15 continued employer liability for unlawful harassment by supervisors june 18 1999 httpwwweeocgovpolicydocsharassmenthtml 16 413 f supp 654 65758 ddc 1976guidance emphasizes that harassment targeted against an individual because of sex need not involve sexual comments or conduc t to be actionable for example the eeoc states that frequent derogatory remarks about women may cons titute unlawful harassment even if they are nonsexual in nature so long as they are sufficiently pervasive and are directed only at female or male employees because of their sex both the supervisor and tangible empl oyment action necessary for imputing vicarious employer liability are broadly defined thus the former includes any individual who has or is regarded to have the authority to affect an employees work activities or status whether directly or by recommendation to final decisionmaker the latter refers to any job detriment or benefit that results in significant change in employment status eg pay raise in exchange for sexual favors but an unfulfilled threat by supervisor is insufficient to be tangible employment action in addition the employer has duty of reasonable care to prevent and remedy harassment and unless very small employer must establish disseminate and enforce formal antiharassment policy and complaint procedure among other steps even an employer that promptly responds to complaint has not taken reasonable care if it ignored prior complaints by ot her employees or if it fails to screen supervisory applicants for any prior record of engaging in harassment harassment victim on the other hand must take advantage of any po licy and procedures provided by the employer and may be denied full monetary relief if she unreasonably delays in complaining an employee may reasonably be excused from complaining or for delay in doing so only where there appears to be risk of retaliation or other builtin obstacles making the complaint mechanism ineffective quid pro quo harassment the earliest judicial challenges i nvolving tangible job detriment or quid pro quo harassment claims filed by women who were allegedly fired for resisting sexual advances by their supervisors were largely unsuccessful the discriminatory conduct in such cases was deemed to arise from personal proclivity of the supervisor rather than company directed policy which deprived women of employment opportunities until the mid 1970s federal district courts were reluctant either to find title vii cause of action or to impose liability on employers who were neither in complicity with nor had actual knowledge of quid pro quo harassment by their supervisory employees an historic turning point came when the federal district court in williams v saxbe held for the first time that sexual harassment was discriminatory treatment within the meaning of title vii because it created an artificial barrier to employment which was placed before one gender and not the other despite the fact that both genders were similarly situated16 echoing earlier opinions that an employer is not liable for interpers onal disputes between employees the court nonetheless refused to dismiss the complaint since if thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33736crs5 17 id at

practice of plaintiffs supervisor then it was the agencys policy or practice which is prohibited by title vii17 appellate tribunals in veral federal circuits s oon began to affirm that quid pro quo harassment violates title vii where gender is substantial factor in the discrimination reversing contrary lower court holdings for example in barnes v costle the dc circuit disagreed with t he notion that employment conditions summoning sexual relations are somehow exempted from the coverage of title vii18 finding that it was enough that gender is factor contributing to the discrimination in substantial way the court ruled that differential treatment based upon an employees rejection of her superviso rs sexual advances violated the statute similarly in tomkins v public service electric gas co the third circuit reversed the trial courts denial of title vii protection to all sexual harassment and sexually motivated assault finding that where an employees status as female was motivating factor in the superviso rs conditioning her continued employment on compliance with his sexual demands actionable quid pro quo harassment had occurred to establish prima facie case of quid pro quo harassment plaintiff must present evidence that she was subject to unwelcome sexual conduct and that her reaction to that conduct was then used as the basis for decisions affecting the compensation terms conditions or privileges of her employment19 where the conduct of the alle ged harasser is motivated by factors other than the sex of the plaintiff however there may be quid pro quo harassment socalled paramour cases are prime example in piech v arthur anderson co 20 the court held that the plaintiffs inability to obtain promotion given instead to female coworker who was ro mantically involved with the employer did not result from sex discrimination since all other employees male or female were equally affected in contrast the claim that female s employed by the defendant had to extend sexual favors to succeed was cognizable as quid pro quo harassment ellert v university of texas similarly held that secretary could not establish quid pro quo harassment claim by alleging that her discharge resulte d from her knowledge of the university deans unwelcome dvances towards an associate21 even if the plaintiffs knowledge of the affair was the basis of ac tion taken against her it was not motivated by her gender and thus was not prohibited by title vii while the loss of tangible employme nt benefit has most often meant dismissal or demotion quid pro quo claims may also arise from denial of career advantages job title dutie s or assignments of less immediate economic impact upon the employee the seventh circuit for example has ruled that tenured

not included in her job description nd denying her the opportunity to attend professional conference did not amount to significant change in employment status generally speaking the more remote or insubstantial the consequences of refusing supervisors unwelcome advances the less likely that prerequisites for quid pro quo will be found24 the dismissal by judge susan weber wrig ht of paula jones sexual harassment lawsuit against formerpresident clin ton squarely addressed the workplace consequences that must flow from the refusal to submit to an unwelcome sexual advance for the court to find actionable harassment25 plaintiff jones claimed that her career advancement had repeatedly been thwarted by her state employer as retribution for rebuffing the former arkansas g overnor as evidence of tangible job detriments jones alleged that she had been discouraged by supervisors from seeking job promotions or pay increases that following return from maternity leave she was transferred to new position with fewer res ponsibilities that she was effectively denied access to grievance procedures ava ilable to other sexual harassment victims and that by physically isolating her directly outside her supervisors office with little work to do she was subjected to hostile tr eatment having tangib effects judge wright was unconvinced by the record howev er that any threat perceived by jones during her alleged hotel meeting with the former governor was so clear and unambiguous as to be quid pro quo conditioning of conc rete job benefits or detriments on compliance with sexual demands refusal cases like jones calling for proof of tangible job detriment by plaintiffs who resist unwelcome sexual demands26 were distinguished from socalle d submission cases where in the nature of things economic harm will not be available to support the claim of the employee who submits to the supervisors demands27 it was widely anticipated that some further guidance on the essential character of quid pro quo harassment particularly in relation to jones claims against president clinton would be forthcoming wh the supreme court decided burlington industries inc v ellerth28 that case involved former merchandising assistant at burlington industries w ho alleged that she was the subject of repeated boorish andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33736crs7 29 under common law agency principles the majority reasoned an employer is generally immune from liability for the tortious conduct of its agent the harassing supervisor in ellerth which is deemed to be outside the scope of employment unless the wrongdoer is aided in the harassment by the existence of the agency relation the aided in the agency relation standard differentiates supervisory harassment for which an employer may be automatically liable from similar acts committed by mere coworkers and it is most clearly satisfied in those cases where the rassment culminates in tangible employment action 30 ellerth 524 us 761offensive comments and gestures by di vision vicepresident who implied that her response to his advances would affect he r career ellerth detaile d three incidents in which her supervisors comments could be c onstrued as threats to deny her tangible job benefits short time later she quit her job without informing anyone in authority about the harassment even though she wa s aware of burlingtons antiharassment policy squarely presented by ellerth therefore was the question of whether sexual advances by supervisor accompanied by the threatened but not actualized loss of employment or job benefits ma render an employer liable for quid pro quo harassment in fashioning an employer liability rule in ellerth the court considered the judicial distinction between quid pro quo and environmental rassment to be less important than whether the claim involved threat that had been carried out in fact29 such actions according to the court include instances where the subordinate employee is subjected to significant change in employment status such as hiring firing failing to promote reassignment with significantly different responsibilities or decision causing significant change in benefits for failing to permit sexual liberties30 claims based on unfulfilled threats of retaliation were equated by the court to hostile environment harassment requiring plaintiff to prove severe and pervasive conduct since ellerth had not demonstrated that she was the victim of retaliation by her supervisor in fact she had been prom oted during the period in question there was tangible detriment for which the empl oyer could be held strictly liable the case was remanded however for application of an alternative standard of vicarious employer liability formulated by the court for supervisory harassment cases not involving tangible employme nt action under that rule after the plaintiff proves that the supervisory misconduct is both s evere and pervasive the employer may assert as an affirmative defense that its actions to prevent and remedy workplace harassment were reasonable while the plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of any antiharassment policies nd procedures of the employer ellerths failure to avail herself of the employers grievance procedure likely defeated any title vii recovery against burlington under the s econd prong of this defense the judicial task for lower courts after ellerth is to construe this duty of reasonable care governing the employers affirmative defense to liability other than rewarding employers for prophylactic measures aimed at wor kplace harassment and compelling victim participation in those efforts ellerth provides little specific guidance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33736crs8 31 641 f2d 934 1981 32 id at 945 33 682 f2d 897 11th cir 1982 in an oftquoted passage from its opinion the court stated sexual harassment which creates hostile or offensive environment for members of one sex is every bit the arbitrary barrier to sexual equality at the workplace that racial harassment is to racial equality surely requirement that man or woman run gauntlet of sexual abuse in re turn for the privilege of being allowed to work and make living can be as demeaning and disconcerting as the harshest of racial epithets pattern of sexual harassment inflicted upon an employee because of her sex is pattern of behavi or that inflicts disparate treatment upon member of one sex with respect to terms conditions or privileges of employment there is requirement that an employee subjected to such disparate treatment prove in addition that she suffered tangible job detriment id at 902 34 477 us 57 1986 35 id at 58hostile environment harassment the earlier judicial focus on economic detriment or quid pro quo harassment making submission to sexual demands cond ition to job benefits largely gave way to title vii claims for harassment that create an intimidating hostile or offensive environment the first fede ral appellate court to jettison the ta ngible economic loss requirement and recognize hostile environment claim of sexual harassment was the dc circuit in bundy v jackson 31 despite the plaintiffs failure to prove quid pro quo harassment she was not fired demote d or denied promotion the court refused to permit an employer to lawfu lly harass an employee by carefully stopping short of firing the employee or taking any other tangible actions against her in response to her resistance32 another decision important to the judicial development of sexually hostile environment law was henson v dundee in which the eleventh circuit rejected claim of quid pro quo harassment but found that the employee had right to trial on the merits to deter mine whether the misconduc t alleged made her job environment hostile33 in meritor savings bank v vinson 34 the supreme court ratified the consensus then emerging among the federal circuits by recognizing title vii cause of action for sexual harassment according to the court hostile environment predicated on purely psychological aspects of the workplace environment could give rise to legal liability and tangible loss of an economic character was not an essential element35 this holding was qualified by the cour t with important reservations drawn from earlier administrative and judicial pr ecedent first not all workplace conduct that can be described as harassment affects term condition or privilege of employment within the meaning of title vii for example th mere utterance of an epithet engendering offensive feelings in an employee would not ordinarily be per actionable the opinion suggests rath er the misconduct must be sufficientlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33736crs9 36 id at 62 quoting henson v dundee supra n 33 at 904

and create an abusive working environment36 second while voluntariness in the sense of consent is not defense to sexual harassment charge the gravamen of any sexual harassment claim is that the alleged sexual advances were unwelcome the correct inquiry is whether respondent by her conduct indicated that the alleged sexual advances were unwelcome not whether her actual participation in sexual intercourse was voluntary37 accordingly it does not follow that complainants sexually provocative speech or dress is irrelevant as matte r of law in determining whet her he or she found particular sexual advances unwelcome to the ry such evidence is obviously relevant38 on the question of employer liability the meritor savings majority held that the court below had erred in conc luding that employers are always automatically liable for sexual harassment by their supervisors39 the usual rule in title vii cases is strict liability and four justices concurring in the judgment argued that the same rule should apply in the sexual harassment c ontext as well the majority disagreed impliedly suggesting that in hostile environm ent cases employer at least none with formal policy against harassment should be made liable in the absence of actual or constructive knowledge the supreme courts failure to clear ly define what constitute s hostile environment in meritor savings led to frequent conflict in the lower courts particularly as to the necessity of proving that serious psychological injury resulted from the harassing conduct40 the courts decision in harris v forklift systems inc revisited and offered so clarification of meritor savings in this regard41 in harris company president had subjected fema manager to sexual innuendo unwanted physical touching and insults

supreme court decided that hostile nvironment sexual harassment need not seriously affect psychological wellbeing of the victim before title vii is violated according to the court meritor savings had adopted middle path between condemning conduct that was mer ely offensive and requiring proof of tangible psychological injury thus hostile environment is not created by the mere utterance of an epithet which enge nders offensive feelings in an employee on the other hand victim of sexual harassment need not experience nervous breakdown for the law to come into pl ay so long as the environment would reasonably be perceived and is perceived as hostile or abusive there is need for it also to be psychologically injurious42 harris also addressed the standard of reas onableness to be applied in judging sexual harassment claims another issue divi ding the lower federal courts the court opted for twopart analysis both component s of which must be met for violation to be found first the conduct must creat an objectively hostile work environment an environment that reasonable person would find hostile and abusive second the victim must subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive the totality of circumstances surrounding the alleged harassment are to guide judicial inquiry including the frequency of the di scriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating or mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employees work performance43 since meritor savings and harris broad range of hostile environment harms frequently as concerned with lewd co mments inquiries jokes or displays of pornographic materials in the workplace as with overt sexual aggression have been brought before th federal courts robinson v jackson shipyards inc44 was among the first reported decisions to impose liability for sexual harassment based on the pervasive presence of sexually oriented materials magazine foldouts or other pictorial depictions and sexually demeaning remarks and jokes by male co workers without allegations of physical assaults or sexual propositions directed at the plaintiff most courts however have limite d recovery to cases involving repeated sexual demands or ot her offensive conduct45 except for cases involving touching or extreme verbal behavior courts are often reluctant to find that sexual derision or claims against pornography in the wor kplace is sufficient to create hostile environment when unaccompanied by sexual demands46 the first amendment has even been invoked to curb harassment cl aims

admonition in oncale that congress never intended title vii to beco general code of civility conduct need not be overtly sexual however as other hostile conduct directed against the victim because of the victim s sex is also prohibited48 and in line with meritor savings evidence of sexual harassment cl aimants own provocative behavior or prior workplace conduct is genera lly relevant to judicial determination of whether the defendants c onduct was unwelcome49 likewise claims involving isolated or intermittent incidents have frequently been dismissed as insufficiently pervasive recu rring point in the decisions is that simple teasing offhand comments and isolated incidents unless extremely serious will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment50 in jones v clinton for example the court ruled that considering the totality of the circumstances an alleged hotel incident and other counters between paula jones and former president thengovernor clin ton were not the kind of sustained and nontrivial conduct necessary for cl aim of hostile work environment51 in particular the court noted that plaintiff jones never missed day of work because of the

language or the courts precedents for excluding samesex harassment claims from the coverage of title vii the opinion for the court is notable for its emphasis on general sexual harassment principles possibl paving the way for stricter scrutiny of sexual harassment claims in general first the opinion observes that federal discrimination laws do not prohibit all verbal or physical harassment in the workplace only conduct that is discr iminatory and based on sex moreover harassing or offensive conduct is not automatically discr imination b ecause of sex merely because the words used have xual content or connotation instead the court emphasized those allegi ng harassment must prove th at the conduct was not just offensive but actually c onstituted discrimination59 second reiterating meritor savings and harris only conduct so severe or perv asive and objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the victims employment is actionable so that courts and juries do not mistake ordinary socializing in the workplace such as maleonmale horseplay or intersexua l flirtation for discriminatory conditions of employment60 another moderating aspect of the oncale ruling is the courts obvious concern for social context and workplace realities when appraising all sexual harassment claims samesex or otherwise61 the full implications of oncale for same sex harassment and hostile environment cases remain largely unsettled the court clearly reinjected the element of discrimination because of sex back into harassment law perhaps tempering tendency on the part of some lower courts to equate offensive behavior with hostile environment without more indeed the opini on states that title vii does not prohibit all verbal or physical harassment and requires neither asexuality or androgyny in the workplace because little gu idance was offered however for determining when untoward conduct crosses the line to sexba sed discrimination wer court have been left to grapple with the issue the c ourts opinion suggests two possible approaches to demonstrating nexus between xually offensive conduct and gender discrimination trier of fact might reasonably find such discrimination for example if female victim is harassed in such sexspecific and derogatory terms by another woman as to make it clear that the harasser is motivated by general hostility to the presence of women in the workplace samesex harassment plaintiff may also of course offer direct comparative evidence about how the alleged harasser treated members of both sexes in mixedsex workplace it is difficult however to discern how either approach would aid male samesex plaintiffs like oncale in proving discrimin ation because of sex when they are victims of harassment by other males on an oil rig or in other maledominated

fifth ci rcuit has decided that there are two types of evidence that are likely to be especially credible proof that the harasser may be homosexual75 the first type is evidence suggesting that the harasser intended to have some kind of sexual contact with the plaintiff rather than merely to humiliate him for reasons unrelated to sexual interest second is proof that the alleged harasser made samesex advances to others partic ularly other employees according to the court harasser might make sexually demeaning remarks and putdowns for sex neutral reasons but it is less likely that sexu

persists among the lower courts as to whether gender sexu attraction or conduc t of sexual nature is the key factor distinguishing discrimination based on sex from sexual orientation discrimination in the samesex harassment context to large extent the answer may depend on the facts presente d by the particular case remedies in 1991 congress enacted amendments to the civil rights act of 196477 of

continuing hostility between the plaintiff and the employer or coworkers or psychological injuries suffered as result of discrimination may prevent the plainti ffs return to the workplace front pay in such circumstances is substitute for reinstatement the plaintiff in pollard had claimed that she was victim of coworker harassment and that her supervisors we re aware of the illegal conduct as consequence she was given medical leave of absence for psychological assistance but was later fired for refusing to return to what she claimed was hostile work environment at trial pollard was aw arded 300000 in compensatory damages the maximum allowable for emotional and psyc hological suffering but was denied any additional front pay because of the cap the sixth circuit affirmed the result in unanimous decision th supreme court concluded that front pay is not an element of compensatory damages within the meaning of the 1991 act thus ruling that the statutory cap did not apply tracing the history of title vii the court noted that the original statute authorized backpa awards which had been interpreted by the courts to include front pay to date certain in the future as an alternative to reinstatement to limit front pay to cases where there is eventual reinstatement after judgment reasoned the court would leave th most egregious offenders subject to the least sanctions likewise ruling that fr ont pay could be considered compensation for future pecuniary losses subject to the damages cap would fly in the face of the congressional intent behi nd the 1991 act to expand the available remedies by permitting the recovery of compensato ry and punitive damages in addition to previously available remedies such as front pay the consequences of pollard for employers may be considerable the estimated monetary value of harassment or other intentional discrimination cases may be multiplied several times if juries or judges can be persuaded by plaintiffs attorneys to award front pay for years or even decades into the future88 the expansion of title vii remedies dramatically affects the level of relief available in cases of intentional sex disc rimination where for the first time employees in the private sector have the prospect of federal compensatory and punitive damage recoveries and the right to jury trial the act now provides monetary remedy for victims of

liability of employers and supervisors for monetary damages the addition of monetary damages to the arsenal of title vii remedies rekindled inquiry into an employers liability for rassment perpetrated by its supervisors and nonsupervisory employees and the personal liability of individual harassers the ellerth decision ratified the federal circuit courts which had generally declared employers vicariously liable for quid pro quo sexual harassment committed by supervisors culminating in tangible job detriment89 only those with actual authority to hire promote discharge or affect the terms and conditions of employment can engage in quid pro quo harassment and are held to act as agents of the employer regardless of their motivations quid pro quo harassment is viewed differently than other forms of prohibited discrimination for which employers have routinely been held vicariously liable because title vii define s employer to include any agent of the employer the statute is understood to have incorporated the principle of respondeat superior in effect holding employers liable for the discriminatory acts of supervisory employees whether or not the employer knew should have known or approved of the supervisors actions90 however the suggestion in meritor savings that courts look to agen cy law in developing liability rules for hostile work environment led most lower federal courts to reject vicarious liability for employers lacking actual or constructive knowledge of environmental hara ssment perpetrated by supervisor prior to ellerth and faragher most courts

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33736crs20 92 id at 803 93 id at 80708as in ellerth the faragher court largely abandoned the legal distinction between quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment looking instead to agency principles as guides to employer liab ility for supervisory misconduct the court reiterated ellerths determination that sexual harassment by supervisor is not within the scope of employment but because supervisor is aided in his actions by the agency relationship more stringent vicarious liability standard was warranted than pertains to similar misconduct by mere coworkers where the employer is liable for negligence only if he fails to abate cond itions of which he knew or should have known when person with supervisory au thority discriminates in the terms and conditions of subordinates employment his actions necessarily draw upon his superior position over the people who report to him or those under them whereas an employee generally cannot check supervis ors abusive conduct the same way that she might deal with abuse from coworker92 the court also determined however th at public policy considerations were important in crafting employer liability rules the congressional design behind title vii favored both the creation of antihara ssment policies and ffective grievance mechanisms by employers and coordinate duty on the part of employees to avoid or mitigate harm to accommodate these title vii policies and agency principles of employers vicarious liability the court in ellerth and faragher adopted composite standard which for the first time explicitly allows employers an affirmative defense to liability for environm ental harassment caused by supervisory misconduct according to the court an employer is subject to vicarious liability to victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the employee when tangible employment action is taken defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages subject to proof by preponderance of the evidence the defense comprises two necessary elements that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior and b that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by the em ployer or to avoid harm otherwise while proof that an employer had pr omulgated an antiharassment policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in ev ery instance as matter of law the need for stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any case when litigating the first element of the defense and while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing an unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy the employers burden under the second element of the defense93 the affirmative defense is unavailable however and employers are strictly liable for harassment

imposes duty of care on both the employer nd the employees to prevent workplace harassment and to mitigate its effects the first line of defense for the employer is to adopt and communicate to its staff and mana gement an effective sexual harassment policy and complaint procedure in most cases the failure to do so at least in the case of large employers like the city government in faragher will result in strict liability for any harassing conduct by supervisory empl oyees whether or not the alleged victim suffers any adverse employ ment action questions remain however as to scope of that legal ob ligation particularly in relation to smalle r employers since the courts formulation appears to leave open the possibility that corrective actions short of formalized antiharassment policy may be reasonable at least in some circumstances thus considera tions of employer size and resources and the structure of the workplace eg whether single loca tion or on scattered sites may be relevant factors similarly the latest high court d ecisions place the burden on aggrieved employees to avail themselves of corrective procedures provided by the employer thereby mitigating damages caused by the alleged harassment or risk having their claim legally barred however the court did not address whether an employees failure to take such saving action would be deemed unreasonable if the complainant is able to demonstrate the inadequacy of the employers grievance procedure if employees had suffered retaliation for invoki ng the procedure in the past or if harassing supervisors previous ly had not been disciplined for their action nor do the decisions specifically address the fate of employers denied the benefit of the affirmative defense because an employee followed the complaint procedure set forth in the employers antiharassment policy is strict employer liability the rule in such cases or is the issue to be decided in light of the overall ppropriateness of the employers remedial response thus many questions remain for lower courts to decide in regard to the employers asserti on of an affirmative fense consequently while clarifying the law to some extent it may take the courts years to flesh out the concept of reasonable care correct promp tly unreasonably failed and tangible employment action all key elements in the courts definition of the employers affirmative defense some guidance may be gleaned from later federal appeals court decisions that have grappled with issues left unresolved by ellerth and faragher much judicial attention has focused

strategy for employers to avoid liability for hostile work environment was proactive approach99 in addition the courts have generally been relu ctant to impose title vii liability on employers who act

subjecting empl oyers that adopt antid iscrimination policies to punitive damages would undermine title v iis objective of encouraging employers to prevent discrimination in the workplace constructive discharge in 2004 the supreme court resolved conflict among the federal circuits concerning the defenses if any that may be available to an employer against an employees claim that she was forced to resign because of intolerable sexual harassment at the hands of supervisor in pennsylvania state police v suders 102 the plaintiff claimed that the tangible advers action was supervisory harassment so severe that it drove the employee to quit cons tructive discharge in effect the court accepted the theory of constructive discha rge as tangible employment action but it also set conditi ons under which the employer could assert an affirmative defense and avoid strict liability under title vii the issue is of key importance for determining the scope of employers vicarious liability in supervisory sexual harassment cases alleging hostile work environment as noted farager and ellerth held employers strictly liable for sexually hostile work environment created by supervisor when the challenged discrimination or harassment results in tangible employme nt action the court defined that term categorically to mean any significant change in employment status that may but not always result in economic harm speci fically included were hiring firing failing to promote reassignment with si gnificantly different responsibilities or decision causing significant change in benefits103 however constructive discharge where the employee quits claimin g that conditions are so intolerable that he or she was effectively fired presente d an unresolved issue could an employer faced with claim of construc tive discharge still assert the ellerthfarager defense the constructive discharge doctrine originated in federal labor law and was later transposed by judicial interpretation to employment discrimination cases basically the courts have held that an employ ee alleging constructive discharge must demonstrate the concurrence of two factor s 1 the employee suffered harassment or discrimination so intolerable that reasonable person in the same position would have felt compelled to resign and 2 the employees reaction to the workplace situation was reasonable given the totality of circ umstances because of its direct economic harm on employees the third circuit in suders joined the eighth circuit104 concluding that constructive discharge if proven is the functi onal equivalent of an actual dismissal and amounts to tangib employment acti on taking the opposite position the second and sixth circuits had decided that voluntary resignation as opposed to dismissal was never the kind of official action that deprived the employer of its legal defenses105 the opposing circuits refu sed to view constructivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33736crs24 105 continued caridad v

employee that is neither instigat ed nor ratified by the employer in suders the court applied the framework of its 1998 rulings to stake out middle ground between the conflicting approach to constructive discharge taken by the courts of appeals the only real difference between the harassment in ellerthfarager and this case was one of degree that is suders presented worst case scenario or harassment racheted up to the breaking point but constructive discharge claim requires more than pattern of severe or pervasive workplace abuse as would satisfy the legal standard for ordinary harassment employees advancing compound claims must also prove that the abusive working environment became so intolerable that reasonable person w ould have felt compe lled to resign such objectively intolerable conditions could result from coworker conduct unofficial supervisory act or official company acts the courts earlier decisions applied agency principles to define employer vicarious liability for supervisors harassment of subordinates only when supervisory misconduct is aided by the agency relation as evidenced by tangible or official act of the enterprise is the employers responsibility so obvious as to warrant stri ct liability when tangible employment action is taken the basis for imputing blame on the employer is less evident and the focus shifts to the title vii policy of prevention the employer may then defeat vicarious liability by showing that it had reasonable antiharassment procedures in place that the employee unreasonably failed to utilize ultimately the court held that title vii encompasses employer liability for constructive discharge claims attributable to supervisor but ruled that an employer does not have recourse to the ellerthfaragher affirmative defense when supervisors official act preci pitates the constructive discharge absent such tangible employment action however the defense is available to the employer whose supervisors are charged with harassment106 in recognizing hostile environment constructive discharge claims suders enhanced title vii protection for employees who quit their jobs over intense sexual rassment by supervisor but the decision also makes it easier for an employer to defend against such claims by showing that it has reasonable procedures for reporting and correcting harassment of which the employee failed to avail herself only if the plaintiff quits in reasonable response to an employersanctioned advers action officially changing her employment status or situation for example humiliating demotion extreme cut in pay or transfer to position in which she would face unbearab working condition is the employer made strictly liable for monetary damages or other title vii relief107 moreover even where there has been tangible employment action coupled with constructive discharge or resign ation the employer may have defenses available first the employer may argue that

employment action is shown to be unrelated to the alleged rassment or is taken for legitimate nondi scriminatory reasons particularly if by persons othe r than the alleged harasser the employer might escape liability finally the employer might be able to demonstrate that whatever form the underlying supervisory harassment may take it did not meet the standard for constructive discharge so intolerable that reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign but suders also makes it more difficult to obtain summary judgment and avoid jury trials in sexual harassment cases involving constructive discharge claims under the d ecision if there is an real dispute about whether the employee suffered tangible employment action the employer may not rely on the affirmative defens to obtain summary judgment personal liability of harassing supervisors and coworkers because the term agent is included w ithin the definition of employer some division of judicial opinion initially existed regarding the personal liability of individual supervisors and coworkers for hostile environment harassment or other discriminatory conduct howeve r all of the federal circ uit courts to address the question eventually interpreted the term agent in the statutory definition as merely incorporating respondeat superior and refused to impose personal liability on agents108 these courts also note the incongruity of imposing personal liability on individuals while capping compensatory and punitive damages based on employer size as the statute does and exempting small businesses that employ less than 15 persons from title vii altogether retaliation under title vii it is unlawful for employers to discriminate or retaliate against an employee because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice under title vii or because he has made charge testified assisted or participated in any manner in an inves tigation proceeding or hearing under title vii109 the scope of this retalia tion provision was the subject of judicial debate for number of years in 2006 however the supreme court issued its decision in burlington northern and santa fe railway co v white 110

statutes retaliation provision encompasses any em ployer action that would have been materially adverse to reasonable employee or job applicant111 this standard which is much broader than standard that w ould have confined th retaliation provision to actions that affect only the terms and c onditions of employment generally makes it easier to sue employers if they retalia against workers who complain about discrimination under the cour ts interpretation employees must establish only that the employers actions might dissuade worker from making charge of discrimination this means that an employ ee may successfully sue an employer for retaliation even if the employers acti on does not actually result in an adverse employment action such as be ing fired or losing wages recently the supreme court agreed to review crawford v metropolitan government of nashville and davidson county 112 case in which the plaintiff alleges that her participation in sexual harassment investigation against her supervisor resulted in her termination lthough the plaintiff cooperate d in the investigation and provided testimony regarding explicit comme nts and actions made by her boss the fact that she had not filed the sexual harassment complaint or other charges with the eeoc led the lower court to rule that she was not covered under t itle viis retaliation provision the court is expected to i

victims of sex discrimination who need not exhaust their administrative remedies before filing suit116 however the availability of monetary damages under title ix remained uncertain until franklin v gwinnett county public schools117 in franklin female high school student brought an action for damages under title ix against her school district alleging that sh had been subjected to sexual harassment and abuse by teacher although the hara ssment became known and an investigation was conducted teachers and administrators did not act and the petitioner was subsequently discouraged from pressing ch arges the court which found that sexual harassment by teacher constituted discr imination on the basis of sex held that damages were available to the sexual harassment victim if she could prove that the school district had intenti onally violated title ix after franklin it was clear that sexual harassm ent by teacher constituted sex discrimination but the extent to which sc hool districts could be held liable for misconduct by its employees was less clear the appropriate standard for measuring school districts liability for sexual buse of student by teacher remained unsettled until the supreme court ruling in gebser v lago vista independent school district 118 in gebser the supreme court answered th question of what standard of liability to apply to school districts under title ix where teacher harasses student without the knowledge of school administrators jane doe thirteen year old student had been sexually abused by teacher but there was evidence that any school official was aware of the situation until af ter it ended instead of strict liability or theory of constructive notice doe relied on the familiar common law principle later applied by the court in ellerth and faragher that an employer is vicariously liable for an employees injurious actions even if committed outside the scope of employment if the employee was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relationship119 according to this theory the harassers status as teacher made his abuse possible by placing him in an aut horitative position to take advantage of his adolescent student because teachers are almost always aided by the agency relationship however and pplication of the common law rule would generate vicarious liability in virtually every case of teacherstudent rassment the fifth circuit rejected the approach in fa vor of its actual knowledge standard in 5 to 4 opinion the supreme court ffirmed avoiding any comparison to the strict liability

financia l liability on schools appeared to drive the courts decision unlike title vii title ix has been judicially determined to provide only an implied private right of ac tion and rather than statute of general application it imposes legal obligations only as condition to the receipt of federal financial assistance these distincti ons persuaded the court to shape sensible remedial scheme that best comports with the statute and its legislative history121 in analyzing congressional intent the court examined the statutory provisions for title ix enforcement by means of federal agency rmination of federal funds to noncomplying school districts following notice and opportun ity to be heard given the express notice requirement of the statute the majority felt it unfair to impose vicarious or constructive notice standard on school distri cts in private lawsuits moreover there was concern that the award of damages in any given case might unfairly exceed the amount of federal funding actually receive d by the school consequently there was actionable title ix claim since respons ible school administr ators were without notice or actual knowledge of the alleged sexual

to prove than sexual harassment in employment beyond requiring actual knowledge the court cauti oned that schools are unlike the adult workplace and disciplinary decisions of sc hool administrators are not to be second guessed by lower courts unless cl early unreasonable under the circumstances additionally the majority emphasized that damages are not available for simple acts of teasing and namecalling among school children even where these comments target differences in gender125 in effect davis left to school administrators the task of drawing the line between innocent teasing and
