federal land refers to any land owned or managed by the federal government regardless of its mode of acquisition or managing agency public domain land is used when the historical distinction regard ing mode of land acquisition is relevant ie when law specifically applies to those lands that originally were ceded by the original states or obtained from foreign sovereigns i ncluding indian tribes as opposed to being acquired from individuals or states public land refers to lands managed by the bureau of land management consistent with 103e of the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma pl 94579 43 usc 1701 et seq 4 several other agencies manage some of the remaining 434 million acres 65 of federal land the department of defense dod including the army corps of engineers is the fifth largest federal land manager because land management is not dods primary mission these lands are not discussed in this report nonetheless military lands often are noteworthy for their size which can provide important open space and for their historic cultural and biological resources moreover because access is sometimes severely restricted these lands may contain ecological resources in nearly pristine condition in addition the general services administration owns or rents lands and buildings to house federal agencies and also administers the excesssurplus system of property disposalbackground the federal government owns and manages approxima tely 6718 million acres of land in the united states 296 of the total land base of 227 billion acres2 table 1 identifies the acreage of federal land located in each state and the district of columbia the figures range from 5318 acr of federal land in rhode island to 243847037 federal acres in alaska further while dozen states contain less than ½ million acres of federal land another dozen have mo re than 10 million federal acres within their borders table 1 also identifies the total size of each state and the percentage of land in each state that is federally owned these percentages point to significant variation in the size of the federal presence within states specifically the figures range from 05 of connecticut land that is federally ow ned to 919 of land in nevada that is federally owned all 12 states where the federal government owns the most land are located in the west including alaska four agencies administer about 6284 million acres 935 of the 6718 million acres of federal land3 these four agencies are the forest service bureau of land management fish and wildlife serv ice and national

important in american history adding to the strength and stature of the federal government serving as an attraction and opportunity for settlement and economic development and providing source of revenue for schools trans portation national defe nse and other national state and local needs the formation of our current federal gove rnment was particul arly influenced by the struggle for control

acquisitions gave rise to distinction in the laws between public domain lands which essentially are those ceded by the original states or obtained from foreign sovereign via purchase treaty or other means and acquired lands which are those obtained from state or individual by exch ange purchase or gift some 6015 million acres 895 of all federal lands are public domain lands while the other 703 million acres 105 of federal lands are acquired lands many laws were passed that related only to the vast new public domain lands even though the distinction has lost most of its underlying significance today different laws may still pply depending on the original nature of the lands involved the lessening of the histor ical significance of land designations was recognized in the flpma which defines public lands as those managed by blm regardless of whether they were derived from the public domain or were acquired for more information on the louisiana pu rchase see

land ordinance of 17855 and the northwest ordinance of 17876 established the federal system of rectangular land surv eying for disposal and set up system for developing territorial gove rnments leading to statehood during operation of the articles of confederation the states that then owned the western lands were reluctant to cede them to the developing new gove rnment but eventually acquiesced this together with granting constitutional powers to the new federal government including the authority to regulate federa l property and to create new states played crucial role in transforming the weak central government under the articles of confederation into stronger centralized federal government under our constitution the new congress which first met in 1789 enacted land statutes similar to those enacted by the continental congress subsequent federa l land laws reflected two visions reserving some federal lands such as for national forests and national parks and selling or otherwise disposing of other lands to raise money or to encourage transportation deve lopment and settlement fr om the earliest days these policy clashes took on eastwest overtones w ith easterners more likely to view the lands as national public prope rty and westerners more likely to view the lands as necessary for local use and development most agreed however on measures that promoted settlement of the lands to pay soldiers to reduce the national debt and to strengthen the nation this settlement tr end accelerated after the louisiana purchase in 1803 the oregon compromise with ngland in 1846 and cession of lands by treaty after the mexican war in 18487 during the mid to late 1800s congress passed numerous laws that encouraged and accelerated the settlement of the west by disposing of federal lands examples include the homestead act of 18628 and the desert lands entry act of 1877httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32393crs6 8 continued httpwwwourdocumentsgovdocphp doc31

establishment in arkansas of hot springs reservation which was dedicated to public use in 1880 and as hot springs national park in 1921 approximately 8159 million acres of the pub lic domain lands we re transferred to private ownership between 1781 and 2002 another 3285 million acres were granted to the states gene rally and an additional 1275 million were granted in alaska under state and native selection laws9 most transfers to private ownership 97 occurred before 1940 homestead entr ies for example peaked in 1910 at 183 million acres but dropped below 200000 acres annually after 1935 until being totally eliminated in 198610 certain other federal laws were catch up laws designed to legitimize certain uses that already were occurring on th federal lands these laws typically acknowledged local variations and customs for example the general mining law of 1872 recognized mineral claims on the public domain lands in accordance with local laws and customs and provided for the conveyance of title to such lands in addition early land disposal ws allowed states to deter mine the rights of settlers to use and control water th courts later determined however that the federal government could also reserve or create fe deral water rights for its own properties and purposes although some earlier laws had protected some lands and resources such as timber needed for military use other laws in the late 1800s reflected the growing concern that rapid development threatened so of the scenic treasures of the nation as well as resources that would be need ed for future use preservation and conservation movement evolved to ensure that certain lands and resources were left untouched or reserved for future use fo r example yellowstone national park was established in 187211 to preserve its resources in natural condition and to dedicate recreation opportunities for the public it was the worlds first national park12 and like the other early parks yellowstone was protected by the us

mission and policy statement for the blmfrom poachers of wildlife or timber in 1891 concern over the effects of timber harvests on water supplies and downstream flooding led to the creation of forest reserves renamed nati onal forests in 1907 the creation of national parks and forest reserves laid the foundation for the current development of federa l agencies with primary pur poses of managing natural resources on federal lands for example in 1905 responsibility for management of the forest reserves was joined with forest ry research and assistance in new forest service within the department of agriculture the national park service was created in 191613 to manage the growing number of parks established by congress and monuments proclaimed by the president the first national wildlife refuge was proclaimed in 1903 although it was not until 1966 that the refuges coalesced into the national wildlife refuge system the graz ing service department of the interior first known as the grazing division was established in 1934 to administer grazing on public rangelands it was combined w ith the general land office in 1946 to form the bureau of land management blm14 in addition to the conservation laws nd activities noted above emphasis shifted during the 20th century from the disposal and conve yance of title to private citizens to the retention and management of the remaining federal lands some laws provided for sharing revenues from various uses of th federal lands with the states containing the lands examples include the mineral leasing act of 192015 which provides for the leased development of certain federal minerals and the taylor grazing act of 1934 which provides for per mitted private livestock grazing on public lands16 during debates on the taylor grazing ac t some western mbers of congress acknowledged the poor prospects for relinqui shing federal lands to the states but language included in the act left this question open it was not until the passage of the federal land policy and manageme nt act of 1976 flpma pl 94579 43 usc 1701 et seq that congress expre ssly declared that the remaining public domain lands generally would re main in federal ownership17 this declaration of policy was significant factor in what became known as the sagebrush rebellion an effort that started in the late 1970s to ta ke state or local cont rol of federal land and management decisions to date judicial challenges and legislative and executive attempts to make significant changes to federal ownership have proven unsuccessful current authorities for acquiring

and others s upporting retention of federal lands by the federal government still others promote acquisition by the federal government of additional land including through an increas ed and more stable funding source related issue is determining the optimal division of resources between federal acquisition of new lands and maintenance of existing federal lands and facilities another focus is whether federal lands should be managed pr imarily to produce national benefits or benefits primarily fo r the localities and states in which the lands are located who decides these issues and how the decisions are made also are at issue some would like to see more local control of land and reduced federal role while others seek to maintain or enhance the federal role in land management to represent the interests of all citizens the extent to which federal lands shoul d be made availabl for development preserved and opened to recr eation has been controversia l significant differences

special accounts some require annual appropriations most of these are small but the land and water conservation fund used for federal land acquisition is relatively large and controversia l and is discussed separately below number of the trust funds and special accounts are permanently appropriated also known as mandatory spending this means that the agencies can spend the receipts deposited in the accounts without nnual appropriations by congress many of these accounts 15 were established to compensate state and local governments for the taxexempt status of federal lands these accounts will be discussed separately below others receive funds from particular sources eg excise taxes timber sales recreation fees for grants or for agency operations the receipts deposited in these accounts are in addition to the treasury receipts shown in table 3 the fws has the largest annual funding in permanently appr opriated trust funds and special accounts with fy2003 budget authority of 661 million the two largest accounts are the sport fish restoration tr ust fund 330 million established by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32393crs13 20 this is also known as the dinge lljohnson act and the wallopbreaux act 21 this is also known as the pittmanrobertson act 22 since fy1998 this account has been available for forest health improvement activities as well as for building and repairing roads and trailsfederal aid in sport fish restoration act20 and the wildlife restoration special account 235 million established by the fe deral aid in wildlif restoration act21 these accounts are largely funded by excise taxes on equipment related to fishing and hunting respectively and the money is dist ributed to the states mostly to fund fish and wildlife restorati on activities by state agencies the third largest account is the migratory bird conservation fund 44 million which uses the revenues from selling duck stamps to hunters refuge visito rs stamp collectors and others to acquire lands for the national wildlife refuge system as noted below under land acquisition funding the blm and nps have numerous perman ently appropriated trust funds and special accounts with total budget authority of 305 million for each in fy 2003 most of the blm accounts are much sm aller than for the other federal land management agencies but the one larges t account southern nevada public land sales had fy2003 budget authority of 279 million 92 of blm permanent appropriations for operations the nps permanently appropriated speci accounts and trust funds allow the agency to retain 100 of its recreation and admission fees the largest is the recreational fee demonstra tion program described be low two funds are unique to the nps the concessions improveme nt account and park concessions franchise fees combined total of 54 million in fy2003 two other funds are common to all four land management agencies but are significantly larger for the nps one is the fund for maintaining employee quarter s 16 million for the nps less than 11 million total for the other three agencies paid by rent from employees another consists of contributions and donations fro m interested individuals and groups 29 million for the nps less than 3 million total for the other three agencies the fs has the least annual funding in permanently appropria ted trust funds and special accounts the fs has 20 accounts with fy2003 budget authority of 285 million six of the eight largest are directly or substantially re lated to timber sales including the salvage sale fund 58 million the knutsonvandenberg

established to authorize the four agencies to retain recreation fees the first recreati on fee collection costs pl 10366 10002b allows the agencies to retain up to 15 of recreation fees to cover the costs to collect the fees the second much larger progra m is the recreational fee demonstration program created to allow the agencies to test the feasibility and public acceptability of user fees to

for the nps 37 million for the fs 9 million for the blm and 4 million for the fws land acquisition funding the largest source of funding for federal land acquisition is the land and water conser vation fund lwcf is special account created in 1964 speci fically to fund federal land acquisition and state recreation programs it can be credited with revenue s from federal recreation user fees other than those collected under th recreational fee demonstr ation program and the fee collection cost program the federal motorboat fuel tax and surplus property sales these are supplemented with revenues from federal offshore oil and gas leases up to the authorized leve l of 900 million annually lwcf does not operate the way true tr ust fund would in the private sector the fund is credited with deposits from specified sources but congress must enact appropriations annually for the agencies to spend money from the fund through fy2004 272 billion has been credited to the lwcf and 138 billion has been appropriated unappropr iated funds remain in the us treasury and can be spent for other purposes the 105th 106th and 107th congresses considered gislation that would have supplemented or supplanted the lwcf and fu lly funded it for 15 years the clinton administration successfully pursued another avenue the lands legacy initiative that led to the creation of the conservation sp ending category to increase funding for lwcf federal land acquisition through the annual appropria tions process and to use some of the lwcf authorization for ot her nonacquisition federal programs president bush has expanded on this tter approach proposing in fy2005 to fully fund lwcf requesting 9002 million but use more than half of the total for nonacquisition fede ral programs including several fish and wildlife service and forest service programs in fy2003 lwcf appropriations for federal land acquisition alone totaled 3130 million nd in fy2004 they declined to 1697 million both down from the fy1998 peak of 8971 million for fy2005 president bush has requested 2202 million for lwcf federal land acquisition other federal programs so provide funding for fe deral land acquisition the largest is the fwss migratory bird c onservation fund mbcf receipts from the sale of duck stamps to hunters refuge visitors stamp collectors and others are deposited in this account the funds are permanently appropriated to the fws to acquire lands for the national wildlife refu ge system and often provide more than half the total fws land acquisition f unding in fy2003 the fws used 438

governments because federal property is exempt fro m state and local taxation congress has enacted mechanisms to compensate state and local governments for tax revenues that would have been collected if the land s were privately owned many of the mechanisms provide for sharing revenues fro m federal lands with state andor local governments only the nps has agency specific compensation system the

general treasury to cover appropriations for access roads and refo restation thus the counties actually receive 50 of the revenuesrevenuesharing the amount and percentage of federal revenues that are shared with state andor local governme nts depends upon the history of the land and the type of activities generating the revenues congress created the simplest system for revenuesharing for fs lands ce 1908 the agency has returned 25 of its gross revenues to the states for use on ro ads and schools in the counties where the national forests are located the states determine which road and school programs are to be funded and how much goes to each program but the amount allocated to each c ounty is deter mined by the fs and the states cannot retain any of the funds for the national grasslands 25 of net revenues go directly to the counties in addition three counties in minnesota receive special payment of 075 of the appraised value of the superior nf lands in the county payments for these fs programs are permanently appropriated from any fs re venues in fy2003 total fs payments were 393 million because of concerns over declining timb er revenues in many areas and the approaching end of the special spotted owl payments program24 the 106th congress debated bills to modify the fs revenuesharing program in the secure rural schools and community selfdetermination ac t of 2000 pl 106393 congress enacted sixyear program allowing counties to s upplant the historic 25 payment with the average of the three highest payments to the state between 1986 and 1999 of these high3 payments 1520 must be spent on certain county programs or on projects on federal lands recommended by local advisory committee or chosen by the fs this program accounted for 72 of the 393 million in fs payments in fy2003 for blm lands and revenues the revenuesharing system is more complicated the share going to state and local entities ranges from 0 to 90 of gross program revenues as specified in individual statutes for example states and counties receive 125 of revenues from grazing within gr azing districts under 3 of the taylor grazing act of 1934 and 50 of revenues from grazing outside grazing districts under 15 of the taylor grazing act another example is timber sale revenues the states and counties receive 4 of timber revenues from most blm lands however the counties receive up to 75 from the heavily timbered oregon california oc railroad gran t lands in western oregon25 counties with the coos bay wagon road cbwr grant lands adjoi ning and usually identified with the oc lands similarly receive up to 75 but actual payments are limited by county tax assessments because the oc and cb wr payments have been largely from timber sales which have d eclined since the late 1980s they were included with national forest lands see above in the spotted owl payments program and the sixyear program of payments at the aver age of the three highest under pl 106393 these examples demonstrate the complexity of the legal direction to share blm revenues with state and local governments the blm re venuesharing payments arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32393crs17 permanently appropriated with 10 separate payment accounts fy2003 budget authority was 157 million of which 111 million was for the oc and cbwr lands and 38 was relate d to oil leasing in the nati onal petroleum re servealaska finally the fws has revenuesharing program but payments depend on the history of the land for refuges reserved from the public domain the payments are based on 25 of net revenues in cont rast to 25 of gross revenues from fs lands other than national grasslands for refuges which have been created on lands acquired from other landowners payments are based on the greatest of 25 of net revenues 075 of fair mark et value of the land or 075 per acre the national wildlife refuge fund is permanently appr opriated for making these payments but net revenues have been insu fficient to make the authorized payments although payments have been supplemented with annual appropriations total payments 14 million in fy2003 consistently have b een less than the authorized level payments in lieu of taxes the most comprehensive federal program for compensating local governments for the taxexempt status of federal lands was created in the 1976 payments in lieu of ta xes pilt act pilt payments are made in addition to any revenuesharing paymen ts although the payments may be reduced by such revenuesharing payments as disc ussed below federa l lands encompassed by this countycompensation program include lands in the national forest system lands in the national park system and those administered by the blm plus the national wildlife refuge system lands reserved from the public domain and few other categories of federal lands in 1994 congress amended the pilt act to more than double the authorized payments over five years to adjust fo r inflation between 1976 and 1994 and to build in adjustments for future inflation th two formulae used to calculate the fy2003 authorized payment level for each count with eligible federal lands are 1 which is less the countys eligible acr times 027 per acre or b the countys payment ceiling determined by county population level pick the lesser of these two this option is called the minimum provision 2 which is less the countys eligible acr times 202 per acre or b the countys payment ceiling determined by county population level pick the lesser of these two and from it subtract th previous years total payments under other payment or revenuesharing progra ms of the agencies that control the eligible land as reported by each state to the blm this option is called the standard provision the county is authorized to receive whiche ver of the above calculations 1 or 2 is greater this calculation must be made for all counties individually to determine the national author ization level in contrast to most of the revenues haring programs pi lt

determined for fy2005 issues several financing themes are perennial issues for congress involving fees charged or not charged and how these revenues relate to agency activities one issue has been the question of whether prices set administratively rather than by markets subsidize some resource users th is issue typically has focused on fees for private livestock grazing on federal lands and for hardrock locatable minerals that are currently available for private developm ent under claims system without royalty payments another issue is whether below cost timber sales s hould continue if the government is losing money on them in addition whether to permanently authorize the recreational fee demonstration program and which agencies lands and programs to include is c ontinuing congressional focushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32393crs19 26 the most current copies of crs products are available at h ttp wwwcrsgov another persistent issue is determining the annua l appropriations for the

controversial parts of these bills funding for wildfire protection has grown significantly in recent years following the severe fire seasons of 2000 and 2002 annual appropriations for fire suppression operations have not been suffici ent and the agencies have used their authority to borrow from other accounts to fund fire suppression these borrowings typically are repaid in an emergency

people management of the resources is to be coordinated for multiple use considering the relative values of the various resources but not necessarily maximizing dollar returns nor requiring that any

nfmahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32393crs27 prohibits the return to the public domain of any land reserved or withdrawn from the public domain except by an act of congress 16 usc 1609 the 1911 weeks law authorizes the secr etary to dispose of land chiefly valuable for agriculture which was incl uded in lands acquired inadvertently or otherwise if agricultural use will not injure the forests or stream flows and the lands are not needed for public purposes 16 usc 519 the bankheadjones farm tenant act author izes the disposal of lands acquired under its authority with or without cons ideration under

focus of discussions and legislative proposals on fs management of the nfs has been forest health and wildfires especially in the intermountain west the 2000 and 2002 fire seasons were by most standards among the worst since 1960 many believe that excessive accumulations of biomass dead and dying trees heavy undergrowt h and dense stands of small trees reflect degraded forest health and make fo rests vulnerable to c onflagrations these observers advocate rapid action to improve forest health including prescribed burning thinning and salvaging dead and dying trees and that rapid action is needed to protect nfs forests and nearby private lands and homes critics counter that authorities to reduce fuel levels are adequate treatments that remove commercial timber degrade forest health and waste taxpayer dollars and expedited processes for treatments are device to reduce public oversight of commercial timber harvesting in september 2000 president clinton re quested an additional 16 billion for the fs and the blm for fire protection including funds to pay for the 2000 summers fire suppression efforts and for fuel treatment to addre ss forest health in the

established in 1934 to manage the public lands best suited for livestock grazing in accordance with the taylor grazing act of 193441 this law sought to remedy the deteriorating condition of public rangelands due to their overuse as well as the drought of the 1920s and depression of the early 1930s the taylor grazing act provided for the management of the public lands pending their final disposal this language expressed the view that the lands might still be transferred to private or state ownership and that the federal government was serving only as custodian until that time however patenting of the more arid western lands had already sl owed and there was growing concern about the condition of resources on these lands these factors and changing general attitude towards the public nds contributed to their retention by the federal government for decades congress debated whether to retain or dispose of the remaining public lands and how best to coordinate their manageme nt

to sell even if condemna tion authority was not formally used if such intimidation exists its extent is unclear but legislation was introduced in the 105th congress to restrict fws land acquisitions without spec ific congressional approval ultimately provision was added in pl 105277 forbidding the use of any of the funds appropriated in this act for the purchase of lands or interest s in lands to be used in the establishment of any new unit of the national wildlife refuge system unless the purchase is approved in advance by the house and senate committees on appropriations in compliance with

refuges were designated on the other79 in recent years controversy devel oped over the propriety of hunting and to lesser extent fishing on refuge lands the prohunting position is based largely on two arguments 1 the purchase of migra tory duck stamps by hunters has paid for substantial portion of refu ge land mainly in areas itable for waterfowl habitat and 2 the animal population is the appr opriate measure of conservation and removal of individual animals for human us is not harmful and may be beneficial as long as the population growth rate is maintained the antihunting argument holds that place can be considered refuge if its major wildlife residents are regularly hunted they contend further that since fewer people now hunt80 and the enjoyment of this sport hinders use of the land by others by restricting access for safety reasons then hunting should be eliminated to allow fuller access by nonhunting users while various bills have been intr oduced over the years to eliminate or restrict hunting on refuges others have been introduced to support it over the past several years the backlog of unmet maintenance needs of the federal land management agenci has been an issue of focus of the congress and the administration although there is deba over the amount of fws money that should be spent on the deferred main tenance backlog versus the acquis ition of additional federal

wanton destruction of fish and game85 when yellowstone national park was au thorized there was concept or plan for the development of system of such pa rks the concept now firmly established as the national park system embracing diversity of natural and cultural resources nationwide evolved slowly over the years this idea of national park was an american invention of histor ic proportions

charged by participating agencies to be retained at the sites where the money is collected rather than returned to the us treasury it continues to be tested by the agencies and has been extended in appropriations laws most recently through december 2005 for fee collection to give th authorizing committees time to consider establishing permanent program many citizens have objected to paying additional fees for previously free or lowcost r ecreation in the national forests but have expressed few objections to higher fees for the national park system the administration has asked congress

but others must be protected until congress releases them congress began expanding the system in 1968 four years after it was established the most significant expansion was included in the alaska

rs21917 bureau of land management blm wilderness review issues by ross w gortefor the decade following the fs r ecommendations in 1979 congress generally addressed possible wilderness designations for all fs lands within state many statewide fs wilderness bills were introduce d but their enactment was held up in the early 1980s until compromise over release language99 broke the legislative stalemate this compromise which allowed but did not compel the fs to maintain wilderness attributes of released lands led congress to enact 21 wilderness laws designating 86 million acres of predominately nfs wilderness in 21 states the 103rd congress 19931994 also substantia lly expanded the system with nfs wilderness areas in colorado and blm and nps wilderness areas in the california desert congress continues to consider furthe r expansion of the national wilderness preservation system more than 29 million acres mostly nps lands in alaska have been recommended by the agencies to congress for inclusion in the system numerous areas continue to be reviewed for their wilderness potential by the federal land management agencies issues wilderness designations tinue to be controversial restrictions on the use and development of designat ed wilderness areas often conflict with the desires of some groups while providing the values soug ht by others in an attempt to find balance between development and protection congress has enacted general standards and prohibitions for wilderness protecti on eg motorized access and general and specific exemptions to those standards and prohibitions eg continued motorboat use where such use was occurring prior to the designation exceptions often reflect agreements for specific areas but widespread compromise between development and preservation inte rests generally remains elusive several current issues surround the possibl protection of the remaining fs and blm roadless areas one issue focuses on blm lands in utah but has national relevance central to the controversy is whether blm may currently designate wilderness study areas wsas areas that are statutorily entitled to automatic and continuing protections section 603 of flpma required the blm to review the wilderness potential of its lands and by 1991 to recommend areas to the president who then could recommend areas to the congress for possible inclusion in the national wilderness preserva tion system in response blm first inventoried its lands to determine which lands met the basic size criteria and might have wilderness characteristics then conducted more indep th review of these lands to determine which among them possessed wilderness characteristics lands found to have wilderness character were designated as wsas and studied further many wsa lands were then recommended to congress in the early 1990s for inclusion in the national wilderness preserva tion system these wilderness recommendations arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32393crs62 still pending for utah and many other we stern states approximately 19 million of 25 million acres of wsas in utah were recommended some ut ah wilderness bills before congress have recomme nded more acreage some less section 603 also requires blm to protect the wilderness characteristics of such areas until congress directs otherwise this nonimpairment standard prevents most development and blm has pplied it to all wsas including those that blm did not recommend for wilderness designation ther efore whether blm can designate new wsas and whether the nonimpairment standa rd can be applied to these or other lands are important issues both for those seeking to protect the lands and those seeking to develop them either the auto matic and continuing protections of the nonimpairment standard apply or protec tions may only be provided through the slower less certain and more changeab land use planning process under 202 of flpma following debate over dditional wilderness areas proposed in legislation secretary babbitt in 1996 used the 201 flpma inventory authority to identify an additional 26 million acres in utah as having wilderness qual ities alt hough the stated purpose of the inventory was only to ascertain which lands had wilderness characteristics and report on those utah f iled suit alleging various flaws in this process and alleging that the inventor was illegal even unde r 201 th district court enjoined the inventory preliminarily but the 10th circuit remanded to the district court to dismiss on various grounds all but the claim that related to facto wilderness management of the inventoried lands utah v babbitt 137 f 3d 1193 10th cir 1998 the department of the in terior subsequently settled the case and on september 29 2003 issued new wilderness guidance instruction memoranda 2003274 and 2003275 these directives pply to blm lands nationwide except for alaska and certain categories of lands and take the position that the 603 authority terminated in 1993 that blm cannot administratively create more wsas under 603 or other authority and that the nonimpairment standard cannot be applied to nonwsa lands rather protective manageme nt of the remaining blm roadless areas can occur only through the re levant land manageme nt plans others disagree with this interpretation and the issues are currently in litigation the importance of these issues is accentuated by the emphasis of the bush administration on energy development of the federal lands and by the promulgation of new regulations on disclaimers of interest that may facilitate the validation of highway rightsofways in roadless areas thereby disqualifying additional lands from further consideration another utah wilderness controvers has widespread implications for management of wsas generally suit was filed to compel blm to protect wsas from impairment by increased offroad vehi cle use the supreme court ruled in norton v southern utah wilderness alliance that although the protection of wsas was mandatory it was programmatic duty and not the type of discrete agency obligation that could be enforced under th apa also the court concluded that language contained in rele vant flpma land use plans indicating that wsas would be monitored constituted management goals that might be modified by agency priorities and availa ble funding and was not basi s for enforcement under the apa 5 usc

selected freeflowing rivers for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations to complement the thencurrent national policy of constructing dams and other structures such as flood control works along many rivers three classes of wild and scenic rivers were established under the act reflecting the characteristics of the rivers at the time of designation and affecting the type and amount of development that may be allowed thereafter the classes of rivers are wild rivers are free from impoundments dams diversions etc and generally inaccessible except by trail where the watersheds area surrounding the rivers and tri butaries are primitive and the shorelines are esse ntially undeveloped scenic rivers are free from impoundmen ts in generally undeveloped areas but are accessible in places by roads recreational rivers are readily accessible by road with some shoreline development and po ssibly may have undergone some impoundment or diversion in the past rivers may come into the system either by congressional signation or state nomination to the secretary of the interi or congress initially designated 789 miles in 8 rivers as part of the national wild and scenic rivers system congress began expanding the system in 1972 and made substantial additions in 1976 and in 1978 413 miles in 3 rivers and 688 miles in 8 ri vers respectively the national wild and scenic rivers system was more than doubled by designation of rivers in alaska in anilca in 1980 in january 1981 interi or secretary cecil andrus approved 5 rivers designated by the state of california increasing the system mileage by another 20 1235 miles the first additions under the reagan administration were enacted into law in 1984 with the addition of 5 rivers including more than 300 miles the next large addition came in 1988 with the designation of more than 40 river segments in oregon adding 1400 miles in 1992 14 michigan river segments totaling 535 miles were added the 106th and 107th

response to controversies associated with management of lands within wild and scenic river corridors several recent signations have incl uded language calling for creation of citizen advisory boards or other mechanisms to ensure local participation in deve loping management plans even without such direction management plans for river corridors involvi ng predominantly private lands usually are developed with input from local jurisdictions prior to designation management of lands within wild and scenic corridors generally is less restricted than in some protected ar eas such as wilderness areas although management varies with the class of the signated river and the values for which it was included in the system administrati on is intended to protect and enhance the values which led to the designation but c ongress also directed that other land uses not be limited unless they subs tantially interfere with public use and enjoyment of these values 10a of the 1968 act primary emphasis for management is directed toward protecting aesthetic scenic historic archaeologic and scientific features of the area road constructi on hunting and fishing and mining and mineral leasing may be permitted in some instances as long as the activities are consistent with the values of the area being protected and with other stat and federal laws designation rivers may be added to the system either by an act of congress usually after study by federal agency or by state mination with the approval of the secretary of the interior congress s identified numerous rivers as potential additions to the system the secretaries of the interior and agriculture are required to report to the president on the suitability of these rivers for wild and scenic designation who in turn submits

httpwwwnpsgovrivers visited feb 13 2004 2aii of the 1968 act management of these st atenominated rivers may be more complicated because of the diversity of land ownership in these areas fewer than 10 of the federal wild and scenic ri ver designations have been made in this manner issues concern over land management issues and private property rights have been the predominant issues associated with designation of wild and scenic rivers since the inception of the 1968 act initially the ri ver designations i nvolved land owned and managed primarily by the federal agencies however over the years more and more segments have been designated that include private lands within the river corridors the potential use of condemnation aut hority in particular has been quite controversial congress s addressed these issues in part by encouraging development of management pl ans during the wild and scen ic river study phase prior to designation and by voiding condemnation acco rding to the national park service condemnation has almost ceased to be used since the early 1980s103 another issue that arises from time to time is the nature of state or federal projects allowed within wild and scenic corridor such as construction of major highway crossings bridges or other activities that might affect the flow or character of the designated river segment major statutes wild and scenic rivers act

the weaknesses of the system according to critics is that poor definition exists of which kinds of trails should be part of the system except for nht criteria114 while it is relatively easy to add new trails it has proven more difficult to provide them with adequate staffing and partnership resources another issue is whether the federal g overnment should be given authority to acquire land for existing trails and the ex tent of any such authority between 1978 and 1986 congress authorized ne national scenic and hist oric trails but prohibited federal authority for land acquisition th trails
