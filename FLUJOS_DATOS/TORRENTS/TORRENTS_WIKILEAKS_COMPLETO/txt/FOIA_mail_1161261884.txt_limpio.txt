from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re fwd re gkss results date thu 19 oct 2006 084444 0400 replyto mannpsuedu xflowed hi keith certainly not and sorry for not clarifying this is the response to the j climate comment by von storch that were talking about here the final draft is due this week and so thats why i needed to check if you tim wanted coauthorship if we were going to show the gkss result we can certainly plan to do more detailed followup analysis jointly i would very much enjoy that something weve talked about doing is set of experiments with mixed proxies where the proxies have variable combination of surface temperature and precip componentsit will be very interesting to see what happens in these cases perhaps this would be good opportunity for collaboration where we could apply this to several different models including csm and the models you guys are working with let know what you think thanks mike keith briffa wrote great mike but hope this does not mean that you will exclude our possible contribution to this paper keith at 1352 18102006 you wrote thanks tim as luck would have it zorita is providing the data to caspar anyway so this should now be moot point well keep you guys updated on things mike original message from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subj re fwd re gkss results date wed oct 18 2006 337 am size 6k to mannpsuedu scott rutherford srutherfordrwuedu cc keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk hi mike your suggested compromise is acceptable to both keith and good luck with the j clim response cheers tim at 1704 13102006 michael mann wrote keith i also figured this might be what you say and i understand where youve coming from this represents bit of dillemma too as it seems unprofessional at best that zorita and von storch have not made their code public when we of course have made ours public there are other sources where we could have gotten the gkss dataim checking w caspar for confirmation i know that the cane group has it and i believe other groups have it nows too so frankly it is effectively now public domain whether vs and zorita like it or not i propose hoping that their is loud objection that we will include line in our response indicating that we have confirmed that we get similar results using the gkss erik simulation well leave it at that we dont need to show that result necessarily unless the editorreviewers demand to see proof and we certaintly dont have to reveal where we got the gkss data as i mentioned there are enough groups out there that now have it that vs and zorita would not know the source and we would not reveal it we feel as if we cannot completely hide the fact that we have confirmed our result w gkss hence the compromise suggested above meanwhile we can pursue more thorough official collaborative effort in the future thoughts on this thanks mike michael mann associate professor director earth system science center essc department of meteorology phone

think best wishes keith at 1733 10102006 you wrote dear timkeith i hope all is well with both of you weve been doing number of sensitivity tests w regem using both the csm simulation and now more recently the gkss simulation data we got from you there are some methodological developments well describe soon related to what is the most reliable regularization method in regem ridge regression and truncated total least squares we are now leaning towards the latter because of potential nonconvergence problems in some cases w the former more on that soon more relevant however are the results as you can see from the attached plot regem works quite well w gkss using short calibration period 19001980 corresponding to years 900980 in the attached plot and both white and red pseudoproxy noise we used rho05 in the attached but similar result for other values the most interesting result is that while regem reconstructs the full nh series well throughout in the case of the csm simulation it does modestly underestimate the warmth of the earliest centuries in the gkss erik simulation it fits everything else including the lia cooling very well we feel that this is likely due to problem of correctly identifying the drift pattern using cfr methods the long and short of this is that we would like to be able to show this result in very short j climate response we need to finalize to comment on mann et 2005 j clim by zorita and von storch we would show you this response for comment of course and would add you as coauthors we have cleared with andrew weaver that this would be an acceptable course of action we are hoping you are in agreement with this please let us know asap we have to finalize our response within days thanks mike michael mann associate professor director
