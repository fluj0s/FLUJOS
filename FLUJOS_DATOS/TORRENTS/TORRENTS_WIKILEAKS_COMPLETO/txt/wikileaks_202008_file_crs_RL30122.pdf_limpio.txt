domestic social policy division september 8 2008 abstract the aging of the american population has made retirement income an issue of increasing concern to the congress and the public although americans are living longer than ever before most retire before age 65 moreover while the nations population continues to grow the decline in birth rates that followed the postworld war ii baby boom and the continued lengthening of life spans will result in fewer workers relative to the number of retirees these trends will aﬀect the economic wellbeing of future retirees because pensions and social security beneﬁts will be paid over longer periods of time savings will have to be stretched over longer retirements and social security beneﬁts will have to be ﬁnanced by working population

employment and earnings january 2008 congress and retirement income policies the internal revenue code was firs t amended to provide favorable tax treatment for qualified pens ion and retirement plans in the 1920s these provisions have been expanded and modified many times since then among the tax exemptions that apply to traditional defin ed benefit pension plans are the deduction of pension contributions from employer in come exclusion of employer contributions to pension plans from employee income and tax exemption of the earnings of pension trusts2 in defined contribution plan s such as those authorized under section 401k of the tax code income taxes are deferred until retirement on employer and employee contributions to th plan and on the investment earnings of the plan by establishing the taxfavored status of pension programs and defining the terms under which tax exemptions and dedu ctions are granted federal tax law has both encouraged the growth of retirement plan coverage among workers and shaped the development of pensions and retirement savings plans congress also has sought to protect the pension benefits earned by wo rkers through direct regulation of pension plans most notably through the employ ee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa pl 93406 erisa too ma have influenced the development of employersponsored retirement plans since its enactment defined contribution dc plans have proliferated while the number of defined benefit d b plans has fallenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30122crs3 two kinds of retirement plans defined benefit and defined contribution retirement programs are legally classified as either defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans in defined benefit or db plans the retirement benefit usually is based on an employees salary nd number of years of service with each year of service worker accrues benef it equal to either fixed dollar amount per month or year of service or percentage of his or her final pay or average pay defined contribution or dc plan is much like savings account maintained by the employer on behalf of each participating employee the employer contributes specific dollar amount or percentage of pay into the account which is usually invested in stocks and bonds in some plan s the size of the employers contribution depends on the amount the employee contri butes to the plan when the worker retires the amount of the retir ement benefit that he or she receives will depend on the balance in the account which is the sum of all the contributions that have been made plus interest dividends and capital gains or losses the worker usually has the choice of receiving these f unds as lump sum series of fixed payments over period of years or in the form of life annuity in recent years many employers have converted their traditional pensions to hybrid plans that have characteristics of both db and dc plans the most popular of these hybrids has been the cash balance plan cash balance plan looks like dc plan in that the accrued benefit is defi ned in terms of an account balance the employer makes contributions to the plan and pays interest on the accumulated balance however in cash balan ce plan the account balances are merely bookkeeping devices they are not indivi dual accounts that are owned by the participants at retirement the employee must receive benefit that is equal to the amount contributed to the plan plus the in terest that has been credited to those contributions legally therefore cash balance plan is defined benefit plan who bears the investment risk in defined bene fit plan it is the employer who bears the investment risk of th plan while in defined contribution plan it is the employee who bears the investment risk in defined benefit plan the employer promises to provide retirement be nefits equal to cer tain dollar amount or specific percentage of the employees pay the employer contributes money to pension trust that is invested in stocks bonds real estate or ot her assets retirement benefits are paid from this trust fund the employer is at risk for the amount of the retirement benefits that have been promis ed to employees and their survivors if there are insufficient funds in the pension trust to pay the accrued benefits the firm that sponsors the pension plan is legally obligated to make up the difference by paying more money into the pension fund this can be done over period of years in defined contribution plan the empl oyer bears risk beyond an obligation to make contributions to each employees re tirement account in these plans it is the employee who bears the risk that his or her retirement account will increase in value by an amount sufficient to provide adequa income during retirement if the contributions made to the account by the employer and the empl oyee are insufficient or if the securities in which the account is i nvested lose value or increase in value toohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30122crs4 3

corporation pension insurance data book 2006 slowly the employee risks having an income in retirement that is not sufficient to maintain his or her desired standard of living if this situation occurs the worker might choose to delay retirement many factors affect firms decisi on to sponsor retirement plan and workers decision to participate in the plan in any given year changes in the business climate infla tion interest rates wage increas the cost of other benefits such as health insurance trends in business revenues and pr ofits could weigh more heavily in firms decision to establish or continue retirement plan than the potential tax advantages it could gain by s ponsoring plan likewise an employees decision to participate or not to participate in retirement plan may be affected by such variables as the rate of growth of wages the rising cost of employee health insurance premiums his or her confidence in the financial status of social security and whether another family member already participates in retirement plan encouraging sponsorship of retirement plans by small firms is an important issue to the congress in part because of the large number of people employed by small businesses in 2007 for example more than 36 million wage and salary workers were employed by firm s with fewer than 25 employees3 the relatively low rates of employer sponsorship and employee participation in retirement plans at small businesses have prompted c ongress to look for ways to make it easier for small employers to establish and maintain retirement plans for their employees because small employers may be reluctant to take on the financial risk and administrative burden of establishing definedbenefit pe nsion plan congress has sought to encourage greater retirement plan sponsor ship among small businesses mainly by easing the financial and re porting requirements associated with certain types of defined contribution pension plans the revenue act of 1978 pl 95600 authorized defined contribution plan called the simplified employee pension sep4 the small business job protecti on act of 1996 pl 104188 authorized another type of defined cont ribution plan called the savings incentive match plan for employees simple nevertheless rate s of retirement plan sponsorship and participation in small firms continue to lag behind the rates achieved in larger firms the number of defined benefit plans is declining according to the pension benefit guar anty corporation pbgc the number of pbgcinsured define d benefit plans fell from 114396 in 1985 to 30328 in 20065 the decline in the number of db plans resulted mainly from the termination of large number of small plans betw een 1985 and 2006 the number of single employer defined benefit pension plans w ith fewer than 100 participants fell fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30122crs5 90061 to 18199 decline of 80 the number of large db plans fell from 22147 to 10585 decline of 522 in recent year s however several large pension plans have been terminated and ot hers have been frozen so that participants longer accrue pension benefits recent trends in retirement plan sponsorship and participation every month the bureau of the census conducts the current population survey cps among nationally representa tive sample of approximately 100000 households primarily for the purpose of estimating the rates of employment and unemployment during march of each year the survey includes supplemental questions about employment income health insurance retirement plan participation and receipt of government benefits during the previous calendar year this information allows analysts and researchers to calculate the number and percentage of workers who reported whether their em ployer offered retirement plan and whether they participated in the plan responses can then be categorized by demographic and economic characteristics such as the workers age race sex income and the size of firm at which they worked unfortunately however because the cps asks only two pension related questions if the workers employer offered retirement plan and if the worker was included in the plan we cannot ascertain whether the plan is defined benefit plan or defined contribution plan plan participation by fulltime vs parttime employment table 2 compares retirement plan par ticipation among yearround fulltime wage and salary workers in the private sector with participation among workers who were employed partyear or parttime workers with partyear or parttime employment are much less likely to be empl oyed by firm that sponsors retirement plan parttime and partyear workers also are less likely to participate if their employer sponsors plan the proportion of yearround fulltime workers employed at firms that sponsored retirement plan increased from 572 in 2006 to 599 in 2007 the participation rate among these worker s rose from 492 in 2006 to 520 in 2007 between 1990 and 2000 plan participation among fulltime workers increased from 546 to 574 it has since fallen by about five percentage points between 2006 and 2007 the proportion of part time or partyear workers employed by firms that sponsored retirement plan rose from 378 to 383 the par ticipation rate among partyear and parttime workers whose em ployer sponsored retirement plan was essentially unchanged from 2006 to 2007 at approximately 23 in both years the lower rate of retirement plan participation among partyear and parttime workers is one of the reasons that women are less likely than men to participate in companysponsored retirement plan ther is little difference in retirement plan participation between n and women who work yearround fulltime see table 4 women however are more likely than men to work partyear or

may include more than one establishmentanother measure of retirement plan participation the national compensation survey the bureau of labor statistics collects data from employers about paid leave health insurance retirement plan participation flexible spending accounts and other employee benefits as part of the national compensation survey ncs this survey is conducted among nationally representa tive sample of privatesector business establishments9 the term establishment usually refers to single place of business at particular location or all branches of business in particular metropolitan area or county an establishment might be branch or small operating it of larger firm in contrast firm comprises all of the establishments that together form corporation partnership or other business entity10 according to the data collected from employers through the national compensation survey 51 of workers in the private sector participated in employer sponsored retirement plans in march 2007 see table 8 twenty percent of private sector workers participated in defined benefit plans and 43 participated in defined contribution plans approxima tely 12 of privatesector workers participated in both types of plan the ncs indicates that 66 of employees in establishments with 100 or more workers participated in an empl oyersponsored retirement plan in march 2007 while only 37 of employees at estab lishments with fewer than 100 employees participated in an employersponsored retirement plan the data from the ncs also indicate that among fulltime workers 60 participated in an employersponsored retirement plan in march 2007 compared to just 23 of parttime workers while it is not necessarily surprising that the results of the ncs differ from those of the cps nor that the ncs shows higher ra tes of particip ation it is important to note that in recent years the difference in the results shown by the two surveys has increased because the ncs has indicated generally steady rate of retirement plan participation whereas the cps data indicate that retirement plan participation has been falling as recently as 2003 the ncs indicated that 49 of privatesector workers participated in retirement plan whereas the cps data showed participation rate of 47 this two percentage point difference wa s small enough to be inconse quential for most analytical purposes the slightly higher rate of par ticipation indicated by the ncs might partly be due to the fact that the business owners and benefits specialists who are interviewed for the ncs could be expected to have greater knowledge of employerprovided benefits than the household members in terviewed for the cps by march 2007 however the ncs indicated that the proportion of privatesector wo rkers participating in employersponsored retirement plan s was 51 whereas the march 2008 cps which asks about pension participation in 2007 show ed that participation in retirement plans among private sector worker s had fallen to 45 the difference in the results shown by the two surveys can longer be considered inc onsequential leavinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30122crs17 analysts to question whether one or both
