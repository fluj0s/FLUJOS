sale or rental to minors of video games that are rated m mature or ao adultsonly by the entertainment software ratings board this board is nongovernmental entity established by the interactive digital software association and its ratings currently have legal effect the boards website sets forth the criteria for its m and ao ratings titles rated m mature have content that may be suitable for persons ages 17 and older titles in this category may contain intense viol ence blood and gore sexual content andor strong language titles rated ao adults only have content that should only be played by persons 18 years and older titles in this category may include prolonged scenes of intense violence andor graphic sexual content and nudity the supreme court has never ruled on the constitutionality of statute that restricted minors access to violent or sexually oriented video games but all nine lower federal courts that have ruled on such statute have found it unconstitutional based on the holdings of these courts it appears that for prohibition of the sale or rental to minors of video games with violent content to be upheld the government would have to present empirical evidence that these games harm minors or cause them to become violent the prohibition of the sale or rental to minors of video games containing sexual content however would seem more likely to be upheld without empirical evidence that such games harm minors nevertheless the apparent vagueness and broad scope of the current criteria for m and ao ratings might cause statutory prohibition on the sale or rental to minors of video games that incorporates those ratings to be found unconstitutional on its face even if the sale or rental to minors of some of the video games to which the m or ao rating apply could constitutionally be prohibited by more narrowly tailored legislation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33232g5g152g151g156g157g146g157g158g157g146g152g151g138g149g146g157g162g561g152g143g561g18g155

entertainment software ratings board this board is nongovernmental entity established by the interactive digital software association and its ratings currently have legal effect the boards website sets forth the criteria for its m and ao ratings titles rated m mature have content that may be suitable for persons ages 17 and older titles in this category may contain intense viol ence blood and gore sexual content andor strong language titles rated ao adults only have content that should only be played by persons 18 years and older titles in this category may include prolonged scenes of intense violence andor graphic sexual content and nudity 1 the primary constitutional issue that proposal to prohibit the sale or rental to minors of video games with m or ao ratings raises is whether it would violate the first amendments guarantee of freedom of speech if it would not violate the first amendment then it would constitute valid regulation of interstate commerce within congresss power to enact under the commerce clause2 congress would also apparently have the power to delegate the promulgation of video game standards to private entity as the supreme court has upheld congresss power to delegate regulatory power to private entities in other contexts3 g8g146g155g156g157g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g561g18g155g146g151g140g146g153g149g142g156g561 the first amendment provides that congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech but the supreme court allows various exceptions to this prohibition obscenity for example is not protected by the first amendment but most sexually oriented material has not been judged to be obscene and is protected by the first amendment 4 even statute that restricts protected speech on the basis of its content may be constitutional but the supreme court generally will uphold such statute only if it passes strict scrutiny this means that to be found constitutional the statute must be necessary to promote compelling interest and be the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest 5 the supreme court has recognized that there is compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological wellbeing of minors 1 httpwwwesrborgesrbratings_guideasp bold in original we will refer to minors throughout this report as it seems unlikely that it would make difference from constitutional standpoint whether proposal applied to 17 or 18year olds 2 the congress shall have power to regulate commerce among the several states art i 8 cl 3 3 see the constitution of the united states of america analysis and interpretation 2002 at 8890 httpwwwcrsgovproductsconanarticle01 topic_s1_4_4_2html 4 the supreme court has created threepart test known as the miller test to determine whether work is obscene the miller test asks whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work taken as whole appeals to the prurient interest b whether the work depicts or describes in patently offensive way sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law and c whether the work taken as whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value miller v

interest extends to shielding minors from the influence of literature that is not obscene by adult standards6

expression which is indecent but not obscene 7 it was not referring to material with violent content and the courts tend to treat restrictions on sexual material differently from restrictions on violent and other nonsexual material with respect to nonsexual material the supreme court requires that when the government defends regulation on speech as means to redress past harms or prevent anticipated harms it must demonstrate that the recited harms are real not merely conjectural and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in direct and material way 8 this is true even with respect to governmental restrictions on speech to which unlike indecent speech the supreme court accords less than full first amendment protection and therefore applies less than strict scrutiny 9 with respect to sexually explicit material by contrast the courts generally assume without requiring evidence that it is harmful to minors or to consider it obscene as to minors10 even if it is not obscene as to adults they therefore find it not entitled to first amendment protection with respect to minors whether it is harmful to them or not considering the constitutionality of federal statute that required cable television operators to prevent signal bleed to customers who had not subscribed to channels primarily dedicated to sexually oriented programming federal district court wrote we are troubled by the absence of evidence of harm presented both before congress and before us that the viewing of signal bleed of sexually explicit programming causes harm to children and that the avoidance of this harm can be recognized as compelling state interest we recognize that the supreme courts jurisp rudence does not require empirical evidence only some minimal amount of evidence is required when sexually explicit programming and children are involved 11 the court therefore found that the statute served compelling governmental interest it held the statute unconstitutional however because it found that it did not constitute the least restrictive means to advance the interest the supreme court affirmed on the same ground apparently assuming the existence of compelling governmental interest but agreeing that less restrictive means could have been used in another case federal court of appeals upholding the statute that bans indecent radio and television broadcasts

governments interest in protecting children extends beyond shielding them from physical and psychological harm the statute that the court found constitutional in ginsberg sought to protect children from exposure to materials that would impair their ethical and moral development congress does not need the testimony of psychiatrists and social scientists in order to take note of the coarsening of impressionable minds that can result from persistent exposure to sexually explicit material12 dissenting judge in the case noted that there is not one iota of evidence in the record to support the claim that exposure to indecency is harmfulindeed the nature of the alleged harm is never explained13 despite the above rulings it has been noted that the court seems to be becoming less absolute in viewing the protection of all minors regardless of age from all indecent material regardless of its educational value and parental approval to be compelling governmental interest in striking down the communications decency act of 1996 the court would neither accept nor reject the governments submission that the first amendment does not forbid blanket prohibition on all indecent and patently offensive messages communicated to 17yearoldno matter how much value the message may have and regardless of pare ntal approval it is at least clear that the strength of the governments interest in protecting minors is not equally strong throughout the coverage of this broad statute reno v american civil liberties union 521 us 844 878 1997 in playboy entertainment group 529 us at 825 the court wrote even upon the assumption that the government has an interest in substituting itself for informed and empowered parents its interest is not sufficiently compelling to justify this widespread restriction on speech the court also would not discount the possibility that graphic image could have negative impact on young child id at 826 thereby suggesting again that it may take age into account when applying strict scrutiny 14 g17g159g142g155g139g155g142g138g141g157g145g561 the supreme court has written the first amendment doctrine of substantial overbreadth is an exception to the general rule that person to whom statute may be constitutionally applied cannot challenge the statute on the ground that it may be unconstitutionally applied to others the doctrine is predicated on the danger that an overly broad statute if left in place may cause persons whose expression is constitutionally protected to refrain from exercising their rights for fear of criminal sanctions overbreadth doctrine has wideranging effects for statute found to be substantially overbroad is subject to facial invalidation 15 12 action for childrens television v federal communications commission

apply if sp eech restriction imposed only civil sanctions as civil as well as criminal penalties can chill speech as the court of appeals noted in federal election commission v lance 635 f2d 1132 1141 5 th cir 1981 it is reasonable to suppose that even if section 441b were overbroad it would not have chilling eff ect substantial enough to justify invoking the overbreadth exception to the standing

means in the present context is that if retailer affected by the proposal under consideration were to challenge it as violating the first amendment then it would not matter whether the sale or rental to minors of particular video game by that retailer could constitutionally be proscribed even if the sale or rental to minors of that particular video game could constitutionally be proscribed the court would strike down the law on its face if it applied to substantial number of other video games whose sale to minors could not constitutionally be proscribed put another way the overbreadth doctrine renders statute invalid in all its applications ie facially invalid if it is invalid in any of them 16

minors access to violent video games but every lower federal courttwo courts of appeals and seven district courtsthat has ruled on such law has found it unconstitutional and issued an injunction against its enforcement 17 two federal courts of appeals the seventh and eighth circuits have considered the constitutionality of local ordinances indianapolis and st louis countys respectively prohibiting making violent video games accessible to minors and both refused to treat violent material like sexual material or to find it obscene as to minors18 both courts rather held the ordinances unconstitutional on the ground that the government had failed to present adequate evidence that violent video games are harmful to minors what sort of evidence would be adequate to persuade court that there was compelling interest in denying minors access to violent video games in the st louis county case the eighth circuit held before the county may constitutionally restrict the speech at issue here the county must come forward with empirical support for its belief that violent video games cause psychological harm to minors in this case as we have already explained the county has failed to present the substantial supporting evidence of harm required before an ordinance that threatens protected speech can be upheld we note moreover that the county may not simply surmise that it is serving compelling state interest because society in general believes that continued exposure to violence can be harmful to children where first 16 ada governor of guam v guam society of obstetricians

than anecdote and supposition19 st louis county also asserted that it has comp elling interest in assisting parents to be the guardians of their childrens wellbeing as to this the eighth circuit said that in case does the supreme court suggest that the governments ro in helping parents to be the guardians of their childrens wellbeing is an unbridled license to governments to regulate what minors read and view 20 in the indianapolis case judge richard posner holding for the seventh circuit that preliminary injunction against enforcement of the indianapolis ordinance was warranted wrote the city rightly does not rest on what everyone knows about the harm inflicted by violent video games these games with their cartoon characters and stylized mayhem are continuous with an ageold childrens literature on violen t themes the city instead appeals to social science to establish that games such as t he house of the dead and ultimate mortal kombat 3 games culturally isomorphic with and often derivative from movies aimed at the same under 18 crowd are dangerous to public safety the social science evidence on which the city relies consists primarily of the pair of psychological studies that we mentioned earlier these studies do not support the ordinance there is indication that the games used in the studies are similar to those in the record of this case or to other games likely to be marketed in game arcades in indianapolis the studies do not find that video games have ever caused anyone to commit violent act as opposed to feeling aggressive or have caused the average level of violence to increase anywhere and they do not suggest that it is the interactive character of the games as opposed to the violence of the images in them that is the cause of the aggressive feelings the studies thus are not evidence that violent video games are any more harmful to the consumer or to the public safety than violent movies or other violent but passive entertainments 21 seven federal district courtsin washington illinois michigan minnesota oklahoma louisiana and californiahave also struck down statutes that denied minors access to violent video games we discuss these seven cases in the order in which they were decided in 2004 district court struck down statute enacted by the state of washington finding that there has been showing that exposure to video games that trivialize violence against law enforcement officers is likely to lead to actual violence against such officers22 in 2005 district court struck down an illinois statute that prohibited both violent and sexually explicit video games finding with respect to the prohibition of violent video games that defendants have failed to present substantial ev idence showing that playing violent video games causes minors

the courts words regulates the distribution of both sexually explicit video games and ultra violent explicit video games to those under the age of 17 the plaintiffs only challenge the second part of the act dealing with ultra violent explicit video games24 the court found that defendants have failed to present substantial evidence showing that playing violent video games causes minors to have aggressive feelings or engage in aggressive behavior25 the court also found that the statute would have chilling effect on video game re tailers because it would make the retailers themselves responsible for determining which games are considered ultraviolent since they could not determine this in advance the retailers would likely steer clear of any game with the potential of such violence in order to avoid civil and criminal liability thus denying constitutionally protected free speech to minors and adults26 the court found in addition that the defendants have also failed to consider less restrictive ways of achieving their interests such as undertaking an advertising campaign to inform parents of the voluntary ratings system developed by the entertainment software ratings board and what to watch out for when purchasing games for their children much like the theater industry did when ratings were first introduced27 finally the court found the michigan statute to be unconstitutionally vague28 in july 2006 district court struck down minnesota statute that would have imposed civil penalty of up to 2500 on persons under 17 who knowingly rented or purchased video game rated ao or m by the entertainment software rating board esrb 29 minnesota is in the eight circuit so the court was bound by the holding of the eighth circuit case discussed above that video games are protected speech and that governmental restrictions on their distribution are subject to strict scrutiny30 the district court found that the state had failed to meet its burden of providing substantial actual empirical support for its belief that violent video games cause psychological harm to minors 31 the court also found violation of due process in the states delegation of its authority to the esrb to determine which video games person under 17 may rent or purchase32 in october 2006 district court in oklahoma granted preliminary injunction against enforcement of statute that criminalizes the display sale or other dissemination of violent video games as defined by the statute 33 the court found that plaintiffs present strong continued cir 2006 the state appealed the

restrictions and that the acts language is unconstitutionally vague in december 2006 district court in louisiana granted permanent injunction against statute that criminalized the distribution to minors of violent video games34 the court found that when it comes to regulating expression in order to curb violent behavior the state must satisfy the standards set forth in brandenburg v ohio 395 us 444 1969 under brandenburg the government must prove that the target expression is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action35 in addition the statute cannot be defended on the grounds that it is designed to protect minors from some form of psychological harm as that amounts to nothing more than impermissible thought control36 the court also found the statute underinclusive because violent video games are only tiny fraction of the media violence to which modern american children are exposed and found that there are less restrictive alternatives which would achieve the states goals including encouraging awareness of the voluntary esrb video game rating system 37 finally the court found the statute unconstitutionally vague in 2007 district court struck down california statute that required that certain violent video games be labeled and prohibited the rental or sale of those games to minors38 the court found that there as been showing that violent video games as defined in the act in the absence of other violent media cause injury to children in addition the evidence does not establish that video games because of their interactive nature or otherwise are any more harmful than violent television movies internet sites or other speechrelated exposures39

struck down an illinois statute that prohibited both violent and sexually explicit video games the state appealed only with respect to sexually explicit video games and the seventh circuit affirmed 40 the seventh circuit applied strict scrutiny and quickly found that the states identified purpose in shielding children from indecent sexual material and in assisting parents in protecting their children from that material is clearly compelling the seventh circuit however found the illinois statute to fail the second prong of strict scrutiny because it is not narrowly tailored and is overbroad this was because it banned access to material that has serious social value for minors even though doing so was unnecessary for the state to achieve its stated purpose 41 even apart from

follow ing the relevant precedents would apply strict scrutiny which means that it would uphold the provision only if it finds that it serves compelling governmental interest by the least re strictive means the determinative question with respect to whether the prohibition serves compelling interest would apparently be whether the government can demonstrate that the recited harms are real not merely conjectural and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in direct and material way42 all six cases cited above found inadequate the governments evidence as to the harm caused by violent video games but one cannot know whether court in the future will consider the same research rejected by courts in the past or if it does whether it will find it more persuasive than have courts in the past if court were to find compelling governmental interest in the prohibition of the sale or rental of video games with violent content then it would have to decide whether the prohibition constituted the least restrictive means to advance the interest point in favor of the proposals constitutionality with respect to this question is that video game stores would know from the m or ao rating exactly which videos they could not legally sell or rent to minors they would not therefore face the situation that the court found that stores could face in one of the cases discussed above namely that without wholesale indiscriminate refusals to sell video games to minors by store operators it appears impossible to protect sellers from prosecution nor is it reasonable to expect store clerks to play each level of each game to determine if it falls within the acts definition of ultraviolent explicit 43 under the proposal however although retailer s would know which video games they were prohibited from selling or renting to minors they could nevertheless argue that the proposal prevented them from selling or renting to minors some video games that are constitutionally protected with respect to minors in addition producers of video games could argue that the proposals vagueness would prevent them from k nowing which video games would be rated m continued definition parallels the first two prongs of the miller test for obscenity but omits parallel to the third prong which is that to be obscene material must taken as whole lack serious literary artistic political or scientific value miller v california supra footnote 4 in ginsberg v new york supra notes 10 and 12 the supreme court upheld statute that prohibited the sale to minors of material that the statute labeled as harmful to minors which it defined so as to parallel all three prongs of predecessor to miller test although by applying each prong in terms of minors ie appeals to the prurient interest of minors etc the statute like the illinois video game statute applied not only to material that was obscene under the miller test 42 turner broadcasting system supra footnote

therefore prohibited from being sold or rented to minors and that the proposals overbreadth would prohibit from being sold or rented to minors some video games that were constitutionally protected with respect to minors in other words producers of video games could argue that the proposal would chill their speech because it might deter them for market reasons from producing video games that were constitutionally protected with respect to minors producers that is might fear that some video games that were constitutionally protected with respect to minors would be rated m or ao and therefore would not be sold or rented to minors and that there was not sufficient adult market for such games to make it worthwhile for them to produce them or that even if there were the producers would make less money because minors would not be allowed to purchase or rent video games that were constitutionally protected person challenging the prohibition of the sale or rental of video games with violent content as overly restrictive might argue that the language that defines the m and ao ratings is vague and overbroad specifically such person might argue that the phrases intense violence sexual content strong language and nudity are unconstitutionally vague and that video games having one or more of these features does not necessarily cause it to lose first amendment protection as to minors and therefore the prohibition on renting or selling to minors video games with one or more of these features would render the proposal unconstitutionally overbroad note that the use of andor in the m and the ao ratings means that intense violence under the m rating need not include blood and gore nor be prolonged as under the ao rating and that strong language is sufficient for an m rating even if it is unrelated to violence or sex the breadth of the ban on the sa or rental to minors of video with strong language might be especially problematic the supreme court has written minors are entitled to significant measure of first amendment protection and only in relatively narrow and welldefined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to them speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that legislative body thinks unsuitable for them 44 furthermore the court has also found that the first amendment applies not only to ideas capable of relatively precise detached explication but to otherwise inexpressible emotions as well in fact words are often chosen as much for their emotive as their cognitive force we cannot sanction the view that the constitution while solicitous of the cognitive content of individual speech has little or regard for that emotive function which practically speaking may often be the more important element of the overall message sought to be communicated45 strong language therefore is protected speech including generally for minors the only exception the supreme court has found is with respect to the use of indecent language on broadcast radio and television during hoursbut not all 24when

proposals prohibition of the sale or rental of video games with sexual content might more easily pass the compelling governmental interest prong of the strict scrutiny test than would the proposals prohibition of the sale or rental of video games with violent content even here however the m rating refers merely to sexual content by contrast with the ao ratings reference to graphic sexual content sexual content especially if it is not graphic does not necessarily constitute pornography but may concern such subjects as birth control and sexually transmitted diseases video games may not typically address such matters but under the substantial overbreadth doctrine discussed above it might not be necessary that they do for court to find the proposal facially invalid it might be impossible for the government to demonstrate compelling interest in denying minors access to all material with sexual content 47 if court did not rule on this question and instead applied the least restrictive means prong of the strict scrutiny test then it might find the proposal overbroad in applying to all material with sexual content in an effort to deny minors access to some of it48 the m rating like the statute that the seventh circuit struck down in the one federal case that addressed ban on video games with sexual content is not limited to material that is obscene as to minors ie to material that taken as whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value 49 an ao rating may be imposed on video games with graphic sexual content and nudity which suggests that nudity alone would not suffice for an ao rating though it might be considered sexual content and suffice for an m rating this seems problematic because the supreme court has written that nudity alone does not place otherwise protected material outside of the first amendment 50 this statement was not made with reference to minors first amendment rights but if court in applying the first amendment took into account the ages of minors who typically buy or rent video games the extent of the nudity portrayed and the manner in which it is portrayed then it might find the proposals coverage of nudity vague and overbroad

proposal would prohibit the sale or rental to minors of video games with either m or ao ratings the constitutionality of each of these prohibitions should be examined separately video games with m ratings as noted may contain intense violence blood and gore sexual content andor strong language if video game contained any one of these features then it would be rated m and could not be sold or rent ed to minors if it would be unconstitutional to prohibit the sale or rental to minors of video games simply because they contain strong language or simply because they contain sexual contentwithout regard to the particular strong language 47 see text accompanying footnote 14 supra especially the supreme courts comment in reno that it would neither accept nor reject the governments submission that the first amendment does not forbid blanket prohibition on all indecent and patently offensive messages communicated to 17yearoldno matter how much value the message may have and regardless of parental approval it is at least clear that the strength of the governments interest in protecting minors is not equally strong throughout the coverage of this broad statute 48 in other words it appears that if the proposal applied to sexual material with serious value then it might be struck down under either prong of the strict scrutiny test 49 entertainment software association v

particular sexual contentthen the substantial overbreadth doctrine would seem likely to render unconstitutional prohibition on the sale or rental to minors of mrated video games given the current criteria for an m rating video games with ao ratings as noted may include prolonged scenes of intense violence andor graphic sexual content and nudity applying the same reasoning just applied to video games with m ratings if it would be unconstitutional to prohibit the sale or rental to minors of video games simply because they contained prolonged scenes of intense violence without regard to their literary value or the possibility of harm then the substantial overbreadth doctrine would seem likely to render unconstitutional prohibition on the sale or rental to minors of aorated video games given the current criteria for an ao rating g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 in conclusion it appears that for prohibition of the sale or rental to minors of video games with violent content to be upheld the government woul d have to present empirical evidence that these games harm minors or cause them to become violent the prohibition of the sale or rental to minors of video games containing sexual content however would seem more likely to be upheld without empirical evidence that such games harm minors nevertheless the apparent vagueness and potential overbreadth of the current criteria for m and ao ratings might cause statutory prohibition on the sale or rental to minors of video games that incorporates those ratings to be found unconstitutional on its face even if the sale or rental to minors of some of the video games to which the m or ao rating apply could constitutionally be prohibited by more narrowly tailored legislation
