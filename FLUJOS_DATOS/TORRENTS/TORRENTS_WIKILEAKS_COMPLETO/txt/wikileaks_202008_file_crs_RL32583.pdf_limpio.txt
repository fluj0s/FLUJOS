grown consistently during the past decade increasing by total of 20 between 1999 and 2003 gasoline consumption grew by 500000 barrels per day accounting for all of the increase in petroleum consumption during that period while 2004 may see growth slow down because of high prices during the first seven mont hs of the year gasoline demand was up by another 19 the fact that gasoline supply has not ke pt up with demand has been reflected in pump prices that have risen from 150 at the start of 2004 to as high as 206 per gallon in late may when s upply and demand become out of sync with their previous relationship prices change to establish new balance the outcome has been period of volatile gasoline prices which have set record highs that have become focal point for consumers and polic makers and raised concer ns about their impact on the economy gasoline is supplied both by us and foreign refiners domestic producers capacity is limited as resu lt nearly 1 million barrels per day of gasoline and its components are imported impor ted blending components especially those used in ethanolblended fuel are increasingly important to total us supply without this supplemental supply gasoline would be less available and prices likely higher imports most recently have come from canada and the us virgin islands which supply onethird of the offshore s upply argentina the netherlands russia the united kingdom and venezuela provide another third imports peaked in march 2004 took dip and reached new highs in july increased imports may have contributed to pump prices backing ff their may highs in late summer new gasoline blending components from venezuela and the rehabilitation of refinery in aruba may also contribute to enhanced gasoline component supply later

legislative interest in the house the gasoline price reduc tion act hr 4545 was brought to the floor under suspension of the rules passage requires twothirds vote on june 15 but failed by 236194 the bill was intende d to increase gasoline availability by limiting the number of fuel blends required to meet clean air standards and by allowing waivers of fuel blend requirements during suppl disruptions this would have made it easier to ship gasoline between markets when needed to balance supply on june 16 the house passed the united states refinery revitalization act hr 4517 by vote of 239192 this bill would provide incentives to increase refinery capacity focusing on areas with closed refineries or those experiencing layoffs or high unemployment it would also charge the department of energy doe with centralizing the process of obtaining environmental permits for new refinery projects including additions and upgrades gasoline demand gasoline demand in the united states continues

imported components of the gasoline cocktail fit into the increasingly common practice of local blending for local markets in that cocktail components often come from multiple sources and are

among stakeholders regarding refiners ability to provide the di versity of products required in sufficient quantities as well as the produc t transport sectors ability to distribute the diverse product slate in its staff white paper on boutique fuels5 the environmental protection agency epa contends that th refining and distribution system works well under normal operating conditions but th agency notes that when the entire fuel market is stressed the places where supply shortfalls and volatile prices tend to show up first and be most acute involve geographically isolated fuel programs many state boutique programs are of this nature and have fewer suppliers and fewer transport options in situations wher there is transportation failure supply shortfall of gasoline components or some combination of these and possibly other factors prices can become very volatile as small supply glitches impact an isolated local market disproportionately there appear to have been few such instances but some have taken place the experience in the chicago metro area during the spring of 2000 is one example of how confluence of circumstances can play out as the chicago metropolitan area transitioned to ethanolblended gasoline in the late spring of 2000 key pipeline supplying gasoline from th gulf coast refining area failed the supply shortfall from traditi onal refiners coupled w ith the initial difficulty in making reformulated gasoline blendstock fo r oxygenate blending in local refineries combined to create tight regional supply situation which saw pump prices nearly double in may and june6 but by july supply from other sources and restoration of pipeline flow began to return prices to accustomed levels the price spike while only few months in duration was substantial and is often pointed to as worst case situation of how converg ence of mishaps can lead to substantial disruption in market delineated by boutique fuel requirements epa notes that problems of this type to date have been limited in terms of geographical scope and durati on it appears that the fuel supply system can support the current structure of fuel standards absent some t of untoward

eia june 2004 in addition to canada and the virgin islands increased gasoline imports now come from the united kingdom and the netherlands where refinery utilization is much lower than in the united

from fadi kabboul minister c ounselor for energy affairs embassy of venezuela aug 20 2004provided extra competition for comparable cargoes from europe where distances and shipping costs are greater this illustrates the significance of the supply of foreign gasoline components and how they can impact us gasoline prices it is likely that high us prices for gasoline and its significant components will continue to attract foreign re finers attention perhaps leading them to seek permanent market share pdvsa which also owns us refiner citgo affording direct retail market access announced that for september it planned to export 12 rbob cargoes to the united states including f our or five for the new yorkconnecticut ethanolonly blended markets10 another example of what may be ta king place in offshore refined product supply is the revitalization of large refi nery in aruba that was recently acquired by valero energy an independent refining company with most of its facilities in the united states while geographically wellpositioned to serve us markets this facility had an unsuccessful operating histor valero began improving operations quickly and is adding upgrading units so that gasolin components can be made in increasing quantities from lowquality crudes the capac ity of this refinery is 275000 barrels per day figure which suggests that it could when it reaches capacity contribute significantly to gulf and east coast gasoline supplies imports from aruba are so recent that they are not reflected in doe data which lag by few months on product imports by country imported gasoline is the nation overly dependent dependence on imports to meet over 10 of national gasoline needs has begun to cause concern that these imports mig ht contribute to 2004s high prices while supplies from canada may have similar physical characteristics and prices to the output from us refiners and offer speedy delivery products from refineries farther afield may not factors such as th cost and timeliness of incremental supply physical reliability and mee ting us product specificati ons can affect price and supply at the gas pump shipping cost may be an additional issue gasoline and many other refined products need to be protected from conta mination from other oils as result they must be shipped in clean vessels these product carriers are usually much smaller than crude carriers and not benef itting from economies of large scale have higher unit costs in addition the clean tanke r market is influenced by spot charter rates for vessels making produc t shipping costs often hi gher and more volatile thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32583crs10 11 the energy information administra tion eia described the economics of attracting imported gasoline to the united states in its summer 2001 motor gasoline outlook showing how the incremental cost of transport must be surmounted it notes that western europe is an important source of incremental or swing gasoline supply in the united states transatlantic gasoline price differentials provide some indication of the attractiveness of the us market to european refiners when us prices exceed european prices adequately to cover transportation costs the united states will attract supply from refineri located there eia notes that europe us gasoline transport costs vary greatly while averaging 4 cents per gallon as imputed by wholesale pri ce differentials but the data shown on the graph accompanying the discussion i ndicate differentials as high as 14 cents per gallon and yearlong periods averaging 8 to10 cents per gallon these figures embody the costs of shipping presumably imported crude to refinery in europe so they embody crude transport costs according to eia figures crude transport to the us from the persian gulf averaged 237 per barre l 56 cents per gallon during 2003crude oil it is cheaper to ship crude to local refinery than to transport products an equivalent distance11 imported products cost more than those refined domestically simply by virtue of transport costs the higher import cost s impact the last units of gasoline supply providing price umbrella for domestic re finers whose pricing like all industrial pricing is linked to the cost of the st increments of the good involved as long as gasoline is imported to meet siz eable imbalance between domestic supply and demand this situation offers likelihood of prices which are above the cost of domestic manufacture this assumes that new domestic refining capacity to replace imports could produce usspec gasoline at costs below those of foreign refiners plus product transport tariffs to the united states in addition to pricerelate d considerations the speed of supply response to price signals from us gasoline markets seems less than it might be from refiner located here it may well be that distance mutes price signals related to an increase in demand for example and refi ners abroad may be slow to receive the message that us consumers desire more gasoline and are currently paying prices which would justify foreign refiners manufacturing of u s specification fuel even if the foreign refiners response to us prices were inst antaneous it could take as long as month in some cases more for the physical supply to arrive here manufacturing fuel for the us market may be another source of delayed response to us market signals some of the substances called for in satisfying us fuel needs may not be produced in the ordina ry course of refinery runs abroad and some like rbob are difficult for many refiners to make calling for longer setup time lags in getting foreign supply may have contributed to 2004s price increases figure 3 shows low imports during late 2003 and early 2004 which corresponded to decline in gasoline inventories and cons istent price increases seen throughout the first half of 2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32583crs11 is dependence on gasoline imports for mo re than 10 of the nations gasoline supply undesirable in theory importing ga soline may have few drawbacks it might make little difference if this fuel were to be supplied from across the border in canada the products supplie d might be usspecification conventional gasoline or rfg what about imports from refinery operated by majo r international oil company in europe or nearby in the cari bbean at what point does foreign refined product dependence become policy concern there is clear answer but major considerations in evalua ting this question include availability of supplies meeting u s specifications so that demand can be met without the need for waivers that could compromise environmental protections the speed with which incremental supply might be available given justintime gasoline inventories in order to avoid excessive price volatility the delivered price of foreign s upplies and whether they are above the incremental price of domestic output such that they ultimately contribute to higher prices policy and legislation the nation has apparent defined policy on refined il product imports nor is there policy regarding gasoline prices there is general perception among policymakers that price volatility is undesi rable but there is consensus on what the price level ought to be nor is ther consensus about how the government might deal with market volatility similarly there appears to be general agreement that spot shortages runouts and lines at gas stations are to be avoided but there are guides for policy actions to remedy such situations should they take place and it could be that letting market forces make corrections without government involvement would be the better course of action some policy initiatives in the 108th congress are embodied in two house bills focusing on the proliferation of regiona l gasoline blends and expanding refinery capacity hr 4545 the gasoline price reduc tion act centered on the proliferation of special local boutique gasoline blends the bill failed to get the required two thirds house vote for passage under suspension of the rules it would have authorized epa during significant supply disruptions to issue waivers of state provisions requiring boutique fuels the boutique fuel requirement is seen as potentially limiting supply by impeding the movement of fuel between areas shortage in one spot might not be met with extra fuel from nearby area because of differing requirements the bill also proposed cappi ng the number of boutique fuels at the current level hr 4545 proposed dealing with supply fungibility but it did not offer

overall cost of gasoline given that ma ny state programs which avoid fullfledged rfg have been implemented to keep down gasoline costs the refining proposals attempt to address the 1 mbd gasoline production shortfall which is made up by imports in one form or another encouraging growth in domestic refinery capacity implies judgment that it is advantageous to have that capacity in the united states in contrast to offshore even if offshore is relatively nearby as noted above domestic producti on could reduce transportation costs and provide quicker supply response to unantic ipated changes in demand this could shorten the duration of potentially disr uptive price spike resulting from gasoline supply shortfall refinery proposals under curre nt debate do not addre ss other issues impacting refinery projects such as an historic l ack of profitability in this industry segment12 it may well be that the current refining situation with imports holding price umbrella over domestic gasoline production may be profitable situation for many refiners many of whom are realizing record earnings in the first and second quarters of 2004 while this years earnings may be high one years experience does not outweigh years of low profits while basic change in refiner profitability might be suggested it is too soon for many fi rms to consider making significant investments in longlived capital equipm ent whose cost is recouped over many years were the prospects for longterm profitab ility in the refining industry to improve by virtue of sustainable recovery in re fining margins it is likely that additional investment in added capacity would be seen but it might take several years of high margins before firm managers and their bankers would become confident enough to make substantial capital commitments
