2008 regulation of energy derivatives mark jickling specialist in financial economics government and finance division summary after the collapse of enron corp in late 2001 that companys activities came under intense scrutiny much of its busine ss consisted of tradin g financial contracts whose value was derived from changes in ener gy prices enrons derivatives trading was largely overthecounter otc nd unregulated little information about transactions was available trading in energy derivatives rebounded after postenron slump and much of the market remains unregul ated this regulatory gap strikes some observers as dangerous for two reasons firs t the absence of government oversight may facilitate abusive trading or price manipulation j une 2007 report by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations concluded that excessive speculation by the amaranth hedge fund which failed in 2006 di storted natural gas prices second the failure of large derivatives dealer could c onceivably trigger disruptions of supplies and prices in physical oil and gas markets thoug h the effect was minor in the enron case number of bills before the 110th congress would give the commodity futures trading commission cftc enhanced authority to regulate certain energy trades on markets other than the regulated futures ex changes hr 2419 the farm bill enacted as pl 110234 on may 22 2008 over the presid ents veto will impose exchangelike regulations on electronic overthecounter markets trading contracts that play significant role in setting energy prices this report analyzes the development of energy derivatives regulati on crs re port rl34555 speculation and energy prices legislative responses by mark jickling and lj cunningham summarizes bills that address energy speculation it will be updated as deve lopments warrant energy derivatives financ ial contracts whose value is linked to changes in the price of some energy product are traded in several kinds of markets the futures exchanges and the offexchange or overthe counter market the new york mercantile exchange nymex is the leading us market for futures contracts based on prices of crude oil natural gas heating oil and gasoline futures exchanges called designated contract markets are regulated by the commodity futures trading commission cftc under the commodity exchange ac t cea the cea imposes range of mandates on the exchanges and on futures indus try personnel regarding record keeping including an audit trail for all trades registration requirements market surveillance financial standards sales practices handling of customer funds and so onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21401crs2 the second trading venue for energy deriva tives is the offexchange or overthe counter otc market unlike the futures ma rket there is centralized marketplace for otc derivatives instead number of firms act as dealers offering to enter into contracts with others who wish to manage their risk exposure to energy prices otc contracts based on energy products are generally exem pt from regulation under the cea so long as the contracts are offered only to eligible contract participants defined as financial institutions professional traders institutional investors governmental units and businesses or individuals who exceed various asset and income thresholds the law assumes that sophisticated parties such as th do not need the inve stor protections that government regulation provide s for small public customers of the futures exchanges in recent years hybrid form of market has emerged which resembles the exchanges in that multiple parties can trade on an electronic platform but which has been largely exempt from cftc regulation th markets known as exempt commercial markets must notify the cftc before they begin operations and provide certain basic information about themselves but they are not required to monitor trading publish data on trading volumes or prices or enforce ce prohibitions against fraud or manipulation before the passage of pl 110234 the cftc had limited jurisdiction other than enforcement authority ove r manipulation and fraud to traders whether they are speculating on pr ice changes in search of profit or using derivatives to protect themselves from th price risk associated with producing or purchasing physical energy commodities these markets are basically interchangeable historical development of derivatives regulation in 1974 congress observed that derivatives trading was about to expand from its traditional base in farm co mmodities into financial futu res contracts based on bonds interest rates currencies nd so on to ensure that deri vatives traders received the same protections whether they were trading k bellies or tbonds pl 93463 created the cftc to oversee all derivatives trading regardless of the nature of the underlying commodity the cftc was given exclusive jurisdiction all contracts that were in the character of futures contracts had to be traded on cftcregulated futures exchange there were two major exceptions to this exchangetrading requirement forward contracts where actual delivery of the commodity would take place at the expiration of the contract were considered cash sales nd not subject to the cea second the so called treasury amendment part of the same law that created the cftc specified that contracts based on foreign currencies or us treasury securities could be traded off exchange existing markets in these instruments had long used futureslike contracts and appeared to function well without direct government regulation treasury saw public interest in bringing them under the new cftc during the 1980s market in otc deri vatives evolved utilizing swap contracts that served exactly the same economic functions as futures the first swaps were based on currencies and interest rates later otc contracts based on commodity including energy prices were introduced these otc markets were well established before the cftc made any move to assert its jurisdiction despite the fact that swaps were clearlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21401crs3 1 exemption for certain products involving energy products federal register vol 58 april 20 1993 p 21286in the character of futures contracts the potential cftc jurisdiction however created legal uncertainty for the swaps industry if court had ruled that swap was in fact an illegal offexchange futures c ontract trillions of dollars in outstanding swaps could have been invalidated this might have caused ch aos in financial markets as swaps users would suddenly be exposed to the risks they had used derivatives to avoid the cftc issued swaps exemption in 1989 holding that the cea gave it authority to regulate swaps but that it would not do so as long as they differed from futures contracts in certain enumerat ed respects in 1992 congress gave the cftc additional authority to exempt otc contracts pl 102 546 in response the cftc modified the 1989 swaps exemption in 1993 and also issued specific exempti on for otc derivatives based on energy products1 under the 1993 exemption otc energy derivatives would not be regulated if all trading was betw een principals whose business involved the physical energy commodities underlying the deri vatives if all contr acts were negotiated as to their material terms unlike futures contracts where terms are standardized and if all contracts were held to maturity rather than traded rapidly as futures are this exemption was matter of regulati on not statute in may 1998 the cftc issued concept release that indicated that it was considering the possibility of extending features of exchange regulation to the otc market the release solicited comments on whether regulation of otc deri vatives should be modified in light of developments in the marketplace among the questions were whether the existing prohibitions on fraud and manipul ation were sufficient to pr otect the public and whether the cftc should consider additional terms nd conditions relating to registration capital internal controls sales practices record keeping or reporting the concept release drew strong opposition from the swaps industry and from other regulators especially the fe deral reserve in decembe r 1998 congress included in the omnibus appropriations act pl 105277 provision directing the cftc not to propose or issue any new regulations aff ecting swap contract s before march 31 1999 in november 1999 the presidents working gr oup on financial markets issued report entitled overthecounter derivatives markets and the commodity exchange act the report recommended that to rem ove uncertainty about the lega l and regulatory status of the otc market bilateral tran sactions between sophisticated parties that do not involve physical commodities with finite supplie s should be excluded from the commodity exchange act that is the cftc should have jurisdiction while the working groups report made distinc tion between financial commodities and those with finite supplies and suggested that continuing cea jurisdiction was appropriate for the latter the report did not recommend that the cftc should re scind its exemption of otc energy derivatives in other words the work ing group saw immediate problem with the unregulated status of otc ma rkets in energy derivatives in 2000 congress passed the commodity fu tures modernization act of 2000 pl 106554 hr 5660 that legisla tion established three classes of commodities first financial variables interest ra tes stock indexes currencies etc are defined as excluded commodities and otc contracts based on these are not subject to the cea providedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21401crs4 that trading is restricted to eligible contract participants that is not marketed to small investors second there is statutory exemption for derivative contracts based on agricultural commodities these remain under cf tc jurisdiction finally there is an all other category exempt commodities wh ich includes energy products contracts in exempt commodities can be traded in the otc market without cftc regulation provided that small inve stors participate however certain antifraud and antimanipulation provisions of the cea continue to apply if an otc exchange is created defined in the law as an electronic trading facility where multiple buyers and sellers may post bids and trade with each other the cftc has some oversight jurisdiction and may require disclosure of certain market information in summary the otc energy derivativ market developed outside cftc jurisdiction in the late 1980s and early 1990s despite the ceas pparent prohibition of such market as with financial otc rivatives however the cftc never challenged the legality of this offexchange market as concerns about legal uncertainty mounted the cftc in 1993 issued an exemption stating that certain otc energy transactions did not fall under the cea in 2000 congre ss essentially codified this exemption by including energy in the category of exempt commodities this removed them from even the possibility of cftc regulation excep t for limited antifra ud and manipulation jurisdiction and some oversight if the market for otc contracts should evolve into an exchangelike market thus the 2000 legisl ation did not deregulate the otc energy derivatives market that market had been unregulated since its beginnings manipulation in energy markets since the value of derivatives contracts is linked to the price of the underlying commodity traders who can manipulate commodity prices can reap huge profits manipulative strategies may invol ve either physical spot or derivatives markets or both since the enron scandal regulators have ta ken numerous actions ag ainst several types of manipulation in energy markets in 2003 the cftc charged enron with mani pulation of natural gas prices the strategy was simple enron purchased an unusual number of contracts for spot gas driving up prices by simultaneously increasing demand in the marketplace and making other traders think that there was some funda mental factor that favored higher prices enron settled cftc charges by agr eeing to pay 35 million fine in 2004 ten energy companies have paid tota l of 180 million in fines to settle cftc charges that they manipulated natural gas prices in 2001 and 2002 by providing false data about supply levels to platts private sour ce of information on energy market conditions the affected platts reports sent false signals to other market participants that supplies were significantly tighter than expected and prices rose sharply but briefly as result enron and number of other firms admitted to gaming the marketing system for electrical power in california in 2000 exacerba ting price increases and shortages the strategies included deceptive reporting of energy supplies on hand to create the impression of shortages to drive up prices di sguising the source of electricity to take advantage of variable pricing for instate and outofstate power and in some caseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21401crs5 actually closing power plants during times of tight supplies to drive up prices numerous firms and traders faced civil and criminal ch arges as result of these manipulations in august 2006 the amaranth hedge fund st 2 billion in natural gas derivatives and liquidated its entire 8 b illion portfolio june 2007 staff report by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations excessive speculation in the natural gas market found that the funds collapse trigge red steep unexpected decline in prices and that amaranths large positions had caused significant price movements in the months before it failed the report concludes that amaranth was able to evade limits on the size of speculative positions key feature of the futures exchanges antimanipulation program by shifting its trading from ny mex to exempt and unregulated markets as energy and agricultural commodity pr ices reached record highs in 2008 there was concern that financial speculators were driving prices up to levels not justified by fundamentals of supply and dema nd it is common to speak of speculative premium or bubble in the price of oil but ther is sure methodology for determining what commodity price ought to be based on the fundamentals the only price we can observe is the one generated by the markets and the speculative premium argument assumes that markets are not setting prices efficiently legislative proposals on derivatives regulation since enron the regulatory status of otc energy derivatives has been much debated increases in the price of oil and gasoline have sharpened the debate several bills before the 110th congress propose to regulate or othe rwise affect the otc energy derivatives market several bills hr 6330 hr 6341 hr 6372 and s 3134 would remove energy commodities from the category of ex empt commodities and place them on the same regulatory footing as agricultural commodities this would require that otc energy contracts be approved by the cftc before they could be traded hr 6264 would limit participati on in the otc energy market to firms that deal in the physical commodities hr 3009 s 577 s 3131 and s 3202 would impose new reporting requirements on energy swap dealer s andor other otc ma rket participants summaries of these bills and others are available in crs report rl34555 speculation and energy pri ces legislative responses by mark jickling and lynn j cunningham on may 22 2008 congress enacted the farm bill hr 2419 pl 110234 over the presidents veto title x iii included provisions reauthorizing the cftc and creates new regulatory regime for certain otc energy derivatives markets subjecting them to number of exchangelike regulations th provisions apply to electronic trading facilities markets where multiple buyers and sellers are able to post orders and execute transactions over an electronic network if the cftc determines that these markets currently exempt from most regulati on play significant role in setting energy prices they will be required to register with the cftc and comply with several regulatory core principles aimed at curbing manipula tion and excessive speculation including the establishment and enforcement of positi on limits they w ill be required to publishhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21401crs6 andor report to the cftc information rela ting to prices trading volume and size of positions held by speculators and hedgers these new regulatory requirements apply onl to electronic markets that have come to resemble the regulated futures exchanges bilateral otc derivative contracts between two principals eg between swap dealer and an institutional investor that are not executed on trading facility where multiple bids and offers are displayed will continue to be largely exempt from cftc regulation number of bills would raise the margin requirements for crude oil futures contracts margin is the amount of money th at trader must post with the exchange to buy or sell single futures contract for cr ude oil the nymex margin is currently 11813 per contract each contract represents 1000 barrels of oil margin requirements are normally set by the futures exchanges higher margins raise the cost of trading the theory is that higher costs will drive out speculation moderating price volatility and perhaps easing upward pressure on prices them selves empirical research however has not established strong link between margin levels or speculation in general and price volatility current concerns about excessive specula tion in energy raise basic issues about derivatives markets the cftc does not believe that energy markets are being manipulated but that they are responding to tr aders expectations of future prices which is their proper function the cftcs concep tion of manipulation requires that single trader or group of traders amass market pos ition that enables them to willfully distort or dictate prices in defiance of the fundamentals the cftcs observation that it cannot detect any elements of such classic corn er or squeeze behind todays high prices and that therefore the markets are functioning well does little to reassure the many observers who believe that flood of money from hedge funds wall street firms pension funds endowments and other in stitutional investors has driven prices artificially high to these observers excessive financial specu lation is in itself form of manipulation even though it does not meet the legal definition fundamental issue is whether speculation causes prices to become more volatile empirical research suggests that in general it does not but financial markets in recent years have witnessed several episodes of price bubbles dotcom stocks residential real estate mortgagebacked bonds indicating that markets at times generate prices that are not supported by fundamental factors of supply and mand attempts to limit the influence of speculators include the call for higher margin requirements in energy futures more stringent measures are available india recently banned trading of agricultural futures contracts it is not certain however that market where speculation is restrained will be less volatile than the ones we have now nor that we have better model for setting prices than market where traders of all kinds pool their information by taking risky financial positions based on their ex pectations of future price trends
