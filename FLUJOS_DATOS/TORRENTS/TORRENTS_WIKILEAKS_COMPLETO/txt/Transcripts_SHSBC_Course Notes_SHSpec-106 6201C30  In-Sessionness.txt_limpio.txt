6201c30 shspec106 insessionness assessing isnt to find something to run its running the case rudiments must be kept in throughout the session not just used to get the pc in session end rudiments are there to keep the session from perpetuating itself or hanging up beginning rudiments are to get the pc out of the physical universe into session and his own universe not still coping with his life outside of session if he has to put lot of attention on the auditor he is still in cope in having to handle another human being social situation not session an auditor who does poor job of getting rudiments in puts the pc into the physical universe coping with the auditor pc in session should be able to be in state of noresponsibility for the physical universe around him during the session that is the reason you can plumb the bank the less responsible you make the pc for the physical environment and the auditor and the auditing the more noresponsible the pc is for those things that sounds peculiar because it is also the state of an hypnotic trance but pc in session is not in an hypnotic trance the difference is interesting in an hypnotic trance it is demonstrated conclusively that he has control over anything the only person with any control is the hypnotist hypnotism is total overwhelm devoted directly to the physical universe the pcs body that has little in common with pcs attitude in session it was one of the few states man could induce on man along with cured dead injured etc it was the only one by which he could approach the spiritual and the infinite people can misinterpret this when it comes to getting pcs in session their past track in dealing with these other states can color their approach to pcs there are also the social states which have nothing much to do with auditing it is to play on that but auditors can get confused about what insessionness is what is the beingness of pc it is of course willing to talk to the auditor and interested in own case this is so simple that auditors can try to put additive states in on top of it using inval and eval they can turn the session into an hypnotic trance session by overwhelming the pc it cant happen easily it takes some doing but it could happen what you want is just someone who is longer fixated on the physical universe or in social state with the auditor but if you violate the auditors code he will still have the physical universe because he will have person not an auditor to deal with he will be too concerned with what the auditor might think what the auditor is doing etc that is normal enough to degree early in auditing so the first auditing person has should be the best because that is when he is most distrustful you dont want him to keep distrustful attitude towards an auditor pc in session can look at his own universe the auditor has to get him to look its interesting that he is in such state of noresponsibility for the physical universe since that is actually the state he has been in since the beginning of track it is his noresponsibility for the physical universe that makes it necessary for him to cope with it and be unsafe with it this is common denominator of bank at the most aberrated spots on the back track the person is 100 irresponsible for the lot so he goes into this state rather easily we are more interested in the backtrack than in his present time physical universe the reason why we are trying to detach him from the pt physical universe is so that we can put him into communication with the pasttime physical universe if he stays stuck in present time he is in state of supercope the mind to such person is already an area of danger because his time track is fraught with insecurity even greater than the insecurity of ft but he is actually not stuck in pt he is stuck on the back track believing that it is present time so you must get beginning ruds in much better with new pc or green pc likewise if auditing gets into grind tear into the ruds dont just check them to see if they are in use them to audit the case dont just get them in for the session we are running get them in for all his past sessions particularly the first how many ruds processes should you use normally you can just flick the withholds off of any ruds question to get the pc into session but the available processes for getting ruds in are nearly countless any valid communication process old problems processes withhold processes there are lots of them you must recognize what rudiments are they are reasons why he might not be in session if you want to straighten him out on the subject of auditing get his ruds in starting with his first session having located the first session you could run what didnt that auditor know and what didnt you know about the environment if the pc has been an auditor you can run out his first pc with what didnt that pc know about you you could get all ruds in on every session he has ever had including end rudiments only the first session or two and few others will have any importance the best method to do this would be form 6 sec check see hcopl 7jul61 processing sec check this is intended for students who have done fair amount of auditing so if pc behaved peculiarly as pc if he was hard to get in session etc look for past bum session and get all ruds in for the first session hed had and given you could lockscan him to find where the pc is stuck lockscanning is very useful for that then you can get ruds in wherever he is parked until he takes time to get from the first session to pt you could do this over and over it shouldnt take more than four or five hours failure to do something like this wastes auditing time because of outofsessionness outofsessionness could arrive from another quarter either you didnt prepare the pc for assessment or ruds are out or there was at least one bad session which has been restimulated so that earlier auditing has to be cleaned up to get later auditing accomplished the pcs interest may be in later incidents but the trouble comes from earlier this has been the uniform mistake all down the track looking at the wrong end of the chain the pcs interest is in the last occurrence and his aberration is in the first occurrence the things person cant remember are the things he has taken responsibility for you can get an inversion where the pc has responsibility for things but has apparent full memory for them actually it is dubin dubin is an effort to take responsibility for something the pc has responsibility for this would be barrier to an auditor unless he could detect something under it for that you can use your emeter which will detect noresponsibility areas that the pc cannot remember when lrh audits pc he makes sure that the pc is interested in finding out about the unknown areas of his past that he gets some familiarity with his own thinkingness that he gets some realization that he has had some causation over his actions in life one thing looms large over all technicalities the state of being in session the most gross auditing error there is is not to get and keep pc in session one can fail to recognize when the pc isnt in session or one can hope insessionness will materialize it never materializes it is not an accident or something you can put on automatic you put pc in session or you take advantage of pcs insessionness when it occurs the main thing that you dont notice is that the pc goes out of session in the middle of session you have to devote some time to putting ruds in when they are out during the session this is very necessary when doing 3d criss cross you are handling charged items the pc can hit one lack confidence in his ability to handle it and arc break with the auditor or something or they invalidate the situation or they withhold something the auditor has to keep these things picked up but the pc isnt telling you what is wrong with his case when he tells you one of these things he is telling you what has just blown that is why it is an error to q and with what the pc gives you in middle ruds if you do take it up you will put the pc out of session one way to get ruds in in midsession is to find what flow the pc has on automatic it is that flow that causes the others to materialize when you get that one cleaned up the ruds will stay in better because you know what the trigger is all you have to know is which flow is sticky which flow has his attention
