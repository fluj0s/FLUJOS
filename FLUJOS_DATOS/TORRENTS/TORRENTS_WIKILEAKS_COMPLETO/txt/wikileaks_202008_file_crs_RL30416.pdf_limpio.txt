trade embargo against vietnam the following year the two countries establishe d ambassadoriallevel diplomatic relations in 1998 president clinton granted vietnam its first waiver from the requirements of the socalled jacksonvanik amendment contained in the trade act of 1974 title iv section 402 which prohibit the president from normalizing commercial relations with selected socialist and formerly

after two requirements ve been met the president issues determination that the country is not in violation of the freedomofe migration requirements of the jacksonvanik amendment6 to date vietnam has not been found to be in full compliance with jacksonvanik requirements alternatively subject to certain conditions the president may waive full compliance with these requirements as presidents clinton and bush have done since 1998 jacksonvanik waivers must be renewed annually and congress may reject them by passing joint disapproval resolution b the completion of bilateral trade agreement that contains certain required provisions includi ng reciprocal mfn clause7 such an agreement requires approval by the congress and by the vietnamese national assembly the approval of the bta allows the president to extend temporary mfn tariff treatment to vietnam the mfn treatment is temporary because it is contingent upon vietnam meeting the requirements described inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30416crs4 8 note that vietnams mfn treatment would be temporary regardless of whether it received jacksonvanik waiver or presidential report that vietnam is in full compliance with the jacksonvanik amendment in the case of the latter the presidents annual yearend report would be subject to congressional review nd therefore could be rejected by joint disapproval resolution 9 for more on this topic see crs report rs20717 vietnam trade agreement approval and implementing procedure by vladimir pregeljthe previous paragraphs ie either obtaining presidential determination or presidential waiver both of which are subject to annual congressional review and disapproval8 congressional procedures for considering usvietnam bta9 to go into effect title iv bilateral trade agreements must be approved by joint resolution of congress once the president transmits the agreement to congress joint resolution must be introduced in bot h houses the resolutions are subject to special expedited procedures under which amendments are not permitted in either chamber additionally there are deadlines of 45 sessiondays for committee consideration by the house ways and means and the senate finance committees and 15 sessiondays for floor debate in both chambe rs because the approval resolutions are revenue measures the senate must vote on housepassed reso lution and congress would have maximum of 90 sessiondays to act on the resolution 45 days for consideration by the house ways and m eans committee followed by 15 days for floor debate in the house followed by 15 days for considerati on of the housepassed resolution in the senate finance committee followed by 15 days for floor debate in the senate as with most trade agreements with nonmarket economies the usvietnam bta will remain in effect for 3year period and will be extended automatically unless renounced by either party add itionally each extension will require presidential determination that vietnam is satisfactorily extending reciprocal mfn treatment to us exports after the bta extending permane nt mfn treatment to vietnam following the bta the next step toward normalizing usvietnam commercial ties is restoring permanent mfn status also known as permanent ntr or pntr status to vietnam this process that will require congress to terminate the application of the relevant title iv provisions to vietna m as has been done for several countries including china albania and georgia vietnam and the world tr ade organization wto vietnam applied to join the wto in 1995 many observers belie ve that vietnam is number of years away from meeting the requirements for wto membership in march 2001 vietnams trade minister expressed his governments goal of acceding to the wto by 2004 countries seeking to enter the wto must negotiate bilateral agreements with current wto members provisions of such agreements are then consolidated into the acceding countrys protocol of accession and because of the wtoshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30416crs5 10 if vietnam acceded to the wto before th us extended to it permanent mfn status its wto membership could place the us in violation of the wto requirement that unconditional mfn treatment be applied to all wto members the us could avoid this by invoking the wtos nonapplication article article x iii prior to vietnams accession to the wto thus if vietnam were to join the wto hanois accession would not in and of itself alter the status of usvietnam trade relations which would continue to be governed by title iv of the trade act of 1974 as well as the usvietnam bta however the us would not have any claim on vietna ms concessions to other wto members nor could it use the wtos dispute resolution mech anism to deal with usvietnam trade disputes 11 alternatively as described earlier this step could be taken through presidential determination that vietnam is in full compliance with the jacksonvanik amendments freedomofemigration requirements along with belarus vietnam has not been determined to be in full compliance with the jacksonvanik requirementsmandatory mfn requirement apply to all wto members in other words any concessions obtained by one country in bilateral accession agreement would be enjoyed by all wto members typically the bilateral accession negotiations focus on tariff concessions and othe r market access issues that will govern bilateral trade relations after the applicant becomes member thus at some point in the future vietnam and the us are likely to engage in another set of ne gotiations about the changes vietnam must make to its trad regime before the us will support vietnams application for wto membershi p upon completion of this agreement it is likely that the us president will ask congress to extend permanent mfn treatment to vietnam much as president clinton did after completing wto accession negotiations with china in november 199910 table 1 vietnams path to commercial

detailed conce ssions in the areas of services investment and market access than had been obtained in previous bilateral trade pacts with other jacksonvanik countries as discussed in the following section it appears the us successfully obtained most of these negotiating objectives following the signing of the agreement clinton administration officials and business representatives were careful not to argue that the bta will significantly boost us exports and investment to vi etnam in the short term rather they stressed that us exporters and investors will benefit most in the medium to

complaints of arbitrary treatment by local and central government authorities many of the agreements proponents also contended that the bilateral trade pact will nudge vietnam toward more democr atic

market access the final bta includes commitments by vietnam to reduce tariffs on approximately 250 products about fou rfifths of which are agricultural goods 1999 press reports implied that th agreement in principle contained 330 tariff items scheduled for ta riff reduction us official involved in negotiating the agreement however has argued that this number is incorrect stating that the tariff changes in annex of the final bta are essentially the same as those agreed upon in 1999 comparison with past btas in negotiating bilateral trade deals with jacksonvanik countries us negotiators generally have tried to break new ground with each successive agreement as one indication of that policy the 1979 agreement china was less than 10 pages while the far more comprehensive usvietnam bta is more than ten times that length the vietnamus bta goes bey ond past agreements in its more detailed commitments in the areas of services and investment furthermore vietnams tariff concessions represent new development previous jacksonvanik btas contained few or market access commitments becau in those negotiations the us proposed to carry out tariff disc ussions at future date not as part of the final bta itself27 vietnams ambivalence toward economic integration though the us and vietnam reached an agreement in principle on the bta in july 1999 for nearly year vietnam delaye d signing

consensusstyle of decisionmaking and the weakness of the countrys current leadership probably extende d this vetting process the bta is the most extensive agreement vietnam has ever negotiated and the assent of virtually all officials involved in implementing the deal was required befo re hanoi would take such radical step furthe rmore the weakness of the c ountrys current top leaders vcp general

since the vietnamese communist partys vcp 8th party congress in 1996 disagreements between reformers and conservatives in vietna ms 19member politburo the countrys supreme ruling body have paralyzed econo mic decisionmaking as the bilateral trade agreement with the us requires vietnam to jumpstart its reforms and deepen its integration into the global economy it is not surprising that the politburo also has been divided over whethe r to finalize the deal the conservatives fear that economic reform will undermine the socialist foundations of the countrys economic and political systems and thereby erode the vcps legitimacy and monopoly on power they also fear that vietnams sovereignty will be eroded by increasin g vietnams economic dependence on the west and by increasing vietnams vulner ability to regional economic downturns such as the 199799 asian financial crisis am ong their specific concerns conservatives worry that shifting to more marketo riented economy will force the politburo to curtail subsidies to the c ountrys state owned enterprises the backbone of the socialist economic system many cons ervatives are understandably worried that further rationalization will

another hypothesis is that hanoi was concerned that trade deal with the united states would antagonize china beijing and hanoi recently have strengthened their ties and conservative elements in hanoi

treaty negotiations that were not concluded until december 1 999 there are also reports that chinese leaders warned the vietnamese not to conclude the bta before beijing had finalized its own wto accession negotiations with the us talks that were concluded in novemb er 1999 however some an alysts and administration officials reject this reasoning as stalling tactic by the vietnamese who are said to often use the chinese as an excuse for delaying foreign polic moves about which they are uncertain as one observer has pointed out chinese opposition did not prevent vietnam from joining the association of southeast asian nations asean in 199531 most observers agree that apart from the issue of unsubstantiated chinese pressure the china factor played positive role in spurring the
