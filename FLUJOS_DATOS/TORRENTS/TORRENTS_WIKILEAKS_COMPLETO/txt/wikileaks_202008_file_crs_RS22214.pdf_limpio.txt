modifications of the traditional defined benefit plan1 these plans are referred to as hybrid plans because they are defined benefit plans that conceptualize the benefits in manner similar to defined contribution plans2 one type of hybrid plan is the cash balan ce plan cash balance pension plan is defined benefit plan that resembles defined contribution plan because the employees promised future benefits are stated as an account balance the account is hypothetical each participant does not actually have an account and is used to reflect the amount of benefits the individual has accrued the account consists of employer contributions that are percentage of annual compensation called pay credits and interest earned on those contributions called interest credits an employer may choose to adopt cash balance plan as new retirement plan or may convert its traditional defined benefit plan to cash balance plan during the past two decades numerous employers have converted or considered converti ng their plans conversion is subject to the rules that apply to any plan amendment includ ing the anticutback rule under that rule an amendment may not 1 decrease an accrued benefit or 2 eliminate or reduce an early retirement benefit or retirementtype subsidy with regard to service that has already been performed except in limited circumstances and with prior approval by the treasury secretary 3 the plan amendment may only reduce future benefit accruals since these benefits have not yet been earned any amendment that significantly reduces the rate of future benefit accrual requires clearlywritten notice to affected participants 4 cash balance plans and other hybrid plans have been the subject of controversy three issues have received recent public and congressional attention the negative effect of plan conversion on older employees due to wearaway the whipsaw effect that may occur when computing lumpsum payment of benefits prior to normal retirement age and the practice of providing the greater of benefit to plan participants as part of conversion to cash balance plan 5 while the pension protection act of 2006 pl 1092806 clarified the law with respect to cash balance plans and added various new requirements that these plans must meet certain questions remain with respect to these three issues g25g142g138g155g556g3g160g138g162g561 in conversion from defined benefit plan to cash balance plan an employees accrued benefit will typically be converted into hypothetical opening account balance if this opening account 1 defined benefit plan is pension plan under which an em ployee is promised specified future benefit traditionally an annuity beginning at retirement in defined benefit plan the employer bears the investment risk and is responsible for any shortfalls see erisa 335 2 defined contribution plan is pension plan in which the contributions are specified but not the benefits defined contribution plan also called an individual account plan provides an individual acc ount for each participant that accrues benefits based solely on the am ount contributed to the account and any income expenses and investment gains or losses to the account see erisa 334 3 erisa 204g erisa 302c8 irc 411d6 irc 412c8 4 erisa 204h1 5 another controversial issue with respect to cash balance plans is the claim that cash balance plans andor the conversion to such plans violate federal laws prohibiting age discrimination this issue is addressed in separate report see crs report rl33004 cash balance pension plans and claims of age

already accrued then the employee may experience period of wearaway wearaway occurs during the time it takes the account balance under the cash balance plan to surpass the accrued benefit the employee has already earned under the defined benefit plan during this period an employer may not be required to make new contributions to an employees cash balance plan account until the account balance catches up to the previously accrued benefit because of wearaway an employee may have to work several years before accruing any additional pension wealth under the cash balance plan 7 this issue while still pertinent has beco somewhat less controversial due to changes made by the pension protection act critics have argued that the wearaway concept violates the anticutback rules of the employee retirement income security act erisa in campbell v bankboston 8 the first circuit court of appeals addressed this issue and held that the occurrence of wearaway due to conversion from defined benefit plan to cash balance plan did not violate the anticutback rules the court stated that the anticutback rules protected campbells accrued benefits but not his future expected benefit therefore according to the court erisa allowed bankboston to amend or terminate future accruals so long as campbell received the pension benefits previously accrued the pension protection act of 2006 amended eris the internal revenue code irc and the age discrimination in employ ment act adea to include new restrictions on plan conversions9 these restrictions are intended to eliminate the wearaway of preconversion benefits the act provides that when traditional defined benefit plan is converted into cash balance plan each participant must receive the sum of 1 the preconversion accrued benefit determined under the prior plan formula plus 2 the postconversion accrued benefit determined under the cash balance plan formula newly conver ted plan must also credit participant with the amount of any early retirement benefits or retirementtype subsidies if the participant has met the requirements for the benefit or subsidy under the prior plan the wearaway provision is applicable to plan conversions adopted after june 29 2005 thus for plans that converted to cash balance plan prior to this date issues regarding wearaway still remain and may still be evaluated by the courts10 g25g145g146g153g156g138g160g561 in general cash balance plans are designed so that employees who leave employment prior to normal retirement age may receive lumpsum payment of their accrued benefits at the time of termination as opposed to waiting until normal retirement age depending on how the value of the lumpsum payment is determined there may occur what is known as the whipsaw effect the basic issue arising prior to the enactment of th pension protection act is whether the lumpsum payment equals the current account balance or the present value of the accrued benefits expressed as an annuity beginning at normal retirement age 7 see generally ea zelinsky the cash balance controversy 19 v atax rev 683 70203 2000 8 campbell v bankboston 327 f3d 1 1st cir 2003 9 erisa 204b5bii irc

the present value of the accrued benefit expressed as an annuity beginning at normal retirement age this is based on the argument that erisa and the irc require that lumpsum payment of an accrued benefit in defined benefit plan be the actuarial equivalent of that benefit determined according to statutorilyprescribed interest rate and mortality assumptions11 under this argument the employees lumpsum payment in cash balance plan must be calculated by 1 projecting the hypothetical account balance to normal retirement age by adding future interest credits at the interest rate specified in the plan to the account 2 converting the balance to an annuity payable at that age and 3 determining the present value of that annuity using the statutorilyprescribed interest and mortality assumptions the lumpsum distribution is then the present value of the annuity in 1996 the irs released proposed guidance on how to compute the lumpsum payment under cash balance plan and used this method 12 the whipsaw effect arises if the interest rate used to project the account balance to normal retirement age the projection rate is higher th an the interest rate used to determine the present value of the annuity beginning at normal retirement age the discount rate in such situation the value of the lumpsum payment ie the presen t value of the annuity will be greater than the employees account balance this result will be common if it is required that the projection rate be the rate specified in the plan for the interest credits this is because many plans use an interest rate for the interest credit that is higher than the statutorilyprescribed discount rate some employers argued that since the benefits of cash balance plan are expressed as the employees hypothetical account balance the am ount in the account should be distributed as lumpsum payment in other words they claim the lumpsum distribution does not have to include the present value of the posttermination interest credits some of these employers have argued that the method outlined in the irs proposed guidance is incorrect others have followed that method but used the statutorilyprescribed discount rate as both the projection rate and the discount rate this method results in the value of the lumpsum payment equaling the current value of the employees hypothetical cash balance account prior to the pension protection act three us courts of appeals had considered the issue and all three held that erisa required plans follow the procedure described in the irs proposed guidance and use the plans interest rate as the projection rate 13 for many plans this meant that the lumpsum payment was required to be greater than the amount of the hypothetical account balance at termination the pension protection act of 2006 contains provision intended to eliminate the effects of whipsaw14 under the act cash balance plan may pay out to an employee lump sum distribution equal to the participants hypothetical account balance the act requires that the plan must use market rate of interest to calculate the lumpsum as opposed to the 30year treasury rate under prior irs guidance the whipsaw provision applies to distributions made after august 11 erisa 203e irc 411a and 417e 12 irs notice 968 19961 cb 359 feb 5 1996 13 berger v xerox corp retirement income guarantee plan 338 f3d

one method of plan conversion from traditional defined benefit plan to cash balance plan involves calculating the benefit for employees under both the traditional defined benefit plan formula as well as the cash balance formula and then providing benefits under whichever formula that yields the greater amount either on permanent or temporary basis while this greater of method has been considered favorable option for employees it has been publicized that the irs in issuing determination letters to employers who converted their plans indicated that using this twoformula method could violate rules designed to prevent an employer from backloading participants benefit accruals ie providing disproportionately higher benefit accruals to participants for later years of service than for earlier years erisa and the irc provide that defined benefit plans must satisfy one of three benefit accrual rules 16 and the regulations accompanying these rules provide that when plan has multiple benefit formulas available to participant plan must aggregate these formulas in order to determine whether one of three permissible accrual rules have been satisfied17 the irs allegedly took the position that if plan used both the traditional defined benefit plan and the cash balance plant formulas simultaneously an impermissible spike or drop in the accrual rate of participants benefits could result 18 while the pension protection act addressed plan conversions from traditional defined benefit plan to hybrid plan such as cash balance plan it did not require or prohibit any specific conversion methods however in february 2008 the treasury department and irs issued revenue ruling 2008719 which addressed how the accrual rules apply to greater of scenario under the facts of the ruling as part of conversion from traditional defined benefit plan to cash balance plan participants who met certain age and service requirements were grandfathered into the traditional defined benefit plan while other employees began participating in the new cash balance plan in its analysis plan participants were split into various groups including 1 those who were employed after the plan conversion and would only receive benefits under the new plan 2 those who received benefits under the old plan and benefits under the new plan as they did not meet the age and service requirements imposed by the plan 15 the treasury department has issued proposed regulations that would provide guidance for calculating market rate of return see 72 fed reg 73680 dec 28 2007 16 under section 204 of erisa and section 411b of the irc defined benefit plan must meet one of three benefit accrual rules the rule most applicable to cash balance plans is the 13313 rule which generally requires that later rate of accrual for one year of plan participation cannot be more than 13313 percent of the rate for any other plan year other tests include the fractional rule under which an employees accrued benefit upon separation from service is proportional to the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age finally under the 3 method participant must accrue at least 3 of the participants normal retirement benefit of which the participant would be entitled if the participant began participating in the plan at the earliest possible age and served continuously until the earlier of 1 age 65 or 2 the normal retirement age as specified under the plan up to maximum of 3313 years 17 treas reg 1411b1a1 18 one example where this result could occur is if an employee is temporarily grandfathered into the old plan once the employee is switched to the new plan there may be large drop in the benefits accrued by the employee in the year of transition see carol h jewett and felicia finston recent additions

concluded that the plan satisfied one of the three accrual rules with regard to each group of participants an important part of the rulings explanation includes the idea that while benefit formulas must be aggregated for determining whether plan meets the accrual rule s all participants in the plan do not have to satisfy the same accrual rule so long as one of the three permissible rules for each participant group is satisfied20 the ruling also provides temporary relief from plan disqualification ie loss of favorable tax status for other cash balance plans that provide greater of benefits so long as the benefits provided under each plan formula standing alone meet one of the accrual rules this temporary relief is only available to plans that have received favorable determination letter and meet certain other conditions according to the ruling plans that meet these conditions will not be considered as violating the accrual rules until january 1 2009 the treasury department and irs have issued press release indicating that they anticipate proposing amendments to the regulations dealing with the situation presented in the revenue ruling as well as other similar greater of formulas it is anticipated that the regulations will apply to plan years beginning in 2009 21 g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561
