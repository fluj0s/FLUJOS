policy implications updated october 30 2003 dana shea analyst in science and technology policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress highthreat biological agents characteristics effects and policy implications summary the anthrax mailings in 2001 which culminated in 5 deaths 22 infections and contamination of both postal and congressional buildings intensified concerns about terrorist use of biological agents this event increased congressional interest in actions to limit the vulnerability of the united states to such attacks highthreat biological agents defined by the centers for disease control and prevention as category pathogens are considered relatively easy to disseminate have high mortality and have the potential for major public health impacts highthreat biological agents cause different symptoms in their victims depending on the pathogen since the nature of these agents differs single treatment can be given in the case of biological attack as result treatment of the victims of biological attack especially one which is covert may be difficult the identification process for many pathogens may be complicated by their incubation period and the lack of distinct symptoms early in the diseases progress the difficulties in treating the various highthreat agents may place strain on the resources of the medical system especially in the case of mass casualties protection from biological agents is an area of active research and development the range of protection and detection equipment available to first responders has led to questions regarding equipment standardization and state and local preparedness development and distribution of vaccines continues to be contentious issue attempts to detect biological releases using sensor technologies or through analyzing public health data continue to be implemented but these technologies are in relatively early stages of development it is unclear whether terrorist groups are capable of effectively using biological agents as weapons of mass destruction but the relatively small amounts of pathogen that may be needed to execute significant attack is source of concern some suggest that terrorist interest in biological agents is increasing however others assert that technical difficulties would make mass casualty attacks unlikely current policies seek to reduce the proliferation of biological weapons by relying on both domestic and international controls to increase the number of countermeasures available against such pathogens through research and development activities to improve the nations ability to detect pathogen releases and to increase the ability of hospitals and care providers to treat mass casualties policymakers may be called upon to further address potential biological terrorism vulnerabilities including overseeing the use of atmospheric monitoring equipment for pathogen detection the direction of continued research and development into biological agent detectors review of further research into protective equipment prophylaxis and treatment against highthreat pathogens and assessment of

characteristics effects and policy implications introduction since the anthrax mailings of 2001 policymakers have been implementing programs to decrease the vulnerability of the united states to terrorist use of biological weapons this report discusses highthreat biological agents focusing on the centers for disease control and prevention cdc definition for category pathogens bacteria and viruses their treatment and detection current policies and possible future approaches to reducing their threat terrorist use of biological agents would be low probability but potentially high consequence event while there is still debate over whether terrorist groups have the ability to effectively use biological weapons as weapon of mass destruction the anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted their potential as terror weapon policy approaches for reducing vulnerability to biological terrorism involve both addressing biological agents as group and focusing on specific agents perceived as posing the greatest threat treatments for exposed victims vary depending on the nature of the pathogen and experience in treatment of these diseases is limited due to the rarity of naturally occurring cases what are highthreat biological agents biological agents for the purposes of this report are pathogens which can infect and cause serious illness in humans1 the level of threat biological agent may constitute is open to interpretation depending on what aspects of pathogen are considered priorities different biological agents are likely to be identified as high threat for example the national institute of justice provides an extensive list of biological agents of concern in their handbook on purchasing protective equipment23 in comparison handbooks regarding battlefield treatment of biological weapon 1 for an introduction to biological weapons see crs report rl31059 biological weapons primer by steve bowman 2 an introduction to biological agent detection equipment for emergency first responders nij guide 10100 national institute of justice december 2001 3 the nij list includes anthrax brucellosis coli o157h7 tularemia cholera diphtheria glanders melioidosis plague typhoid fever marburg virus junin virus rift valley fever virus smallpox venezuelan equine encephalitis yellow fever virus dengue fever virus ebola virus congocrimean hemorrhagic fever virus typhus q fever and rocky mountain spotted fever crs2 casualties contain shorter list of agents4 the cdc identifies number of different categories of biological agents and rank the various biological agents into categories category diseases anthrax plague smallpox tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fevers are of the highest threat5 the cdc views category pathogens as easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person resulting in high mortality rates having the potential for major public health impact potentially causing public panic and social disruption and requiring special action for public health preparedness this is in contrast to the category b agents which lack such potential6 the category pathogens will be discussed in this report anthrax bacillus anthracis anthrax is disease caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis7 bacillus anthracis responds to environmental stresses such as nutrient depletion or oxygen exposure by forming spores while the bacterium is dormant in spore form these spores are very hardy and can remain viable for decades in ideal conditions anthrax spores are primarily found in soil and are endemic to many parts of the world anthrax is primarily an animal disease infecting animals when they ingest bacillus anthracis spores during grazing anthrax is not persontoperson contagious disease the forms of anthrax infection are cutaneous intestinal and inhalation the type of anthrax infection depends on how the victim came into contact with the spores cutaneous anthrax is the most common form of the disease and occurs when anthrax spores contact broken skin intestinal anthrax occurs after consumption of anthraxsporecontaminated food usually meat intestinal anthrax is less common than cutaneous anthrax inhalation anthrax is the least common naturally occurring form of anthrax inhalation anthrax occurs when spores are inhaled and germinate in the lungs the symptoms usually appear 48 to 72 hours after exposure the effects of the three forms of the disease differ from each other drastically cutaneous anthrax is marked by swollen painless black ulcer where the infection occurred in contrast intestinal anthrax is characterized by nausea vomiting and fever followed by abdominal pain vomiting of blood and severe diarrhea inhalation anthrax manifests with symptoms resembling common cold fever fatigue and dry cough the symptoms progress to severe difficulty breathing and shock as the bacteria multiply 4 these include anthrax brucellosis melioidosis glanders plague q fever tularemia smallpox venezuelan equine encephalitis and viral hemorrhagic fevers 5 for information about the categories the cdc uses to define bioterrorism threats see httpwwwbtcdcgov 6 category b diseases include brucellosis salmonella species coli o157h7 shigella glanders melioidosis psittacosis q fever typhus fever viral encephalitis cholera and cryptosporidia 7 for summary of technical information on anthrax see httpwwwcdcgovncidoddbmddiseaseinfoanthrax_thtm crs3 the recovery rate for anthrax infection depends both on type of infection and how early treatment begins early treatment of anthrax victims is strongly suggested as late treatment is not as effective in many cases cutaneous infection typically has fatality rate of less than 5 with early treatment increasing to 20 without any treatment intestinal anthrax has higher mortality rate with fatalities ranging from 25 to 75 depending on effectiveness of treatment some medical experts assert that aggressive early treatment of intestinal anthrax will lower the fatality rate8 untreated inhalation anthrax is almost uniformly fatal with early treatment within the incubation period the fatality rate can be dramatically reduced in the aftermath of the anthrax mailings of 2001 5 of the 11 people diagnosed with inhalation anthrax died but historically greater than 90 of inhalation anthrax cases have been fatal even with treatment9 all forms of anthrax are treated with antibiotics several different antibiotics may be used including ciprofloxacin penicillin and doxycycline some anthrax strains may be less sensitive to antibiotics and therefore difficult to treat prophylaxis is available to protect against anthrax both via vaccination and post exposure antibiotic treatment while vaccine against anthrax has been licensed by the fda it is not currently available to the general public due to vaccine shortage the department of homeland security working with the department of health and human services and other federal agencies is coordinating development of civilian anthrax vaccine policy the department of defense anthrax vaccination policy and the amount of vaccine needed to implement this policy includes vaccination of troops thought to be potentially exposed to anthrax10 after the anthrax mailings of 2001 those individuals thought to be potentially exposed to anthrax spores were offered vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis using the drug ciprofloxacin plague yersinia pestis plague is disease caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis plague bacteria are sensitive to sunlight and humidity and do not form spores instead plague bacteria naturally reside in host creatures such as rodents and are found in many parts of the world including the united states plague usually travels within animal populations via insect vectors generally migrating from one animal to another through biting insects such as fleas 8 thomas v inglesby donald henderson john g bartlett et anthrax as biological weapon medical and

httpwwwanthraxosdmil crs4 the three kinds of plague are bubonic septicemic and pneumonic bubonic plague and septicemic plague occur when plague bacteria enter the body through the bite of an infected insect pneumonic plague occurs when plague bacteria are inhaled into the lungs or develops out of bubonic or septicemic infection pneumonic plague unlike the other forms does not have to pass through an insect vector it is persontoperson contagious bubonic plague is the most wellknown form it is also known as the black death and was responsible for the european plagues of the 14th century victims of bubonic plague develop swollen painfully inflamed lymph glands11 and also suffer fever headache chills and general weakness septicemic plague occurs in manner similar to bubonic plague except the swelling of the lymph glands does not occur instead the bacteria multiply in the blood causing shock and internal bleeding in addition to the more general symptoms of fever and weakness the symptoms of pneumonic plague include fever weakness and cough possibly combined with severe nausea abdominal pain diarrhea and difficulty breathing the recovery rate for treatment of the different forms of plague vary naturally occurring plague in the united states has an overall fatality rate of 14 the majority of these cases are bubonic with some septicemic and very rarely pneumonic plague the fatality rate for septicemic plague is markedly higher than that for bubonic 33 versus 11 between 1980198412 mainly ascribed to difficulties in diagnosing septicemic plague at an early stage pneumonic plague has much higher fatality rate it approaches 100 as the time between infection and treatment increases for effective treatment therapy must begin within 18 hours or victims are not likely to survive13 for untreated forms the fatality rate is 60 for bubonic plague and 100 for septicemic and pneumonic plague all forms of plague are treated using antibiotic therapy the food and drug administration has approved several antibiotics for treatment of plague and others not yet approved for such have been shown to be effective natural antibiotic resistance in plague bacteria is known so not all cases can be cured using single antibiotic14 plague vaccine has been approved for human use but its production was discontinued in 1998 because of manufacturing difficulties additionally the 11 these are called buboes and give rise to the origin of this plague forms name 12 thomas w mcgovern and arthur m friedlander plague medical aspects of chemical and biological warfare office of

limiting its utility several investigational new drug ind vaccines are under development15 smallpox variola major smallpox is disease caused by the virus variola naturally occurring variola virus has been eradicated and the only remaining legal stocks of the virus are held at secured facilities in the united states and russia16 smallpox is persontoperson contagious disease typical victims of smallpox suffer an outbreak of rash followed by scabbing pustules covering their body the rash and pustules form over three week period following an incubation time of approximately one to two weeks survivors of smallpox are generally scarred by the disease the disease has two rare variants one is known as flatpox the other hemorrhagic smallpox17 the fatality rates for the forms of the disease differ for smallpox the fatality rate is approximately 30 though in population lacking natural resistance this rate may increase both flatpox and hemorrhagic smallpox have fatality rate approaching 100 smallpox has specific treatment though vaccination after exposure may reduce the severity of the disease an approved vaccine which protects against smallpox is known but it is not available to the general public this vaccine has recently been offered to select first responders and members of the military for more information regarding the smallpox disease and vaccination see crs report rs21288 smallpox technical background on the disease and its potential role in terrorism by frank gottron and crs report rl31694 smallpox vaccine stockpile and vaccination policy by judith johnson tularemia francisella tularensis tularemia is disease caused by the bacterium francisella tularensis tularemia bacteria are fairly hardy surviving for weeks in the environment and naturally reside in host creatures such as rodents tularemia bacteria are found in many parts of the world including the united states tularemia like plague can be transferred between animals via biting insects 15 mary beth nierengarten and larry i lutwick vaccine development for plague medscape infectious diseases vol 4 2002 16 the united states maintains its store of smallpox virus at the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta russia maintains its store of smallpox virus at vector in koltsovo novosibirsk 17 another variola strain variola minor causes smallpox symptoms smallpox from variola minor tends to be much less lethal than that caused by variola major crs6 naturally occurring cases of tularemia arise from the bite of an infected insect eating contaminated food or water or breathing aerosols of bacteria18 tularemia bacteria are very infectious requiring very few bacteria to cause disease the different forms of exposure to tularemia bacteria lead to different symptoms those who ingest contaminated food or are bitten by infected insects may develop swollen and painful lymph glands and eyes sore throat or skin lesions victims exposed to aerosolized tularemia bacteria develop symptoms similar to pneumonia weakness fever aches cough and chest pain tularemia has an incubation period of 3 to 5 days after exposure the recovery rate for tularemia depends on access to proper treatment untreated tularemia has fatality rate of 60 but with proper treatment the fatality rate can be reduced to 2 tularemia can be treated using antibiotic therapy but reportedly strains of f tularensis have been successfully engineered to be antibiotic resistant19 several antibiotics are approved by the fda to treat tularemia and other antibiotics have been shown to be successful against the disease tularemia lacks an approved vaccine though several ind vaccines are undergoing testing one ind vaccine has successfully been used to protect laboratory personnel against inadvertent aerosol exposures20 viral hemorrhagic fevers viral hemorrhagic fevers are caused by viruses of the filovirus and arenavirus family these fevers include ebola and marburg21 these viruses are rarely encountered and are believed to be found in natural animal reservoirs though the exact nature of some of the reservoirs is unknown viral hemorrhagic fever viruses are not especially hardy and are generally transmitted through contaminated body fluids such as blood22 viral hemorrhagic fever symptoms depend on the exact disease but most include fever muscle aches and exhaustion severe cases of viral hemorrhagic fever 18 the united states reportedly averaged 124 cases of naturally occurring tularemia in 1999 and 2000 rare rabbit fever reported in 3 men the associated press june 25 2003 19 ken alibek biohazard the chilling true story of the largest covert biological weapons program in the world told from inside by the man who ran it new york ny random house 1999 20 mary beth nierengarten and larry i lutwick developing new tularemia vaccines medscape infectious diseases vol 4 2002 21 cdc category viral hemorrhagic fevers include the viruses which cause junin machupo guanarito lassa fever rift valley fever dengue fever ebola marburg and hantaviruses not all diseases exist solely in the hemorrhagic form for example 80 of lassa fever cases are not hemorrhagic in nature 22 cases are known of viral hemorrhagic fever infection following the eating of infected animals crs7 also involve internal bleeding or hemorrhage from the mouth eyes or ears blood loss is not the common cause of death but rather failure of internal organs the recovery rate for viral hemorrhagic fevers varies from 30 to 90 depending on the exact disease since many fevers occur in developing countries these recovery rates may not be representative of aggressive medical treatment viral hemorrhagic fevers encountered in the united states may have higher recovery rate due to more advanced supportive treatment viral hemorrhagic fevers have established treatments besides supportive care though some medications are recommended against specific diseases for example animal and clinical studies have shown that ribavirin an antiviral drug has some efficacy against lassa fever and crimeancongo hemorrhagic fever and could be used under ind status investigation into vaccines for viral hemorrhagic fevers is ongoing23 vaccines have been developed that provide protection against some with the exception of one for yellow fever these vaccines are not commercially available in the us access to these vaccines is limited and provided under ind protocols protection against biological agents protection against biological agents may be achieved through either physical or medical means personal physical measures limit exposure by protecting the eyes lungs andor skin from biological contact and preventing contact with insect vectors medical protection may be effective when the biological agent responds to drug treatment or when an available effective vaccine exists physical personal physical protection against biological agents includes masks and protective clothing protective masks filter the air inhaled by the wearer removing particles from the air the most effective filters can remove almost 100 of aerosol particles greater than one micron in size by blocking inhalation of pathogens disease is avoided protective garments in the context of biological agents are generally designed to minimize inadvertent selfcontamination with pathogen protective gloves disposable overgarments and in some cases face shields provide requisite protection from victims of contagious pathogens such personal physical protections are used by medical professionals in the treatment of victims of viral hemorrhagic fevers isolation and barrier methods 23 see for example philip cohen fastacting ebola vaccine offers hope newscientistcom august 6 2003 and nancy j sullivan et accelerated vaccination for ebola virus haemorrhagic fever in nonhuman primates nature vol 424 2003 p 681 crs8 provide medical professionals with protection from infection in extreme cases additional precautions to avoid aerosol inhalation may be required24 medical medical protection against pathogens takes two tacks one is the preexposure vaccination of populations potentially at risk for example troops in the middle east have been vaccinated against smallpox and anthrax as protection against potential military use the other is the prophylactic use of antibiotics following known exposure to pathogen this method was used after the anthrax mailings of 2001 the availability of an effective licensed vaccine is requirement for protective preexposure vaccination for the highthreat biological agents found on the cdc category listing few vaccines are available licensed vaccines exist for both anthrax and smallpox but these vaccines are not in public distribution due to national security needs anthrax vaccine is being used to innoculate military personnel and sufficient supply of vaccine has not become available to offer vaccination to the general public recently the supply of the smallpox vaccine has become such that in extremis the entire population of the united states could be vaccinated not all highthreat biological agents have licensed vaccine but some have indstage vaccines which might be used in emergency situations use of ind vaccines might be complicated by supply concerns as only small amounts of these vaccines exist prophylactic use of antibiotics is only successful against bacteria viruses are not sensitive to antibiotics and so antibiotic use will not provide protection because the treatment of many bacteria is most effective when treatment is begun at an early stage prophylactic use of antibiotics is usually recommended for those potentially exposed detection of biological agents the detection of pathogens especially in the case of covert release is complicated process when victims of release are hospitalized identification of the causal pathogen may quickly occur as the combination of symptomatic patients and ready access to large amounts of the pathogen provide much information towards its identification25 but in the instance of suspected smallscale releases identification 24 see notice to readers update management of patients with suspected viral hemorrhagic fever united states morbidity and mortality weekly vol 44 june 30 1995 pp 475479 and management of patients with suspected viral hemorrhagic fever morbidity

very difficult to determine for more information on sars see crs report rl31937 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars public health situation and us response by judith johnson and crs report rl32072 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the continued crs9 and even detection of pathogen release may be difficult biological agents are difficult to quickly detect generally requiring laboratory workup to detect and identify pathogens it may require several hours at the minimum to detect and definitively identify specific pathogens on the other hand these laboratorybased molecular biology techniques are extremely sensitive and can detect very small amounts of pathogen the methods used to detect pathogens involve analysis of the pathogens genetic sequence or enzymatic reaction scientists are working to develop faster techniques for both detection and analysis atmospheric monitoring president bush during remarks to new employees of the department of homeland security announced the establishment of the biowatch initiative26 this initiative consists of deploying early warning sensors in locations across the nation to help detect biological attacks this prototype atmospheric monitoring system is being put in place using epa air quality monitors27 the monitoring system consists of sampling equipment which collects particles present in the atmosphere the material collected is brought to laboratory setting analyzed and tested for specific pathogens in theory the laboratory results from this process could be available in as little as 12 hours28 it is reported that the laboratories which take part in the laboratory response network would be involved in performing detection and analysis of these pathogens29 research and development of further refinements of such monitoring technology is underway30 other commercial systems have been purchased and installed to detect airborne pathogens and toxins for example the city of honolulu has purchased and deployed six stationary air monitors within the island of oahu31 the us postal service is 25 continued international response by rhoda margesson and tiaji salaam 26 office of the press

mailprocessing plants nationwide to protect postal workers biological agent detectors the field detection of biological agents is usually performed with screening devices which detect specific pathogens typical screening devices use antibody tests or fast genetic tests using polymerase chain reaction pcr to provide rapid diagnostic for the presence of given biological agent antibody tests are agent specific so different biological agents require the use of different antibody tests pcr screens determine if genetic markers are present linking the test sample to known pathogen screening tests have varying sensitivity for some highly infectious pathogens the detectable concentration of pathogen may be significantly greater than the infectious dose33 consequently such field devices are not generally considered definitive tests for the absence of an agent but rather are used to confirm the presence of significant quantities of agent further development of field devices is ongoing34 subsequent to an initial screening test samples are sent to laboratories where more sensitive laboratory tests are used to ascertain the identity of any pathogen present in general samples even those that test negative through screening tests require laboratorybased confirmatory analysis the burden of this process on the public health laboratory system has been heavy35 public health monitoring monitoring the public health has emerged as potentially important method in detecting the covert release of pathogens the centers for disease control and prevention in conjunction with the department of defense the association of public health laboratories and others have upgraded the laboratory response network which connects hospitals public health laboratories and other resources to monitor 32 don oldenburg detection devices may offer an early read on the danger the washington post march 16 2003 and crs report rl31280 the us postal service response to the threat of bioterrorism through the mail by frank gottron 33 for example the public was cautioned during the time of the anthrax mailings that hand held assays for bacillus anthracis spores were not guaranteed to detect spores at the infectious dose lower limit centers for disease control and preventioncdc health advisory handheld immunoassays for detection of bacillus anthracis spores distributed via health alert network october 18 2001 34 tim starks labinabox detects chemical biological agents cq homeland security october 10 2003 35 poll conducted by the association of public health laboratories showed that during the anthrax mailings 98 of the respondents stated they required staff overtime to handle bioterrorism samples and 85 of the respondents stated bioterrorism testing negatively impacted testing of other routine samples public health laboratory issues in brief bioterrorism capacity association of public health laboratories october 2002 crs11 and track disease outbreaks36 it has been suggested that the first sign of covert pathogen release by terrorist groups may be sudden increase in the number of hospital patients exhibiting symptoms by analyzing information from such patients likely time and location of pathogen release might be discovered and consequence management plans invoked some cities have further expanded these programs by monitoring purchases related to the public health for example some cities track pharmaceutical and other medicinal sales operating on the theory that this will provide even earlier detection than hospital arrivals37 it is expected that the early identification of disease outbreak will increase the treatment success and consequently lower the fatality rate biological agents as weapons of mass destruction versus as weapons of terror the likelihood of terrorist use of biological agents as weapon of mass destruction is an area of great debate biological agents have not been used to cause mass casualties in modern times and are incapable of destroying physical infrastructure this raises questions about the claim that they would be effective weapons of mass destruction the technical feasability of terrorist groups disseminating biological agents is also open to question some believe that the techniques and technologies required for processing and disseminating biological agents are beyond the capabilities of terrorist group while others believe that terrorist groups wishing to use biological weapons could easily do so in contrast to chemical agents few biological agents are commercially available in large quantity and so are not readily available for purchase or theft on the other hand biological agents are naturally occurring and selfreplicating which may ease the difficulties of acquiring and manufacturing sizeable quantities because pathogens are selfreplicating very small amounts can cause infection large quantities are not required to cause mass casualties it has been estimated that approximately 100 lbs of anthrax spores efficiently and uniformly disseminated by airplane under ideal conditions in metropolitan area could cause 150000 casualties38 terrorist groups have shown interest in biological weapons but few examples of their successful use and none as weapon of mass destruction exist one well known example of biologicalweapon use within the united states was by the rajneeshee cult in 1984 there salmonella bacteria was disseminated through 36 executive summary on the laboratory response network centers for disease control and prevention april 17 2002 37 for

over number of weeks39 the aum shinrikyo cult also attempted to develop biological weapons while more wellknown for their chemical weapon attack in the tokyo subway system in 1995 they cultured and attempted to disseminate bacillus anthracis by aerosolizing liquid slurry of anthrax culture the anthrax disseminated was an avirulent strain and consequently casualties occurred40 whether terrorist groups would choose biological weapons is unclear some have asserted that such use would be incompatible with political goals that terrorist groups have eg formation of nationstate others claim that new stage of superterrorism has begun with the attacks of september 11th being indicative of greater willingness of terrorist groups to intentionally cause mass casualties for more information on the motivation of terrorist groups with respect to biological and chemical weapons see crs report rl31831 terrorist motivations for chemical and biological weapons use placing the threat in context by audrey kurth cronin weapons of terror in contrast to weapons of mass destruction may cause few casualties but rather instill panic because of frightening aspects of their use some argue that the use of biological agents as weapons of terror would require little infrastructure and be an effective use of even limited supplies of pathogen they claim that release of small amounts of biological agent might cause level of panic disproportionate to the actual amount released and point to the anxieties raised after the mailings of the anthrax letters of 2001 as emblematic of the type of response that can be generated by smallscale use of biological weapons others assert that the significant investment of time money and trained personnel which would be required to develop even small amounts of pathogen provides serious disincentive to terrorist groups they state that terrorist groups are much more likely to use conventional weapons than any weapon of mass destruction the anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted the vulnerability of the united states to biological attack and reignited public interest in bioterrorism and domestic preparedness series of letters containing freezedried anthrax of varying coarseness were sent through the us postal service to two us senators and two news outlets the anthrax spores contaminated postal equipment during mail processing and subsequently infected postal workers with inhalation anthrax questions regarding the identity of the mailer the motivations of the mailer and the origin of the anthrax spores remain unanswered for more information on the

weapons is combination of nation state level controls increased domestic regulation and accelerated research and development of medicines vaccines and detectors additionally professional societies have increased selfmonitoring actions export control the united states maintains export policies with respect to selected pathogens and biological dualuse equipment primarily through the multilateral australia group and the wassenaar arrangement us export controls aimed at creating proliferation barriers include export administration regulations and international traffic in arms regulations41 these export controls are designed to inhibit nation state level acquisition and proliferation of biological weapons because of the commercial ubiquity of equipment potentially capable of producing biological weapons experts consider it difficult to block terrorist groups from developing small scale production capability solely through export controls42 increased domestic regulation use possession and transfer of highthreat biological agents is now increasingly regulated due to the usa patriot act pl 10756 and the bioterrorism preparedness and response act pl 10718843 only persons with bona fide need for them are allowed to possess or use biological agents on the select agent list44 additionally university researchers experimenting on select agent pathogens are required to pass background check by the fbi45 individuals who are citizens of the countries formally declared as sponsors of terrorism are not allowed access to these pathogens 41 export administration regulations

research includes discovery of new vaccines and treatments research into countermeasures against biological weapons as well as research into more fundamental basic science such as pathogen genetics and the origins of virulence the national institutes of health administers the bulk of the department of health and human services biomedical research funding while the darpa biological warfare defense program and the joint service chemical and biological defense program is funded by the department of defense development of biological countermeasures and efforts to reduce the impact of biological terror attack is performed through the department of homeland securitys directorate of science and technology as well federal research on highthreat pathogens is performed at the us army medical research institute of infectious diseases laboratory at fort detrick maryland and the centers for disease control and prevention laboratory in atlanta georgia increasing detector accuracy and sensitivity detecting and identifying pathogens is an area of continued research the ability of first responders to identify biological agents when first encountering them is key to identifying appropriate treatment for victims sensitive rapid detection systems are under development in the private sector as well as the department of energys national laboratories new detectors based on different detection methods are being investigated to ascertain their capabilities the military while already possessing large platformbased detection capabilities is developing new detection system

biological agent identification and diagnostic system jbaids which will allow for fast portable detection of biological agents miniaturization in concert with the need for more sensitive accurate detectors reducing the size of such detectors is also an area of current research technologies currently employed for analyzing the atmosphere for pathogens tend to be large and complex the goal of compact ideally easily portable detector system drives research efforts in detector miniaturization the national science foundation the department of energy and the department of defense have all funded programs to develop smaller handheld instruments to detect biological pathogens in the environment better understanding of diffusion of biological releases understanding how an aerosol release might travel is another area where research occurs computer modeling of aerosol properties wind flow in urban settings and within buildings and the effects of initial conditions on final particle distribution all may lead to more effective incident response and consequence management the department of health and human services uses such modeling in its emergency response command center to help develop and prioritize response to chemical or biological release48 research in this area is conducted at the national laboratories among other places decontamination after the anthrax mailings the hart senate office building required extensive decontamination to remove the residual anthrax spores methods for decontaminating office buildings have not been widely tested and decontamination of the hart building using chlorine dioxide cost an estimated 42 million the cleanup of the contaminated brentwood facility in washington dc and the hamilton township new jersey facility is reportedly expected to cost over 150 million49 research is underway to develop less costly methods of decontaminating areas from biological agents and to assess the effectiveness of current decontamination methods scientific publication the federal government has historically supported the open publication of federally funded research results but series of research publications in molecular biology have increased concerns over whether publication of certain federally funded extramural research results could threaten national security because of their possible usefulness to terrorist groups some have suggested that federally funded extramural research results should be reviewed for their security implications prior to their publication in the open literature while others have asserted that such review would be damaging to scientific progress and productivity if such review is deemed necessary an open question remains as to who would review these research results and at what point in the research process they would be reviewed some publishers 48 tamara lytle health official debuts hightech center orlando sentinel march 12 2003 49 stephen losey usps mail center safe to reopen after

included additional funding from the cdc for the development of bioterror response plans and increasing the preparedness of hospitals and other facilities for bioterror casualties additionally the national strategic stockpile formerly called the national pharmaceutical stockpile has been expanded to contain antibiotics medical treatments and antidotes50 while there are still critics of the

development topic of potential interest to policymakers is oversight of the federal governments development of biological countermeasures such countermeasures include but are not limited to new detectors treatments medical prophylaxis and physical protection from biological agents while the department of health and human services has been designated the lead agency in providing bioterrorism research and development the department of homeland security has been given role in setting priorities in fy2004 budget 266 million has been appropriated for dhs science and technology directorates biological countermeasures programs how the department of homeland security will assist in setting priorities for hhs research and how the new homeland security advanced research projects agency hsarpa will prioritize research it funds are not currently well understood because highthreat biological agents include both viral and bacterial agents single treatment will not be successful against all illnesses some have suggested that research into new antiviral and antibiotic compounds for use against biological agents might provide additional health benefits as these compounds may prove to be effective medications for other more common illnesses because of the shortage of licensed vaccines for many highthreat pathogens development of new vaccines has been an area of congressional interest the lack of civilian market for biological weapon vaccines has inhibited private sector investment and production of these products since the natural incidence of disease from biologicalweapon pathogens is rare and disease form is often different than that expected to result from bioterror attack there has been little impetus to develop and market these vaccines some have suggested that the federal government should take role in providing research incentives and guaranteed market for any vaccines against biological weapons variety of mechanisms have been suggested including expedited drug approval processes tax incentives liability protections and expanded procurement practices form of expedited drug approval has already been implemented by the fda for drugs involved in biodefense it requires fewer animal studies before approval is given for human use59 for more information on federal vaccine policies see crs report rl31793 vaccine policy issues for the

information on project bioshield see crs report rs21507 project bioshield by frank gottron detection of biological release the deployment of the biowatch prototype biological agent detector has raised questions about how this system will be used such monitoring system for covert releases of biological agents may provide important early notification of potential danger since many pathogens have an incubation period of several days it is often difficult to begin treatment at an early stage early treatment of the inhalation form of these diseases is essential to recovery and system that signaled pathogen release before the appearance of symptoms in victims would be likely to increase the ability of victims to receive medication and survive by employing an array of such sampling devices citywide network might detect pathogen releases in smaller amount and also aid in determining the epicenter of release such information may be important to identify the perpetrators of such an attack since the biowatch detectors are coupled to epa air quality monitors the locations are determined by air quality considerations and it is not readily apparent that these locations will provide adequate sampling of populated areas if the air quality monitor is located well above street level it may not detect the release of biological agents at street level additionally the effectiveness of these detectors in identifying small releases or indoor release of biological agents is not established and so placement of these detectors may provide false sense of security such detection system may also detect naturally occurring biological agents which are not virulent for example anthrax spores naturally occur in some areas of the united states and may provide false indications of smallscale covert release the continued cost of these detectors reported at 1 million per detector per year is also of concern an unknown aspect of the biowatch program is the range of detector coverage it has been reported that each metropolitan area chosen will have 10 to 12 distinct detectors built into different air quality monitors also reported goal of this program is to provide detection for 80 of the american population by geographic distribution60 since the epa air quality monitors are not evenly spread throughout the various geographic areas of the country it is not apparent whether the biowatch program will be expanded to other sorts of monitoring stations biological detectors development and production of easily portable or handheld biological detection apparatus is another area where pressing need has been identified antibody tests and methods using recognition of pathogen genetic sequences only detect specific pathogens unexpected pathogens either rare or genetically modified may elude current detection equipment consequently policymakers may decide to direct 60 biowatch program aims for nationwide detection of airborne pathogens cidrap news feb 26 2003 revised march 10 2003 found online at httpwwwcidrapumneducidrapcontentbtbioprepnewsbiowatchhtml crs20 funding towards development of either broad assortment of inexpensive testing equipment or expanding the range of pathogens given device can detect as more pathogenspecific detectors become available the cost of testing per incident may increase as more pathogens are potentially screened but may decrease as more detectors are manufactured and distributed monitoring public health policymakers may choose to address current methods of detecting bioterror events tracking potential bioterror releases through monitoring hospital admissions and physician reports may indeed detect covert pathogen release but such an approach requires that individuals first fall ill from the pathogen release critics claim that in the case of contagious pathogen such as pneumonic plague or smallpox the spread of the disease will occur at rate greater than the government response as there will be time delay due to the incubation period of the disease thus there will be an expanding number of people being infected even as public health workers attempt to determine the epicenter of the release such an argument has been made especially in the case of smallpox as treatment for smallpox once symptoms have begun to appear is unavailable in the smallpox case the debate over which vaccination method should be used the ring vaccination model based on identifying the initial outbreak of the disease and then vaccinating contacts of the victims of the initial outbreak or the mass vaccination model where people in geographic area are innoculated if smallpox is detected has been very lively advocates of establishing sensors to detect pathogen releases before victims begin to seek treatment claim that the earlier the detection of an outbreak the more effective treatment will be others have asserted that the current model will be effective in limiting casualties from pathogen release they claim that increases in the public health infrastructure have reduced the likelihood that hospitals and careproviders would be overwhelmed by bioterror event while not rejecting the utility of developing other detection devices to warn of covert pathogen release some scientists modeling pathogen releases have stated that even reducing detection times from 48 to 6 hours after release would not reduce overall casualties as much as an effective efficient public health response and treatment61 first responder equipment the amount of funds the federal government should provide to first responders and whether all first responders should have standardized equipment is topic of congressional interest62 first responder equipment is currently not nationally standardized with each jurisdiction purchasing its own equipment some first 61 amanda onion calculating the unthinkable new model suggests faster methods needed to deliver antianthrax meds abc newscom

responders to terrorism seek federal strategy equipment global security newswire march 6 2002 crs21 responder teams feel wellequipped and prepared for potential biological attack while others do not yet have necessary equipment63 while the national institute of justice has provided manual outlining the criteria by which biological equipment might be assessed64 some first responders have claimed that the federal government has not provided enough oversight and direction regarding such esoteric purchases65 advocates of allowing each community to choose what equipment to provide to first responders point out that the needs of one community may not be the same as the next and because of location population or previous expenditures mandating specific equipment purchases may not meet specific locality needs66 the department of homeland security is slated to develop standards program to develop test and evaluation criteria and conduct analyses for first responder detection equipment to help provide more guidance for first responder purchases policymakers may ultimately determine the adequacy of current first responder equipment and its availability the amount of funds that first responders should receive to purchase protective equipment whether proper guidance has been given by the federal government to state and local authorities regarding this equipment and what steps may be required through oversight or legislation to properly equip first responders federal emergency response teams the use of federal response teams to augment local first responder capabilities has been questioned while an investigation by the general accounting office in 2000 found that federal response teams do not duplicate one another67 there have been concerns that the varied teams established by these agencies may be redundant68 also the general structure of establishing regional teams has been questioned since there would be delay in response due to required travel time for team69 on the other hand others have advocated that parallel civilian and military response teams may be necessary since military teams might not be available to civilians during
