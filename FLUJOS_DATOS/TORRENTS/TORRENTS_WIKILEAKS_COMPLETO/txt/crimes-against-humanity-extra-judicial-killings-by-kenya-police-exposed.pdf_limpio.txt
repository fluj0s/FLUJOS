ȱȱ ȱ3ȱ chapter one background to the investigations 1 the kenya national commission on human rights knchr has since july 2007 been investigating comp laints in respect of alleged executions and disappearance of persons attr ibuted to the kenya police 2 pursuant thereto on 51107 the kn chr released preliminary report indicating that the kenya police could have been complicit in extrajudicial executions of close to 500 people between june and october 2007 and the bodies deposited in various mortuaries in the country some left in the wild and others dumped in various locations such as forests desolate farms rivers and dams 3 this report was transmitted to the pres ident of the republic of kenya he mwai kibaki and made available to all the relevant government departments asking that the concerned authoritie s act on its findings the knchr was therefore surprised that instead of acknowledging the gravity of the issues raised in the report the police commissioner maj general hussein ali reacted by calling the kn chr meaningless busybody which had engaged in baseless accusations against the polic and further accused the knchr of lacking expertise in carrying out in vestigations the police commissioner also challenged the knchr to provide any evidence to thes rather infantile accusations subsequently the kenya police issued its official rejoinder to the knchr report the police rejoinder d oes not deny the fact of the deaths but merely states that inques t files have been opened 4 b t h t s i t m t h k n c h r p r c ded with further investigations to complete its report and the ensuing findings confirm the substance of the preliminary report and reveal egregio us violations of the law and fundamental human rights by the kenya police in dealing with suspected mungiki members and other alleged criminals 5 while the knchr in way condones the at rocities attributed to mungiki and other illegal gangs see annex 1 for background on the mungiki movement it condemns the use of extrajudicial killing of suspected members as strategy to deal with t he illegal group methods attributed to the police and chronicled in this report amount to serious violation of human ȱ ȱthe ȱcry ȱofȱblood ȱreport ȱon ȱextra ȭjudicial ȱkillings ȱand ȱdisappearances ȱȱseptember ȱ2008 ȱȱ ȱ4ȱ rights especially the right to life and t he right to fair trial before court of law 6 the knchr continues to receive an arming number of complaints of ongoing disappearances and extrajudicial killings attributed to the police and urges the government to urgently intervene to stop these human rights violations methodology 7 knchr placed an advert on 221007 in both print and electronic media calling on relatives of missing victi ms and other kenyans with relevant information to come forw ard and record statements as result knchr received over three hundred petiti ons from various sources including relatives of persons who have either disappeared or been found dead after they were arrested by people alleged to be police officers attached to the kwekwe squad and other specialized police units refer to annex 3 8 the knchr also conducted visits to nu merous mortuaries that included nairobi city mortuary naivasha distric t hospital mortuary nanyuki district hospital mortuary machakos district hospital mortuary nakuru provincial hospital mortuary nakuru municipal mortuary nyeri provincial hospital mortuary karatina district hospital mortuary muranga district hospital mortuary kerugoya district hospital mortuary and naivasha district hospital mortuary 9 factfinding visits were conducted to va rious locations across the country after receiving information that dead bodi had been discovered the locations included ngong magadi kiserian kangudo karura kieni forest nanyuki suswa and athi river 10 given the apparent complicity and he nce reluctance by the police to investigate this matter the knchr will be seeking intervention from the office of the high commissioner for hum an rights the special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions and other specialized agencies within the united nations to fully invest igate these allegations summary of key findings 11 some of the key findings drawn from the knchrs investigations are that the evidence gathered by t he knchr establishes patterns of conduct by the kenya police that may constitute crimes against humanity ȱ ȱthe ȱcry ȱofȱblood ȱreport ȱon ȱextra ȭjudicial ȱkillings ȱand ȱdisappearances ȱȱseptember ȱ2008 ȱȱ ȱ5ȱ b that extrajudicial executions and other brutal acts of extreme cruelty have been perpetrated by the police against socalled mungiki adherents and that these acts may have been committed pursuant to official policy sanctioned by the political leadership the police commissioner and top police commanders c that whereas initially the police mainly used firearms to execute the suspects they subsequently changed their modus operandi and have since been using such methods as st rangulation drowning mutilation and bludgeoning the change of stra tegy was to make members of the public believe that rival mungiki ga ngs are responsible for the killings as such the cause of death for majo rity of the latest victims has been blunt trauma strangulation drowning or mutilation using sharp objects as illustrated by postmortem reports attached hereinafter refer to annex 4 several witnesses told the knchr that the killer squads carry machetes iron bars ropes and other crude weapons in their vehicles d that the police spokesperson mr eric kiraithe has on several occasions attributed the wave of k illings to rival mungiki gangs he claims that there is schism with in the mungiki movement pitting maina njenga and ndura waruinge this may be ploy to divert public attention and conceal the grotesque illegal conduct of the police that the disappearances and extra judicial killings heightened following public statements made by top government officials suggesting an official policy to ru thlessly deal with suspected mungiki members and other criminals durin g madaraka day celebrations on june 1 2007 president mwai kibaki wa rned that mungiki sect members should expect mercy two days later on june 3 2007 about three hundred suspected mungiki member s were arrested and at least twenty killed when they were reported ly caught administering oaths

making the admission which was transmitted live g that these acts were ordered dire cted or coordinated by the top leadership of the kenya police acti ng jointly with common purpose h that by the time of compiling this report the knchr had compiled at least three hundred names of persons who have either been killed or disappeared additionally there are at least two hundred other persons whose identity the knchr was unable to establish since they were merely booked in mortuaries as unknown many of these bodies were subsequently disposed by the respective mortuary authorities after they remained unclaimed by their relatives for long i that the knchr continues to rece ive complaints from families of persons who have disappeared in cluding allegations of people arrested by police and who have not been heard of since the date of arrest or where persons arrested by police have later turned up dead in mortuaries j that the kenya police appears responsible for the abduction and killing of kimani ruo who was arrested outside nairobi law courts in june 2007 moments after he was acquitted by the court for charges of being member of mungiki k that the police may be involved in an extortion racket where they arrest individuals and demand for m oney from their rela tives to secure their release the knchr has success fully intervened on number of occasions and secured the release of individuals held by the police key recommendations formal inquiry be instituted into the role of police officers implicated with regard to the regime of pparent torture and extra judicial executions the knchr wishes to re mind the government that the prohibition against torture and ot her cruel inhumane and degrading treatment is nonderogable and that t he government must act to stop the torture and killing of suspects alle gedly involved in mungiki and or violent criminal activities and hold perpetrators to account b the knchr recommends under section 25 of the knchr act that the attorney general institute impartial inve stigations into these allegations to secure credible investigations ȱ ȱthe ȱcry ȱofȱblood ȱreport ȱon ȱextra ȭjudicial ȱkillings ȱand ȱdisappearances ȱȱseptember ȱ2008 ȱȱ ȱ7ȱ c given that the substance of this repo rt points to the police as the organ responsible for the violations enumera ted institution of impartial and credible investigations into thes allegations is paramount since obviously the police cannot be the juror prosecutor judge and executioner in their own case the knchr also expect s that the resultant findings from this inquiry will be made public d the knchr calls on the government to take responsibility for preventing further violence in the country and monstrate commitment to the rule of law which ensures the respect fo r human rights in combating crime parliament should urgently review all legislation touching on the kenya police and other security ctor agencies to ensure th at they are guided by law and their actions do not trample unde rfoot civil liberties in the name of maintaining law and order knchr calls for total reform of the kenya police force further the knchr welcomes the newly established police oversight board whose mandate is to receive and evaluate complaints against the police f parliament should urgently enact legi slation delinking the investigation function of the police from that of pros ecution which is and should be the preserve of the attorney general as th is report reveals the police should not be investigators and prosecutor s particularly given the numerous opportunities for collecting rents that this entails g these allegations are especially serio us since they would constitute crimes against humanity given their widespread and systematic nature crimes against humanity have been defined under the international criminal court icc statute as any of the following acts when committed as part of widespread or systematic attack directed against any
