september 19 2005 jean hearne specialist in social legislation domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress medicaid eligibility for adults and children summary medicaid is meanstested entitlement program that is largely designed and administered by states under broad federal rules the programs are jointly financed by federal and state funds federal contributions to each state are based on states willingness to finance covered medical services and matching formula the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms within the us department of health and human services hhs is responsible for federal oversight of the program in fy2003 preliminary federal and state spending on medicaid reached 2755 billion exceeding medicare payments net of premiums by over 15 billion medicaid coverage for nonelderly nondisabled adults and children is provided to people who qualify through number of pathways some of which are required under federal law others are optional for states state programs are required to provide coverage to families based on welfare program rules in effect in 1996 coverage for children goes beyond those often very low financial criteria through combination of other mandatory and optional pathways low income pregnant women can also receive medicaid coverage through both mandatory and optional pathways in addition number of other optional pathways exist for special groups of people who are not considered disabled because they do not have disability as defined under the supplemental security income ssi program rules some of those groups include for example certain women with breast or cervical cancer uninsured individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis people who become impoverished by their medical costs and certain immigrants variation across the statebased programs is the rule income eligibility levels and services covered vary and the method for and amount of reimbursement for services differ from state to state medicaid is targeted to individuals with low income but not all of the poor are eligible and not all of those who are covered are poor for medicaidcovered children and families primary and acute care is often delivered through managed care organizations while elderly enrollees and those with disabilities more often obtain such care on feeforservice basis in recent years more and more states have implemented variety of major program changes using special waiver authority this report describes federal medicaid eligibility rules for children and adults but does not address eligibility pathways for individuals qualifying on the basis of having disability or for persons who are age 65 and over this report is one of number of crs reports on medicaid and will be updated

medicaid law defines over 50 distinct population groups as being potentially eligible for states programs some groups are mandatory meaning that federal law requires all states and the district of columbia that participate in medicaid to cover them other groups are optional that is federal law allows states to choose to cover them1 categories of eligible populations are found primarily in section 1902a10 of the social security act prior to the 1980s medicaid eligibility was limited to poor families with dependent children poor elderly and individuals with disabilities receiving supplemental security income2 these groups are known as medicaids traditional categorical groups and the medically needy almost all pathways were tied to the receipt of welfare payments but beginning in the 1980s additional eligibility pathways were added to the medicaid statute to provide for the coverage of additional lowincome children and pregnant women as well as other elderly and individuals with disabilities most recently states were given options to provide medicaid to additional select groups including certain women with breast or cervical cancer uninsured individuals with tuberculosis and working individuals with disabilities not all groups of medicaid beneficiaries receive the same set of benefits to understand more about the benefits offered under medicaid see crs report rl32277 how medicaid works program basics by herz et medicaid programs have few federally required coverage groups for adults who do not have disability groups that states must cover are very lowincome adults in families meeting welfare program rules in effect in 1996 and temporarily those whose earnings rise above those levels due to increased work income3 and pregnant women with income at or below 133 of the federal poverty level the mandatory routes to medicaid are more numerous for children all children whose families 1 all 50 states and the district of columbia have medicaid programs in addition five commonwealths and territories have medicaid programs although those programs do not operate under the same set of rules for eligibility and benefits as the states and dc in addition territories programs are funded through matching payments up to ceiling 2 the ssi program provides monthly cash welfare benefits to individuals who are aged blind or disabled and whose income and resources fall below certain thresholds federal medicaid law requires states to provide medicaid to most individuals who receive ssi benefits for more information on the ssi program see crs report 94486 epw supplemental security income ssi fact sheet by april grady 3 transitional medical assistance is more fully described later in this report crs2 have income below the federal poverty level fpl4 must be covered but younger children and in some states older children are covered at much higher income levels through both optional coverage groups and through other mechanisms that make the programs more generous table 1 summarizes the major medicaid pathways for adults and children excluding those based on disability status each of those pathways is described in more detail in the pages to follow medicaid eligibility is twotiered process to qualify first individuals must be member of one of medicaids categorical groups the major categorical groups include members of families with children aged blind or disabled individuals and pregnant women there are number of additional optional coverage pathways once it is determined that an individual meets the categorical restrictions financial tests are applied each eligibility pathway includes its own income and resource restrictions the specific limitations that apply to each eligibility group are set through combination of federal parameters and state definitions consequently those standards vary considerably among states table 1 major medicaid eligibility pathways for adults and children mandatory coverage optional coverage lowincome

qualifying under research and demonstration waivers certain immigrants sources title xix of the social security act pl 74271 and medicaid eligibility for families and children kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured sept 1998 by schneider k fennel and p long medicaid coverage for families lowincome families can qualify for medicaid coverage through four major pathways all of which are described below in more detail the first two pathways section 1931 coverage and transitional medical assistance are explicitly for families the remaining two pathways medically needy coverage and coverage under section 1115 research and demonstration waivers can be applied by states to other groups in addition to families in addition there are several other pathways covering smaller groups of mostly children they are described below in the section other afdcrelated groups the four major pathways for families include section 1931 of the medicaid statute covers families whose income and resources are low enough to have qualified for cash welfare payments under the former aid to families with dependent children afdc program rules transitional medical assistance tma extends coverage on timelimited basis to families that would otherwise lose medicaid due to increased earnings or other income the optional medically needy program covers families andor individuals whose income is just above the section 1931 thresholds or whose medical expenses when subtracted from income impoverish them5 and demonstration projects conducted by states and approved under section 1115c of the social security act6 cover some families andor individuals 5 the medically needy pathway is also an important coverage group for the elderly and people with disabilities for more information on coverage under medically needy for the elderly and people with disabilities see crs report rl31413 medicaid eligibility for the aged and disabled by julie stone 6 section 1115c of the social security act provides authority for states to waive number of provisions of medicaid statute for the purpose of conducting research and demonstrations as long as those projects are consistent with the purpose of title xix in many states this authority has been used to undertake major program changes rather than to conduct time limited demonstrations for research purposes crs4 family coverage under section 1931 medicaids section 1931 preserves medicaid entitlement for individuals who meet the requirements of the former afdc programs that were in effect before welfare reform this eligibility pathway was created as part of the reforms in 1996 before 1996 all recipients of the afdc program were automatically eligible for medicaid coverage the 1996 reforms replaced the afdc program with new program temporary assistance for needy families tanf at the same time the section 1931 coverage group was established within medicaid to ensure that low income families would not lose medicaid as result of the reforms of the cash assistance programs under section 1931 states must ensure that at minimum income and resources standards and methodologies for lowincome families are more restrictive than those in effect in 1988 specifically section 1931 allows states to 1 reduce income standards below those in effect in 1996 but they cannot be lower than those used on may 1 1988 2 increase income and resource standards for any period after 1996 but by more than the percentage increase in the consumer price index cpi for the same period and 3 use less restrictive methods for counting income and resources than those in effect on july 16 1996 this last provision affords states the flexibility to make family coverage under section 1931 more generous by disregarding various amounts of income or types of assets when compared against the 1996 standards the afdc program in place in 1996 was similar to medicaid in that states administered the program under broad federal guidelines states determined eligibility and benefit levels based on need standards payment standards and maximum payments number of the rules for counting income and resources for the former afdc program remain in effect in many states today for determining eligibility for medicaid under section 1931 some of those welfare program rules included when determining financial eligibility states were required to compare the familys income to gross income limit set at 185 of the states chosen need standard states were to disregard certain amounts of income standard allowance of 90 per month the first 30 of earnings during the first 12 months of enrollment and onethird of remaining earning during the first four months of enrollment when counting resources states were required to compare the value of all resources against federal upper limit of 1000 and states were to exclude the familys home and the equity value of car up to 1500 or lower state limit table 2 displays the income standards used to determine financial eligibility for families under section 1931 expressed as percentage of 2002 poverty levels column 3 these percentages are compared with the percentages used for afdc eligibility in 1996 in column 2 these percentages serve as the floor for states under the provisions of section 1931 in addition the maximum percentages available to families through other eligibility pathways higher threshold for crs5 families are shown in column 4 most states have extended the generosity of medicaids coverage of families since 1996 often using the 1931 pathway some states use other means to extend medicaids coverage for families there are few caveats that must be considered in evaluating the information in table 2 most states use complex combination of counting and disregarding various forms of income putting those amounts together to determine single income standard relative to poverty can introduce some error this difference may result in percentages in two columns that are close to each other but actually reflect the same standards for example in alabama the afdc standard relative to poverty was calculated to be at 15 in 1996 currently crs calculates the 1931 standard to be at approximately 20 of poverty this five percentage point difference may not reflect policy changes in the state of alabama increasing the level of generosity of the program but rather may be due to calculating errors introduced because of the complexity of states income counting rules table 2 afdc 1996 income standard section 1931 income ceiling in 2002 and higher thresholds

thresholds are authorized under research and demonstration waiver projects defined in section 1115 of the social security act d in arizona and massachusetts section 1931 eligibility is subsumed under the research and demonstration waiver eligibility groups michigan and new york reported different income standards for different counties after family is initially determined to be eligible for medicaid states may conduct redeterminations at intervals that are longer than 12 months unless families report rising income or earnings to state agencies they would remain eligible until the next redetermination most states conduct redeterminations for section crs7 1931eligible families at 12month intervals smaller number of states use shorter periods for redetermining eligibility see table 3 for redetermination periods counting income the medicaid program is often criticized for being administratively complex and having confusing rules the income eligibility rules for families qualifying under section 1931 contribute to that impression as described above states have limited flexibility to reduce or increase income standards but they have considerably more flexibility in the way that countable income is defined by excluding certain types of income from their definitions of countable income states can effectively raise the generosity of the eligibility pathway without explicitly raising the income standards states are required to disregard certain amounts and types of income when determining eligibility because those income disregards were part of the income counting methods in place in 1996 in almost all states that means that the first 50 of child support payments is disregarded or not counted for the purpose of determining medicaid eligibility in addition certain portions of familys earned income is not counted and the portion is disregarded in decreasing amounts over time during the first four months of employment 120 plus onethird of remaining earnings per month are not counted after four months of enrollment 120 per month of earnings are disregarded finally after family is on the program for 12 months 90 of earnings per month are disregarded the earned income disregards are intended to lessen the immediate impact of the transition to work many states also disregard child care allowance of 175 per month per child over age two and 200 per month for children under age two in addition to these minimum income disregards many states have used the additional flexibility to define countable income to make this pathway considerably more generous than under the former afdc program rules table 3 shows the earned income disregards and the redetermination periods for section 1931 families in 2002 in 2002 18 states used more generous earned income disregards than the 9030onethird rules in place under 1996 and described above survey conducted by the center on budget and policies priorities found that almost all states liberalized their standards by implementing either more generous earned income disregards or by eliminating various income and assets rules the center also found that states are known to have reduced income standards below those

eligibility practices conducted by george washington university center for health services research and policy for crs notes effective november 1 2003 b on july 1 2003 changes to six months contributing to the seeming impenetrability of the medicaid rules many states continue to count income using 1996 welfare program rules in addition to their new more generous income counting methods fictional example of this is the case of state state has new income counting rule under section 1931 that disregards all income between the former afdc level and 100 of the federal poverty level but state continues to apply the 9030onethird rule from the former afdc program along with the new rule that allows considerably greater amounts of income to be disregarded for the purposes of determining eligibility under section 1931 this illogical combination of income counting methods is conducted simply because it allows the state to prove to cms that the section 1931 eligibility pathway is meeting the statutory purpose of ensuring that anyone who would have qualified for the former afdc program is still able to obtain medicaid the generosity of the new rules would most assuredly include at least those qualifying under the old and less generous rules nonetheless some states are hesitant to abandon those calculations for fear of being found to be out of compliance with requirements that ensure that those who were eligible under 1996 welfare program rules would be eligible under section 1931 second example of how the rules of section 1931 contribute to administrative complexity without clearly benefitting recipients is the fact that states generally conduct redeterminations for this population on an annual basis so disregards intended for use after four and nine months of enrollment are rarely used except when an enrollee selfreports an income change triggering redetermination before 12 months has elapsed counting assets under section 1931 states can apply an assets test as long as it is more restrictive than the test in effect in 1996 states can also under rule number three above use less restrictive methods for counting assets this has been interpreted in some states and by cms as allowing for assets test for the section 1931 eligibility pathway dropping assets tests has number of major benefits for states and for enrollees it simplifies the onerous eligibility determination process considerably in addition it removes significant barrier to access to health care for people at the bottom of the income scale in 2002 19 states had assets tests for crs10 section 1931 families other states had liberalized their assets rules only 10 states8 imposed stringent assets standard in those states in 2002 families with 1000 or more in assets were unable to qualify for medicaid other eligibility rules for families qualifying under section 1931 number of other eligibility rules are applicable for families seeking medicaid under section1931 some remain as vestiges of the afdc program ended almost 10 years ago gross income standard about half of the states report imposing gross income standard this is an income test that is applied before any income is disregarded or alternative methodologies for counting income are used it is the sum of the total countable gross monthly earned income of all family members and the total countable monthly unearned income of family members the family is able to proceed to the eligibility determination process only if its gross income is at most certain percentage of the selected standard often between 133 and 185 of the federal poverty level 100hour work rule many states continue to require that employed parents in twoparent families work fewer than 100hours per month to qualify under section 1931 this 100hour rule was originally established by the secretary as standard for determining whether family meets the deprivation requirement for the former afdc program in order for family to qualify for assistance under the old programs rules its children had to be deprived of parental support or care due to the death absence incapacity or unemployment of parent twoparent families generally qualified only under the unemployment criterion which was narrowly defined in the afdc regulations forty one states responding to the crs funded survey confirmed that they continue to impose 100hour limit on work hours for working families the rule remains popular even though regulations posted by cms in 1998 then called the health care financing administration hcfa removed this 100hour limitation the regulation allows states to adopt more flexible definitions of unemployment to align their tanf foster care and medicaid programs and to simplify administration under the revised rule states are not allowed to define unemployment in any way that is more restrictive than the definition of unemployment that existed when the rule was first published certain individuals qualifying under the section 1931 pathway may be denied medicaid coverage if they refuse to cooperate with states tanf work requirements states are permitted to deny medicaid benefits to nonpregnant adults and heads of households who lose tanf benefits because of refusal to work but must continue to provide medicaid coverage to their children enrollment in 2002 about 106 million family members were reported by states to have qualified for medicaid through the section 1931 pathway that included about 36 million adults and 71 million children section 1931 eligibles as 8 alabama arkansas georgia idaho indiana kentucky new

datamart on august 3 2005 note includes annual unduplicated eligibles reported as receiving cash transitional medical assistance transitional medical assistance tma was established prior to the 1996 welfare reforms to address the concern that individuals receiving afdc payments would be discouraged from seeking work or would turn down work opportunities for fear of losing medicaid the tma provisions require states to continue providing medicaid to members of families who would otherwise have lost such assistance due to increased work hours increased earnings of the caretaker relative or the loss of one of the timelimited earned income disregards there are several tma requirements in statute today the tma provision that is currently in effect requires states to provide an additional six months of medicaid coverage to families who were receiving medicaid under section 1931 in at least three of the last six months should income rise for any of the above reasons in addition states are required to extend medicaid coverage for second six months to families who were covered during the entire first sixmonth tma period and whose earnings are below 185 of poverty these tma provisions are due to sunset at the end of september 2005 although this date has been repeatedly extended if these provisions were to expire separate tma provisions would become effective under the older and permanent tma provisions medicaid would be required to be extended for families who would otherwise lose coverage due to the above reasons for period of four months families eligible for this fourmonth extension must have been receiving medicaid under section 1931 in at least three of the preceding six months9 9 for more information about tma see crs report rl31698 transitional medical assistance tma under medicaid by april grady crs13 other afdcrelated groups while the afdc program longer exists number of medicaid eligibility groups remain tied to states former afdc rules recipients of adoption assistance and foster care who are under age 18 and eligible for title ive of the social security act states are required to provide medicaid to recipients of adoption assistance and foster care assistance who are under age 18 and enrolled under title ive of the social security act former foster care recipients who are ages 18 19 or 20 in 1999 states were given the option to continue to provide medicaid coverage to children who were aging out of the federal title ive foster care system responding to survey on eligibility rules in place in 2003 30 states and the district of columbia indicated that they include such former foster children as medicaid eligible an additional eight states reported covering all children under age 21 through other pathways so foster children would be covered via this broader pathway10 ribicoff children states have the option to provide medicaid coverage to reasonable categories of children who meet the former welfare programs financial criteria but do not qualify as dependent child the ribicoff pathway named for the former senator who sponsored legislation authorizing this group applies to children under age 21 who do not meet the dependency requirement often because they do not live with their families in the past this pathway had been used for children residing in institutions or in statebased foster care or adoption assistance programs but today most of those children can qualify under other povertylevel eligibility pathways since those pathways do not include family dependency requirement ribicoff as result has little meaning for most children under the age of 19 for children who are 19 or 20 or are inpatients in psychiatric facilities on the other hand ribicoff may still be valuable pathway to medicaid older children cannot qualify under the other povertylevel groups because those pathways define eligible children to be under the age of 19 institutionalized children who are in families with income that exceeds the poverty level ceilings also cannot qualify as povertylevel children because their parents income is deemed to be available to children under those pathways under ribicoff on the other hand parental income is not considered to apply to children who do not reside in their parents homes 10 oregon did not respond to any survey questions west virginia and vermont did not respond to this particular section of the survey connecticut delaware georgia indiana kentucky maine oklahoma pennsylvania south carolina all reported that these children are not covered crs

question in the crs survey about whether their medicaid programs include any categories of ribicoff children11 povertyrelated pregnant women and children between 1986 and 1991 congress gradually extended medicaid to additional groups of pregnant women and children see table 5 under these provisions states are required to cover pregnant women with family incomes equal to or below 133 of the federal poverty income guidelines12 coverage for pregnant women qualifying through this pathway is limited to services related to pregnancy and complications of the pregnancy and extends to 60 days after pregnancy states are required to cover all children under age six or alternately under age seven or eight who are in families with income equal to or below 133 of the federal poverty level in addition states must cover all children in families with income equal to or below 100 of poverty this requirement has been phasedin since july 1 1991 and was fully implemented in 2002 all povertyrelated children receive full medicaid coverage states have the option to go beyond the above mandatory groups to include pregnant women and infants under one year of age whose family income is over 133 up to 185 of the fpl in 2002 36 states and the district of columbia extended coverage to some or all pregnant women and infants in this category table 5 povertyrelated pregnant women and

pathway states have the ability to apply more generous income and assets disregards and methodologies to extend coverage beyond the statutory ceilings for povertyrelated pregnant women and children many states have chosen to do so for some or all of their povertyrelated groups of children and pregnant women see table 7 for more information on assets tests small but growing body of research supports the conclusion that when entire families have insurance coverage the children experience health benefits such as increased access and use of health care services13 nonetheless policy makers at both the federal and state levels have met with less opposition when extending coverage to children in families and less success for coverage proposals for entire families this reflects consensus that childrens health care is an important priority but such consensus exists with respect to coverage for adults table 6 maximum eligibility thresholds for pregnant women and children as percentage

to offer presumptive eligibility to pregnant women children and to women qualifying under the breast and cervical cancer treatment pathway see description of this coverage group on page 20 presumptive eligibility for pregnant women the purpose of the presumptive eligibility provision for pregnant women is to ensure that prenatal care is not delayed because woman does not have medicaid card during the time it takes for state to process an ordinary medicaid application and make final eligibility determination certain providers of care may make an interim determination on the basis of preliminary information that pregnant woman seeking treatment may be financially eligible for medicaid benefits providers permitted to make this determination include individual practitioners clinics participating in number of federally funded healthrelated programs or in state perinatal care programs and indian health service facilities the provider must notify the medicaid agency of the presumptive eligibility determination within five days and must inform the woman that she is required to make formal application for medicaid by the last day of the month following the month in which the determination of presumptive eligibility was made once the provider has established tentative eligibility the woman may receive ambulatory prenatal care if the woman fails to apply for medicaid her presumptive eligibility ends the last day of the month after the month she is determined presumptively eligible if she applies for medicaid her presumptive eligibility period continues until the day on which the state makes final eligibility determination even if the state should ultimately determine that the woman is not eligible payment will still be made to the provider for services rendered during the presumptive eligibility period crs20 payments made on behalf of applicants who are later found to be ineligible for the program are not counted as erroneous payments for the purposes of meeting administrative oversight thresholds presumptive eligibility for children and women with breast or cervical cancer similarly states can also choose to provide coverage for care and services offered under the state plan for medical assistance during presumptive eligibility period for children under age 19 and for women who are eligible under the pathway specific to certain breast or cervical cancer patients described below the presumptive eligibility is the same as for pregnant women although the care and services go beyond ambulatory care to include all medicaid services offered under the state program states can determine which providers are to make determinations of presumptive eligibility for women with breast and cervical cancer states can also determine which providers may make presumptive eligibility determinations for children but in this case regulations offer additional guidance on the choice of providers they must be providers that are eligible to

coverage to an individual for stated amount of time even if the family income of that person rises to levels that would otherwise disqualify them from such coverage states are required to provide continuous eligibility to individuals crs21 qualifying through certain eligibility pathways and are given the option of providing continuous eligibility to individuals qualifying through other eligibility pathways continuous eligibility provides for more stable coverage for both the enrollees and for their service providers despite what may be frequent fluctuations in incomes continuous eligibility for pregnant women states are required to continue medicaid coverage for pregnant women who would otherwise lose eligibility because of change in family income through the pregnancy and post partum period the postpartum period is defined as ending on the last day of the month during which the 60th day after the end of the pregnancy falls medicaid law requires continuous eligibility for pregnant women and infants regardless of changes in income that is child born to woman receiving medical assistance remains eligible for medical assistance for one year or up to one year of age so long as the child is member of the womans household and the woman remains or would remain if pregnant eligible for medical assistance continuous eligibility for children states have the option to provide poverty level children with continuous eligibility period of more than 12 months the continuous eligibility period begins when the child is determined or redetermined to be eligible for coverage but is not available to children who are presumptively eligible during the presumptive eligibility period thirty states responded to crs eligibility survey that their medicaid program offered some continuous eligibility period to children under age one in 2002 all but four states reported that infants coverage is continued for full 12 months several states reported offering the continuous eligibility period only to infants born to mothers who are enrolled in the program similar to presumptive eligibility fewer states offer continuous coverage to older children twentytwo states offered continuous eligibility to some older groups of poverty level children guaranteed enrollment for beneficiaries enrolled in managed care organizations related provision allows states the option of guaranteeing that medicaid recipients enrolled in certain managed care organizations mcos retain eligibility for the medicaid services provided by the mco even if the enrollee otherwise loses medicaid eligibility this guaranteed enrollment period is not limited to nondisabled adults or children and was not intended to improve access to medicaid services for lowincome children and pregnant women rather its purpose was to improve medicaid programs attractiveness to mcos that might otherwise be concerned that income fluctuations of medicaids population would lead to unstable and unpredictable funding guaranteed enrollment periods may be provided for period not to exceed six months if recipient loses medicaid eligibility during minimum guaranteed enrollment period heshe is entitled to coverage through the end of the enrollment period only for services furnished or arranged by the mco with which he or she is enrolled crs22 medically needy states may extend medicaid coverage to persons who are members of one or more of the broad categories of medicaid covered groups ie the aged disabled pregnant women or families with children but do not meet the applicable income or resource requirements for eligibility states have the option to establish medically needy coverage for those individuals whose income and in some cases resources are close to but somewhat higher than those for the above coverage groups most importantly though states are allowed to deduct medical expenses from countable income of applicants when determining financial eligibility for the medically needy program in other words individuals are allowed to spend down to eligibility through the medically needy pathway17 this makes medically needy programs important to individuals or families experiencing medical crisis or whose routine medical costs are high relative to their modest income in 2003 35 states and the district of columbia18 covered the medically needy any state that opts to include medically needy coverage for any group is required to extend that coverage to children under age 18 pregnant women certain newborns and certain protected persons who are blind or disabled and were eligible as of 1973 other groups can be included as well including the elderly and individuals with disabilities and children who under age 21 20 or 19 and caretaker relatives of eligible children states are also allowed to create reasonable categories of children to be eligible as medically needy such as children under age 19 who are fulltime students states that offer medically needy coverage can set single income standard called the medically needy income limit mnil at any level up to 13313 of the maximum payment amount that could have been made to the same size family or individual under the states former afdc plan the mnil can be raised or lowered in accordance with the welfare reform provisions described above as they relate to section 1931 family coverage if raised they can rise by more than the annual increase in the consumer price index or if lowered they cannot fall below those in effect in may 1988 methodologies for calculating income and resources must be the same as those used for the most closely related cash assistance program for example for lowincome families the methodologies of the former afdc program would be used and for aged and disabled the methodologies of the ssi program would be used 17 individuals may also spenddown to become eligible for medicaid under pathway expressly for individuals with disabilities known as the 209b pathways

waivers authorized by section 1115 of the social security act section 1115 allows the secretary of hhs to waive number of medicaid rules including many of the federal rules relating to medicaid eligibility and benefits19 the health insurance flexibility and accountability hifa initiative is an explicit effort of hhs to encourage states to seek section 1115 waivers to extend medicaid and schip to the uninsured with particular emphasis on statewide approaches that maximize private health insurance coverage options and target populations with incomes below 200 fpl number of states have used such waivers to enact broadbased and sometimes statewide health reforms although demonstrations under section 1115 need not be statewide many of the demonstrations extend comprehensive health insurance coverage to individuals who would not otherwise be eligible for medicaid as of september 2003 cms reports 18 states and the district of columbia have used the waiver demonstration authority

medicaid that move the program further away from its traditional links to cash assistance programs two new pathways were added to medicaid for individuals with specific medical diagnoses for lowincome

consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act cobra and to unauthorized aliens seeking medical treatment in emergency rooms21 women with breast and cervical cancer woman who are eligible for medicaid

breast and cervical cancer early detection program nbccedp women who qualify must be under age 65 uninsured and otherwise not eligible for medicaid benefits are limited to the period in which the beneficiary requires breast or cervical cancer treatment states spending for the benefits is matched at an enhanced federal matching rate22 as of 2004 all states and the district of columbia have chosen to cover women who meet these requirements23 persons with tuberculosis states may choose to offer medicaid to people with tuberculosis tb who are uninsured individuals qualifying under this pathway are entitled only to those services related to the treatment of tuberculosis in 2003 13 states24 and the district of columbia covered such persons with tb cobra continuation beneficiaries

benefits to employees who would otherwise lose the coverage due to change in their work status the medicaid option allows states to pay the former employees premiums but only under the following circumstances the employee or family member worked for firm with 75 or more employees the premium payment is cost effective ie the premium paid for the employer based coverage is below the amount medicaid would have otherwise spent on medicaid services for the individual the employee entitled to elect cobra coverage is in family with income that does not exceed 100 of fpl and the individual or

required to cover treatment for emergency conditions for illegal aliens and for persons in lawful temporary resident status who otherwise meet the programs eligibility criteria25 an emergency medical condition is defined as medical condition including emergency labor and delivery manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity including severe pain such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in placing the patients health in serious jeopardy serious impairment to bodily functions or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part26 coverage provided to these individuals on the other hand may exclude organ transplants general eligibility principles and requirements wide variation in state programs federal requirements and options combine with state choices and definitions to ensure wide variation in the characteristics of state medicaid programs this variation across state programs makes generalizations about medicaid eligibility policies difficult federal law describes more than 50 eligibility pathways some of those pathways describe mandatory coverage groups others are optional for states some of those coverage groups defined in federal law are described precisely such as women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer identified through the center for disease controls national breast and cervical cancer early detection program 25 persons legally residing in the us would qualify for medicaid through general medicaid eligibility pathways as described in this report with some restrictions see discussion of those restrictions on page 27 26 section 1903v3 of the social security act crs27 other pathways are only generally described with the specifics left to states discretion where federal law identifies optional coverage groups states have great deal of flexibility in defining and specifying the pathways they choose to implement as described above for example federal law provides an option for states to cover children who are between the ages of six and eight and whose family income is between 100 and 133 of the federal poverty level fpl states can choose any combination of income level and age within those parameters another example is an eligibility pathway referred to as ribicoff children this pathway allows states to identify reasonable classifications of children whose income is very low and who do not otherwise qualify under welfarerelated pathways under that category states can define one two 10 or any number of classes of children to be offered medicaid coverage most states cover multiple classifications of ribicoff children for almost all medicaid eligibility groups mandatory and optional alike federal law also leaves the precise definitions of financial eligibility criteria countable income and resources up to states states can define what counts as income and resources for most coverage groups few exceptions to this rule include individuals eligible for medicaid because of receipt of ssi payments or through ssi related eligibility pathways for those individuals definitions of income and resources come directly from ssi statute and regulations few other eligibility pathways place limits on states ability to define income and resources for example medicaid regulation pertaining to optional families and children prohibits states from using any requirements for determining eligibility that are more restrictive than those used under the state afdc plan that existed in 1996 similarly states cannot use more restrictive definitions for optional aged blind and disabled individuals than those used under ssi27 and in the medicaid tradition there are exceptions to those rules as well all of this variation contributes to the overwhelming level of diversity and complexity of the states medicaid programs many people have said that if you know one medicaid program you know one medicaid program this is because every rule or definition that applies in one state could be quite different in another this immense variation also makes reforming the medicaid program exceedingly difficult minor federal law change could have multiple ripple effects in each state retroactive eligibility under federal law persons who are determined to be eligible for medicaid must be provided with coverage for any care and services under the plan during the three months before he or she made application if that person would have been eligible for such assistance during that time states are directed to determine if applicants have unpaid bills during the three calendar months before application and to pay for those services that are included in the states medicaid plan 27 42 cfr section 43501 crs28 citizenship medicaid programs are required to cover all us citizens who meet the states financial and categorical restrictions states are also required to cover certain groups of legal permanent resident immigrants those groups are refugees for the first

immigrants arriving in the united states after august 22 199629 and to legal immigrants already residing in the country as of that date who become disabled in the future all medicaid applicants are required to declare in writing under penalty of perjury that they are citizen or national of the us or an alien in satisfactory immigration status in addition states are required to verify with the bureau of citizenship the immigration status of all aliens applying for medicaid through the systematic alien verification for eligibility save system this requirement does not apply to aliens seeking treatment for emergency medical conditions eligibility verification states are required to have an income and eligibility verification system in administering medicaid states are required to request and make use of internal revenue service irs unearned income and quarterly wage information the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 clarified that the use of such information be targeted toward the most productive cases and did not require states to use the information to verify the eligibility of all beneficiaries eg states can verify samples of beneficiaries 28 for more information on

residence state medicaid agencies must provide medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible residents of the state including residents who are temporarily absent from the state an individual is generally considered resident of state if he or she is living in it with the intention of remaining there permanently or indefinitely eligibility may not be denied because an individual has not resided in the state for specified period or because the individual is temporarily absent from the state state is also prohibited from denying coverage to an individual who satisfied the residency rules but who did not establish residence in the state before entering medical institution state is required to reimburse providers for services provided to its residents in another state under the following circumstances medical services are needed because of medical emergency medicaid services are needed and the beneficiarys health would be endangered if he or she were required to travel to their state of residence the state determines on the basis of medical advice that the needed medical services or necessary supplementary resources are more readily available in another state or it is general practice for beneficiaries in particular locality to use medical resources in another state homelessness homelessness does not automatically qualify an individual for medicaid homeless person must still meet his or her state programs eligibility criteria however state may not exclude from coverage any otherwise eligible individual who resides in the state regardless of whether or not the residence is maintained permanently or at fixed address states are required to establish method of making eligibility cards available to eligible individuals who do not reside in permanent dwelling or do not have permanent home or mailing address rules for medicaid benefits there are number of general rules that apply to the benefits offered under state programs although the rules are primarily about benefits they are important to consider for complete understanding of medicaid eligibility this is because these rules contribute to states complaints about the inflexibility of the medicaid program in addition it is often the effect of these rules on state programs that have encouraged the proliferation of waivers and experimentation in providing health benefits to selected medicaid enrollees in different ways the requirements are often waived as part of the research and demonstration waivers described above amount duration and scope each covered service must be sufficient in amount duration and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose the state may not arbitrarily deny or reduce the amount duration or scope of services solely because of the type of illness or condition the state may place appropriate limits on service based on such criteria as medical necessity crs30 statewideness generally state plan must be in effect throughout an entire state that is the amount duration and scope of services covered must be the same statewide comparability the comparability rule requires that the benefits offered be the same for all individuals qualifying within each eligibility pathway this rule is often major source of states concerns regarding inflexibility it prohibits states from changing the benefits offered to individuals within one pathway as their family income rises it also prohibits states from offering some groups trimmed down benefit packages current eligibility issues medicaid eligibility rules and policies raise number of issues that generate both debate about the program as well as many questions for legislators first issue relates to achieving the optimum amount of program enrollment among those who are eligible ensuring that people who are eligible for medicaid enroll is important to those involved in medicaid policy issues for number of reasons reaching full enrollment is way to minimize the number of people who are uninsured without requiring additional programs or changing current program rules second important issue is how to account for the countercyclical impact of the economy on medicaid eligibility and enrollment that is when the economy improves medicaid benefits are needed by fewer individuals when the economy suffers medicaid benefits are needed by more people this countercyclical effect is consistent with the notion that medicaid is safety net for people losing jobs and financial security moreover when the economy suffers states revenues are impacted as is their ability to fund the program final issue the changing nature of medicaid enrollment describes the recent transformation of the program to cover new groups of individuals and to play greater role in addressing the needs of citizens with moderate incomes and who have stronger ties to the workforce these issues are discussed below managing and monitoring enrollment for number of years researchers have found that state medicaid programs do not enroll all of the eligible population most of the research related to the enrollment gap has focused on lowincome children and finds that between 65 and 80 of individuals eligible for medicaid enroll in the programs table 9 in 1998 seldon et found that children over age twelve had significantly lower rates of enrollment or takeup rates than those who were younger the authors speculate that this could reflect continuous medicaid coverage for some children since birth it may also be related to need and use of health care services children under age 12 are known to have more medical encounters than those over age 12 in addition children who became eligible for medicaid because they were in families qualifying through welfarerelated pathway had higher takeup rates than those qualifying through the povertylevel expansions this could be because crs31 many states automatically enroll individuals who are receiving welfare benefits into medicaid but do not automatically do so for those qualifying through the poverty related pathways other factors can play role in the persistent enrollment gap unlike private insurance there is open enrollment period for medicaid coverage individuals do not lose out on medicaid coverage for the year if they do not enroll at the beginning of the year so people can enroll at any time or whenever they find they need medical services there has not however been any systematic review or evidence of this playing role in the enrollment gap the presence of the enrollment gap raises number of concerns first much analytic evidence shows that insurance coverage leads to improved health outcomes30 on the other hand with the inadequacy of available data to measure the problem we may never know what the true gap in enrollment is31 the surveys that probe insurance coverage have universally underrepresented public program enrollment some researchers have attempted to adjust the survey responses for this under count although others have not to the extent that public program enrollment is underrepresented in the national surveys used to calculate the enrollment gaps the takeup rates presented in table 9 could be too low and the enrollment

agencies have often taken the lead in efforts to reduce the enrollment gap the aggressiveness with which states have attempted to reduce the gap however has waxed and waned depending on the budgetary conditions that states face the additional budgetary costs of covering people who are not currently enrolled has at times acted as barrier to aggressive outreach during particularly difficult fiscal times states sometimes do the opposite of outreach that is they may create administrative hurdles intended to impede enrollment or hasten disenrollment32 the federal government has also played major role in encouraging states to reach out to potentially eligible individuals major force behind the liberalization of medicaid in the 1980s allowing states to cover many more pregnant women and 32

were being lost in the transition off of afdc consensus was building to extend federallysponsored health care to cover all poor and near poor children in the us it became widely recognized that in order to achieve universal or near universal coverage of children medicaids reach among children already eligible must be improved in 1998 the states childrens health insurance program schip was enacted34 the program provides grants to states to extend health coverage to children in families with low and modest income who are not eligible for medicaid portion of the schip grant was identified for outreach activities and the dhhs and the health care financing administration hcfa now known as the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms encouraged outreach activities in addition hcfa established the outreach information clearinghouse35 which provided outreach information and forum for information exchange among states providers schools and school districts and childrens groups among others hcfa also produced two guides or reports on medicaid eligibility enrollment and outreach activities identifying when practices and procedures were federally required and which state activities were highly successful36 finally hcfa provided funds for five states to conduct pilot projects to remove barriers in states application enrollment and renewal process37 removing administrative barriers much has been written about the complexity of the application and eligibility determination processes and how those processes have in the past raised considerable barriers to enrollment for many of medicaids target populations applications have been notoriously long and sometimes have questions that are difficult to understand after the passage of schip many states worked to ensure transparency so that children making application for either medicaid or schip were placed in the appropriate program without having to undergo separate processes or applications states made changes such as reducing the number of pages of applications minimizing documentation requirements and eliminating asset tests nonetheless during periods of heavily strained state budgets erecting indirect barriers to enrollment such as increasing the documentation requirements 34 see crs report rl30473 state childrens health insurance program schip brief overview by elicia herz bernadette

pennsylvania and washington crs35 establishing intrusive verification procedures such as fingerprinting or reducing the number of days in week or hours in day during which applications may be accepted effectively restrain medicaid program participation and thus spending in the recent period of strained state budgets number of states are reported to be considering establishing such red tape barriers to deter enrollment in response to budget pressures38 the impact of the economy on enrollment the nations economic condition during any given period has direct impact on states medicaid programs first when depressions or recessions occur citizens often lose jobs job loss can drive up medicaid enrollment for two reasons because people lose their jobbased income and because people lose their jobbased health care coverage the number of people qualifying on financial basis swells at the same time that the perceived need for medicaid to play its safetynet role swells the same forces that raise the number of lowincome people in need of medicaid benefits concomitantly reduce states ability to fund medicaid rising joblessness reduces states tax revenues federal statute provides states with considerable flexibility to choose whether to cover certain eligibility groups and to define other eligibility groups in ways that would allow more or fewer individuals to qualify for benefits this means that eligibility policy could in theory be used as tool to reduce medicaid spending when states budgets are tight or to extend the generosity of the program in other times but this much control over the programs size and cost is often elusive for statelevel policy makers instead medicaids size and spending levels are largely driven by the nations general economic fluctuations the size and needs of the states population and by other political concerns cutting eligibility to reduce costs is difficult but not impossible there are three reasons for this eligibility and enrollment trends are driven by economic conditions making the impact of any policy changes at the state level either dulled or accentuated by the changes driven by the economy for example if state eliminated coverage for medically needy people during time when incomes are generally high and fewer people are qualifying for such coverage there is less objection but if the eligibility pathway were eliminated during recession at just the time when large numbers of individuals and families are finding their income dipping into the range for medically needy coverage the cutback has considerably stronger impact this situation leads to the second problem with cutting eligibility eliminating individuals ability to rely on medicaid at exactly the time when such need for assistance is climbing may be politically unpopular many states seek to avoid this unappealing tool for fiscal restraint by instead restricting benefits reducing provider payments andor raising copayments for services 38 dc ross l cox beneath

cutbacks and exclusions proposed and recently enacted 2003 title ii community aids national network oct 2003 crs36 finally there is cyclical problem with reducing the size of the medicaid program during recession when states budgets are flush with revenues improving access to medical care for those in need is very popular use of state funds during such periods many states add eligibility coverage groups to medicaid or modify the definitions of existing groups to include additional people thereby increasing the programs generosity such eligibility expansions raise the fiscal stress on the states during the next recession in the late 1990s the nations economy surged largely spurred on by the technology stock boom states revenues improved and medicaid programs in many states became more generous but during the next few years 2001 to 2003 states were unable to keep up with the programs rising costs in response states appealed to the us congress for fiscal relief in 2003 states received that relief with provision passed as part of the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 108027 that temporarily raised the share of medicaid paid by the federal government39 beside fiscal relief there are few other proposals that directly provide additional funding for the program when the economy drives such periodic increases in eligibility and enrollment such proposals would modify the federalstate funding relationship to shift costs from states to the federal government in recessionary periods40 changing nature of medicaid enrollment medicaids target populations have undergone major changes over the years early in the programs history eligibility for medicaid was tied to the receipt of cash assistance when enacted medicaid was offered only to families and individuals who qualified to receive payments under two programs the former afdc program which provided cash assistance to very lowincome families with children and the ssi program which provides cash assistance to very low income individuals who are aged or meet certain federally prescribed definitions of blindness or disability the programs close link to cash welfare programs began to erode when congress enacted series of eligibility expansions in the 1980s targeted primarily to children and pregnant women these new groups were in families whose income was too high to qualify for cash welfare payments but was still at or near poverty later changes in medicaid continued to move the program further from its cash assistance roots in 1996 the afdc program was replaced with program of grants to states for various lowincome assistance efforts the tanf program was passed as part of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 tanf pl 104193 with this change to federal welfare policy medicaids link to cash welfare assistance for poor families was formally broken instead the 39 for more complete description of this provision and the circumstances surrounding its passage see crs report rl31773 medicaid and the current state fiscal crisis by christine scott 40 for more information on financing medicaid see crs report rs21262 federal medical assistance percentage fmap for medicaid and crs report rl31773 medicaid and the current state fiscal crisis by christine scott crs37 eligibility rules for families applying for medicaid were liberalized to allow states the flexibility to specify new rules as long as states continue to provide medicaid coverage to individuals who would have been eligible to receive afdc payments under old program rules41 the automatic eligibility for medicaid for recipients of ssi payments however has remained over the last decade many states have continued to make changes that move medicaid programs further away from its historical coverage groups states are able to apply to the secretary of hhs for waivers of certain federal medicaid rules these waivers authorized under section 1115 of the social security act allow states to conduct demonstrations the goals of which must be consistent with the purpose of the medicaid statute under these demonstrations some states have extended coverage to higher income individuals and to individuals who otherwise do not fit into medicaids traditional categorical coverage groups the elderly blind and disabled individuals and members of families with dependent children42 the number of approved demonstration waivers has increased over the last decade encouraged by both the clinton and gw bush administrations state officials have identified lack of flexibility in eligibility policies as one of the reasons waivers have such appeal notwithstanding the programs flexibility that allows states to choose which optional groups to cover and to define income and resources tests and methodologies for many groups other rules constrain states one program rule meant to achieve fairness within and across states is predominant issue for states this comparability43 rule states that all individuals within single eligibility category must be offered the same set of benefits for example poverty related child qualifying in marylands anne arundel county must receive the same set of medicaid benefits as child qualifying for medicaid but residing in queen annes county this rule also prevents states from offering particular population trimmed down benefits package so for example if state chooses to cover all pregnant women who are in families with income below 185 of poverty the state could not offer reduced benefits to those with income over 150 or charge larger co pays to this somewhat higher income group than charged to those below 150 of poverty states argue that they must as consequence of this rule offer nothing to anyone in particular coverage group or income range when they could otherwise offer some additional individuals limited set of benefits because of this all or nothing inflexibility some states claim they could be more generous to certain groups than they are today skeptics question whether states complaints about lack of flexibility disguise less benevolent goals detractors of policies to enhance the states design flexibility worry that advocates of increasing flexibility are primarily those who would prefer to reduce medicaids assistance for poor people and are prevented from doing so because of existing mandates and the comparability rule 41 the law includes minimum eligibility standards to ensure that families who had formerly qualified for medicaid through their receipt of afdc would continue to be eligible for coverage section 1931b 42 see crs report rs21054 medicaid and schip section 1115 research and demonstration waivers by evelyne baumrucker 43 general rule at section 1902a10b of the social security act crs38 putting arguments about what flexibility means aside medicaids role as insurer of last resort has undergone transition from covering only those eligible for cash assistance to having much larger role for broader range of lowincome uninsured individuals the debate about medicaids role is likely to intensify as private insurance coverage continues to decline and as aging baby boomers demand more longterm care services that are typically not covered under private health insurance plans for other versions of this document see
