1843 the statute was amended in 1986 in severa l respects including increasing the penalty provisions and making it easier for whistleblowers to file qui tam actions on behalf of the federal

health insurance program and champus background the false claims act fca dates back to the civil war congress was concerned at that time with union army contractors who were defrauding the government by schemes such as selling the same horses to the union cavalry several times and delivering musket boxes full of sawdust instead of guns1 the fca was enacted in 1863 to combat contractor fraud and was popularly known as the lincoln law the law imposed 2000 civil fine as well as double damages on wrongdoers for each false claim submitted to the government the st atute also contained qui tam provision2 which allowed private citizens called relators to sue on th governments behalf and to receive up to 50 of the amount the government r ecovered as result of their cases

and providing that whistleblower could not proceed with fca qui tam lawsuit if it was based on evidence or information already in the po ssession of the fede ral government3 the effect of the 1943 amendments was to discourage qui tam suits and the statute was seldom used until it was amended in 1986 judicial precedents durin g this period also made use of the fca more difficult for the government for example in united states v ueber4 the sixth circuit court of appeals applied the comm on law standard and re quired the government to produce clear unequivocal and convincin g evidence that the fca defendant had actual knowledge of fraud5 during the 1980s widespread reports of contractor fraud against the federal government particularly in fense contracts prompted c ongress to take another look at the fca government enforcement agencies cited difficulties in investigating and stopping fraud due to insufficient resources in adequate legal tools and the reluctance of employees with knowledge of fraud to speak up fo r fear of job reprisal s senator charles grassley and representative howard berman introduced bills amending the fca in 1985 and congress passed the amendments with president reagan signing the bill into law on october 27 19866 the 1986 amendments expanded the role of whistleblowers who became qui tam relators in fca litigation whether or not the federal government decides to intervene and take over the suit by allowing the relator to remain party to the case even if the government steps in at the same time protections were provided for qui tam relator against discrimination or retaliation by an employer the potential qui tam bounty available to relators was increased from minimum of ten percent to the range of fifteen to twentyfive percent of the recovery where the government intervenes7 and from maximum of twentyfive percent to the range of twentyfive to thirty percent where the government declines to intervene8 the civil monetary penalty was raised from 2000 per false claim to between 5000 nd 10000 for any such false claim9 in addition the amendments provided for treble rather than double damages for the amount of loss the government sustains10 the relator is also entitled to receive attorneys fees costs andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98602crs3 11 id at 3730d1 2 12 id at 3731c this ended split in circu it court decisions

plaintiffs burden of proof of all essential elements of fca case by the preponderance of the evidence12 in addition the definition of know or knowingly was defined to include deliberate ignorance and reckless di sregard of the truth or falsity of the information13 in clarifying the knowledge st andard the sena committee report expressed the intent of congress to reach what has become known as the ostrich type situation where an individual s buried his head in the sa nd and failed to make simple inquiries which would alert him that false claims are being submitted14 accordingly the 1986 amendments make clear that proof of specific intent to defraud is required to support fca violation15 current false claims act provisions civil actions may be brought in federal district court under the false claims act by the attorney general or by person called relator for the person and for the united states government under the fca defendant is liable to the united states government if the defendant knowingly presen ts false or fraudulent claim to an officer or employee of the united states government for payment or if the defendant knowingly makes or uses false record or statement to get false or fraudulent claim paid16 claim is actionable under the fca even if the cl aim is made against party other than the government if the payment of the claim would eventually result in loss to the united states17 while the fca covers claims made to the armed forces of the united states it does not cover cla ims made to the internal revenue service18 the claim must have been presented

billion in qui tam cases approximately one quarter of which was recovered in health care fraud cases hospital groups have responded to thes investigations and the resultant civil lawsuits brought under the fca by arguing that the justice department has begun to characterize practices that for many years we re treated as simple mistakes or differences in interpretation as intentional wrongdoing triggering severe civil monetary penalties under the fca they contend that the use of the fca under these circumstances unfairly punishes providers for innocent billing errors nd that providers are forced to settle fca lawsuits because the risk of liability under the act is so onerous in response to the issues raised by the hospital industry attorney ge neral janet reno has pr omised to work with the nations hospital leaders to address their concerns speaking at the american hospital associations annual meeting on february 2 1998 reno stated it is not the department of justices policy to punish honest billing mista kes or mere negligence but where there is reckless disregard and people go be yond simple negligence i will use the law bills introduced in the 105th congress on march 19
