type 3 idate21965 volnum2 issue67 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec67 out tech 6509c21 shspec67 out tech references hcob 13sep65 out tech and how to get it in and hcob 21sep65 out tech teachers tend to say that everything is important we are in good position to select out the important data from all the data that we have someone at the has level cant do this to him every datum looks as important as every other datum the guy at the bottom of the ladder is drowning in sea of data that is unevaluated this is true both in life and in scientology the person is already overwhelmed with the confusions of life which also overwhelm him with data so he goes on retreat from the whole thing the hardest thing thetan has to do and the most important thing that thetan can recover is his ability to evaluate importances to know whats important and what isnt the value of administration of processing is different thing from what is processed the duplicative question which is basic to auditing is the examination of the mind for the apparent answer to the question the knocking out then of this that and the other thing until the individual can take look at it and see before him some data that is important the repetitive process itself is therapeutic repetitive processes permit the individual to examine his mind and environment and out of it to select the unimportances and importances the duplicative question is unique to scientology other things work because of this duplicative action moreover to find out what is important and unimportant the person has to find out what is and what isnt he would get great clarification of things because he is being presented with certain vistas of existence and conditions of existence and he is examining them and he is taking them in or he is knocking them out he is handling existence and reorienting himself someone can get things clarified by getting more data about life from study however as he does this he is straightening up his own mind and his real gain when the chips are all the way down largely depends on the auditor someone who is drowning in the sea of life gets repetitive command from an auditor and asises various confusions the pcs statements on the question are handled and asised those statements are then acknowledged by the auditor making full cycle of the situation only then can the pc get up to point where he himself might all by himself confront his own mind only when hes got his mind straightened out can he really benefit from new data hes got his own mind 742 and life so mixed up that he has completely forgotten what mind is all about and in large majority of cases people arent even aware that they have minds at best they think that they are minds and perhaps that they have souls saving oneself seems too egoistical so one saves ones soul man is at effect he looks for the oneshot clear or enlightenment its not that scientology is slow its that man has gone so far down but the big gains arent so much at the top they are at the bottom getting started these gains are startling just getting the idea that there is road out can be big win the individual has had lot of loses on this line to him scientology is like straw in the ocean helped by an auditor the person can look at himself and life and make more gains it is lone ladder contrary to the general idea and desire for fast way to the top the person makes his first real gains on coming to realize that there is road out so there is dependency on 1 the disseminator 2 the intro lecturer 3 the course supervisor they all perform vital functions and they can produce more dramatic results than you would ever expect being used to auditing as the way to get changes the changes on the chart are made in session but the biggest mistake you could make would be not teaching scientology and not disseminating people in society are very confused and distracted one of the soundest ways to reach them is to talk about communication and telling them that scientology exists and as their friend is interested in helping them you tell person that if he could communicate to his environment better he could handle it better you tell him that if he were to talk to his wife it would come out better the only dicey thing there is that he has been punished perhaps for communicating so it might be difficult along the way dissemination and teaching lines can be bit wobbly but if the individual makes some gains he will still do ok but auditing lines cant afford to be wobbly when the person gets to auditing that is where there is room for shakiness or flubbiness now tech is tech the comm cycle has to be good the questions have to be understood by and acceptable to the pc they must also be answered and acknowledged up to the point of getting the person in session it is debatable exactly what the correct technical action in disseminating to him is because you are disseminating into such confusion life as it exists it is still debatable what it is best to lecture to people about common denominator is that lecturing about communication is good idea but auditing isnt debatable it works with precision if it is applied with precision there must be gaes in auditing there is leeway in dissemination but not in auditing which must be standard all troubles in auditing stem from auditor goofs so dont butter up nattery pc pull his withholds the ability to observe and tell whether what is being done is right or wrong is harder to do in auditing than in disseminating or in course supervising the auditor can make tiny mistakes that upset the pc so that the pc acts up the casual observer would say that it is difficult pc when in fact it was auditor goofs you have to be good auditor to observe good and bad auditing you will get some gain 30 to 40 of potential even out of bad auditing 743 just by duplicative questions and by the fact that someone is interested in the pc however full gain only comes from precise right auditing what we mean by out tech is not getting the whole 100 gains available on every pc not just obvious goofs out tech is what is happening when the fine points of auditing are missing and when what really goes wrong with cases is not understood when there is out tech the auditor is to be sure sitting there giving the auditing command but he is making lots of goofs with it what does it take to make good auditor first we have the gaes see hcob 21sep65 out tech there are only five gaes 1 cant handle and read the emeter he doesnt see reads he overcompensates when bringing the ta back to set giving falsely large amounts of ta action 2 doesnt know and cant apply technical data this used to be cant read and apply an hcob this also includes nonduplication of css and not knowing that you havent done what you were supposed to have done 3 cant get or keep pc in session this is very often the case the pcs attention is on something other than the auditing you have to be able to see when the pc is not in session distracted etc there is little body of technology in this area you have to get the pcs attention by finding out what it is on and asising it note and find the arc break ptp or missed withhold and handle it the auditor who would try to audit pc whose attention is elsewhere is applying tech to nobody the most obvious and silly version of this mistake is where one got the pc an auditor despite the pc wanting and having paid for auditing or the auditor is so wedded to form that when the pc comes in already in session the auditor carefully takes the pc out of session in order to start the session 4 cant complete an auditing cycle this accounts for the pc who itsas obsessively this pc has been prematurely acknowledged in life or in auditing and this has happened so much that he feels as though he has never been acknowledged eg kid says mommy i just had great idea whereupon mommy says thats wonderful dear failed acknowledgment and host of other errors will also give rise to obsessive itsa such as not asking the question not acknowledging q and etc there are hundreds of ways to stop an auditing cycle one is not to start one as when the auditor just doesnt give the command the auditor can always polish up his comm cycle and make it better but when it is fouling up the pc it is grossly out with q and question ack etc 5 cant complete repetitive auditing cycle auditors used to have immense trouble just asking the same question repetitively the trs and op pro by dup were developed to handle this inability in auditors as an auditing supervisor these are the things to look for not aspects of the auditors case dont audit the auditor as first action after you find the gae maybe the auditor could be audited say on his missed withholds 744 there are really only four actually six things that can be wrong with pc 1 the pc is suppressive suppressive is someone who doesnt get case gain because he has continuing overts not because auditing wasnt applied well only about 2 12 of pcs are suppressive it is very hard to get this pc to give up the overts or to be made auditable for real case gain about the only way in which we can do it is with power processing occasionally someone can be overaudited so far especially on r6ew that they thereafter get case gain and will act slightly suppressive they have to be rehabilitated but true suppressive has never had any case gain or ta he is continually committing little overts because to him everyone is an enemy each individual is an everyone to the sp who is busy fighting everyone the sp is paranoid who doesnt change institutional cases are all ptss or sps that is why lrh has said dont fool with the insane he didnt know exactly why but now we know the psychiatrist is professionally pts 2 the pc is pts the pc who is pts rollercoasters in auditing this is the psychiatrists manicdepressive case he feels good after auditing and then feels bad the paranoid or catatonic who doesnt change is the suppressive pts doesnt have to see the sp between sessions he only has to think what will joe think about this or what would joe say the sp could be 10000 miles away ethics officers sometimes have trouble finding the sp but there is one on the case the sp speaks in generalities which puts up fog making the sp hard to find if you audit the pts and get him better the sp will do something to destroy him so it is dangerous to audit him if you give pts too much gain the sp will either commit suicide or murder him most of our troubles have come from auditing ptss who then threaten the sp who then incites the pts and others to cause our problems you have to find the right sp finding him gives very positive result not just tiny change when you correctly spot the sp in ptss case the pts lights up like spotlight 3 the pc is arc broken 4 the pc has ptp of long duration this includes hidden standards 5 the pc has withhold or misunderstood word the misunderstood word is just withhold of understanding the pc is withholding himself from the understanding or vice versa 6 the pc has continuous withheld overts this makes the pc suppressive the eleven items discussed in this lecture ie 5 gaes and the 6 things that can be wrong with pc given above are the only things that will act as barriers on case processes are things that work if these six things arent out with the pc and when auditors dont have gaes if they dont work one or more of these is why that is all that drives tech out d of p who 745 doesnt look at these barriers to processing cant make anything work if these eleven reasons why processing doesnt work are ok almost any process will work unless it is overrun in other words the only other reason why process doesnt work is that it has worked all the way to result and it is done overrun is either problem or an arc break hence in fits into the above schema if the five gaes are not present then if the case is not progressing 16 are present you can just assess these six things and find out what is wrong with the case so these things are the points of out tech the whole environment is trying to feed the cs different data than these analysis of out tech would result in getting tech in by not allowing gaes and by detecting and handling the things that are wrong with pcs persons case is helped by the fact that as he advances he becomes more and more capable of selecting importances as you get on up the line the selection of importances becomes more and more an ability that is easily practiced l ron hubbard type 3 idate141065 volnum2 issue68 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec68 briefing to review auditors 6510c14 shspec68 briefing to review auditors there are three key data that go out in an org and therefore are essential to be known by the department of review that lrh hasnt been able to teach tech qual or orgs you will hit them in review because one else will have gotten them 1 high ta is overrun there is other reason for high ta reviews problem is to find what was overrun and how it was overrun when someone comes in who has never been audited and who has never been near another therapy or practice and whose ta is at 50 he has still been overrun on something you just have your work cut out for you in finding it dont throw away the datum the way everyone else has using this datum you are likely to find some interesting things say someone went release on christianity at age six or on exercise at age twenty and then went on past that point doing it some more releases dont only happen in scientology it is likely to be some wisdom or therapy that released him they are all failed technologies all past wisdoms may have had technologies that have been alterised and lost we almost went that route by not recognizing the state of release and the phenomenon of the fn what has been overrun is not necessarily what the pc was running when the ta went high you might have overrun some earlier release it may for instance be restimulation of an earlier overrun communication release the pc could have been problems release and gotten keyed in again on ruds question if the hgc or field auditor didnt repair it by asking as first question what was overrun they would never solve it they would get the wrong overrun you must find what exactly the release was on which or what one was it get the right when and the right what and the ta will blow down and the needle will float youve got to rehab the right release to get the high ta down there could be other overruns on the case too but there is one that is making the high ta get that and the rehab tech will get it to fn quickly or less quickly 746 2 rollercoaster case has an sp in the vicinity the anatomy of the pts is that of problem postulatecounterpostulate the persons purpose postulate has been or is being suppressed counterpostulate there is other source of rollercoaster an sp gives the pts problem when the pc rollercoasters he has run into postulatecounterpostulate situation since his last gain pts really does make trouble for the auditor the org and himself ethics exists to get tech in if it is ever used to throw tech out it is being used suppressively search and discovery is used to find the suppressions that person has had in life the s and d question is 1 whats been your main purpose in life 2 who opposed it this often makes problems release in minutes with pts or with any problem you want to solve find the source of the counterpostulate man gets solutions to problems he leaves the two opposed postulates in place not knowing the definition of problem and then solves the resulting collision as in dialectical materialism the anatomy of problem gone mad any idea is the product of two forces is the backbone of dialectical materialism to solve problem look over the whole perimeter of counterpostulates and find what is the source of the problem if you handle the problem for the pc often the problem will evaporate for the other person also problems sometimes evaporate in the physical universe when you find the source of the counterpostulate in ethics when you see that the disconnection or the handle causes an enormous problem for the pts or for the other person from whom they are disconnecting you have invariably found the wrong person pts is the manifestation of postulatecounterpostulate find who when where and what you could list what purpose of yours has been thwarted you can get grade i release with this suppressives are now to be ated in review because ethics has flubbed it too much ptss go to ethics after review to have note made of the fact that they ar pts and to get statement made of handle or disconnect pts condition can be caused by suppressive action as well as by suppressive person for instance if you overrun pc past release the pc goes pts to the auditor just as mechanical action selfauditing is potential hidden source of overrun you dont declare the auditor an sp it was suppressive act thats all the definition of pts is connected to suppressive person or action the action could be inadvertent so you find the suppressive person the person may have only been suppressive for five minutes or he may have been suppressive for lifetime someone could be pts and overrun in that case you must get the suppression off and rehab the process suppressive person isnt someone with horns it is someone who has had counterpostulate to the pc person may occasionally commit suppressive acts or he may be habitually suppressive someone who is routinely suppressive in life invalidative of scientology and trying to keep people from getting well is social menace he is the subject of ethics he is the one who gets declared not the auditor who overran process from some inadvertent or stupid mistake 747 when you tell person the right sp it is like locating and indicating bpc you should get blowdown and gis if the pc again rollercoasters youve got another sp so there could be several sps on the case you dont go looking for all of them at the same time but after you find one suppressive look for another one if you found all the sps and suppressive actions in persons lifetime he would be problems release and if he goes release on problems he wont go pts again unless he goes home and starts selfauditing he can overrun himself on selfauditing so be aware of that 3 the source of overts is an earlier misunderstood word the source of the overt is the other key datum that has been missed misunderstood word causes individuation which leads to overts the word that student is arguing with the course supervisor about is later than the one that the student really misunderstood any confusion stupidity or upset in study always stems from misunderstood word earlier than the one he is upset about it is always earlier so the source of the overt is in the formula 1 something is misunderstood 2 the person individuates 3 he commits overts against the misunderstood thing if what the person thought was the misunderstood was the misunderstood the problem would have blown so it is always earlier this datum is the key datum in the area of study and comprehension of existence it regulates persons iq the review action is to look for the earlier area and the earlier word that was misunderstood cf method 1 word clearing you can unburden few words earlier than where you think the misunderstood word is then get the misunderstood just before it you can date the time of the misunderstood you should ask what subject the pc was in person isnt upset with studying it is only misunderstood word it is not case and it is not the environment remember that you are handling fringes on endwords so dont push all the way back into r6 just find what was happening before he hit the thing he doesnt understand so these three data are the only ones that are really important in review 1 high ta overrun 2 rollercoaster pts who is the sp that question is the source of hangups on the track you must find the counterpostulate and the source of the counterpostulate 3 confusion comes from misunderstood word earlier than the one the person is confused about l ron hubbard type 3 idate19766 volnum2 issue69 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec69 about rhodesia 6607c19 shspec69 about rhodesia lrh has just come back from rhodesia around february 1966 lrh was holding the mockup his body together with sticking plaster the organization was going fine tech was wrapped up lrh put things on wait his case for one thing he decided to take vacation he spent thirty days in palmas the organization was running fine clear 1 john mcmasters was made during february of 1966 while lrh was in palmas lrh decided to go to south africa he wanted to locate an alternate base for ots in case of war or political takeover he couldnt figure 748 out why he couldnt do this the reason was that he hadnt defined the purpose of such base the purpose was 1 an alternate base for scientology in case of war or political takeover 2 to serve as base from which to put in ethics on the planet so tech could go in 3 to put in economics so that people can support orgs and the orgs can flourish see later part of this lecture p 749 below lrh went to rhodesia he conceived of type of constitution they could use to solve their difficulties the government liked it lrh recalled that he had some assets in south africa he decided to invest them he bought house and learned that he could buy hotel in the wilderness for 5500 pounds and did he bought farm he was watching the economics and behavior of the wog world and getting kick out of being out there making friends with tough characters his usual friends rhodesian culture is still victorian it is small civilization in the middle of howling wilderness it is more sophisticated than london rhodesia has lots of land minerals precious metals and beautiful climate it is untouched and could easily be developed lrh met the governmental highups he was very acceptable to them he didnt discuss scientology at all he was examining the wog world and he didnt want to unwog it he went on tv and radio he had authority but he was solving lots of problems each individual rhodesian would agree with lrhs solutions but warned him that other rhodesian would agree with him because the solutions were too advanced lrh went down to his hotel at lake kariba he supplied the hotel with twoton trucks local industry started to use his trucks to transport goods and the area boomed lrh started furniture factory colony started to sprout just the fact of lrhs being interested in the country and seeing hope for it caused production to rise then lrh wondered how he was going to leave to go back to saint hill he was woven too tightly into the picture with staff of nine personal staff and twentynine general staff the pick of the exconsular domestic staffs white rhodesians kept telling lrh how to handle the african he realized that they didnt know anything about africans because they didnt recognize that they were people they would say they are sullen youve got to watch them but the reason they are sullen is acknowledgment bad 8c overexpectation and outgradient they were taking people with experiential background in politics or economics and expecting more of them than they were trained to do lrh made his staff happy by telling them that they werent rhodesians anymore that they were americans they were very spitandpolish enthusiastic and hardworking so in four months lrh was very acceptable to both races and even to extreme moderates as well as to extreme rightest whites reporter from the london daily mail told the minister of information what bad fellow lrh was the minister instantly told prime minister smith what bad fellow he was smith told the cabinet the same story and the next morning the rhodesian front committee was charging down to see lrh when they found out that his visa wasnt going to be extended because they knew that it was all lies smith had been built up as too fair and too honest his popularity had begun to decline because he hadnt worked 749 miracles and because his communication was going out then he told the committee various things such as that lrhs business associates were complaining about him lrh had in fact only three business associates and one of them was there and denied the story smith said that lrh had been deported from australia but lrhs passport had record of having entered australia he said that lrh was wanted all over and had criminal record these people however knew that lrhs credit was in the stars all over the world they saw smiths feet of clay and walked out so lrh could leave covered with laurels as result of this expedition lrh found out that you cant locate base that you dont know the purpose of that was why he had trouble locating ot base now he knows what ot base has to do it has to put in ethics on planetary basis so that tech can be gotten in as you associate with the public and try to tell them about scientology you have trouble with the public because their ethics are out and for other reason one sp in rhodesia has wrecked the country and is keeping the whole scene enturbulated the only real threat to scientology is that an atom war or political takeover could prevent the organization from going ahead to clear people in addition to ethics but less vital than ethics economics has to be gotten straightened out economics is very simple subject with very plain laws it has nothing to do with politics and ideology actually economics exists as subject the purpose of which is to get people enough to eat etc man violates the laws of economics all the time for ideological and political purposes the already existing economic systems of the planet are usable in modified form and we need them to improve in order to allow for an expansion of our organization there has to be workable enough economics on the planet so that people can support orgs and the orgs can flourish and expand total subsidy of processing doesnt work because there is contribution from the pc people have to contribute to benefit from auditing so the economic purpose is secondary purpose of ot base also ethics is hard to get in on starving people ethics is out on earth and the out ethics prevents easy dissemination nearly every human being on this planet that is in trouble is in trouble because ethics are out in england someone stole and sold lrhs research papers which were then represented as the current practice of scientology very different thing people are killed in wars because of one sp in the government the only reason for war is few sps we could go and sort out key sps in international situations what we would do about it is something else political systems exist only to solve the problem of succession of rulers otherwise everyone could agree on benevolent monarchy the answer is of course not to have successors clear the monarch but political systems are not concerned with the happiness or productivity of people the only source of our individual personal difficulties is not having ethics in in the society around us the only reason why you are having difficulty as an individual is not having ethics in in your immediate environment weve got to shift gears in our emphasis we have been getting ethics in on our fellow scientologists with great enthusiasm now we are familiar with the system and how it works we have erred by getting ethics in too 750 heavily on scientologists and too lightly on the environment it is time to reverse the emphasis there isnt any point in getting ethics in on willing person just because he is stupid doing that just makes the person sullen ethics should be directed at willful acts of sabotage real sp is not just anyone he intends to damage you he is real nut he intends to knock you down he is not just difficult person he is real monster upgrade your idea of what an sp is like sps amount only to 25 of mankind find out if the guy is driving people into sanitariums strewing social wreckage about and smashing statistics we have only had one real sp on staff just because person shows up on an s and d doesnt mean that he is real sp maybe he is just making someone unhappy dont fling the title around lightly within scientology outside scientology dont worry about making mistake and accusing someone wrongly just get ethics in real hard first and correct the mistakes later weve got to put in ethics fast to prevent disaster it was great to find that the organization could continue without lrh it was great to find that you could make more clears you made 22 to celebrate his return lrhs immediate program is to finish his own clearing he has found that people dont make it with their grades out then he will start ot research every time he tries to put together the scope of ot he has to run off the invalidation any statement you can make about ot falls short of the truth l ron hubbard type 3 idate21766 volnum2 issue70 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec70 dianetic auditing 6607c21 shspec70 dianetic auditing processes today are so fast that auditors cannot be trained see p 738 above lrh wrote bulletin in april hcob 3apr66 dianetic auditing course which is now going into effect to handle this situation if auditors cant audit auditing gets done and one makes it up the line follow the fundamentals get your question answered dont change the process because the pc goes unconscious drills on trs are not enough by themselves to make smooth auditor releases can be made with dianetic auditing lrh has done it for years the earliest clears were dianetic releases they were more or less stable but they were in much better shape than they had been in dont go using dianetic auditing in practice joke dianetics is practice auditing however these processes can heal though not with uniformity since the whole reactive mind is the cause of very severe illnesses the way to make someone well is to make thetan clear therefore clearing is the real cure for illness so dont specialize in dianetic keyouts but slower process is needed to give auditors practice at auditing they must get to where they are used to the comm cycle can read meter get some wins etc all the bugs have been ironed out of dianetic auditing even turning on visio which used to be hard is easy if you get the exact duration of the incident teaching someone dianetics gives him very basic fundamentals hcob 3apr66 gives an improvement on old dianetic technique since it doesnt require repeater technique etc it was simplified version of dianetics compared to the earlier r3r technique which was closer to modern dianetic technique it involved simply locating an incident within the pcs conscious recall and running through it repeatedly until the pc is up to tone 40 cheerful on it then taking another incident within the pcs conscious recall and doing the same thing 751 the mind is 1 literal record of experience plotted against time from the earliest moment of aberration until now 2 additional ideas the fellow got about it 3 other things he may have mocked up or created on top of it in mental mass 4 some machines 5 some valences these make circuits that talk to the pc the arabs demons circuit is an endowed life object you can audit any of these to greater or lesser profit mental mass is mass but the mass of it is very slight compared to the real object one makes picture of for auditing purposes when you do an s and d you are not looking for pictures you are looking for valence if you want to change someones personality graph audit out some valences the graph is just picture of the persons valences he is hardly there at all in dianetic auditing neglect the machines the valences and the illusions the psychiatrist and the psychologist addressed things that the person himself mocked up his illusions they only invalidated the illusions without finding why the person was creating them you are only interested in experience not illusion illusion is surface manifestation that evaporates when real experience appears illusion is the product of the actual and if you attack the illusion in dianetic auditing you prevent the pc from contacting the actual the actual is so bizarre that humans tend to invalidate it by confusing it with illusion thus people are prone to call the actual and illusion both illusion as with dubin newspaper stories are untrue but usually based on real event the newspaper is the modern gossip newspapers specialize in creating illusions news is social illusion of an event if you are running an engram the pc may start by confronting illusion then come up to confronting the incident so the incident may change as he audits it pcs confront gets better as he audits dubin and he begins to see the real event the pc can himself be confused by the change dont evaluate for him about the reality of the incident he is running just put him through it again thetan is busy little bee he goes along making pictures he clutches them to his thetanish bosom then wonders why he feels sick person isnt aberrated by pleasure though he can get hung up in magnitudinous win pleasure moments dont run out secondaries contain misemotion any emotion or misemotion may be contained in secondary the tone scale was plotted from the behavior of secondaries as they were audited any aberrative secondary is based on an engram an experience or picture of pain and unconsciousness this was originally thought to be cellular memory hence the word engram whenever someone is hurt he makes complete exact record of what happened that is fantastically accurate with respect to time thetan does not make errors reactively about time he gets confused analytically about it the exact date of each incident is recorded but the incident is unconfrontable if he cant get the date he records what he cant confront and that is where he gets engrams and secondaries 752 the emeter sees deeper than the pc can but it doesnt see all the way down it reads on things that are close to being confronted it reaches what the pc isnt confronting but could confront it wont register on the totally unconfrontable see fig 29 eventually the being can confront as much as the meter can see when he is clear you can unflatten things that you have flattened by continuing to go over them in running engrams you should get them down to where there is more ta action figure 22 the emeter and confront start of auditing read 5 feet pc confronts life at this level 4 feet emeter reads at this level 3 feet read 2 feet read 1 foot floor _______________________________________________ b after some auditing read 5 feet read 4 feet pc confronts life at this level 3 feet emeter reads at this level 2 feet read 1 foot floor _______________________________________________ c when pc is clear read 5 feet read 4 feet read 3 feet read 2 feet read 1 foot pc confronts life at this level floor _______________________________________________ 753 the aberrative mind the mind being approached by dianetic auditing is the mind of events the events are often approachable through locks what person knows about is not aberrative someone can do total switch in valence he can become another person with that persons characteristics so pc in given valence in an incident may see another person in the incident as opposite who actually represents the pc in his own valence in the incident so if you notice certain trait in the pc ask the pc who had characteristics opposite to the ones that the pc is manifesting the pc will spot the person he had switched with who objected to the characteristics that the pc had before the switch but that appear opposite to the pc because the pc is in that persons valence looking at himself when you ask the pc this question the valence will asis and the pc will then get true perception of the other person in running engrams the pc may thus go into and out of various valences thislifetime address to the situation is recommended because the pc might have an infinite number of incidents to run but you can err in dianetic auditing by running too late on the chain you may be able to stay in this lifetime and key the pc out but you cant insist on staying in this lifetime the danger is in 1 trying to erase an incident that is getting more solid because it is too late on the chain you should go earlier 2 not getting the charge off incidents contacted before going earlier this is the opposite error you can hit the incidents too lightly not get enough charge off and keep going back too quickly if you do this the pc will wind up in ball overwhelmed with the charge he will be all messed up pc may himself skip several incidents and get himself into the glue if the latter occurs just treat that session as an incident and erase it as lock this is something we have almost forgotten how to do in scientology it is quite easy and effective you can erase anything if you are good you can always go through something once but if it is chain watch it about going through it more than once the whole of dianetic auditing is the tracing of experience the rules for it are in hcob 3apr66 plus this lecture additional thoughts if you get pc stuck in some lifetime run out its death the lives that are especially aberrative are the ones in which the pc almost made it there is total bank release at the level of dianetics there are only releases on particular subjects the releases you get are by chain not from whole class of experience total bank releases exist only at scientology levels 0v you can get minus releases from the minus awareness scale in fact you can assess the minus levels of the awareness chart and sometimes produce release just by assessing them and finding where the pc is stuck at but dont go by an fn during this procedure any dianetic auditing is better than dianetic auditing that is still true although some scientology auditor may knock the pc around if the pc is groggy at the end of dianetic session have him look around and notice things in the room 754 audit the pc on locks andor secondaries at first running secondaries will drop the pc into engrams dont try to cure his lumbosis by running out the engram that gave him his lumbosis auditing to cure something is giving the pc attention because hes got lumbosis ie rewarding down statistic it puts the being at effect and he will deteriorate as being you have the technology of total recovery of the being if you audit towards that you will be helping the pc audit towards improving the pcs confront and his abilities not towards curing his illness his illness is his hidden standard he is saying cure my medicosis and i will believe in scientology audit the being not the illness there is value in dianetic auditing it solves the problems that freud was attacking but compared to scientology it is nothing dont get stuck in the wins that you will have with it the road out is the road up through the grades use dianetic auditing to learn the fundamentals about the human mind and to learn how to audit dianetics is not currently for the psychotic

classification chart and auditing auditing means to listen and compute and to get result on pc who is person with aberrations and difficulties auditing has to be done in professional standard manner since the beginning of wogdom there has been offbeat activity going on that is reason to perpetuate it the psychiatrist exists for the good of the society and to hell with the patient our situation does not compare with earlier mental therapies we are not even trying for the same result we are clearing people by erasing reactive minds unlike psychotherapies auditing is not social criticism we know the answer to why the pc behaves the way he does we also know why the wog behaves the way he does scientology is road out that increases the persons abilities taking him out of his identification of aaa the road has milestones which we call grades there are also levels on grades there are certain abilities gained but these grades are not composed of single points despite the names given on the gradation chart that is the rough public rendition it is really not possible to enter the upper grades without having attained the lower grades trying to do so results in disasters the whole track falls between grade v which enables the pc to confront whole track and grade vi but it doesnt necessarily appear in either though it may besides the disasters that occur from an out gradient other disasters come from not following standard tech standard tech is contained only in hcobs not in any books if i havent signed it it isnt true some day we will publish then all in consecutive order all corrected the main bugbear of someone studying scientology is that he conceives that every time he reads something new it wipes out the old this concept is based on the fact that he didnt understand the old material that he had read in the first place so he doesnt realize that it can be integrated with the new material that has just been issued something developed later doesnt replace something developed earlier the new does not wipe out the old the old generally correlates well with the new there are very few corrections one significant correction is contained in the newlyfound fact that you can overrun things lot of old 755 processes failed because they worked so fast that the auditor didnt spot the release point when it occurred this accounts for the poor results of r212 when it went wrong it works very fast we didnt know about overrun in those days with dianetics you can have one release per chain so dont try to escape from confronting engrams by going release pcs are entitled to make rapid gains and soar on up the line that doesnt apply to students like great singer student has to suffer to be great he learns what errors can be made by being pc who gets messed up someone who has never been overrun doesnt appreciate why it is undesirable getting bad auditing isnt necessarily disastrous it teaches the student not to give bad auditing i have been audited by dianetic auditors who were trained in an academy that taught only the bubble theory nothing will help an aberrated being short of processing standard tech is very very narrow path and its very easy to stray off of its edges it is bounded on all sides by wrong things to do in auditing one wrong thing is to fail to handle pcs while auditing them you must keep the pc handled in order to audit him one way to suppose that you couldnt handle pcs while auditing them is to think that you cant do anything about something which is above pcs grade you can always run an advanced process on pc as rudiment as something to straighten the case out in hurry for instance even though problems grade 1 you can always run level 1 as rudiment for level 0 in fact if the pc has ptp you had damn well better it is not im sorry we cant talk about your problems because thats grade 1 and you are only working on grade 0 and at the problems level you may run into service facs eg the pcs lumbosis these can give you hard time in making problems release after all the reason why the chart is the way it is is that the gradation chart is made up only at the level of the grades of those things which you cant audit in the face of and that is the genus of the chart the real reason why i found the grades and why there are certain things that if you dont pay attention to them prevent all progress in auditing and in life so therefore they must be the keys to aberration and thats where we got the chart only these factors have appeared as barriers to case gain when not handled these are the super barriers to the track 1 ptps give rise to ta asising inability to concentrate inability to answer auditing commands and perhaps some degree of rising ta 2 missed withholds and overts cause nattery choppy and mean pc 3 arc breaks give the pc sad effect 4 communication problems lead to communication unconsciousness is communication problem the cdei scale can be applied to communication for instance ow must be higher grade than problems because person could confront having problems when he couldnt confront an overt dont think that because someone is grade iv release he will never again have outruds of any sort the product you have is gross product the release can last quite awhile or not it is not gold it is gilt and it can tarnish sometimes it turns green it is the temporariness of this state which is after all 756 state of keyedout clear that boobytrapped the whole research line in the field of the mind there are lowerscale harmonics of everything the thetan can do or be the state of thetan exterior is what the buddhists called bodhi it is not permanent state however even though it is not permanent release should not be underrated it is accompanied by the experience of overcoming that which the person has been released on and that improves his ability to confront also bit of erasure has occurred which desensitizes the whole thing so the releases made nowadays are more stable than the releases that were made in 1950 now we are approaching release on gradient and we know what grade of release we are making always be willing to give the pc win the clear cog is im mocking it up clears follow the rules of life until they themselves have changed their minds about the rules and when they do that of course they are ots oddly enough ot processes are upper harmonics of the same things that prevent auditing only they arent processes if you want to audit you must handle whatever rud is out when its out if the pc at grade iv isnt talking he may be communications release but you will get nowhere until you get him in comm communication is the carrier wave of all processing someone whos release is less likely to have outruds but these things can still occur having the grades doesnt mean that you wont get arc broken with yourself and with the auditor if you want good auditor at grades vi and vii become one there are interim release points on the chart that you are probably neglecting someone could get an fn on communications process without being released on every aspect of communication so he isnt necessarily communications release lot of processes were dropped out of the lineup that shouldnt have been dropped you will have to use tech from another grade in running grade at level 0 you have valence processes as well as the usual comm processes you have some more complicated comm processes at grade 1 all along the line there are lots of processes that someone could be released on r4h r2h recall an arc break date it assess indicate bpc cchs were on grade ii also arc processes plus case remedies at level iii you get auditing by lists and overt justifications there are also physical processes meter dating and cause and effect processes dont ignore grades processes as rudiments pcs dont ever object to auditors unless theyve got overts on them matter how lousy their auditing is pull the withhold pc audited over an arc break protests then screams then fusses then gets tired and then gets sad and sadder neglecting rudiments will ruin case you will have to use them on all pcs at one time or another dont ever fail to notice outruds or fail to put them in when they are out that and going nonstandard is the only thing that could bar person from going clear 757 l ron hubbard type 3 idate28766 volnum2 issue72 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec72 dianetic auditing and the mind 6607c28 shspec72 dianetic auditing and the mind when you are running engrams and secondaries you are handling the human mind what the mind was coating was the subject of scientology it is coating the thetan in other words you like blob of glup person is static the subject of the mind has been considerably mucked about and misunderstood the engram came from theory that lrh developed at george washington university man had way to explain memory if memory was molecular phenomenon man has enough storage capacity in the brain to last three months lrh wrote this up as proof that this isnt how man remembers it is difficult to think about mind harder than thinking about brain fortunately the mind doesnt have to understand itself lrh was there to understand it you would have to be aware of the fact that an individual is able to create matter energy space and time in other words pictures before you could understand the mind you dont have to ask or explain where thetan came from thetan just is this gets us into discussion of reality one has nailed this down philosophically in scientology reality is what is that is all you need to know about reality itself delusion is reality for one person out of agreement with others from these elements it is possible to figure out why man is trapped and why he acts and reacts as he does you can figure this out once you know the basic definitions in dianetic processing you have to know what the mind is the thetan is compulsive mockerupper he is stupid that is the one flaw in thetan if you can get him over this mad obsession to 1 make picture of everything that happens to him 2 then hide it from himself 3 then fix it up so it can impinge itself on his existence you can get him out of the cage he dramatizes these pictures or they enforce computations on him he does this by dislocating himself in time the mind is 1 pictures that have been made of experiences 2 plotted against time 3 preserved in energy and mass in the vicinity of the being 4 when restimulated they are recreated without his analytical awareness what is the mind that you are trying to get someone out of the trick of it all is that you cannot make postulate or an intention through this mass called the mind whenever you try the mind is restimulated so the thetan is not able to handle things or make things by postulate thetans thought cannot go through the barricade of his mockups when he tries to put forth an intention or postulate it collides splat with whatever engrams are in restimulation the less creation of his experiences the person has around him and the less he has around him to be restimulated the more he can think or project his thoughts and the bigger he gets you can delete these experiences and thereby free the being and his intentions and postulates dianetic auditing is the activity by which these experiences can be deleted the pc may be messed up because he is trying to restrain himself from dramatizing person has tendency to repeat in action what has happened to him in experience he tends to replay now something that happened then out of its time and place the thetan could give himself disabilities to prevent himself from dramatizing 758 you are dealing with the basic mind the core of the reactive mind also has this same character but it is so outrageous and overwhelming that you had better not touch it without the map in view of the fact that the individual didnt know what happened he sometimes told himself what happened and got the actual experience overlaid with another experience this is how you get too many julius caesars julius caesar was pretty suppressive which made him the winning side or valence so lot of people whom he affected and overwhelmed took on his valence thetan has trouble remembering when he is all smashed down in the mind the effort to remember gets painful so he would rather not remember one of his favorite methods of handling the bank is almost as crazy as making the bank in the first place it is forgetting about it when you start erasing the mind the person may be upset at the point where you have erased his circuits and machinery and he hasnt remembered how to do things himself as far as auditing is concerned dianetics is play it is far more than man could do before but its benefits are far far less than the benefits of scientology auditing if you tried to erase the mind picture by picture you would be at it long time say you have had one pain per year and one major catastrophe every five or ten years if you added them up over all your lifetimes you would come up with too many to erase in any reasonable number of hours or years this is why lrh addressed the thetan rather than the thetans mockups with the grades one could be clear in few years starting from the bottom and not going at frantic pace in auditing engrams there are some phenomena you should be aware of chain wont erase if you erase only the late end of it the only way to solve problem is to handle the elements it contains if it contains past lives you will fail to handle it if you dont handle past lives if an incident gets heavier and more massy hit the silk go earlier if chain has basic before this lifetime that is where you will have to go to get it one of the symptoms of an incident going more solid is the pc bouncing out of it the pc bounces out of the incident into the lock that he has just made in pt running through the incident the first time in this session this can be manifested as the pcs repeating just what he said the first time he has learned better than to go near the incident this is the same mechanism that keeps his bank mocked up in the first place he cant confront it so he keeps it in pt it would erase if he confronted it but to do so is too painful you can get this phenomenon if you use the meter to determine what to run dont use meter to locate incidents if you run what the pc can find youve got something he can confront man can remember what he can confront and that is all he is going to remember if he runs the engram from pt all conceptual and not in the incident it is because the incident is really too much for him to confront guy with amnesia is just guy who is so spooked that he is not willing to remember anything it is not just bouncers or holders which govern peoples ability to move on the track someone who is about to be executed is terrified of the future he will be stuck in the moment before the execution or he will shoot earlier some people thus escape into the past track others are only willing to remember what happens after traumatic experience 759 it is only running pcs beyond their ability to confront which causes trouble in dianetic auditing if you run the pc on what he can confront you wont get into situations for which you need solutions you could run the pcs chronic emotion that would be good project there is probably secondary for every engram so you are likely to drop into engrams while running secondaries the secondary lies right across the top of the engram if you try to run loss you end up running all the incidents on the track there are also overt chains the motivator series each engram has 2000 to 3000 locks each secondary also has 2000 to 3000 locks chains crossconnect and crossreference with other chains it would be impossible to take something that pc was afraid of and trace it back to all the reasons why he was afraid of it it will be found to occur in too many chains and locks the individuals experiential track is important because when we clear someone we get new thing being without bank who has experience when you find yourself in trap it is good idea to find out what the trap consists of that is one benefit of engram running you will find that there will be certain points of emphasis but all thetans have had experience there are specialized thetans if you cant get the pc to run engrams run breakfast if that is not confrontable have him run entering the auditing room for some people the flow of time from moment to moment is continuous pain dont try to get such individuals to confront

penalty for crime of omission in this society it is being there and communicating that are the crimes that are mostly punished but there are also crimes of omission for an auditor not being there and not communicating are the highest crimes in the area of tech we have gone from total change to total nochange the materials are all there the road to clear from raw meat to grade iv is very fast that is something you can have trouble with is an auditor it is over before you notice there is difference between wog and raw meat wog isnt even trying some processes are dangerously quick so they are not even in the lineup because they overrun too easily r212 is one of these the route is so fast that only gaes can prevent someone from going watch out here come quickie grades every thetan wants out at least for himself even the suppressive suppressive is special breed of cat he is someone with case gain the sp knows that he belongs in the soup so he is sure that you want to put him in an sp could be described as someone who is always totally surrounded by martians matter who you are as an auditor he will do nothing but commit gaes he wont just commit few he wont audit at all but he will say see i try to audit these guys and it doesnt work so its worthless fraud he rewards only down statistics he goofs up and vilifies every effort to make people better the trouble with scientology in south africa is that they are afraid that lrh will teach it to africans 760 if registrars kept this nocasegain fact in mind it would save us lots of trouble we wouldnt try to audit them an sp will make case gain and cant resist bragging about it the registrar could route them to the ethics officer anyone has the right to complain about one auditor but not about all auditors as an auditor the suppressive is only happy when the pc gets worse and he is sad when the pc gets better an sp is in state of constant attack on scientology he commits overts 24 hours day you very seldom find out about it another characteristic is that he attacks wrong targets he attacks those who are trying to help him he will not complete cycle of action if by chance he does complete one he will reverse it at time during this lecture have i said that all existing governments on the planet today reward down statistics choose wrong targets fail to complete cycles of action or commit continuous overts i have not said that and your inference on that subject is your own responsibility an sp believes that you are trying to trick him into letting down his protective mechanisms long enough so that you can stab him in the back if as an auditor you observe all these things and the pc is getting case gain you know that tech is out because it isnt working you as an auditor can be an ethics officer if need be you should know some ethics tech you have to know how to locate overts that are so unreal that they dont read on meter the heads of governments are suppressives they do commit continuous overts and they do the other things that sps do they would get case gain if you audited them having them in the drivers seat is dangerous situation ethics must be gotten in not on police state basis but on very narrow precise basis the world is also full of pts people they are the ones who cause most of the trouble hence the name the pc who gets and loses case gain is rollercoastering he has an sp somewhere on his lines either directly or by restimulation auditing is fast but it isnt fast enough to overcome the sp you could take the pts out of his restimulative environment audit him up to grade v let him go back to the environment and he would collapse the reason why the pts individual rollercoasters is that the suppressive person or valence will try to destroy him if he makes case gain therefore dont audit pts you may kill him pts person could make it however if he made it as far as the clearing course grade vi is the makebreak point at grade vi you could barely make it in the presence of an sp below this it is not possible another way to handle the pts individual is to do an s and d to find the suppressive the s and d is an assessment not auditing it is an ethics action therefore you cant have gaes during an assessment because it is not auditing you ought to get the arc break handled by assessment first before doing an s and d what can you do for an sp the only known action that will change an sp is the last power process he is the real psycho the only place that it can be done is in an org that has class viis who could run it and registrar who will throw him out when he comes in complaining of case gain because getting him to answer the question could be very difficult if you did do power on him his next action would be grade 0 or lower but until you have total control of the environment and padded cells send him to ethics if it turns out that he has been well audited with case gain you are taking your life in your hands to put him in the hgc 761 an sp got to be one by switching valences man is basically good but he mocks up evil valences and gets into them an sp is in false mockedup valence to which he has earlier assigned or postulated evil purposes or actions evil is the declaration and postulate that evil can exist thats all in the absence of such postulates man is good scientology would be very dangerous if that were not true the suppressive first mocked up badness in another then took on that valence the suppressive got in the bad valence committed overts then was attacked by other beings he is stuck in that second incident it is far more real than pt he is living nightmare anybody has few of these realerthanreal pictures but when most of us run into them we are running back into them the sp never left you and i may go back to an incident of trauma but an sp has never left it the incident is more real to him than pt to the sp all life is the threat of this incident and the personnel in it all life is this incident and everyone in pt is one of the attackers that is all there is to an sp he continuously commits overts because he thinks he is defending himself you could get in this state only if you had lots of overts before it this makes the sp choose wrong targets he cant complete cycles of action because he is stuck in time that is why the last power process works person commits overts stacks up the bank until he cant move on the track then gets the business institutions contain few sp they mostly contain ptss power processes can blast the sp loose from his stuck point on the track so that he can then be normally audited but how can he be audited on power processing in the first place by someone who is perceived as an enemy how can cop or the roman legion audit him psychiatrists fail to put in ethics on their own profession that is lrhs criticism of them lrhs quarrel with governments and politics is the same any system that permits an evil man to rise to power is bad system as an auditor you are only at liberty to handle ethics if you yourself have clean hands and if you have certainty that it is not your auditing that is the cause of case gain you must be satisfied that you dont commit gaes before you can accurately spot an ethics problem the difference between confident and an unconfident auditor is that the unconfident auditor is one who feels that he may be committing gaes the benefits of doing trs are the benefits of the auditing comm cycle itself apart from the processes used we know that the tech is not inadequate if you omit tech or add to tech it fails to work there was an additive until recently auditors were quitting when ta went low saying that the pc could then only be audited on power the truth is that case that is chronically below 20 is in chronic apathy and wont really get over it until he gets power processing but he can get gains on grades the easy way to know whether it is your error or the pcs condition that is causing auditing problems is to know the five gaes your judgment on an ethics problem depends entirely on your confidence in avoiding gaes they are very obvious you could detect them on tape of your auditing be interested in what is going on with the pc observe how he is doing getting and keeping pc in session is under the heading of observing the pc which depends on willingness to confront the pc real justice can never occur in the absence of an understanding of the human mind never our justice leaves artificial justice behind it justice is only necessary in an aberrated world or area 762 l ron hubbard type 3 idate4866 volnum2

battering ram and the planet hasnt recovered from the impact it got neglected after 1951 but it is the entrance point to what the mind is all about it gives superficial explanation of what behavior is all about it wrapped up the world of mental healing it is very junior subject when it became clear that we were addressing the human spirit working on his mind seemed of far lesser importance the backflash against dianetics and scientology is based on the fact that it works and that it is in competition with psychiatry not that it is fraud not all psychiatrists are really evil some are merely caught up in routine that they cant escape however lot of them are sps those that arent are pretty pts they dont understand what we are doing nor do we understand what they are doing because we dont have the same goals as the psychiatrists on soliciting approval from psychiatrists i rarely go around zoos wondering if i am acceptable to the monkeys in the cages in unsuccessful activities you get change of titles every once in awhile mental healers keep changing their titles at present they are psychiatrists in the 1920s they were alienists etc one reason that they are unsuccessful is that they give all their time to down statistic and keep getting pulled under if we were to approach the same area as our major purpose we would in order to make it first have to be very well and successfully established in other fields the west is scientific barbarism not really civilization yet man has to be pretty civilized before he can be trusted with much power current society has power without gentler social graces to restrain it people in society are trying to control human behavior by brute force this is very crude technology it is very dicey to put technology out for those who are accustomed to abusing technology it would only be safe if the technology itself or learning the technology produced enough case gain to prevent their abusing it tech must be able to work rapidly enough to counteract the tendency to abuse tech something peculiar is going to happen you are taking off from the tremendous technical background of scientology and going back to its immediate entrance background of course this is very easy to clarify it is best not to use dianetics as an entrance point for dissemination purposes but to get the person into scientology and then teach him dianetics as training technique we are advancing the most powerful psychosomatic technology on the planet as training technique as it advances dont lose sight of scientology it is great to be able to salvage the body so that you can salvage the being there is use for dianetics but dont put fixing up body above helping being remember that you are salvaging being not his particular peculiarities you could change someones peculiarities by finding and running out engrams if you had an individual with certain aberration you could find chain of engrams to explain it that when run would change his behavior but there is some more basic reason for his being that way his more fundamental life has been dedicated to going wrong in that direction so of course he has accumulated great number of incidents that demonstrate going wrong in 763 that direction scientology technique could release him from this tendency to collect engrams you had better be sure to go back far enough for this you need to have the concept of the spiritual nature of man if you dont accept the spiritual nature of man you cant make dianetics work because it goes back too far there is piece of scientology tech that gets him over his tendency to accumulate engrams on subject reach and withdraw with this technique you can bring the individual up to pt without bothering to inquire about which mass is causing him to crack up airplanes this could work for several lifetimes scientology is just that much stronger than dianetics it is true that in one lifetime several experiences can ruin someone it is true that as long as the traumatic shock is contained in broken leg healing can be normal or prolonged if you ran the incident even just this lifetime you would reduce the time of healing from six weeks to two weeks use dianetics when injury or illness prevents auditing patch the pc up so that you can audit him in other words if actual advance of the being is seriously hindered by physical distractions dianetics is useful as means of getting rid of them you might need to run out the pcs efforts to cure the illness in short space of time it blew anyway on the auditing that the pc had had but there was just moment when it seemed too overwhelming to permit of actual auditing so engram running was used to take the edge off engram running has some use and one ought to know how to do it spectacular things do happen with dianetic auditing for instance goiter the size of large baseball could shrink and disappear in half an hour the insane can sometimes run engrams and go sane they are just pts they keep wanting to run the incident that the psychiatrist said wasnt true lrh concluded that being sane or insane has nothing to do with someones state of case many people in institutions have been put there for other causes than insanity that is one of the things wrong with suspending civil rights because of insanity making the able more able may not be as profitable as it could be but it is much sounder as basis for organizational and personal repute and growth if you set up to cure lumbosis you are standing on slippery log across roaring stream picking up boulder you are in an enturbulated area and it is risky and prone to relapse it takes lot of effort and the auditor generally gets kicked in the teeth lrhs records tend to show that it doesnt pay to reward the down statistic it is getting so that government penalizes the up statistic and rewards the down statistic rioters welfare cases etc you could probably be very agreeable with society by rewarding the down statistic eg if you helped the retarded etc but when you are standing on slippery log over raging torrent you dont lean over to lift heavy rock out of the stream first build bridge and bolt derrick on

play working within the human race you monitor your use of technology by the society dianetics could be good entrance point in some societies eg atheistic or materialistic ones it wouldnt be so acceptable in moslem or buddhistic scientology with its approach to man as spirit wouldnt reach them your problem in disseminating is just how to tailor your approach to the group that you are addressing in dissemination you must present to person only that part of gradient of what you know about existence that the fellow doesnt have to protest and argue with to preserve his own integrity you are trying to sell him what he already knows down deep but this is covered with lot of false information somewhere however there is an entrance point get the other guy to contribute somewhat to the conversation so you can have an agreement never give someone false data just to get agreement your force and impact consists of the fact that you speak the truth truth is such fast arrow that it goes through without the guy knowing what is happening he may feel that he is under attack give the person something he can use eg data or processing you can select the pieces of scientology that come nearest to his reality estimate the guys position on the tone scale his problems his use for scientology data etc when disseminating if you dont reach to the persons reality level you will make him feel as though you are attacking him give people data they can use or they wont have much use for it if you do it right the reaction you will get is gee where has this been all my life dianetics has an important role in dissemination it is the finest dissemination material use it people arent ready for example to hear about scientologys ow techniques but dont practice dianetics on people let them practice dianetics the greater truth lies in scientology but the experience lies in dianetics it teaches people something about the mind it gives new auditors practice in auditing lrh has used meter

philosophical assumption that if you become wise you become free this is in the woof and warp of todays culture the idea that an individual can exteriorize and that by doing so he can become free was part of gautama siddhartha buddhas teaching that hasnt become part of the popular culture yet so we are slightly ahead of our time it seems to take 10000 years for such ideas eg dharmas idea given above to become central to culture so buddhas idea see above has 7500 years to go and scientology on the same time table has 10000 minus 16 years to go in other zones of the universe the existence of the mind is known in the galactic confederacy they have psychotherapy that consists of recognition of the fact that at moment of fatal accident to thetan picture is made however they think that it is location not picture they take picture of the location where the thetan was hurt and show it to him with movie clapsticklike thing slapped in front of it then the thetan is supposed to follow suit by doing the same thing to his picture and thus be free of its effects that is their way of making releases that therapy is administered to the releases in that society that pass for ots they are ot releases that is the closest other therapy to scientology todays concentration on education universities etc is result of dharmas ideas on wisdom the idea that education leads to freedom that you cant have freedom and ignorance he had tough time 10000 years ago man was more of an animal than he is today so it was more difficult for dharma to communicate with them it is interesting that education is an outgrowth of desire for wisdom hence scientology is in this mainline this would be an interesting topic for lecture or chapter of book the estrangement of wisdom from education it was terrific advance to get the idea of becoming free by becoming wise across to the savages of this planet 10000 years ago this idea is now so widely accepted that the secondlargest expenditure of taxes after the military is for education at dharmas time there was the knowledge that freedom was attainable but there was tech 7500 years later buddha discovered exteriorization gautama siddhartha buddha first exteriorized under bodhi tree he thought you did it by becoming wise one of gs buddhas other ideas was that you should be civilized and polite and buddhism civilized three quarters of asia but exteriorization was not generally doable to any great degree the tibetan lamas came along later and squirreled trying to develop an explanation of exteriorization or technology to accomplish exteriorization 766 we are the gainers from this history to the extent that there is history and acceptance of the idea that the soul exists our gain is that the idea of the soul has been accepted by many for long time the idea that there is soul that goes somewhere after death has dominated graecoroman and mohammedan thought for 2000 years socrates originated this idea in the present philosophical tradition there is verbal tradition about socrates in greece that socrates held forth for the existence of personal being or thetan buddhism advanced into the west through the essenes and christianity later the nicene creed developed from the dead sea scrolls hundred years after its development it was advanced by jesus of nazareth powerhouse with an already existing philosophy the christian church today has to contend with the embarrassing fact that the dead sea scrolls predate christ and yet contain the new testament this is just the advance of buddhism in the western world christ studied in the east for thirty years by the time gautama siddhartha buddhas ideas had gone from india through greece spain ireland etc they were alterised to man has soul but it is over there and belongs to god etc buddha thought became unrecognizable there has never before been clear only releases the most that was achieved by any of these former philosophies was release 1 dharma release by wisdom 2 buddhism release by exteriorization 3 christianity release by repentance and being good in scientology we just let bodhi ie exteriorization happen it is not even that significant to us because we are going for permanent state however if in the course of auditing someone he goes exterior you stop right there if you go on you bang him back into his body and into his bank and he will be arc broken pc exterior is on harmonic of ot but cant have it he has had bunch of losses in the past bad experiences like deaths associated with exteriorization and he snaps back in very soon scared he is not competent to cope with it he isnt ready for it you can take someone who has been insane and have him go totally sane by exteriorizing him you can also have someone go out come back in and never know it the formula for popping someone out is try not to be three feet back of your head buddhism spread like wildfire because it was such clearcut truth in one fell swoop we have capitalized upon the idea that man who is improved becomes free we have brought buddhisms twenty year effort to exteriorize down to twenty seconds we have found what kept dharmas efforts from perfection and what barriered buddhism in culture that only accepts dharmas idea but not yet buddhas dont be discouraged by failures to get instant acceptance for scientology but notice also that earlier missionaries had bank and therefore havent had pure version of the truth that they were spreading the christians civilized things somewhat but there were too many vias to get very good results with christianity from buddha through socrates through the original form of christianity through organized christianity through various arguments of christianity buddhism spread faster than christianity because buddhas ideas were closer to those of dharma buddha was capitalizing on dharmas idea that wisdom would make you free which was acceptable to his society it carried the implication that it was possible to be free asia knew that there was possibility of man becoming free very hard message to get across 767 matter how information is conveyed if it is conveyed at all and it is truth it will take root so scientology wont really take 10000 years to get across it will be more like fifty years at the outside given how fast buddhism civilized asia and japan and given 1 the result that we can produce 2 modern communication 3 the slightly more barbaric conditions 2500 years ago if you take half century to get scientology around you are really slow man you notice i said you when you first address being then you are capitalizing on the past indoctrination and belief of the being you must take this into account the magna carta is direct result on education in dharma through the church the spanish civil war of 1936 was also the result of the philosophy of dharma because in the decade just before the war paperback books were introduced people read french and english philosophers and got the idea that now that they knew something they should be free they actually resisted freedom though so it backfired where you fail in disseminating is where you run into someone who doesnt have this assumption people have to learn that individuals should be free or educated government that skimps on education is either one that hasnt heard of the philosophy of dharma or one that suppresses this philosophy out of fear in the west you are talking to christian people who unfortunately think of the soul as an owned commodity that they should not play with they are stunned to think of someone exteriorizing they are really not up to the idea of buddha though they have gotten the idea of dharma such people have gone past dharma but havent reached buddha it is to such people that you are trying to teach scientology so dont go in over their heads fortunately they do agree with the gradation scale of release they understand the idea of clear as someone who doesnt have barriers to his thinking or to freedom of his mind but they will not understand exteriorization which is in the realm of ot so talk about clear but dont talk about ot there are many undercuts that you could teach him dianetics is not the lowest undercut only relatively enlightened public will accept dianetics the public will understand the idea of communication release as person who gets rid of his barriers to communication they can get the idea that person can communicate better that person can be released from an inability to communicate wog who cant communicate will think that communications release is great for stammerers and backwards children etc he thinks its great for others in short but he will buy the idea likewise with problems wog will buy the idea that man would be better off if he could handle problems and so on up the line there is high probability that you will make connection somewhere the idea that wisdom leads to freedom is basic on this chain it releases man from imprisonment by ignorance and that is your first form of release teach person that if he learned something he would be freeer and he will be released from the idea that he cant know this is the earliest stage of release you would do well to argue with people on the basis of this first premise the dharmic fundamental because dharmas idea is the direct ancestor of scientology there is lower level of release one you would use in processing animals it is the idea that an animal could get an idea across to another animal this is not communication 768 you have to know youre in something before you can get out of it that is the main difficulty with communicating levels of release and people psychologists etc are not aware of the mind they see another bloke they dont see any mind so he says there is such thing as mind only brain which can be seen but in fact the brain is just sort of neural shock absorber looking at scientology as philosophy is agreeable to people when you put it this way you are in agreement with the idea that person can become freer released from some of his travail by becoming wiser so use dharma in dissemination your next level of release that is acceptable to the world at large is that man is spiritual being buddhas idea however dont use this wundt of leipzig wiped out buddha in the west in 1879 when he introduced the idea that man was an animal so it was ok to kill him this is like the christian philosophy advanced in the second or third century ad that man was conceived in evil and was evil so it was perfectly ok to kill maim etc it was and is justification for overts the christian has not found out that the psychologist is an atheist this is partially due to the inarticulateness of the psychologist the populace thinks that psychology is silly but suppressives and governments support it because it prevents releasing sps support sp subjects and technologies that is why the government supports psychology and psychiatry in disseminating you could say you are christian arent you then he has admitted that he is spiritual being reincarnation was only barred in christianity in the last few hundred years the former idea was that guys who hadnt been good enough had to come back and live it all over again if you can get someone to buy the idea that he is spiritual being he is released from truth that could trap him possibly this is where you could introduce the idea of exteriorization but i dont advise it dianetics can give one release from this one lifetime that is terrific release you have made an immortal the terrible consequences of death go away you can start with the idea that there is mind looking at b doesnt see bs mind so he doesnt know that b has mind he may think that b only has brain you have to put across the idea that because this fellow the fellow that you are talking to has mind that that person has mind with dianetics it would follow that he is immortal then he is released from the idea that man is matter and that he only has one life fortunately people do know that there is such thing as mind and mental things they havent gotten totally sold on the psychologists theory that mind brain so you can move in and introduce the idea of the mind being composed of pictures with little dianetic auditing the person will realize that he is immortal and you will have released him from the idea that he is matter so you should be aware that you can release people just by talking to them up to point but remember always stop at the fn vgis dont try to just communicate the data up the chart to do so overwhelms people they have to come to realize it as you progress up the grade chart it becomes progressively more impossible to talk them out of what they are sitting in at levels vi and vii it would be fatal an ultimate release would be release from the universe 769 when we say release we mean freeing we can free someone from an idea that entraps him ideas are the only real traps and one can get released from them there are many grades of release below zero at zero and up we are starting to free someone directly from his reactive mind treating him as spiritual being at level 0 we are pulling him out of mass that tells him that he cant communicate so we have to pull him out of mental masses as well as out of ideas at level vii and up we dont pull him out of mental mass we erase it we turn around and eat the tiger that is form of release that we call clear but this being at this level is still in the universe and associated with the body there are therefore grades of release above clear not many people below the level of clear look any higher though because clear is pretty triumphant level when you get an fn shut up because you have just released the pc from something you have to know why he got the fn to get him through qual ie you have to know what he is released on get this data from the auditing notes not from the pc most stages of release have only relative degrees of stability but release never unreleases to the same degree of stygian darkness that he was in before the release clear is someone who has erased the barriers to his postulating freely he can at this point easily postulate bank and some have done so not realizing that that was what they were doing clear can postulate bank and then not realize that he has done so or that he can simply blow it we are making dianetic clears the trouble we had doing it earlier came only from overauditing people also dont ever try to teach guy something that he already knows it is an overrun released person doesnt tend to relapse but he may run into the next higher levels sticky plaster they havent unreleased they are just enterprising and speculative and this drives them into the next level someone who has been released and comes in the next day with fn has just gotten into the next mass that he is going to confront releases want others to be released and cleared but dont release people to make them better for others sakes being released is something that is reward not right l ron hubbard type 3 idate18866 volnum2 issue76 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec76 study and intention 6608c18 shspec76 study and intention the name of the source becomes identified with the product like kleenex the name dharma became identified with the product rather than with the source of the product so that today you cant find correct definition of dharma anywhere the word dharma does not have its original meaning preserved according to dictionaries it means 1 supreme law 2 the caste system of india 3 fate 4 love 5 the way in buddhism 2500 years ago gautama siddhartha said that the age of love was to begin in the west in 2500 years we started the age of love by making clears they talk about love lot we are longer in the age of reason thank god 770 student should be aware of his intention in studying faulty source may be important in study student tends to assume that the source that he is studying from has some validity but this isnt necessarily the case in fact it frequently isnt the case difficult exams in universities dont correlate with excellence of graduates because for one thing study is an area that attracts suppressives like the areas of government or healing for instance in navigation the method used is what is tested in exams but the fact that you can navigate is all the sea cares about textbooks on navigation are often so complex that you have to know all about the subject before you can understand the bock many textbooks on the sea are full of nothing but disaster in great detail coast pilots are particularly full of warnings and disasters you could write any subject up to make it suppressive subject by making it seem too dangerous to practice on the other hand you can not give any cautions about the subject like leaving out the fact that wronglydone s and d that gets the wrong suppressive will make the pc sick because it restimulates and bypasses the right one the mind has been made too dangerous to study the writers of textbooks need knowledge of study materials as you study what do you intend to do with what you are studying for what purpose are you studying until you clarify that point you cant study intelligently the trouble with university education is that students study to pass exams not to use the materials in practice that is scholastic or academic study which isnt worth much this is why you get failures in practice after certification if someone studies just for examinations he doesnt have to know the exact meanings of the words thus we get very educated dumbbells some subjects are taught suppressively and are therefore ethics subjects where subject is very suppressive it can be studied for examination needing only to be memorized and spat back but it cant be applied because there was nothing there to be understood study gone wild leads to suicides cf french universities at exam time people who are very successful in life are frequently the dropouts who realize that university texts are not arranged to let you apply anything not single philosopher except mills stayed in school subject that is written up with slant or curve is relatively inapplicable too economics is good example economics hardly exists in its simple purity anymore similarly psychoanalysis has relation to freud anymore scientology is studied along the same lines that it was researched on it has curve to it if anything is inapplicable you will soon run into it l ron hubbard type 3 idate23866 volnum2 issue77 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec77 organization 6608c23 shspec77 organization business org pattern wouldnt fit scientology org because business orgs have never isolated the principles of organization in scientology org you are handling life as commodity and you are handling life with vessel made out of life this is like trying to pour water into pitcher made of water in this situation you will find out every frailty in an organization but one law businesses have not violated any organization is better than organization 771 individuals as such operating together will fall apart when they collide with an organized group brilliant leadership can only go so far it needs execution otherwise it fails an organization will normally win unless it is confronted with superior organization an organization consists of group of individuals with common goal or purpose there will never be an org that is perfect because it is composed of individuals who are to greater or lesser degree informed of the rules and in agreement with the purpose an organization must to some degree consist of sentient irreducible individuals it must depend on the individuals for instance literacy is prerequisite for democracy england does better than some other democracies because it has high level of education individuals in the us have so many and varying prejudices that none can really take hold it also has high level of education therefore it is the richest country in the world business management in the us is very tight in spite of bad leadership that will eventually cause trouble the us is doing well organization also has drawbacks 1 limited power of choice of the individual 2 an organization often swallows up the talents and potential contributions of the individual 3 it often plays hobb with the very principles that it is trying to forward 4 wrongly led an organization becomes machine that goes straight over the cliff to destruction but the plus points prevail over the outpoints organizations endure better than individuals on the whole track orgs best survived when led by keyedout ot you would think that these individuals would be unorganizable because of their differences of opinion yes they do have differences of opinions but they still realize that it is better to be organized than not they also recognize the liabilities of orgs higher posts shift lot in ot organizations the ots are minority group in charge of fantastic majorities an individual who puts together an organization without knowing how to do it makes mess law of organization large organization is composed of groups and small organization is composed of individuals when large org is composed of individuals the individual gets devalued you get lack of comparability between the individual and the group of which he is member therefore the individual feels oppressed the people vs john jones makes paranoid therefore the ideal form of organization is individuals composed into subgroups if you try to produce group that is all composed of individuals and expand it it goes all to pieces an org will remain small group as long as it is composed of individuals income tax is violation of this principle because the individual must report to the government once year thus quite apart from the economics of income tax eg penalizing up stats this will make the country grow smaller each person can be jumped on by the government without buffer you must cut out the situation of having an organization vs an individual and stick to the situation of the organization vs group 772 group does have an optimum size seven or eight subordinates is lot if person had only two subordinates he would loaf so the optimum is somewhere between two and eight so we can say that five is optimal big group then would be ten and small group would be two or three by the time you are getting up into group of seven or eight it is best to split things up into two groups the members of each section look to their section leader this also means that an executive spends one sixth of his time consulting with higher management and five sixths of his time dealing with his five subordinates director only looks to his section leaders and an executive secretary only looks to directors danger condition would consist of an exec sec giving orders to section leaders bypassing the director when this happens the org will get smaller you could move this organizational scheme out to where the org could contain the population of the planet size means nothing if you know this law of organization therefore you need an expandable and contractable system the lowest number in group should be five to six people two people isnt really group it is pair when the state breaks down the family as group the church etc the state shrinks when manager becomes overworked his area wont expand therefore if you want to expand make sure your manager isnt overworked you cant have section that is independent of other sections if you try to have such section it will float free and collapse it must have service and communication connections with the rest of the group there are seven divisions on the org board the org board is cylinder circle to show this fact we put the seventh division in front of div 1 you enter the org board at the first department of the first division the org board is organized to impel particle from the first division on out through the back door any particle entered early will shunt late div 7 doesnt necessarily catch what is ejected at div 6 so there is way out of the org board if you violate the position of anything on this chart you cut your throat the order of departments was found by trial and error earlier on we got into trouble because we tried to put origin or construction in dept 9 now 1976 the department of records assets and materials in div 3 it belonged at origin so construction had to be back towards source if something is mispositioned on the board it will be nonfunctional and will cease to work the order of the divisions is 1 hco you have to start with communications 2 dissem dissemination is necessary with the communication you must tell people what you are going to make 3 organization division treasury this is the division that organizes the mest for the assembly of products 4 tech this division has to do with production 5 qual this division deals with correction or adjustment 6 distribution this division is to get rid of the product this is also sales division when they are busy getting rid of the product they are also making new customers that enter at div 1 7 executive the first department would be the office of the ed or general manager 773 the problem in an organization is one of succession but if you get management you dont need succession the lrh comm approves anything that is not against policy that the ed wants to do the us should have the office of george washington each department should have less than or equal to five sections or it should be written up again then you get subsections units subunits etc the org board is flow chart an other primary law of management the fastflow system of management dont inspect before it goes wrong this just holds up the activities of the organization and puts in arbitraries you dont run an organization by being supernervous you let something happen then you act dont put in permanent preventers let the flow go an organization must produce something everyone must have stat the org pattern would do for government it is far more socialistic than socialism and far more communistic than communism socialism and communism are relatively conservative in comparison you would introduce individual companies into your organization as service or production units the reason why divisions are in units of three departments is that you have the head of the division representing the thetan and the three departments representing the mind body and product respectively l

introduction to scientology ethics pp 914 the antisocial personality lrh has made complete list of the characteristics of suppressive person the purpose of ethics is to get technology in ethics doesnt intend social betterment it only intends to ensure case advance by getting suppressives out of the environment an auditor must know about this so that he can recognize and handle pts and suppressive pcs this ability to recognize and handle can prevent an auditor from having loses and invalidating himself when an sp doesnt make case gain when pcs rollercoaster dont blame the past auditor or the hgc blame the sp pc who is critical of an auditor has missed withhold from that auditor the pc who goes on nattering about the thousands of hours of auditing that he has received with gain is another matter you can be too propitiative towards people whereupon you cant help them anymore you exert control and dont give effective help lrh never owed scientology to anyone one of the earliest techniques for controlling pcs taken from early dianetics was to walk out on pc who refused to be controlled with the rfactor that the session would resume when the pc decided to follow the auditors directions at that point lrh hadnt run into failed psychoanalytic cases and people who had been roughed up by psychotherapy there were lot of these people in the first foundation they were generally pts or sps these cases are much harder to handle with auditing than criminals the sp on the case may be nowhere near the pts individual or the trouble that the pts causes 774 in early dianetics pc who got better and then crashed was said to have been on manic person who is manic and then gets depressed however has just run into an sp and has gone pts there is such thing as manic its just that psychiatrists hate people in that condition and so they promptly cave them in the guy says wow at last i realize that i can be sane and isnt the world wonderful the psychiatrist says ohmigawd youre in manic weve got to give you eighteen extra shocks or pills etc the psychiatrist says that euphoria is very bad this explains away persons getting better and this will be used by sps against you as an argument against scientology the only reason for cavein or rollercoaster is an sp joe winters overt was making deal with the publisher of book one to write book to get the mds into dianetics doctor looks at dianetics he claimed that dianetics was an art knack that couldnt be taught this led to complete squirrel nonstandard tech being spread all over the place with results i couldnt hold in tech because i 1 didnt have control of it and 2 didnt have ethics until ethics was gotten in in organizations it was impossible to keep tech in and working fully because there was way to hold the line and way to get the suppressives off tech lines an auditor who doesnt recognize ethicstype cases ie sps and ptss is setting himself up for loses and for eventually quitting auditing there is such thing as case who doesnt have wall there only picture of wall the universe for such person is very flimsy mockup consisting of dubin you can run contact processes on such person cchs and he will come back into contact with the wall that you and i see occasionally he will be startled while doing objective processes to see the wall getting shaky and disappearing you may think that you are making him ot but you arent because the wall is still there for you if he were ot it wouldnt be he will realize that his mockedup wall is not the wall that is there this individual doesnt have to be an sp to have mockups in place of walls for the sp people every one of us are mockups too we arent there god knows what is there in the place where we are standing paranoid is mild version of this an sp is not paranoid paranoid just thinks people are against him an sp is person who is surrounded by identities which others dont see the paranoid may see purely imaginary people who arent there at all the sp creates his enemies out of the real whole cloth of you and he doesnt see his enemies unless another real person is there to be turned into pink alligator crazed indian or the priests of the spanish inquisition what is really there in the sps universe is something else other than people something very threatening and dangerous yet mostly this person looks totally sane he doesnt hallucinate he is just delusional he is stuck on the track really stuck he has never moved beyond the stuck point on the track an sp doesnt make case gain because person needs to have at least concept of motion on the time track to get from one end of an engram to the other the sp cant run an engram because he is stuck in past moment in time and cant move through through the successive moments of the engram you or i might have had an incident there for long time without noticing it but the sp has had the world there for long time and hasnt noticed it 775 the antisocial personality has been looked at before but it has never been fully described in earlier therapies we call such person suppressive because that is more explicit and accurate term these are the qualities of the suppressive 1 we speaks only in generalities he is always talking about they and everybody this effects ptss so they echo it but somebody told the pts newspapers speak of 850 dead on holiday but they neglect to state that 85 million people were on holiday that makes it all look sort of dangerous governments likewise govern the people or the masses not the individuals who are actually there this is where the sweeping generality comes in 2 he deals in bad news continually and exclusively he is critically hostile he never relays good news but may twist good news to bad bad news will be relayed and worsened very sp person is so batty that when he moves up in the world he makes this the norm 3 he alters any communication he never duplicates cf the game of telephone 4 he doesnt respond to treatment reform or psychotherapy the really bad sp wont come anywhere near an auditing chair the one thing this fellow can not do is confront his own mind the sp feels that he would go totally insane if he had to take one tiny little look at his mind that is why the sp goes mad at the idea of getting people to look at their own minds an sp is afraid that if he deals with the mind even slightly those spooks will move slightly sps cannot be reasoned with on the subject of the mind your crime is that you have almost made them confront something that they dont dare confront and you have almost exposed them because they are not under good control and if they love control they will be put away 5 he is surrounded by others in one or another state of ruin and cavein ptss around such person we find associates who are cowed ill failing or not succeeding if not actually driven insane when you try to treat these associates they dont keep their gains 6 he habitually selects the wrong target this is not conscious it is not just getting mad at the boss because somebody is mad at you it is very reactive in the sp for instance psychiatrists wreck people and sps in governments attack us there is complete dissociation it is bill failed at college so therefore we should go on diet not bill failed at college therefore we shouldnt send his brother pete because the sp attacks the wrong target he doesnt succeed very will on job this is saving grace 7 he doesnt complete cycles of action if he finds out that he has completed one he has to redo it he mustnt arrive and he doesnt arrive because his time sense is loused up he doesnt have the idea of consecutive events 776 8 he will often confess to alarming crimes with sense of guilt or personal responsibility whatsoever he doesnt know that there is difference between good and bad behavior 9 he supports and approves of only destructive downstat and criminal groups and attacks constructive ones 10 he approves of destructive actions and disapproves of good actions he says it is probably good thing that we had the war because 11 helping others is an activity that drives him nearly berserk however activities that destroy in the name of help are closely supported the idea is to get rid everybody or to make them all miserable 12 he has bad sense of property he thinks that the idea that people own things is pretense made up to fool people nothing is ever really owned to the sp delusions of grandeur and desires to dominate have nothing to do with suppressiveness the concept of ones own importance does not have any bearing here an sp may or may not have the feeling of being very important as may nonsp there is nothing wrong with dominance this is not the same as suppression it is what person does with dominance that counts an auditors skill depends on his recognition of the situation in which he finds himself auditing when you manage to isolate series of characteristics that give you certain expectancy knowledge of this data becomes valuable if you can see several characteristics on an sp in person you can predict the rest and unload this is an ethics case an auditor should know that there could be more than one sp on the case he should locate the other sps if the first s and d doesnt get permanent results even though it was well done you could do successful s and d and at much later date the pc could find another sp and rollercoaster from that

his student sound and look like an auditor coaching is happy medium between so many flunks that the student quite and so few that he turns into lousy auditor any coaching can be improved it is easy to coach if you know what the tr you are working on is supposed to do the reason for security measures with upperlevel materials is because you have to judge the ferocity of the material against the power of the individual that you are giving it to the only thing wrong with 1950 dianetics was that people were thrown in over their heads the clearing and ot materials look so what when one has finished them but not before if you skip half page or glance ahead accidentally while running them you will get sick the gradient approach has been primary and regulating factor in all of scientology it is new idea as an overall idea thetan in particular responds very well to this approach he responds better than body does you can do gradient that is too shallow or too steep for your pc if you dont correctly judge his reality level confront etc just little bit tough all the way is best but not so tough that you get failures it should just be hard work there are pcs to whom everything is automatic 777 they have trouble on some process because they dont perceive the things in the process they have reality in cchs there are people who will go through it with change at all they are aberrated as coots there is reality to it they dont have to confront doing the process because they arent doing it at person with reality on lions or tigers can walk though cage with lions and tigers in it you must estimate the degree of persons aberration to draw up an estimate of what gradient to apply to it if you cant make eg grade 0 release either 1 the pc is already grade 0 release or 2 grade 0 is completely over his head it is obvious which of these two things is the case if you know what you are looking for you can undercut it if you need to by raising other corners of the arc triangle for instance if the pc doesnt go release on grade 0 you could audit the pc on various processes to raise and r for instance dianetic auditing eg lock scanning words as an undercut this works even on the insane there doesnt have to be anybody else there but the auditor ie the auditor runs the bank usually it is r that you raise affinity occurs in the process of doing this you still have to estimate correctly what the pc can run if the pc is in desperate condition dont do something desperate an early entrance point is mimicry doing mimicry on someone makes you real to them it is low level of communication but it works very well especially as point to at ack with someone who doesnt attain grade 0 release if you imitate little kid or if you communicate with him he will like you he will pick you out in roomful of people not because he knows you but because you are real to him below grade 0 ie if comm is really out or is very difficult you approach with reality as the entry point on the arc triangle so you could use mimicry however if you validate insanity too long you will stick the pc in win for his insane behavior but you cant invalidate him either say the guy complains of spiders all over the wall and himself dont invalidate him pick out the real reality in what he said wall or to hell with the spiders and focus on that and dont agree about the spiders that is lie and basically he knows it so he will know that you are crazy if you agree about the spiders ask what kind of wall wouldnt spiders be on or what kind of wall do spiders like best or who would you have to be not to have spiders on you and you will shift his reality you could get clever with raising reality lrh did in the late forties unfortunately lots of therapies sprang from his ran various things in 1949 every time i audited anybody while others were watching it became school of psychotherapy because they couldnt integrate it so it ill by itself became an approach like gestalt therapy they didnt have the basic data gradient scales arc triangle etc they just copied one thing used in one case the error was made that because this was successful as an entrance point with one individual the same gradient had to be used on all individuals for instance if the pc has policemen on his front porch he at least has porch now the chances are that he has all porches identified aaa if you can introduce differentiation amongst porches you get an increase in reality and an improved state of case but the squirrels would be stuck in asking the pc about walls or worse spiders not realizing that in this case the proper entrance point would be porch 778 point of mutual reality you would get the pc to differentiate between porches and drop the aaa the squirrel never cognited on what lrh was doing he thought that lrh had knack mathematics is in kindergarten on this planet people on this planet dont understand symbolic mathematics symbolic math is not doing algebra with symbols it is solving vast number of nonnumerical variables by the use of comparisons similarities identities and differences and you cant write it down you mustnt follow the lead of math in applying the suppressive generality of number to the specific entity eg an apple person etc which is being calculated two plus two does not equal and never will equal four you have to specify two what when you answerwhat nonspecifically you have an insanity mans math is insane zero is wild variable you must specify zero of what in what interesting universe is this zero of nothing so every time formula involves zero as in nuclear physics it is guess which in fact is based on experiment and not on mathematical prediction these guys really dont know what they are doing in higher math logic ultimately depends on you and your concept of reality math is actually lowgrade expression of r and c r and c add up to understanding mathematicians along with others in denying that you being exist has dropped out that which uses the math and understands it mathematics cannot exist without live interpretation it is always you who asks the question and you who receives the answer if there are live beings to understand there is mathematics math could be defined as method of memory devised by living being to make inanimate objects or other things appear to think or act you will be able to be as much at cause over the whole thing as you are ot because the more livingness you exert the more logical you can be about it you will be as good logically as you are clear eventually you can run up to point where you dont need mathematics one of the baffling things about dianetics and scientology is the question how did he figure it all out there are lots of formulas but it is an old line one lrh is very familiar with its simple matter of arc of potential understanding you cant stand back and hate men and find out any r about them you cant have total unreality about men sitting in some ivory tower someplace and hope to get understanding of or reality on man and communication you cant go about it being careful of what you say and by being afraid to hear anybody who is easily offended had better never go into the business of understanding because it winds up only with prejudice this of course explains somebody whos terribly offended by scientology hes so offended by what he hears shut down communication he cant understand anything in the first place the first requisite on studying life is to be alive not dead or disciplined or approved of in wogs death really gets people together to approve something as in dont speak ill of the dead therefore the basis of all scientologic and dianetic research has been understanding there was mystery involved just arc plus fear of saying things or looking at things awareness depends on how alive you are im not trying to say im more alive than others i just am 779 reality goes lower further south than communication and affinity goes lower in reach than reality this sounds odd but it is observationally true insane people with very low reality can yet feel enough affection to go sane because i asked them to education doesnt work in the absence of r and c r and c are the three pins on which you adjust any auditing session and how you select what you do all auditing sessions go by gradients there is need to depart from what is laid out in the grade chart in auditing but what about the zone between the org and the world around you it is problem in 1 gradients 2 r and c for instance there are two ways to handle intrafamilial relations 1 individual processing on gradient this is the best way it is very senior to education when ethics is used to get tech in it is used to force the family members to act in such way that tech can go in it is not to give advice 2 r and c this is limited if one is present to understand if they dont understand they wont even start the process of getting into better arc this is the problem here we keep looking for some marvellous solution to any individual or organizational problem just realize that theres solution at any time superior to the ability of the person asking for it to understand there is math that would help figure it out mathematics is as good as it can be employed with understanding and as good as the understanding of who asks and who receives the answer the answer to becoming better at mathematics is to became clearer the answer to any problem is to become more alive and more capable of understanding that is the answer which pays off how do you do this you get processed and you process people you are not in position in society to reform society educationally you cant educationally inform the public all you can say is that there is way the worlds reality on communication is extremely faint what they are using the communication media for is total malicious waste the newspaper is the modern gossip r and c in the world today is not good higherlevel data from scientology is totally outr so what can clear 0t or release do he can remember r and c in disseminating and he can just be dont let affinity overwhelm the reality get the affinity and the reality in dont kid yourself you can feel on affinity and get reality never allow others to cut you back from communication then you will understand understanding washes away everything understanding is universal solvent communication is always within the reality of the person who can hear it so your communication must be within the reality of the individual you err when you tell people any more than they need to know namely that there is way out if you tell them more you bedazzle their understanding an 0t could overwhelm guy he could put him in awe or in religious frenzy but the ot is actually putting the other person in complete unreality is he does this the more vulnerable person is the less capable of understanding he is and vice versa at this particular time our power exceeds our understanding though not by much and this wont continue to be true so we get into crisis situation do we get so tired of them we just overwhump them or do we stay true to our own beliefs and continuing to suffer the slings and arrows that are thrown at us still go along in high state of arc there is real argument the answer is the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics 780 so the question is beginning to come up what are we going to do with this planet the only mathematics that will solve this question and the question of how to protect people at lower levels of awareness is the mathematics of arc and the axioms we have to be gingerly because those on the way up the bridge need protection the power of scientology will inevitably be used for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics the question is how to minimize the casualties along the way but lrh doesnt have any canned answers about what we will do with the planet he has plan for keeping scientologists from being wiped out in cataclysm we are at crossroads as our power increases we have been very forbearing we have to rely on good sense and on keeping our reality from degenerating to where it longer matters what happens to the little guys every religious organization of the past has flunked this test i hope we dont luckily arc increases as one goes up the levels towards ot l ron hubbard type 3 idate8966 volnum2 issue80 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec80 states of identity 6609c08 shspec80 states of identity apparently there is boundary beyond which you dont have thetans you have endowment of form with life the little things that wiggle for instance the amoeba or the cell is endowed an ot comes along and says let there be chicken he leaves puddle of theta to animate it this is the concept of how bodies are built there is some truth in the idea that talking to flowers makes them grow better way back someplace the thetan probably did something like this the green thumb phenomenon is perhaps lowerscale harmonic of this there do seem to be people with green thetan other natural abilities of thetans sometimes get preserved in or by individuals in an outofcontrol state so you get telekinesis telepathy child geniuses etc jung had trouble with poltergeists actually he was subject to form of belowawareness telekinesis some skills that are on automatic will temporarily vanish in the course of clearing suddenly you find that you cant do it anymore but when it comes back it is you doing it instead of machine or something jung went into only one past life that of the english druids anything wrong with thetan is lower harmonic of that he can do higher up on the scale when that goes wrong his ability on it goes into an inversion or goes out of his control and still happens in his vicinity as with jung and puzzles him it is just little facet of his ability that has been brought down with him and not yet eaten up boy wonders tend to fold up because they dont know that they are doing it it is not under their control the musical child prodigy has probably been good musician in the near past as you go upscale you tend to lose circuits if we exempt endowed states of wiggle we can find out how far down in the fifth dynamic thetan can go the answer is someplace in the insect or animal kingdom above that you get thetans below that wiggle sometimes you run into horse who is thetan and sometimes you run into one that isnt or bee who was and bee who wasnt when nothing much is required of an animal or insect you can get survival as just piece of automatic machinery unchanging in habit pattern etc it is shadow of thetan because thetan made it you occasionally find vegetables in the human race bodies without thetans maybe sometimes some thetan picks up the body and it changes spectacularly 781 body can survive although not well without thetan when it has been totally guided by thetan and the thetan leaves the body isnt on any automatic functioning and it wont do well also if thetan caves body in the body wont do well body will only get as good as you take away what is caving the body in most mammalian bodies live six times as long as it takes them to grow up thus mans lifespan should go to 110120 years the reason why it doesnt is that the human body is driven by thetan an aberrated thetan causes sick body thetan with service fac is quite capable of keeping body from getting well as society becomes more aberrated it becomes more sick one form of endowed life may destroy another form so it shouldnt upset you that you can cure up the thetan and the body doesnt get well there are variety of illnesses that body suffers from because it is being messed up by thetan who with his intention and aberration is influencing his physical body that body will get as well as you relieve the aberration of the thetan in those sectors where the thetan is causing the body to get sick therefore dont assume that all that is wrong with the body is the mind but in addition to the effects of the thetan on the body there is also different seement of illness caused by endowed life units that are designedly contrary to the bodys life units eg disease germs parasites worms etc then there is physical injury if you hit body with battering ram it doesnt matter what state the thetan is in the body is going to go splash if body is badly guided it is smashed often so you can reduce this category of bodily ills by fixing up the thetan so that he has fewer accidents however some accident is pretty inevitable in an uncleared environment another factor is the repairing ability of the being if one were really upscale as thetan he could patch up or repair the body directly or he could mock up new one lower scale manifestation the thetan stops knocking the body about upper scale manifestation the thetan can put the body back together again so there are three sectors of attack on body 1 endowed life attacking the endowed life of the body 2 aberration of the thetan influencing the body 3 mechanical damage to the body this would include chemical damage poisons lack of air etc and there are three basic means of cure 1 the thetan can repair the body directly 2 you can use beneficial endowed life units as in antibiotics to help the body 3 you can repair the body mechanically as with surgery here you can repair damage or misplaced parts eg from faulty construction of the body or cut out endowed life forms infected tissue or cancerous tissue that attack the endowed life of the body chemical repair could be in this category also eg antidotes oxygen water etc therefore to assume that you can cure everything with auditing is as silly as to assume that you can cure fear of spiders by means of neurosurgery beings do tend to an allness cureall propensity as long as you are not able to endow matter with life you have to settle for what youve got you have to live with the body youve got or do without one so you have to decade whether 782 you are looking at 1 endowed life forms countering each other 2 pure mechanical injury 3 something the thetan is doing to the body you are better off in the last sphere the first two need to be handled in an emergency but the thetan is quite capable of preventing body from recovering eg with service fac so auditing can act as before or after adjunct to the handling of 1 or 2 above you could make thetan less susceptible to 1 or 2 and you could come along after the fact and speed up healing to the degree that the thetan was preventing it from happening your only mistake is to run the incident while it is still going on treat it first and dont get into an allness about auditing and its healing effects the mechanism of miracles using religious relics or tokens eg saints knuckle bone is restimulation of the curative abilities of thetan if they existed that is the thetans idea of his own power is restimulated by demonstrating that there is power somewhere nut this is mental intervention faith healing restores momentarily thetans ot ability to do something with the body it has drawbacks since every now and then when body was endowed by thetan when thetan b comes along and puts some life into it it will get sicker some faith healers have not lost the ability to endow life or change the life endowment of body you can look around the eyes and get the stars that you can see surrounding them these are little gold balls throw them away and put in your own and you can get sicker bodies dont like having their anchor points messed around with or exchanged to complete the experiment throw your gold balls away and get the other ones back there are many things that man didnt know about beingness or life therefore he made fantastic mistakes dont make these mistakes recognize mans limitations relative to this recognize also that they are not your limitations but that they are mans therefore you need an understanding of states of beingness cavedin thetan is on reverse he is totally the unknowing effect of his own cause anything he can do is being done but he is not doing it he has lost some of his ability to have even that happen he is totally gone so estimate how far down he can go he can go down to being the effect of the effect of the effect etc of himself but this is way beyond his reality so dont expect him to got any reality on how he is doing it when you get body animated by thetan as opposed to having body that is merely endowed you go into fringe that is well below being oneself or being conscious one is sort of automatically awake automatically existing with responsibility for being alive awake or existing just below that you get unconsciousness below where he has clue that he is conscious you are getting down to the lower dregs of thetanhood and the upper strata of the human race the thetan conceives that he is body endowed life and more he is removed something he is an identity body he can be picked up rapidly from there to the state of grade 0 release quite distance grade 0 release is less the effect of causes but he is not up to causative alertness he is awake or groggy on an effect basis as he improves he gets to be less the effect both of his own cause and of others cause 783 guy who is really low down on cause is the effect of anything that occurs anywhere he worries about train wrecks 8000 miles away he could go downscale from that point so that he doesnt worry anymore because he doesnt exist and isnt worth anything so it doesnt matter what he is the effect of he can go down below that into faith i have an automatic regulator of my destiny so i dont have to be alert or be concerned about anything because something somewhere is taking care of this isnt necessarily connected with religion people will mock this state up for themselves without even knowing that they are doing it at this point the thetan is totally irresponsible going downscale from there he goes into sort of numbness further release from responsibility below this he is subject to any number of automaticities which if triggered would produce total certifiable insanity the majority of the human face is about quarter of an inch above that that is why many people dont listen to you their state of beingness isnt up to it you must keep the above in mind when asking wog to look at responsibility an individual asked to look at his mind as cause or an effect can get into such anxiety instead of looking into himself that he goes frenziedly mad say that we were in an arena someone let in tiger and you said to joe jump over the railing and deal with the tiger he would think that you were joking at first but if you tried to force him over the railing you would have fighting screaming person on your hands who would be liable to say most anything so it is with the sp when you get him to look at his mind eg to look at breakfast sps arent trying to disprove scientology there is doubt in their minds that you could make them do things and the thought terrifies them the sp thinks that you are likely to drive him mad sps think that they are public benefactors who are discrediting scientology so that people wont have to look at their minds an sp is below being able to be the effect of anything even an automaticity so when you bring him upscale the first thing he has to confront that he might possibly be the effect of is the mind and he goes sting he goes bit insane sps are below the level of insanity so they have to come up through band of insanity cf rd laings idea that the path to sanity is through insanity they are below the level of being the effect of anything good or bad any effect is bad so they have to be an automatic thing cause that has an automatic effect actually they are and aing with an endowed self your presence however can bring them upscale you can be up to the point where your ability to endow is on automatic and you get guys twitching around you when you get to ot that comes under control there has always been way up and road out but it hasnt been pursued because philosophers are thoughtful types they are noted for being reasonable and getting themselves martyred but few stand up strongly when the firing squad marches down the street voltaire got reasonable breakthrough like this isnt scholarly affair it has to be done with here goes nothing attitude to follow up on scientology person would either have to be very reassured in very quiet environment for considerable period of time if the person was pretty bad off ie normal he would have to be calmed down before he could confront something the percent of people who can confront is the upper one percent of the planet when you have the ability to confront it is possible that you could exert enough influence on the environment possible is horrible understatement to calm it down to point where he could confront and disenturbulate it enough to make gains 784 to handle the insane you go down to what he can confront being still in still environment with one worrying him with one solid stable object you could let him disenturbulate in this environment the psychotic doesnt have engrams that make him insane he is insane because his ability to confront the environment in his immediate vicinity is so low that he could never possibly take his mind off his environment long enough to look at his mind it is too dangerous just as your super sp screams when you tell him to confront his mind the psychotic screams when you tell him to confront the environment hence quiet environment is the only cure for insanity insanity is study of environments its not study of the mind there is reason to audit the insane at all when the environment is very safe and the individual is longer actively insane then on very light gradient you could get him to confront the mind scientologys problem is not the problem of making one ot if clears have trouble communicating with wogs ots have even more trouble you could endow crippled boys leg with life and heal it this would be ok unless you tried to explain what happened possibly he would come upscale to faith but he would be more likely to go into terror than into faith your main line is the improvement of the being who is willing to be improved doing this you will get enough improved beings to handle the problems in society that must be handled to snap the society out of being insane you dont want to lift people up by faith though but by hope the hope that maybe some day they could do something about it first you give him the hope that you can do something for him or about it then that he can do something about himself and it then the small hopes materialize states of beingness that man will recognize do include saints gods miracle men and messiahs all sorts of beings because man is familiar with superman batman etc he tends to attribute these characteristics to anything that is step forward for man in the past they would have attributed the characteristics of saints to scientologists in greek society it would have been the characteristics of gods man is capable of conceiving of such beings as long as they are unreal and exterior they are ok if looked at through holy book or something what man can conceive and what man can confront are two different things catholic priest professes belief in supernatural phenomena but what would he do it christs hand suddenly appeared disembodied and started turning the pages of his breviary similarly what being can conceive he can become and what he can confront being there is gap between these two things we need further definition to distinguish clears and ots clear has lost the matter energy space and time connected with thing called the mind he is not an allknowing being he moves up through becoming cause over the matter energy space and time of his mind an ot is being who is knowing and willing cause over life thought matter energy space and time that definition doesnt say mind life includes endowed cells not only or necessarily other thetans the ot may or may not be able to handle another thetan but he can handle this commodity called life so there is big gap between clear and ot clear makes nottooaberrated human being almost fly into pieces this happens to minority of people but it does give an element of fear connected with clears you are making people confront something 785 that is somehow little bit within their ken you will not find them tracing the source of it it isnt bad for them if they sat around long enough they would run out all the pictures clear puts normal people at effect without trying to do thing he just has sufficient zone of beingness that what falls into that zone is liable to be asised or go into some sort of action sometimes people fear clears little and dont quite know why they feel that way they dont necessarily associate the feeling with the clear even grade iv release can be so much calmer and more at cause than the environment that his presence can be therapeutic so as you come downscale to grade iv release they stand out rather remarkably and they are still little bit out of reach as you go downscale from there you get person who is more able to disseminate because he more closely matches the reality level of the rest of the environment as you go down the release stages you get closer and closer to an ability to influence another without causing mess directly immediately understandably and without restimulation the bridge stays in as gradient for dissemination even the book one clear was looked upon with considerable awe bodhi is probably below dianetic release it is stable for from two seconds to two years but buddhisms promise to make bodhi was enough to civilize three fourths of asia having moved out of the reality of wogs the scientologist tends to compare himself with other scientologists he is unaware of his state of beingness until he is surrounded by wogs that makes him somewhat unhappy in the company of wogs as you go up towards clear this is less true if you go out in the wog world as clear they dont spot you as source you tend to produce certain phenomena you give the impression of being in command even when you dont do anything to command people will say i have to concentrate to talk to you or you have such command of the situation when nothing is being commanded you dont bother to use this mainly life becomes easier the pity of these states of beingness is that there is limit to what one being can do for another you can do lot but you cant live anothers life for him what you can do is 1 provide safe environment 2 show way methodology 3 provide for the ethical application or administration of methodology 4 give advice 5 pervade the environment with calmness 6 mock up new leg for crippled boy but that is the limit the rest is up to the other guy unless you lead the person to increase his own beingness he will never arrive this is the point that has been missed in all prior attempts to better man the only miraculous intervention there is or ever will be comes from the person himself he must overcome the terror of becoming the effect he must be led upwards by an unenturbulated environment to destimulate enough so that he can put his own feet on the road out and walk you can help him only with those first steps helping the individual is the only way to help humanity out 786 l ron hubbard type 3 idate11166 volnum2 issue81 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec81 government and organization 6611c01 shspec81 government and organization good government is in the realm of invention at this point man is so afraid of bad turn in benign monarchy that he cant have one he is afraid of an sp getting into power also benign monarch cant wear all of his hats what makes government bad is that it gets an sp into it one sp breeds others as an sp wants other sps around him generals that advocate wars of attrition are sps they are just trying to knock off as many troops as possible the best military training is to do the most in the least time at the least expense and to keep your own people from being banged up the objective is to win that is the proper conduct of war you also want to inflict the least possible damage to the enemy because you will have to put the enemy back together again if you win this is proper war but the last four wars were wars of attrition all governments consist of body of beings against the individual the better government is the less against the individual and the more for the individual it is total suppression exists where the government is everything and the individual is nothing the opposite extreme can be equally suppressive anarchy where the individual is everything and the government is nothing in an anarchy any bum or suppressive is totally at liberty to knock anyone on the head there is perfect government the individual is as close as you will get to perfect entity why do you need government because any organization can win over individuals we thetans got to where we are today because we didnt organize as body of thetans instead we let the bad guys organize into body to get us this is the only big omission on the track ots didnt handle it on their own feet any group of organized humanoids can defeat any ot however this requires that one know something about the laws of organization without an organization the individual would have to maintain constant vigilance because he only has to lose one battle to lose everything you want an org that is minimally restrictive and maximally effective in benign monarchy the individual doesnt have to have much say because everything is taken care of when you turn over the government to group however confidence in the government is shaken and the individual must have say of course you dont let individuals make all the decisions this would lead to clown government individuals can all know enough to be meaningfully involved in every little thing there never has been democracy the greeks never had democracy just fifty landowners formed senate the senators didnt even represent anyone therefore it was not even republic republicanism is mean between the extremes if you make proper qualifications necessary for the holding of office eg that person not be below grade iv that person and other similar ones forming senate being specialists in the issues at stake could be sufficiently informed and have enough time to think about it to actually govern so if scientology took over you would have republican government after you have chosen the governor he is free to govern without any yak yak unless some weighty issue comes up for referendum eg change in the status quo or in the form of government 787 englands failure to allow the american colonies representation in parliament was an error in tech that caused rift when group feels that it cant be heard it arc breaks this is the sort of arc break that always precedes war hitler said something that wasnt acknowledged and vice versa so thirty million men were killed in emergency situations benign monarch is the best system there is time to consult anyone anyway but in time benign monarch gets tired and overworked and he cant acknowledge everybody who speaks so unless he gets backed up by representative body you get dissolution of the organization the nominal head of the organization should be out of the way except in an emergency while the country is run by representative body corporate such body has great liabilities there is lack of total responsibility to the constituents so individuals in the group dont think fast enough therefore it is best not to have generalized body corporate running the government it must be specific in its representation unlike the pattern of board of directors each member of board of directors nebulously represents the stockholders however here there is crossrepresentation this generality goes into suppression if the people are represented then they could logically only be represented by one person that is why benign monarchy works there is crossrepresentation but as soon as the monarch gets body of advisors that doesnt represent the people more than one representative would have to represent exact segments of the population when too many people are represented by one person the distance becomes too great and the people feel unrepresented but if they can communicate with their representative and get action they feel that their governmental hat is well taken care of so they can relax the us has two senators per state this violates the above principle of representation electoral districts however do have direct representation there is further representation in state government which can receive certain orders from the federal government the us government however has representative in colorado it only has covert agencies there the colorado state assembly cannot address the us government there is direct line from the state assembly to the us assembly or the senate before you can have governmental system that is any good you have to have the tech of scientology to detect and improve abilities in people and ethics tech to detect suppressives you also need the communication formula arc triangle arc break tech etc if the people have senator why have representative the outcome is that the individual states and the us government are in violent conflict hence the civil war when these comm lines dont exist an individual goes into apathy you get dictatorship of the people vs the individual or you get situation where every man is the dictator representation can be pretty big because not everyone appeals at once but if everyone does appeal at once then the representative had better do something fast war is caused by incompetent government which causes breakdown in the comm line between constituent group and the society that surrounds it the society that surrounds it may be so incompetently governed that the inner group has to be nearly perfect to work its way forward scientology has this quality we also keep trying to be better at least whenever there is down statistic 788 in scientology there are lots of builtin safeguards in the system so there is immediate need for elective representation in the future elections will be required when scientology gets bigger then exact representation will occur junior governing body may be given orders by any senior governing body in which it is not represented conversely very senior governing bodies should not give orders to junior governing bodies from which they do not have representative that ensures twoway communication situation the advisory council the international advisory council would be made up of representatives of continental parts of the world and executives who represent types of divisions of orgs it would have about fifteen members rule one may initiate motion unless that motion has been formed into an issuable directive if person wants policy letter framed he must write it up rule the chairman is given the power of absolute veto unless three quarters of those present vote to continue discussion or voting this will prevent endless hobbyhorsing proposal could be referred for special study elsewhere to be brought up later this way point of origin of policy letters is stated since that person wrote up the policy letter before it was passed members of the international advisory council represent the continental advisory councils but they also represent all orgs on that continent therefore someone from part of that continental area who feels that he is being done in or something could write to his representative in the international body as the system expands out the individual would find out that he had representative in his local continental body member of the ad council on majority signatures can get an urgent directive out on short notice provided b of i is convened later to determine if it was the right action unless policy change occurs an ad council directive is only in effect for year unless policy letter is issued the purpose of this rule is to prevent arbitrary laws from being arbitrarily introduced needlessly the advisory council has representatives from five continental areas plus one from st hill and divisional organizer for each division he represents every divisional secretary of that division in the whole world his job is to compile all the materials and specifications it is too much work for such person to do this and hold another hat at the same time so if person cant get books for instance he would write the div 2 divisional organizer if the stat of the divisional organizer is down he would get into being an authority he can get militant in the ad council the ad council can then issue what the divisional organizer has already written up in advance it is issued on the flash color of that division and it applies only to that division the divisional organizer is not operating those orgs so he does not act as bypass of the oes of those orgs conversely we will have the st hill or ww representative in continental ad councils lrh comm can also serve this purpose he has authority but he can be talked to and he can explain what ww is doing every divisional secretary in orgs becomes member of the ad council for that org the lrh comm is also on that orgs ad council to represent hco thus we get an eightman ad council sooner or later we will need representative of the ad council in each of the divisions of the org with continental org that has three other orgs plus itself you get four ad councils composed of secretaries and exec secs thus you get tenman ad council composed of the seven divisional heads plus the lrh comm plus the oes plus the has each junior org would have to have representative in the senior org we are dealing with basic ethics and organizational tech it really helps to have all beings in the org crosspoliced by stats stats dont ever happen they are always made and you have got to find out what is making them in downstat situation the errors are always gross the greatest source of downstats is personnel on thepost at all if you get stuck flow going on for too long with return flow you get an apathy on the other end cf the so 1 line people want to talk to lrh to find out if he is there it is to get the backflow going the main problem is in the relationship between the individual and the corporate body corporate body that cant act swiftly will cause lot of upset situation where any citizen can clobber the corporate body is equally suppressive because that person will also clobber other individuals the problem is to set up something that resolves the relationship between the corporate body and the individual 1 the individual must be able to get justice from the corporate body 2 he is entitled to bright management 3 the corporate body can expect contribution and compliance from the individual all it takes to make an organization is to avoid violating these when you get the consent of the people and respect for the government the thing will go on and on on other planets empire selection of governors was based on state of case when you put in government put in review of that government this happened to some extent in the us with amendments to the constitution but one reported back to the original body that created the government governed people who do not understand the theories or postulates of the government or the laws can be pretty dismayed and confused they are afraid that the relationship between the government and the individual will not be safeguarded

together scientology dictionary it requires work from lrh to make sure that the definitions are complete he will take students requests on cards and define the words ot operating thetan operating means manipulating handling you operate car etc also oneself can operate one is operative thetan is from the greek letter theta traditionally used to mean thought the letter n is added to theta to make the noun thetan we mean by thetan life unit being an individual who is alive and who is capable of thinking and being spirit inhabiting the body in greek times theta was the thought in person as opposed to his body the thetan inhabits the clay and moves it around to that degree anyone who can move is operating as thetan but ot means someone who can operate without 790 body being who is cause

someone who can operate without the encumbrances of the common clay there are degrees of operation wog common everyday gardenvariety humanoid he is body he doesnt know hes there etc he isnt there as spirit at all he is not operating as thetan the term comes from worthy oriental gentleman from the days of the british in egypt humanoid is one who has human characteristics by which we do not mean that he is human in his treatment of things he isnt it is simply that he is body he isnt there as spirit at all he will develop philosophy that says that everything is matter including the self wog is not the bottom end of the scale which would include psychotic neurotic catatonic etc this would be someone who didnt even know that he was mest ot isnt the top end of the scale either at the top you would have harmonic of the wog thetan who didnt have to operate at all in an almost unattainable absolute outside of mest altogether so he would be serene calm and dissociated with the physical universe not in the timestream someone at the bottom of the scale is the effect of everything he has to cause everything and can cause nothing someone at the top would be potentially able to cause everything but wouldnt have to but this is nogame condition and thetans are idiotic enough to like to have game going ptp exists when one has to do something about something when audited thoroughly person is longer affected by the problem similarly in serenity one doesnt have to do anything about it but one of the native characteristics of thetan is messing around he gets bored at tone 40 so just below 400 you get ot at the beginning of the universe the thetan was potentially omniscient and omnipotent but he had experience and knew nothing he was pretty stupid when you put someone back to the state of ot you are putting somebody back who is different from anyone else on the track he is operating with experience when we say ot we mean clear ot released ot is someone who is exterior and feeling great feeling powerful for just plain ot we can just call it exterior there has hitherto never been anything but released ot there are two parallel lines 1 how much is someone out of his bank and 2 how much less bank does he have using techniques developed in 1952 you can bang nearly anyone out of his head he then exhibits the characteristics of being who is not influenced by body this state can last third of second or it can last three hundred years it will make someone sane who is insane but since one has aberrations as being not just as body exteriorizing doesnt get rid of all his aberrations gautama siddhartha was exteriorizing people in 523 bc making state called bodhi we can make bodhi buddha in thirty seconds the lamas in tibet developed practices to assist exteriorization when the lamas couldnt exteriorize people they redefined bodhi to mean someone who was calm refined serene and had benign conduct it is the mental mass that prevents exteriorization this mass is composite of the thetans own pictures and aberrations that pins him to the body some people are harder to exteriorize than others 791 it is the mental mass called the mind with its pictures and masses that prevents some people from exteriorizing thetan exterior is simply outside body this happens inevitably at death it is only the worry about getting body that makes thetan unhappy an operating thetan is thetan exterior who can have but doesnt have to have body in order to control or operate thought life matter energy space and time nirvana was added to buddhistic doctrine at later date the original idea was just to get away from the continual cycle of rebirth there is goal to operate in buddhism however someone who is thetan exterior but not clear or ot may be in very bad shape he may barely be able to get to maternity ward he has power of choice over what body he gets etc and sometimes thetan suddenly regains his ot abilities without knowing how he did it this is quite rare it frightens observers suleiman in the arabian nights produced big scare about thetans lrh describes the embarrassment of the thetan in battle who hasnt noticed that his body has been killed and who just keeps hewing away at the enemy on the battlements until he notices that what he thinks is his sword goes through the enemy without touching them then he looks down in the mud and sees his old body very aberrated ot could exist he might accidentally discover that he can move mest make sound etc he is liable to do most anything because he is operating automatically he is not able to control these manifestations eg he may produce poltergeist phenomena this would be released ot those beings can be upset this is higherscale wog amongst thetans it is also possible to be exterior knowingly but unable to move anything or cause things one eventually gets tired of this and wants new body previous released ots had one with whom to associate person who went thetan exterior had hope of anything else he had shut track therefore the game of being body became functional actually an ot could mock up body out of whole cloth how else do you have body an ot like the above with or without the ability to move objects is not clear ot he is released ot since he doesnt understand his state or what he is doing but the scientology definition of ot is clear ot clear ot knows what he has done and what he is doing he is clear who can operate like billyo clear thetan without bank in or out of body the source of the bank the being himself he is making himself the unknowing and unwilling effect of his own bank he is causing himself to receive unwillingly and unknowingly the effect of his own bank the person compulsively makes up pictures when he is bad off all hes got is blankedout picture black mass that covers up the picture or pressure that crowds the picture into oblivion the black five below that you get random pictures that flick by on automatic the word bank is taken from electronic computer terminology meaning card system file system the machine pulls out certain data cards and puts them into operation or computation in the machine so that the machine can solve problems the bankbound thetan is peculiarly affected by and operates on banks there is such thing as crazy thetan there is thetan who is mocking up craziness that he is the effect of otherwise there would be hope you can ask guy with fixed picture or chronic picture what part of that could you be responsible for this is good process for the guy who doesnt know that he has mind someone can be so notised 792 that he isnt aware that he has mind the level of not believing in mind is below the level of not being able to see the mind or pictures above being able to see the mind is not having one all mental masses do is not furnish you with data as they seem to do but charge the area of the data up so that you cant directly recall it and you get hit by the picture or mass and you think the picture is giving you the data so therefore you mustnt get rid of the picture because if you got rid of the picture then you wouldnt have the data this is silly because if you didnt have the picture then you could recall it all without consequences clear doesnt have mind in that he is not the effect of this picture mechanism but the clear still has the mest universe around and he still uses body that isnt very strong and is made of cells that arent invulnerable so the fact that person is clear doesnt say that he wont get sick because there are such things as bacteria and viruses and the body has finite strength it is idiotic to measure clear by his health when clear exteriorizes he may be clear exterior unable to talk etc like baby having to learn to walk the state is stable since he has bank to snap him in again when person is clear he can more easily become exterior there are 140 clears as of this date according to lrh getting someone from clear to ot is job of proofing him up so that even if he mocked up bank he wouldnt be the effect of it cleared ot is proofedup being who wont hit the banana peel you could probably fix up clear exterior so he would go exterior to the physical universe you could use command like try not to be outside the physical universe this would make him exterior from the universe but that would be unstable until he was longer at effect relatively to the physical universe he would be unstable since he is still the effect of mest life and thought but person who can be at cause over something is not necessarily at total effect of it that doesnt mean however that he has nothing to do with it because you can fix car is reason why you cant enjoy one our adversary is the complexity of the wisdom of the ages suppressed and combined to keep people from doing it it takes lot of blood sweat and tears to face this sort of thing there is nothing mild about the way course supervisors continue to do their job there is probably greater distance between clear and ot than between wog and clear clear ot is walking miracle who comprehends the miracle so knowing and willing cause is part of the definition of ot it is not an accidental or automatic state you get to point where you can turn automaticities on and off doing it on an unknowing basis is far inferior if this crosses up your own reality in any way shape or form by all means dont change your own reality just run your auditing question 793 l ron hubbard type 3 idate61266 volnum2 issue83 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec83 scientology definitions part ii 6612c06 shspec83 scientology definitions part ii for the first time in known history there is ethics you cant lie to do people in and get away with it in scientology people who protest ethics say who determines who is suppressive that is easy suppressives have definite characteristics this universe got formed and is going to pieces on suppression an organized minority is all that has been making this universe mess it could have been good universe but ethics would have had to go in early and because thetans were acting as individuals and suppression was organized all we have to do is reverse it so that thetans without forgoing independence can organize the other side just little bit we are eventually going to become an organized majority we already have numerical superiority also they cant think straight we have overt intentions towards suppressives we are just trying to go about our business but you yourself should not go out of your way to obtain amusement by the torturing of sps simply because their valence is there to slip into the mocking up of suns is far more fun but when you do it do good job analytical mind this could be anything that thetan set up which collected data and used it to resolve problems the basic purpose of the mind is the resolution of problems relating to survival now if thetan does this you could say he is mind an analytical mind cannot exist independent of thetan man has been so caved in on the subject of the reactive mind which he knew not wot of of which he was not aware that he now discredits the whole idea of mind he says ill just do it all myself reactive mind reactive mind is an unwanted unknowing series of computations which bring about an effect on the individual and those around him it contains things like the computation all horses sleep in beds it is an obsessive stratum of unknown unseen uninspected data that is forcing solutions unknown and unsuspected on the person it is subawareness activity an analytical mind could be of use to an operating thetan it could exist if it was knowing and willing mechanism for instance much of dianetics and scientology was resolved by the construction of philosophical machines something you would draw up which would give some data that you could then combine with some other data and get some answer but you are setting down and lining up the data you are just doing think which is recorded so that you can knowingly observe relationship of data and get an answer so an analytical mind is knowing and willing resolution of problems related to survival this can get you in trouble when it is of lasting duration when it is set up to run forever without inspection and observation an analytical mind cannot exist without inspection and observation an astronomical computer being operated by competent scientist could be likened to the analytical mind but without inspection and observation an analytical mind would become reactive the reactive mind is like the opposite of the analytical mind it is like computer that uninspected picks up the data to resolve problems that had not been suspected and turns out answers that uninspected then by law become total effect upon population ie to avoid reactivity you must retain the option of total monitoring total circuit like an automatic elevator may still be analytical if it can be inspected 794 the human body falls into the class of machines that operate without understanding such machine where thetan does not know how or why it operates is reactive the fellow who is there doesnt know when it is going to get sick or quit the body line is running uninspected and it is aberrative it has reactions and effects upon the thetan that he cannot predict it is an aberrative machine because it is running uninspected it has instruction book this is major omission beware of buying bodies without directions in them so willingness and inspection is what makes the difference between the analytical and the reactive minds the difference between dianetics and scientology is that one scientology increases the awareness of the thetan and the other dianetics just erases the bank the trouble you run into in disseminating comes from peoples lack of awareness of the reactive mind you have to show it to them if you handle persons reactive mind directly you get the situation where the person was not aware that he had lumbosis and is not now aware that it is gone the way you handle reactive mind is to increase the thetans awareness of it so he can control it it ceases to be reactive when you are talking about the analytical and the reactive mind you are talking about the awareness level of the individual only the reactive mind is opposed to the thetan the analytical mind is mind that is temporarily set up willingly and knowingly to assist in the resolution of problems problems inevitably relate to survival and anything hes set up to do this of which he was aware and which was inspected would be included under the rubric of analytical mind committee set up to get data and to coordinate the activities of another area or body of factory or something like that would be the mind of that factory even though they are thetans doing it in fact they would have to be thetans doing it for it to be analytical one of the reasons why you should know policy is that otherwise the solutions and combinations unknown to you make it have an effect on you because it is somewhat reactive if policy isnt inspected and reformed to meet the condition of operation it too would become reactive mind as with us government law from the point of view of the society scientology is somewhat reactive mind to the degree that they are not aware of our existence or our effect if scientology had evil intentions it would be very easy to operate on subrosa level however it would be bad for the planet on the whole it is hard anyway for society at its low awareness level to be aware of scientology it is likewise hard for them to be aware of thetan thetan should probably go by the rule never explain dont feel that you need to explain your motives to others when you dont intend to hide them their level of awareness of you is already so low that explaining wont help at all after all they cant tell your motives be as obvious plain and straightforward as you like but if the ordinary evidences which lie around them dont justify your actions then theres sense in explaining it to the person whos challenging them he wouldnt be able to understand them anyway any analytical mind can become reactive mind so setting up an analytical mind is always dangerous to some degree 795 power the amount of force that can be applied in unit of time actually the physical definition states that power is the amount of work that can be accomplished in unit of time power has the connotation of being potential unlike force which is actual power doesnt necessarily mean the use of force power is not exerted whereas force tends to be therefore person is powerful when he is able to use force not when he is or isnt using force but if he is forceful he is using force right now the smarter person gets the less he employs force to get others to change their opinions etc implant unwilling unknowing receipt of think an implant is an intentional wreck of somebodys ability to make pictures perceive and remember its intentional an intentional installation of fixed ideas contrasurvival to the thetan in an implant someone is intentionally giving the thetan perceptions and ideas all hypnotism is is restimulation of past implants engram those perceptions unknowingly contained in the force duress pain and unconsciousness of an incident this is not the same as an implant because it is not necessarily intentional for one thing intent is the difference the person makes mental image picture by his reaction to an experience he goes out stop it in the process of doing this hes made sort of stuck wave because he didnt prevent it and just as you would make an embossed impression of something he embosses the environment if you were to press your hand against brick for split second you would have picture of the brick and moment or so later you would have the indentations of the brick because you pushed something at the brick similarly if you pull on rope you make an impression this would be analogous to secondary the thetan pushes back against what is pushing him or he pulls in against what is leaving him it is at the point where he resisted the motion most that he gets stuck thetan can make and exert energy when he tries to fend something off or hold something in he pushes or pulls back against something he gets picture of the moment when his resistance was great that could be an engram secondary lock or implant problem intention counterintention goal countergoal or purpose counterpurpose goals problem mass the gpm is so named because when there are two intentions counteropposed one has problem and the opposed forces or goals tend to produce mass the russians statement of this is dialectic materialism that all ideas are born out of the meeting of two forces that is backwards when two ideas oppose each other they create force that shows you where they are on the tone scale if you hit guy hard enough hell think gpms consist of pairs of opposing ideas two opposing ideas produce mass the thetan cannot asis either side hence the mass remains the mass of gpm is mental energy mass but it can be in the physical universe too pandeterminism and selfdeterminism pandeterminism is the ability to see or asis both sides of conflict or problem if one is totally pandetermined he has mental mass because hes seen both sides of everything he can see two ideas at once even though they are opposed selfdeterminism is laudable because it is rare but it is not as good as pandeterminism if guy justifies what he does you know immediately that he is selfdetermined not pandetermined this is the quickest test there is wholly reactive person will oppose any idea put to him 796 conservative or reactionary tends to be against everything you propose so if you give him his own ideas you give him problem because his first impulse is to be against them cf symptom prescription and the interpersonalists this is such horrible thing to do that it is normally looked upon as fightin words like you think youre pretty good dont you you have made the guy resist his own ideas the above type of person is on lowerscale mockery of pandeterminism he can carry out raging argument with second person that doesnt say word the whole time like well youre going to say and you think but there is ability of thetan that doesnt have lowerscale mockery or exaggeration emotion response by wavelength affecting as individual or another which produces sensation and state of mind intention something which one wishes or intends to do it is an impulse towards something it is an idea that one is going to accomplish something he means to do it affinity affinity has nothing to do with emotion its the ability to occupy the space of or be like or similar to or to express willingness to be something i like you means i would just as soon be you i would just as soon occupy your space when two individuals dont like each other they wont occupy each others space or viewpoint they dont want to be like the other person etc dissimilarity must exist when this becomes sufficiently strong person enforcedly becomes like the other fellow which is an overwhelm home universe the universe thetan made for himself here we find the rock which we audited for and assessed out meaning shape of something on which we could then run process we had in the past theory that it was the first object on the track that the fellow had made we would run fiveway help on it and make fast stable release of very high order religion religion means basically the search for truth deddedex deduced something or other it means that the overtmotivator sequence went backwards deddedex is the overtmotivator sequence wrongway to so that you hit joe and then he hits you thats deddedex the original connotation was that although it went this way you had it figured out that he must have hit you first so you invented something that he did to you to motivate your hitting him its phony overtmotivator sequence it is what guy does to justify an unmotivated overt it means the overt act explained the fact of having hit someone without provocation plus means of explaining having hit him is the deddedex after you commit the first action you invent something to explain it deddedex deeddeed explained somatic mind this idea was added to the first book by donald h rogers john w campbell and the publisher i found it in the glossary so there it is its the mind that runs the body independent of the body and the reactive mind it is physical coordination switchboard system in view of the fact that we dont know how it runs we really have business declaring the existence of mind that we dont really know about the early introduction to dmsmh with the part about the wheel and the arch describes the book its first line was written by walter winchell and the rest was written by the publisher 797 anchor point something the thetan put out to make space buttered all over the universe very badly disoriented and dispersed when someone in this case condition is asked to spot spots where he is an improper process the proper process is to have him spot spots where he is not he will point all over the universe this is the reaction of this very dispersed case to this question from which this term is taken he will think that he is everywhere it is an im over there case perhaps this condition comes from leaving anchor points all over the place and appearing in one or another of these points tiger drill one of the drills that has been adequately discussed in bulletins it uses tiger as nonreactive word see pp 295295a above computation to figure out 2 x 2 4 computing psychosis one who from his psychosis figurefigures hes inconstant in his conduct hes computive hes got crazy explanation hes obsessively solving problem that doesnt exist dramatizing psychotic one patterned action which is insane and which the person runs over and over when he is not doing that particular action the dramatizing psychotic is remarkably sane he is consistent in his conduct arbitrary something introduced into the situation without regard to the data of the situation arbitrary means stand alone someone says x must be done or x is true if that is introduced without observation without any refutation of what was there previously into formula situation admin action of line it will cause ripple this ripple then needs to be solved so someone else will introduce an arbitrary solution to the introduced arbitrary it leads to further arbitraries being introduced to handle resultant outnesses this is the stuck five held down five phenomenon an urgent action may be an arbitrary as in the tech of handling an urgent directive see p 785 above this must be replaced by something based on observed fact it is only in force until data can be gotten an example of an arbitrary would be an education that boy never understood like an education without purpose harmonics any wavelength action or scale has reverberations up and down by doubles or halves in the field of art it means agreement with in scientology upper harmonics refers to welloff cases in scientology it means similarity or repetition of something at higher or lower point on scale lower harmonic is lower similarity which is nutty related to higher harmonic this is based on the tendency of wavelength to repeat itself the lower you go in terms of awareness the more weird the repetition is in music it means coaction or similar action like resonating strings for instance lower harmonic of figuring out math table is doodling it is similar action but less aware therefore harmonics apply to the awareness scale the term lowerscale mockery expresses the idea of harmonics more usefully for our purposes ridicule is based on this you can feel that your ideas are crazy even if they are not if you hear them expressed or mocked by nut or true believer like caricature i was trying to figure out what to do with the org i was trying to figure out what england would do by trying to figure out what she should do to straighten things out politically i was trying to figure out which way this was going to go to figure out if i should expand the organization or whether to enter dollars into the country or hold them out and i ran into guy outside the door who said that he was disraeli and was going to help england 798 l ron hubbard type 3 idate131266 volnum2 issue84 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec84 scientology definitions part iii 6612c13 shspec84 scientology definitions part iii scientology is an extension of the work of gautama siddhartha 2500 years ago gautama sought to end the cycle of death and rebirth by showing an individual that he was spirit not dependent on bodies we accomplished his goal of exteriorizing people more successfully in 1952 but the wisdom of buddhism was enough to civilize threefourths of asia it is the oldest and biggest religion on this planet it predates christianity by 500 years probably the shreds of buddhism came into the middle east with the silk and spice merchants who following alexanders ventures to india in about 333 bc discovered that there was europe and made trade contact with europe this sparked religious revival buddha predicted that in 2500 years the entire job would be finished in the west thats in the pali canons well we finished it buddha never pretended to be other than just man and his movement the first international religious movement was open to anyone buddhism has moved in its technology not one inch further than it was pushed in tibet until 1952 when we started exteriorizing people the essence of religion is the fact that man is spiritual being all religions hold this in common but only in buddhism was this ever proven any forward push like buddhism runs into sps who are afraid that if you got better you might knock them off or at least stop their games the basic goal of psychiatry today is to wipe out religion they say anyone who is religious is psychotic if they succeed in knocking out our church they will go after bigger ones this is really all that its all about as long as religion brings solace to man as long as churches stand in any way for the spiritual freedom of man psychiatry will not really be able to progress therefore psychiatry should not be allowed to wipe out small church and then go on to bigger church and bigger church and so take it all over the government has right to comment upon religious beliefs or practice they are telling us that we must not do something we are not doing we are not treating the sick and the insane there is law against increasing peoples ability or intelligence and that is all that we are doing psychiatry is demanding its right to kill or maim any human being after it states that hes crazy if they can do that they can control the planet politically but they will fail because they cant complete cycle of action or choose right target there is law against making people better or more intelligent also when someone tries to cut pure theta line it tends to blow up against him our victory was the victory of the individual over fate and the universe if we win everybody wins crushing the opposition on the way up is hardly worth doing inversion it should go one way and it goes the other way it inverts it collapses in on itself downward when person is introverted he would look in on himself its reverse scale as one factor progresses the other factor degresses it goes backwards exteriorization an action which i have just described as the history of buddhism thetan walks out of or exists out of body exteriorization is the action of moving out of body psychiatrists boobytrap this by claiming that insane people can exteriorize in fact if they do exteriorize they are sane while they are exterior see p above 799 interiorization people who are interiorized interiorization is not the reverse of this it means going into it too fixedly and becoming part of it not just going into your head you could interiorize into work or into most anything exteriorization means the spirit moving out of the body restimulation the reactivation of an existing incident some approximation of the original incident causes it to go into play there is point where it was restimulated the restimulation is usually unknown to the person if it were known he would immediately recover unknown it tends to have an effect upon the person by picking up restimulations you can knock out of action sn engram without running it it is as though the engram sat over in locker undisturbed and not troubling the person then one day he passes truck and the engram drops out of locker and the person doesnt know what it is so he becomes the effect of it if you picked up the moment of its restimulation it would drop back into locker and cease to trouble the person it is upon this fact that the whole subject of releasing depends the erasure that occurs is the erasure of these points of restimulation destimulation destimulate means to take away the restimulation it does not mean the erasure of the original incident it is the knocking out of the point of restimulation genetic entity cytology the study of cells conceives of an endless stream of protoplasm passing through time with branch tracks that are bodies your current body is supposed to have originated from sea of ammonia by the process of reproduction it is supposed to have dome down to pt if that were the case then somewhere along the line blueprint for body would have had to enter the line in the days of dianetics good way to account for past lives was to say that they were incidents on the ge line cf history of man the darwinian theory is an explanation of this unending stream of protoplasm we find that this theory doesnt actually hold good man is spiritual being you should be able to find the blueprint in the body we used to think that it showed up on the emeter actually it doesnt only you do first overt this would be the first on chain of overts if guy has an impulse to commit given overt you could trace back down the chain to the first one and theoretically he would blow the impulse cf expanded dianetics but you should not try to process specific type of aberration its quite fatal because in the first place its an eval for the case also it is condemnatory negativetype process it doesnt validate the person at all you dont validate the person by finding his nasty habits and trying to process them the percentiles of successes when specific aberrations are addressed is too low this procedure is not successful because you are not validating whats right with the person you dont have to find out whats wrong with person to make him right you just get the guy to be able to communicate then you get him to look at his problems and you find out that he has been resolving them by committing overts you get him over doing this then you find that he is very arc broken with life and you get him over that then he gets to where he discovers that he has great solution to everything and every time he has bad break he goes and lies down and is horse or something but we are not interested in his solutions and were not treating him for that reason all of these things are simply increasing the abilities of spirit not healing whats wrong with it 800 entrance point to this universe classified information many times on the time track one has been told that he just entered this universe it is big swindle ot activities those programs conducted by ots to assist scientology anchor points gold balls body is constructed in space framework you can see these things at least some people can when person has dark hollows under his eyes it is all the little gold balls grouped together under the eyes that have caved in and gone black if you could shift the gold ball framework of the body you could probably bend joints backwards etc every once in awhile somebodys face is out of shape or something and you get him to pick up the gold ball and put it back where it belongs or something or you get him to put bunch of balls out there to remedy his havingness of that particular ball this is anchor point processing from way back when all of sudden instead of lying against his face the gold ball goes back where it belongs and the pc reasserts his sense of balance his face will actually change shape this has to do with the structure of bodies and what the space is in which the body is formed it is apparently one of the ways in which bodies are mocked up i wouldnt look for them if i were you its rather fraught with disaster in some cases gold balls are used in mocking up the body in space first and second postulate if you find the first postulate that was made relating to certain situation you can ignore the second postulate about 1952 lrh tried to make an endall of this he looked for the first postulate that one ever made on the track see pp 1415 above on the first and second postulates we now find that its not necessary to have that energy potential of motion or power the modern physics definition is that energy is small waves flowing it is force or flow or potential force or flow from something to something or ability to accomplish work or to accomplish movement rather doubtful idea that we are taught to believe is that if something moves from point to point b 1 you need energy 2 you develop energy if you really know about the system of energy you wont need huge amounts of energy to move particles if person really understands something he can do remarkable things with it modern physics hasnt done that well with rocketry it is not very efficient so energy is potential or actual motion or force flow progress of particles impulses or waves from point to point b or in any direction there is direction to it which rather outlaws the idea of dispersal dispersal is not flow flow has the connotation of being somewhat directional if something flowing off mountain is getting wider and wider it can cease to be flow and become flood energy is flow of particles waves etc in some direction flow is limited and directional progress of particles through space thought not to be confused with life and the spirit thought is spaceless positionless product of thetan containing meaning the greeks confused it with life the original mistake is in the word theta for the greeks theta meant life or thought thought is not life and it is not spirit lambda life in the dianetic axioms dianetic axiom 11 it is an unused symbol today 801 nothing this implies that the thing is but is being noted you couldnt notis something that wasnt in the first place its an assertion against fact counteremotion the emotion which greets the emotion it is point exerting an emotion against point b emotion is normally something that has flow wavelength and meaning mixed up with it any emotion could counter any emotion so counteremotion means any emotion that is countering an existing emotion when you take apart the emotion in bank you can pick out the emotion and counteremotion counteremotion is the emotion that is used to meet situation and which does meet it counteremotion is an interesting study it is related to politics and control of humans for instance the counteremotion to hitlers rage in germany was enthusiasm the advertising field is also very interested in counteremotion the advertising exec comes up against it because he tries to counter want with an emotion but want isnt an emotion so there is counteremotion so you have to know what emotion could create desire for the product and counter that memory and recall there is difference between these two terms thats significant to the auditor recall however implies that you bring it up to present and look at it it has that connotation whereas memory has the connotation that you simply knew it had happened so the two terms have two different connotations but they are very easily interchanged because person doesnt have to bring things up to pt when he is clear he doesnt do this any longer there are lot of things that he doesnt bring up to pt to recall them he can recall them in detail and tell you exactly where they are without having them brought up into the present to review to that extent the modern clear is far in advance of the book one definition of clear the reason one cant recall is totally contained in the fact that his memory is totally surrounded by mass which prevents him from recalling if you got rid of all the mass of the mind you wouldnt have anything to recall correct actually it doesnt work that way at all when you get the mass off recall is easy it is undue duress in the incident that prevents recall so the individual gets picture of the incident to read it because he cant enter the incident where it is the mental energy you used in bailing out of lions cage would prevent you from remembering that you had been in the lions cage therefore amnesia is the situation where person is protecting himself from so many dangers on the track that the mass prevents penetration because the part of the track for which he has amnesia is so heavily charged confidence an expression of trust degree of trust inflation is an expression of confidence in the government money is symbolized idea that goes bad when confidence in the issuer drops that is why they put pictures of kings and presidents etc on money they try to associate money and its issuer trust and distrust is composed of past experience total trust is looked on as total idiocy but it is the only condition under which you can exist we didnt arrive through suspicion certainty the degree of willingness to accept the awareness of an isness it is very conditional thing since in the first place it is questionable whether any mass has mass scientologist does not start out from where did the wall come from but just from is the wall there and if it is there the scientologist can have certainty on it it is possible to generate uncertainty by asking what is brainwashing is the trick of mixing up 802 certainties to unconfuse someone it is only necessary to have him regain some certainties person arc breaks if his certainties get shifted an education can be made hypnotic by qualifying everything so that it becomes sort of generality and definitely an uncertainty generality any unspecific statement tends towards generality its the substitution of plural for singular or greater for lesser this may or may not be intentional dispersed people talk in generalities classifying anything comes under this heading for instance it is not really boys it is boy boy boy etc cf korzybskis general semantics classifying is necessary but it is very dangerous classifications occur in the bank they is always one person you will always find out exactly who they is on meter the generality is the primary tool of the sp it is used to prevent reach as in everything is all covered with germs johnny suppress to squash to sit on to make smaller to refuse to let reach to make uncertain about his reaching to render liquefy by heating or lessen in any way possible by any means possible to the harm of the person and the fancied protection of the suppressor the sp often expresses generalities to the suppressed person thus surrounding him with generalities the invention of germs was bit suppressive the suppressive uses tricks and mechanisms to prevent reach postulate to generate or think concept concept is think thought to postulate implies requirement that something goes stops turns white goes blue or remains blue or that it is something or that it isnt something or that some action is going to take place etc postulate implies conditions and actions rather than just plain thinks postulate is associated more with intention than it is with thought it has dynamic connotation havingness the feeling that one owns or possesses it is possible to wear coat without having coat mere possession does not make havingness confronting ability to front up to confronting is derived from withfronting so there is dim connotation that if you confront the door the door is confronting you coaction is implied but this does not actually exist in our meaning of the word confront is the ability of the individual to face up to look at stand up to stand in front of be near see visualize or otherwise perceive something by extension if you cant confront something you cant handle it thetans have been steamrolled by confronting total confronting is not the total answer there are times to stand up and glare and there are times not to when person can selectively confront or not confront anything then of course he has total power these do go together when thetan doesnt want to confront something he tends to mask it to turn away from it and it tends to make him an effect if he cant make an effect on it it can make an effect on him however in fact to stand in front of an automobile going 60 mph and to let it run over you just to demonstrate that you are not afraid of confronting it is assininity if you ask person whether he can confront an automobile going 60 mph and he comm lags you know that he is down into an obsessive confront and feels that there is some sense in your asking him to do it he has the idea that there is something wrong with him if he wont go and do this willful and knowing 803 confronting or willingness to conceive the idea of or to confront or not to confront these concepts are all contained in the single idea of confronting if you felt that you had to be able to stand up to anything that would be to confess that you couldnt stop anything from occurring im willing to confront putting my arm out to an automobile traveling 60 mph and having it stop to that extent i am willing to confront this is not conditional confronting what are the conditions under which you would be willing to confront this is not fair question one wants to lead life of ruin though some have made it into virtue eg the stoics it is philosophical booby trap they persuade people that they should be willing to live life as dopeaddicts bums and in total ruin in order to demonstrate that they can confront this kind of life that is suppression it has precious little to do with sanity but it is terrific process in that the individual will come up to finding out what he is obsessively confronting as well as what he is willing to confront and what he doesnt have to confront one thing he might find out is that he doesnt have to go on confronting forever in fact he is quite tired of standing there so desire to have challenge concerning existence only relates to being willing to engage in larger game as the power to confront or not arises selectively an individuals selfdeterminism arises accordingly very often thetan who never likes to be moving explains the fact that he got run over by x by saying that he was perfectly willing to confront it he is happy that he got run over by x because now he has had such an experience he says well it was good experience but i never want to do it again when person can control things he can selectively confront when he loses that ability he says well at least i can confront it the thought that you cant do anything about anything is very humanoid and deadly there is suppression at work if person gets the idea that because he has the ability to confront anything he must therefore confront everything this is an invalidation of his ability to control and change undesirable aspects of the environment this is sp talk it is very different from being willing to confront anything it is only when you lose the ability to handle situation that you justify your inability by the thought that you can confront the disaster that thereby ensues weve run out of time i leave you confronting your sins thank you l ron hubbard
