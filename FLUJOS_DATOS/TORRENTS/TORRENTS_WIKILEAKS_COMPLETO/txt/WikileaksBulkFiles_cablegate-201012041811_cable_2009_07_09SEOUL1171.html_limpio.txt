unification minister hyun intaek outlined kim jongils health and succession concerns key figures and the current state of the dprk for as campbell although kim jongil kji remained firmly in control of the regime for now he was unlikely to live beyond 2015 on succession hyun observed the current succession preparations for kim jungun were rushed and anticipated additional fireworks either third nuclear test or missile launches at the end of the current 150day campaign scheduled to end in midoctober north korea would return to dialogue afterwards north korea is suffering from severe food shortage and devastating economic crisis caused by lack of foreign aid economic foundation and decent harvest the situation is worse than the 1996 1997 crisis because the economic uncertainty is taking place during not after power transition period desperate for cash hyun believed north korea would sell nuclear technology to potential buyers north korea desired to be strong state ideologically militarily and economically nuclear power would allow two of the three ideological and military strength the role of the dprk foreign ministry diminished after kim gaekwan failed to deal with the united states the kaesong industrial complex kic remained source for cash for the dprk it was also potential window of opportunity for interkorean cooperation and at the same time potential political liability for both koreas hyun believed north korea after kjis death would look very different than the current state and require economic assistance from south korea and the united states hyun also underscored the importance the usrok cooperation and believed unified korea should be nuclear free end summary kjis heath and succession 2 c while kjis overall political power remained firm and strong his health was weakening hyun said south korean analysts believed that kji was unlikely to live more than 3 to 5 years although he seemed to be doing better lately mou had not discovered any firm basis for rumored pancreatic cancer reports of which stemmed from japanese press article with beijing source wang jiarui director for prc communist party international liaison department told hyun that when he had met with kji in january wang could not detect any scars on kjis head from his widely reported surgery after suffering stroke also kji did not look as though he would die soon when he attended the 15year commemoration of the death of his father kim ilsung on july 8 kji remained for the entire duration of the celebration over three hours and met with his staff for about 20 minutes after the event 3 c hyun observed that the current rushed pace of succession preparation in the north was noteworthy semiofficially hyun said the transition had started with some power and authority already transferred to the youngest kim jongun who had already been recognized publicly as young commander and brilliant star the current 150day campaign scheduled to end in midoctober was to provide boost to smoother transition hyun said he expected further nuclear andor missile tests in october perhaps after that north korea would return to the nuclear talks return to dialogue after october 4 c hyun said it was only matter of time before north korea returned to the nuclear talks the only question was when north korea faced severely degraded economy serious food shortages and shortage of foreign currency it could resist for while but not for long time the five parties therefore should focus on how to manage the return of north korea to the negotiations if the return was not well managed there would be poor results the united states and south korea must apply patience and pressure the current state of north korea 5 c according to hyun north korea now faced very difficult economic situation similar to the conditions in 1996 and 1997 hyun pointed out that north korea produces nothing and had meaningful trade with the outside world on food hyun said that north korea was now asking private rok entities for food assistance hyun confirmed that the rokg did not send food aid or fertilizer to the dprk from 2008 to present having also refused us food aid the dprk was severely suffering and the food situation would not improve soon hyun said since early july north korea had suffered from unusually heavy rainfall which would have devastating effect on the harvest this year 6 c on interkorean trade hyun cited data from the korea development institute kdi which showed sharp decrease in interkorean trade over the past six months moreover interkorean projects such as mt kumkang and kaesong city tours major sources of cash had dried up completely because they were closed in july and december 2008 the remaining legitimate cash flow for the north is now the kaesong industrial complex kic from which the north receives about usd 35 million for its 40000 workers hyun believed that north korea could and would sell nuclear technology and even plutonium 7 c hyun assessed that pyongyangs nuclear and missile tests were to earn one big deal with the united states north korea wanted to be recognized as nuclear state north koreas goals were to become ideologically militarily and economically strong state aiming to achieve strength in all areas by 2012 the year when north korea will enter the gateway to become strong and prosperous nation according north korean schedule hyun said the ideological goal was already achieved through kim ilsungs juche or selfreliance ideology the dprks aim to become military power was nearly achieved through the norths nuclear and missile capabilities in north koreas view ideological and military strength would come from becoming nuclear power when north korea would gain strength on all three fronts it would also obtain the recognition and respect from the rest of the world key players 8 c hyun identified jang sungtaek as the central figure in north korea at the moment probably the secondincommand however jang did not oversee serious military issues including nuclear and missile programs on military issues key authority was held by the national defense committee among the committee members hyun said joo koochan was responsible for the rocket launch and oh kukryul and kim youngchoon were key decision makers within the military other national defense committee members such as cho myungrok who had met president clinton were not doing well because of old age oh kukryul and kim youngchoon were also old but remained active according to hyuns sources kim youngchoon suffers from bad hearing but remained one of kjis close confidants apparently kji called for kim youngchoon twice on july 8 at the celebration of the 15th anniversary of kiss death clear sign of influence hyun also identified kim jeonggak as very powerful but underscored that kji still controls everything including the military diminishing foreign ministrys role 9 c in the past the dprk foreign ministry enjoyed some of influence and power as checkandbalance element of the dprk regime currently that balance system has broken down and the foreign ministrys role has diminished considerably one reason for this downfall according to hyun was the perceived failure of the sixparty talks 6pt where kim gyekwan did not deal with the united states successfully hyun said that the north korean authorities expected lot from kim gyekwan but he had failed to deliver kaesong industrial complex kic 10 c hyun saw the kic as window of opportunity for interkorean development especially in introducing south korean capitalism to the north run by south korean managers and machines the kic provides glimpse of the south korean way of life to over 40000 north korean workers and their external families the workers change in appearance and way of thinking was visible hyun said the 40000 kic workers could spread the south koreas way of life to their families thus directly affecting some 150000 people around kaesong city hyun also noted that the kic was divisive issue in south korea too the north could use kic to divide the south hyun assessed but still hyun said most of south korea including the rokg did not want the project to fail way forward 11 c hyun believed north korea after kjis death would look very different requiring considerable economic assistance from south korea the united states and international community hyun advised that in case of sudden collapse in north korea the rokg and usg should move quickly toward unification of the korean peninsula there was disagreement among rok agencies on this point hyun said the usg could expect full cooperation from the rokg unification was the goal of south korea hyun underscored the importance the usrok cooperation and stated that unified korea should be nuclear free 12 u as campbell has cleared this message stephens
