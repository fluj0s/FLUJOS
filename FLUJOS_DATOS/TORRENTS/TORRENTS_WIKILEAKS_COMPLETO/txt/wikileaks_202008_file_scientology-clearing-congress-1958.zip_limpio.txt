lectures shoreham hotel washington dc july 4 l958 the fact of clearing lrh enters to resounding applause thank you very much now youve got all discombobulated laughing thank you welcome to the clearing congress im glad youre here too this is really rather memorable occasion this is the first congress where we can go straight down the line and say this is how it is done these are the important facts these parts of scientology cannot be done without and the other parts we can sure forget about at this congress we can bury all of my crimes chuckle without even headstone for eight years now weve been struggling along trying to make the grade trying to keep the show on the road and trying to alter this thing called chuckle called civilization civilization that collection of gadgets which makes everybody helpless laughing and we have made an enormous amount of progress and that progress is due as much to you as to so thank you eight years ago it was pretty thin look terrible facts arose and smacked us in the face yes i have been able to handle some human beings in such way as to produce new human being otherwise i wouldnt have known about this state of being if i hadnt done it but then i tried to explain how it was done the people i explained it to were not stupid that had nothing to do with it its just that the language and selection of importances had not yet been brought to bear to communicate the subject adequately we had in book one simply more less than rather adequate description of the reactive mind the mental image picture the engram secondary and so forth we had ways to run these things but those ways were not the ways used to clear now thats very interesting that i could be guilty of an oversight to that degree and only having accomplished the fact again and communicated it successfully can i bring up this much guilt i have guilt complex of course laughing and here we have here we have state of affairs where all of these materials can be communicated where the elements are found to be rather simple where the general state of affairs in telling somebody how to do it is rather easy and in addition to that in addition to that we have ways and means of changing persons viewpoint sufficiently so that he can clear somebody and that that takes some doing thats rather interesting because there are some people who start out to set somebody free that is what they think they think well ill set this fellow free then half way through the intensive they say well i dont know im not so sure should i set him free or shouldnt i well in view of the fact that im dead in my head yet he might go buzzing around or he might take over my wife or my body gee whiz he might even get down to assuming my social security card and that would be terrible and therefore therefore i dont know and at that moment you get the introduction of few minor innocent flubs little flubs they dont amount to much knock an ashtray off the desk inadvertently running help you know tell some way you couldnt possibly help anybody laughing were all guilty of it some time or another i found myself auditing somebody who has criminal record the like of which the fbi never dreamed of the fbi thinks theres such thing as criminal mind thats always big joke to theres criminal mind and theres noncriminal mind i could never figure this out theyve never shown noncriminal mind laughing its terrible thing to say very uncharitable but its simply comment on j edgar j edgars an awfully good guy stupid but awfully good laughing now where we have where we have human beings we have human beings chuckle now that profound statement chuckle needs little amplification what do you mean by human being well where everybody is so equal and where everybody has the idea that everybodys so crazy we get human being lets look this over lets look this over carefully lets see society which is dedicated to the proposition that all men are equal jefferson didnt say that he said that all men are created equal under law or with equal rights under law he didnt say all men were equal if you went up to tom and said tom whats this i hear about you being equal hed say to whom laugh but this proposition of superequality gets into the wheels when we get super agreement going an obsessive agreement we all have to agree with some hidden mores that we know not what of and if we dont know what this hidden standard is that were in agreement with then the only thing we can do is go into agreement with all of the things we think exist and if we think some of these things exist whether they do or not we still agree with them and we get the lowest order of philosophic concept which is everything is equal to everybody and you get the science of physics and modern civilization now where do we get the idea that anybody would be better off if he was changed if we see everybody in state of disability and super agreement with criminality and beautiful state of enturbulence where we have society that teaches people if youre genius youre crazy how do you make genius well you drive somebody crazy obviously thats what it adds up to doesnt it we get this sort of situation where everybodys idea of everybody else becomes himself lets look at that heres mr famous mr very famous fellow almost as famous as pat pending chuckle mr is certain that everybody around him is very evil and that they are gonna get him one way or the other now mr has choice if he is also saddled with superagreement obsessive agreement making equality necessity but to be this way himself now we ask this question does this evil character actually exist thats one of the first things we have to ask in clearing does this evil character exist it seems like we have synthetic personality in existence which isnt really anybody but is simply everybodys idea of how bad the other fellow is this is pretty complicated see hes got the idea that this other fellow is so bad that he cannot help but criticize him violently but because he is equal to this fellow over here then of course he himself has to assume these characteristics of superlative evil you see that we get generals admirals politicians all sorts of people who have an idea that the enemy is so bad or the fellow man is so bad or something else is so bad that they cant possibly live with it and they therefore got to cut it to pieces its very tricky thing it has vast bearing on clearing they got to cut the evil being to pieces yes but at the same time they have an equality complex by communicating with him they therefore go into agreement with his evil characteristics and the only thing they have left is an evil synthetic personality which they themselves have to wear to be like everybody else and to be normal this is one of the one of the simplest and easiest tricks that is played in culture so what are you trying to do when youre clearing people youve got to find the fellow himself and you also as you go up the line not an attribute of clear but an attribute of ot have to give him certainty on the other fellow now unfortunately an auditor is senior to clear because he already has to have an idea of what the other fellow is really like once he takes scoop shovel and unburdens this personality that this fellow thinks he has to wear so if everybody in the whole society was wearing secondary synthetic useless you know some people are not imaginative enough to be evil quite remarkable chuckle takes little imagination hes wearing this coat you might say that was never anybody and he says is everybody and all you have to do is get him to take off his coat relax and be himself how do you do that the auditor lets say hes dead in his head case in terrible condition sits there and picks up all the somatics of the preclear goes to bed at night and says you know he had cognition there i wonder if thats whats wrong with laughing he has to have some kind of an idea that the other fellow that the other fellow is alright well this is quite remarkable and in the process of auditing him he sometimes gets restimulated to the point where he says maybe this fellow isnt quite that alright maybe i ought to keep him dead dumb and pat him on the face with shovel because maybe he is maybe were wrong about this the odd part of it is that person whos cleared somebody clears people isnt that interesting its very easy all you have to do in order to clear people is just clear somebody and youll be able to clear people is there anything wrong with that yes its clearing the first one chuckle therefore major breakthrough took place when somebody else cleared somebody but myself that was an immediate major breakthrough because it showed other people that other people could do it and gave them considerable confidence now auditors have to learn individually each and every one of them that they can do it then and theyll just go on doing it it becomes very simple very simple once youve done it well trying to build up bridge to the point of where somebody would clear the first one without much confidence without much real concept of what the other fellow was really like that was the trick and thats what weve done in eight years its taken eight years to do that i apologize because thats very long period of time eight years great many things have happened in these eight years but ill point out to you that it cant be too long period of time because all during this period of time weve mostly had just one president in the united states that is if weve had one laughing the i think the beginning of this era i dont think very much was added to the various sciences i think they came out and made public the hydrogen bomb and that was just little more effective and efficient way of killing more people faster which i think is the basic goal of all science its at least the basic goal of governments war is that condition where you can kill the mostest with the leastest the fastest therefore the end goal of all wars is the depopulation of earth so therefore we get the end product of any government which has an impulse toward war as having people you want to go over that logic again slowly youll find out its quite sound chuckle so therefore the basic activities of the government must consist of getting rid of people well now thats not our activity we are not interested in getting rid of people we are interested in getting rid of synthetic people ever see one of these of course you have these apa graphs these nice 8 12 by 11 sheets graphs that shows blue line and so on people have begun to build up mystic quality concerning these graphs they believe this graph is something very difficult well they have to believe that because sometimes when they see their own they say hey look im not that bad and do you know its perfectly true they are not that bad do you know what that graph says that graph says this is what we call valence this is synthetic personality this is this mans belief of other men worn by himself and when it creeps along the bottom then you have to get special longleaded pencil to get it up to the bottom line you are merely reading valence but that valence really never existed it is picture of what this fellow thought the other fellow was like im not making any comment on that great noble triumphant subject of psychology im making comment on that subject at all well leave that for the second hour laughing well ask the ladies to leave and ill dig up my marine corps vocabulary and well work it over right now well be pure and we will merely say chuckle psychology what does it teach man man consists of that hes an animal that hes incapable of creation that he has all sorts of hidden impulses which are liable to come to the surface at any moment along with that we got psychoanalysis i pronounced it right that time laugh its the first congress i ever have and this says man is basically beast below the level of the sensor which is the only thing which keeps him on the straight and narrow path we have this ravenous monster and if you read the books of this particular subject you are struck with this fact that the only normal sexual intercourse comes about through super education and threat of punishment chuckle and that all other sexual activities are really the order of the day and are down there in the super unconscious reconscious mind thats quite interesting isnt it what are these people doing they are teaching people what coat they must wear to be equal and they get this shoddy messed up smeared torn tattered and battered jacket and they say put this on and youll be normal then we cant call these things sciences we can call them operations and therefore we are somewhat new on the face of earth in that we are actually trying to look at man without pitch were trying to look at man without introducing into the interpretation number of resistances to clearing him without introducing number of evil factors by which we can dam him and so perhaps we succeed but well only succeed if we carry it out across the whole broad face of earth and tear up all of these tattered smeared ideas of the other fellow and thats quite project thats quite project includes the chinese the russians the indonesians the ceylonese and the colored races in africa and psychiatrists chuckle includes all races matter how because as long as you have priesthoods as long as you have the racial concepts which seek to retain men into evil in order to make him good which is one of the more interesting propositions that anybodys ever heard of you still have barrier to true civilization on earth so were starting out at that point today its an interesting point to start on its its an interesting thing to come out here and say to you well were all out on top now its all finished thats all thats it thats it here we are you dont have to worry about it anymore oh this is the day we go to work do you think that the assembly of tools repairs cars it certainly doesnt only i seen some fellows particularly plumbers who can assemble tools for very long time well ive been assembling tools for an awful long time and weve finally gotten some cars fixed but but really the basic time has been spent on the assembly of tools and thats what were covering here this is quite remarkable to have achieved this point since it was not necessarily achieved through the field of science it was not necessarily achieved solely through the field of religion it was not achieved through the field of philosophy ornithology materialism or any other particular fieldthis has been this has been proposition of hacking through an impenetrable jungle which was simply the accumulation of several thousand years of ignorance lecture continues in part 212 and it was strictly hacking job you just took machete and you went to it and when we finally got down to point where there was path through the jungle and we reached cliff on the other side and saw there broad sea it was interesting but it was very simple sea we were looking at it didnt have monsters in it or anything else it was sea it was all very calm its all very nice but every time for while that we led somebody up you leading your friends up to this and you say look you see all that stuff thats jungle that doesnt have any real bearing on existence at all its just superstition and ignorance and stupidity and all that sort of thing and were gonna we want you to walk up this line of course i realize that this path is not well marked you have to look at this tree for half hour to find out whether or not theres blaze on it not well marked path but all were asking you to do is walk up this path and go over there to look at the cliff and take look at the sea and its beautiful sight and they say oh oh not for not for very often they say this why well they know its not for the personality that theyre wearing but did anybody ever wear the personality that theyre wearing its totally an invented thing just as every barrier which exists between man and an ignorant superstitious ill warlike violent state is series of shadows these things are not real even when you run into them head on theres something wrong theyre made out of papermache or something like that its not real view but its symptom of our society that we would rather look at delusion than truth oh thats very broad statement isnt it rather look at delusion than truth theres evidence to support this ooh yes im afraid so you can show people great travelogue and they stay away from their television sets in droves but show them gunsmoke chuckle dumas senior had the idea he said he was gonna write all of history up in novel so that it was totally palatable and everybody all would find out all about history very good idea in other words if you fed them fact through delusion hed have it made its an idea but is it workable idea actually and essentially is it workable idea im afraid im afraid that truth doesnt have to be shepherded in by the ushers of superstition fear delusion altered clause ah im going too far there chuckle chalices incense smoke latin hymns truth doesnt have to come in this way its not absolutely necessary but we garland truth with tremendous amount of verbiage because thats the only thing that happened to truth is it became garlanded with tremendous amount of verbiage dont you see and the person who drags in this poor shattered tattered damsel called truth you know and thinks to get her on the stage at all you have to pile her up with with fir boughs and pack sacks and hula costumes or garbled it isnt necessary all you have to do is show people the possibility that truth exists and then ask them whether or not this item is true and if they find that this item is true then they will recognize truth people do recognize truth when they see it but another little factor enters in sometimes you only get the synthetic personality to look and if only the synthetic personality is looking its primary characteristic is that it cant confront truth these are the barriers we face in clearing people these are the barriers they are not very formidable numbers of people are not very formidable but tremendous piles of lies fears and terrors can become rather formidable since i point out to you that man has not walked through these barriers for the last many thousands of years if ever in this universe so we must consider these things to be quite formidable i think its his fear alone of these things which keeps him from being able to be happy now is it possible that man is happy if we look if we look over any of the great seekers after truth they were all driven in the direction of search by the unhappiness of man they looked around and saw that man was not happy they found out that sick man was sick he hurt and he didnt want to hurt they looked around and saw that people were starving when they didnt want to starve and they were faced with this terrible puzzle why is it man has all these evil things and he doesnt want them of course in the philadelphia lectures i covered this many years ago that which you want in the universe you dont get and that which you dont want you of course you can have rather easily one of the little rules that goes along and you would be surprised where this rule enters in i found out where that entered in the other day just why that was to most people affinity is consideration of distance oh boy thats deep one isnt it think it over in other words if you like something and something is compatible and you think its fine you want it out there lrh pointing to space outside himself well if you dont want it at all where do you put it well obviously only one place you could put it would be right there pointing to the top of his head laughing so the basic law of affinity is responsible for this condition in this universe man does not want to be unhappy he does not want to be sick and just why he is is not logical man is not doing or being really in the aggregate of things he wants to do or be hes doing or being things that he must not or has to be he is being prevented from being himself one way or the other and all these shadow barriers are to him much more formidable much more solid than anything else i swear some girls idea of the evilness of marriage is much more solid to her than that wall and girl who has this idea of the terrific evilness of marriage never get married having nothing to do with marriage and you start running her on 8c she can walk through 8c she can reach over and touch the wall why can she touch the wall because the walls not there and she could practically walk right straight through the wall but this idea of marriage is something that someone should never commit boy thats solid ugh ugh interesting isnt it how people make the solids of their own universe the barriers of their own imprisonment man has right man definitely has right to certain happiness he isnt going to experience that right under the circumstances of his own past he cant he cant hes too wound up in this and that its not the mores of the society that prevent him its all of these delusions about how bad the other fellow is you have police because other people are so bad i investigated the police one time i became cop thats the best way to investigate something become it for while you know you can go too far with that sort of thing laughing but where do we have where do we have in essence here cave into the society what could cave society in well all you have to do is have police force and society would start caving in the police force constitute constant reminder that men are evil which is constant reminder that we must agree with these evil men you see how this would work neat little trick now that doesnt say that we are so starryeyed as to believe that at this time we could dispense with all police or could we now you have to make up your mind which way you are going to go with the society if youre thinking about new society of one kind or another and if you say well this society would be totallyunregulated then we would be proposing an anarchy and all the anarchists tell us that the only way society would work as total freedom without the government would be if everyone in it were perfect i dont know whether we propose when we talk about cleared society whether wed propose or not to have an anarchy thats beside the point thats up to the people who get cleared but i dont think youd wind up with an anarchy i think youd wind up with much finer level of agreement and cooperation because i think youd then be able to realize the rest of the dynamics the cops are there only because the rest of the dynamics arent there so if you put those back into society then youd get society the idea of police officer of the state of being of the criminal is one of the more interesting studies you wouldnt believe this study unless youd been cop for while you wouldnt believe this i had hardened criminals walk into horrible bar crammed into the back between two cockroach dens you know hardened criminals cop killers you know they come in i pat em on the back have drink boys mind the peace they would cop yelling cop thats fake i looked like cop i was wearing cops uniform little different cops see couple of these guys come in and they say hmmm evil beings what are you people doing here next thing you know why the nightclub starts to whirl chairs start to go down with crash the proprietor is very unhappy and war has commenced well i think there are certain things that you can appeal to in men definitely certain things that you can appeal to in men which make them more or less revert to their basic selves they take off their coats in other words thats very thin principle it has occasionally worked and theres one religion which is based exclusively on that principle that if you can reach the soul or being of person just ppanng when he becomes well youve got it made that religion i dont know if youve heard of them or not its called christianity chuckle all you have to do is appeal to as some of their various organizations have said the christ spirit of man oh i dont know about the christ spirit but if you appeal to the basic man why you get somewhere and sometimes you have to appeal and appeal and appeal and appeal laughing and after youve duplicated the auditing question enough times youve gotten there quite amusing quite amusing to look over look over the number of struggles we have had to find out the few things we have to know but i suppose when youre climbing over barricades why youre liable to get your clothes covered with creosote now and then and when youre smashing down jungle plants youre certainly going to get splattered with little chlorophyl and you carry it long for little while until you take bath and you say what do you know ive gone all the way through this jungle and theres just one little piece of stuff here thats the only piece of stuff and we went through eight miles of jungle and swamp and so forth and we find only this little piece of stuff duplication duplication gee chuckle you know and then you promptly forget about the eight miles of swamp and jungle and so forth you promptly forget all about that then you say to someone else you see they havent been through it you come up to them and say to them hey look at this duplication and they say yeah what about it you say well see all those eight miles of swamp theyre not true theyre not true they say theyre not theyre in over their heads in quicksand someones lying to you say duplication is important but i say mud is and so we get the birth of science mud chuckle now wherever we look in society as it struggles along it picks up arbitraries with which to bolster up hidden ideal that is never expressed we get these arbitraries piling up piling up laws customs everybody forgets what theyre supposed to prevent and at last we have this mass which simply has one common denominator prevent and when you have person totally prevented you have human being but what would you really have if you had somebody who was totally prevented youd have somebody who couldnt help and who couldnt reach out on the rest of the dynamics and so couldnt have civilization because you couldnt have third dynamic could you thats as easy as this in other words this system of preventing everything in order to bring out good civilization succeeds in killing the thing it was supposed to bring out right so there must be another way and better way and that way we have today in scientology in our in our walkings along the line weve gone through many vicissitudes theres hardly one of us present myself included who hasnt been human somewhere along these last right years these were not lapses from grace however these were repetitions of habit chuckle and its little bit hard to make it all the way but the funny part of it is that somebody who simply starts along this road would just get started along this road and says look there are few truths had astonishing things happen to them remember the old article dianetics evolution of science if more people got hold of that article and read it and all of sudden got well boom here was an odd phenomenon i know of three separate cases that got hold of that article in hospital bed and read it got up called for their clothes left and havent had recurrence years afterwards now the simple idea that there is way out or that there is truth or that truth can be realized that itself is tremendously potent force so for those elements in society which are trying to kill all truth that would be the first thing to attack the fact that there might be road out ummm road out there you are in the middle of the swamp jungle chuckle and there youre gonna stay everybody who tells you there is road out must perforce by definition be faker and quack which is almost direct quote of the better business bureau brochure on curing anything they say you always know faker if he tells you he can cure something think that over for moment thats direct quote out of the better business bureau literature you get the state favoring favoring very strongly only those persons and elements which use which well talk about later in this congress which use violence and which seeks to bury people in they cannot ever believe that there is road out and you know the society is so sure of itself that it has everybody trapped right there in the mud that theyve forgotten to pay the guards and theyve all left thats right its an amazing thing theres guards on the stockade any more only everybody thinks there are before you suddenly tell them to pick their head up little bit and see if they see the glint on rifle barrel any place or reach out there and see if they really feel any barbed wire or walk over this way to see if they really do fall in any quicksand and its with great amazement that somebody will take this delicate tiny step well i dont know and we get the phenomenon of dianetics evolution of science yanking people out of hospital beds we just made them look up and feel around here to see if there were any barriers anymore if the guards were still on duty and they arent in other words nearly every barrier we have and nearly every duress that man has experienced that kept him in an aberrated state is practically unenforced today we have more inquisition we have sky garbled we have more arrests because of religious beliefs in this country you know it was amazing first it went this way over in europe for while all you had to do was have bible read in your house to be burned at the stake you know it was just that bad thats all you had to do or you appeared in field and listened to preacher and finger snap you had it right then dragged the body right off and mounted it up they were very interesting about this we think of people being burned at the stake they didnt just burn them at the stake you know that they very often took ice and packed in their heart and face so that they would live longer while they were burning these were nice people these were good people they were painfully good now these people who were doing this sort of thing of course thought that this was the right thing to do that they were being the best possible people in the best possible world doing this sort of thing and these fellows who were listening to preacher in field or cracking bible in the house or something like that they thought these people were being very very evil because they were breaking through barriers that they knew by experience were tremendously necessary to the continued existence of the society at large and so they gave these punishments but these sort of things arent done anymore they do it in cruel little ways little tiny ways they take some industrialist of some place or another that was trying to get on fine with the politicos you know and this industrialist hardly reads or writes but hes good guy he makes all sorts of things and so on and the politicos say well hes harmless and i exchanged few presents and few things like that all of sudden this becomes major crime well theres great deal of hope for country where that becomes major crime chuckle now does this mean then that we are favored by the time and place of the emergence of scientology yes we are definitely favored we only have to walk slight tightrope there are few people around who say oh and theres some laws that say that you mustnt heal anybody of anything and so on people dont take them terribly seriously anymore and if you pay the least little bit of lip service to this sort of thing why you go right straight through england by the way is freer than the united states on this line you can say youre gonna heal somebody go ahead and heal somebody over there and nobody screams in the united states you say well were going to were going to prevent his being sick or something like that chuckle but were not up against tremendously violent environment at this time and therefore there is every reason to believe that what we know can bloom and grow and can spread and communicate we are also favored by the fact that the world at time previous has had more communication channels there are tremendous communication channels in existence today what theyre being used for is quite something else but that they exist is certainly the case for instance its only been the last couple of decades you can pick up the phone and call almost anybody you wanted to in the world and it certainly has only been in the last decade that most people in the western nations began to have television sets i understand that more people have television sets in russia even than they have shoes that might be some of john foster dulless problem and the system but theres some possibility of it being true heres rather favored time heres rather favored time for all this to happen because although nobodys going to say keep em all in the mud and nobodys going tremendously to object if you start lifting few people out of the mire and if you start lifting everybody out of the mire nobodys really going to object as i say the police are off the stockade now is there any other thing that makes this favored time well its the fact that man might cease to exist almost in his entirety this factor operates however not as preventer but as catalyst to doing what were trying to do and this catalyst is of course the threatened presence of war atomic fission that sort of thing man can do such thorough job on wiping out man now that we actually should put little bit of speed on the ball so i could say off hand that were probably just little bit late maybe even eight years late people used to come romping into the foundation and they used to say where are all the clears i dont know what they expected in truth if i just point down to an empty space in the air of the hall and say theres one now laughing we probably would have started great religious revival in america chuckle but it wouldnt have been based on any truth so it wouldnt have been any good nevertheless it is fitting here in this first hour of this clearing congress that we point up the fact that there is such thing as clear that were doing this all over the world there are as many or more clears now in england than in the united states clears are appearing down in south africa the various you might say field offices are doing very very fine angeles is doing beautiful job new york is just getting under way i wish few of you people up there around new york would go in and get yourself clear so we could say to all these clears from new york as matter of fact there are none at this time but that should be expected new york being new york chuckle and the job thats being done on this is tremendous its gorgeous piece of work thats being done the world around and much of this work now get that is being done on indifferent communication lines somebody flew in the other day from new zealand he said were doing something wrong were not getting any clears doing something wrong he came all the way from new zealand to spend the day and then go home again and sure enough they were doing something wrong they were running help something on the basis of tell way people are never helped anywhere and they had an emeter that they were trying to check people out on that didnt work and they had to come all the way back here to find out the emeter didnt work but they got these points on clearing technique straightened out they got the emeter straightened out he got little bit of subjective reality on couple of the processes he went back home and within sixty hours of his arrival at home he sent cable made my first clear new zealand well the point im making here the point im making here is this is happening all over the world it is happening very successfully and we do have clears we have got show on the road and you are here and we also have congress do we thank you end of lecture transcript of lrh video taped lecture number 2 of 6 the clearing congress lectures shoreham hotel washington dc july 4 l958 the factors of clearing you know ive got some sort of idea that we have congress started here what do you think alright its an awfully grand crowd i dont know how many people are here but i think its one of the largest congresses weve had nobodys given report everybodys in flap chuckle one of the things that has made this congress different than other congresses is long standing ambition of the organization was to film one of these congresses and so that is happening during this of course that sort of thing always introduces randomity in such things now here first off we have the usual lot of telegrams here of one kind or another and here we have one from frank turnbull in new zealand from the hasi staff in new zealand australia and oceania wishing you the clearest and best congress yet stop we wish we were there in body as well as spirit well as matter of fact im sorry theyre not here im sorry theyre not sitting right there but that means ill have to pick up this mockup one of these days you know pick up this mockup and take it down and put it down in new zealand mockups are very hard to move around have you ever noticed that and heres from the scientologists up from the pacific northwest dear ron staff and congress members congrats and have wonderful congress all the best scientology washington state and here is from the hasi staff and the organization secretary john fudge and hco secretary rona garbled best wishes for bumper clearing congress and heres one from the hasi south africa maggie skoltz down there best wishes for happy congress we have sitting right down here the secretary of south africa and his very charming lady here is jack parkhouse and allyson stand up you see they did come partially in body chuckle and heres one from california heres wishing you the best congress ever and also we have the california office represented almost in totality here in julie and ken stand up we have here great many wellwishers from all parts of the world from oregon from every place but that part that part of the world which has gone into little bit of darkness we have part of the world thats gone slightly into darkness the russianafrican pardon the russian asian sector of the world which would love to sweep into africa and other places its an interesting thing to not to have any organizational offices in any of those countries i wonder if theres any parallel at all between the adoption of totally materialistic viewpoint and an evident inability to be communicated with i wonder if that has any any correlations whatsoever well lets get on with the congress here weve got one how about bringing in my notes you know i always have to have notes laughing large stack of books on dolly is wheeled on to the stage there we are good good i always have to have notes you know its very hard thing to follow notes i mean to give an extemporaneous congress and i dont want to establish some new principle here being entirely extemporaneous and so forth and just giving you congress off the cuff because it would be bad precedent chuckle you know so i this time i very carefully collected some notes and some materials and so on and in view of the fact that were dealing mainly and basically with the mind why ive collected here most of the noteworthy books on the subject of mind and im very happy to to picking up book here for instance general introduction to psychoanalysis by professor sigmund freud lld whats that lld stand for well thats beside the point anyway we want to take this thing up thoroughly we want to take the mind up very thoroughly leafing through book and reading the courtyard in which the sheetmetal lies spread out is not to be considered primarily as symbolical but refers to the fathers place of business i will add arbitrarily that going down like the more usual going up is meant to describe well isnt that interesting turning pages in book and reading i mean love rivalry with the emphasis on the sexual character the even as small child begins to develop special tenderness for his mother wouldnt it be strange if small child didnt develop tenderness for his mother laugh but here we find the oedipus complex entering in we now know why were all aberrated because were fond of our mothers chuckle leafing through book well i dont want to give you congress without great deal of learned material in it and reading to be sure there are all kinds of objections possible to the declaration that neurotic symptoms are substitute for sexual satisfaction you said it there are objections in fact i can think of quite few laughing well i just wanted to give you very authoritative i guess we better forget that one lets see if we havent got something thats much more pertinent here picking up another book oh heres something heres dictionary of psychology very good very good now obviously psychology should tell us great many things which we should be well aware of the first thing it should tell us about there should be definition this is psychology dictionary there should be some sort of definition for life reading lie detector life linen linnet linear perspective theres definition for life well thats beside the point theres undoubtedly here definition i hate to give congress off the cuff you know i like to have authoritative material here backing up mind mind mind mind mind theres definition here for mind laughing well theres theres undoubtedly definition for psychology ill look that up psychology hah reading though the very though the era of definition in terms of the tenets of the various schools of psychology is past there is acceptable single sentence definition now look i was trying to give you an authoritative congress here lets look up creativeness shall we leafing through book creation creation creativeness creativeness im sure they have definition for that the various things you know you need to make something im getting very nervous here because i expected these fellows to give hand you know creative thinking creation but theres creative thinking its the achievement of new relationship among parts of an experience laugh well hah chuckle im little bit embarrassed here i expected some of these boys to back us up you know theres some books there on yogi but i know what they say they say if you sit still long enough youll have sat still laugh well im embarrassed there go all my notes you can take these away pointing to dolly with books you can take those things away i hardly know what sort of congress to give you now i mean here we got all of the former schools that were supposed to tell you all about the mind and so forth and they dont have definitions for the things that we consider the mind you know like life and being alive whatll you do with them looking off stage i dont care what you do with them burn them muttering whatll i do with them but youd think theyd have definitions for things called the mind and definitions for things called man or woman or life youd think thered be objects the other day i had wonderful idea i was going to write bridge book between psychology and scientology and bridge book between psychoanalysis and scientology now dont you think that would be nice wed put them out in the book stores and people pick them up and theyd read all about psychoanalysis and then what laughing looking back stage at smoke i hope the management doesnt find out about this i didnt mean him to take literally laugh well there goes psychoanalysis laugh well in the fumes and flames of an expiring yesterday laugh we can begin new tomorrow one of the things that is quite amazing was to start from nowhere and every time i thought in dealing with the development of scientology that we were starting from somewhere i found that we were pretty well sidetracked science has to have certain patterns certain definitions certain objects of study and even if you only study thought you are still studying an object if you say it is thought you know you say we are going to study thought well you have to find out what you are studying in order to study it it sounds awfully funny but its brand new discovery i assure you chuckle as far as the field of the mind is concerned the isolation of discovery objects have not been done so right away quick like bunny lets just sail right in and for the remainder of this congress im just gonna hit you left and right with all of the various isolated data which grouped as whole make clearing would you like that now some of you old timers will say oh not again and some of you new comers theyll say about the same subject what so well take the middle course ill talk to those two nice little girls right down there there are essentially four parts of what we are talking about when we are talking about when we are talking about the mind when we are talking about clearing there are four parts and these things are very easily isolated let assure you this first one doesnt have any mass its called thetan thetan by definition is something without mass without wavelength and actually without finite location but thetan is our definition or symbol use for what they used to call ghost spirits anything elan vital any of these various items of yesteryear we have to call it something new because all of these things meant special things for instance somebody the other day colored person was discussing with whether or not ghosts still existed and i settled the argument rather easily i said well have you ever been ghost and feigning comm lag and shame and i said well im not ashamed of it i have well that person doesnt work for us any more laughing here is specialized meaning to spirit ghost is an evil spirit that is partially materialized evidently that is found in various locations where they will do the real estate the most damage chuckle thats evidently ghost so lets just take all of these things that people refer to as spirits or something of the sort and lets just cover that with this mathematical term thetan isnt an esoteric or magic term its simply mathematical it is the greek letter which stood for thought but that is not quite precise either because thought is product of thetan not the thetan thetan is potentially able to produce thoughts matter energy space time and all the rest of it so you get basic production unit and therefore we are starting with an assumption we have place of assumption in scientology this subject starts from somewhere thats brand new you dont realize it thats brand new it doesnt start from well the proclivities of the libido are very often introducable when you get socioeconomic libido theory it doesnt start from doubletalk it starts from definable thing we get axiom one alright we say this thing called thetan is capable of producing all sorts of things and we say this is the person so therefore we differ enormously from the christian statements on the subject they say you must save your soul the fellow says i dont have one so therefore the christian religion cannot possible be true and they lose all kinds of converts that way the fellow doesnt find his soul not there somebody saving his soul is doing something very interesting he evidently has something set up over here that has probable mass that he says is his soul and then he goes about saving it and it turns out to be demon circuit called mama or something now he expects this to go to heaven but this cant exist without continuous creation by that pointing to thetan symbol on his board so he sends this to heaven and he goes on elsewhere laughing very very remarkable things go on youd be surprised how man gets tangled up in all these things but this tangling is called identification he begins to identify himself with things he says i am thing well thats all very well you can be thing if you want to person can be something yes thats true but he shouldnt go whole hog and say i am only that thing and nothing more and never will be anything else because when it perishes he loses his identity now the funny part of it is thetan has already basic personality and this is what we are trying to uncover in scientology in order to make clear now its as easy as that and people keep forgetting that they say well i got halfway through being clear and i knew who i was i knew i was nobody oh oh halfway through valence split half way through coming out from under the cloak of being somebody else you have terrible feeling of being exactly nobody because thats the way you went down you walked in one day and you said im seneschal and this knight with eight inch spurs standing there humph and say im supposed to open the doors to this castle ive been doing this for long time and im very trusted retainer well he says i dont know about that i married the old mans daughter and weve given him poison now and youre fired whats the fellows beingness now his beingness depended upon somebody elses saying he was something and he goes around still trying to say i am necessary somebody has to open these castle doors i am really the seneschal get that really see hes insisting hes the seneschal but nobody will pay him his wages and so forth hes become nobody see he has the feeling that he is nobody but this doesnt reveal this fact he was somebody before he became the seneschal now as seneschal he became nobody until he finally went out and got begging pan on the highway and began to hold it out for fish and chips as people came along you know and people keep handing him something now he says i am something i am beggar but thats still something then the new york state police come along or somebody and they say to him im little mixed up in my periods here but they say to him do you realize you cannot beg upon the public road without licence number 603f and he says where do i get this licence and they say well that bureaus been abolished laughing so now he is again nobody so he starves to death and kicks the bucket and there he lies there now hes somebody hes corpse but hes not dead hes merely corpse and people come along and say they dont ever say you are now corpse they say look at that corpse which is below his level of tolerance entirely nobody is giving him any attention at all and so he jumps off and does something else get the idea but he goes through sequences of becoming nobody somebody nobody somebody nobody somebody nobody not necessarily on dwindling spiral some people get up to the point of being happy man you know the old story of happy man i wont tell it he didnt have shirt chuckle this chap in other words was somebody until he began to identify his beingness with thing in other words he had personality beingness an aliveness and particularly potentials and capabilities and then he decided to be something which had limited potentials and capabilities dont you see well he could keep going downhill for long time or going out into other identities for very long time and he would eventually you might say find beingness which he was satisfied with and which could go on for long time but none of these beingnesses are the person the person is the thetan that is the one identification that scientology jumps off with now physics jumps off with an assumption and it has now blown the assumption sky wide and handsome and that is conservation of energy in the first place this thing called the conservation of energy is about the poorest name thing you would ever do you could have said conservation of mass if you please but conservation of energy now all somebodys got to do is come along and demonstrate that energy is an impulse and isnt anything and therefore doesnt conserve and the one thing that isnt conserved about energy is an impulse why didnt anybody ever think of this they had this around for centuries and they keep saying conservation of energy there is conservation of energy there might be conservation of potential motion but they jump off from the point of conservation of energy and that is the stable datum on which the rest of it is built now if there is something wrong with this assumption of thetan we have lost our stable data so therefore we have to proceed to demonstrate what this stable data consists of it doesnt have length breadth and thickness and so forth in other words can it be proven or demonstrated well years ago we started exteriorizing people we started kicking people out of their heads it wasnt necessarily good for them but it was fun laughing and we sure did have good time kicking people out of their heads as matter of fact they talked different and acted different go sailing around well that was the person i even developed some electrical gimmicks to have somebody sail out of his head and go over and settle on the gimmick and have it register and get out of the gimmick and go back in his head again fantastic you know and so far this basic premise has not been shaken probably because nobodys had any real opportunity to shake it because the one thing that very materialistic people cannot possibly confront is the thetan theres process in creation of human ability called conceiving static you say to somebody you say alright just get the idea theres spirit up there nothing spirit alright confront it good they get sick to their stomachs people who are having bad time isnt that interesting because its too little mass for them to confront so probably this thing is quite safe for years to come probably some time some great controversy will rage as to how many thetans there could be housed on the head of pin chuckle or something of this sort it is relatively unimportant lets just escape the truth of this for its workability and lets examine it as workable premise and we find out that as long as we use this as workable premise we win in clearing and as soon as we desert this as workable premise we lose in clearing that is all there is to it if we consider man to be mass of circuits and pictures and so on flesh blood tobacco juice 97 cents worth of chemistry the army says i think the price has gone up i heard somebody say that in the army the other day he said its odd that the army rescue teams and the air force rescue teams would go to so much work to rescue man who was only worth 97 cents in terms of chemistry i found objection to it because of inflation and so forth its now about 143 chuckle well if we say he is so many bits of chemistry we say hes just chemistry hes nothing but chemistry oh boy we cant cure him we cant do anything but assume the things which the healing sciences today have assumed which is if you shoot him with enough gook and big enough needles that are blunt enough often enough or enough electric shock and if you rearrange his chemistry somehow or another youll make him well person well it has very limited look you can do just so much with chemistry and all youve done is make the thetan happier with the chemistry he has thats all well thats one way of making thetan happy but its limited because it doesnt make all thetans happy some dont like chemistry im sure theres some people here who have flunked the subject chuckle well the first thing we see the first thing we see here as an object or an item to study in this subject of scientology is thetan i say it doesnt matter whether you believe this or not the point is its workable much more important is the fact that result can be achieved which is desirable evidently by everybody its worked on by assuming this first assumption so we get out our next thing which is the mental image picture now this stupid little bug pointing to thetan symbol on his board makes pictures he makes pictures all the time hes just gotta make pictures gotta make pictures make some more pictures he makes some more pictures then he makes some more pictures he makes some more pictures he makes some more pictures he makes some more pictures and finally he says you know i dont know what to do with all these pictures im making ill just say theyll last forever and ill put them out of sight or ill say joe is doing them and ill put them out of sight and we have reactive mind and into that area he begins to collect every operation every difficulty everything he cant confront and he makes picture of it and shoves it behind him thats how we get get thee behind satan laughing now the funny part of it is everyone does this everybody does this and in psychology they said that only morons and little children did because the psychologist himself longer could but he was still doing it but he was doing it somewhere else where it was not visible and so forth and hes making these pictures pictures and we get the freudian unconscious we get the dianetic reactive mind and so forth it contained record evidently of everything that had ever happened to the person but the person was just making this record all the time he was keeping it mocked up and we had the nicest game running you ever saw he mocked up all of his experiences mocked them up all the time mocked them up any time he halfway thought about them or became into restimulation and then hed mock up the whole thing and not look at it which was pretty good and you got your unconscious mind now these mental image pictures of course are very demonstrable anybody can do this sometimes they get into valence that cant create and cant look and although they can still make pictures because obviously theyre still creating this valence picture they cant see other isolated pictures so they begin to believe they cant see pictures and you ask them what theyre looking at and they say nothing and you say come on take look what are you looking at shut your eyes whatare you looking at i see nothing but blackness everywhere well what is blackness but picture did you ever see that kid stunt of the negro the portrait of negro hiding an coal cellar at midnight this black thing still picture it doesnt have any features picture is not formed picture is simply picture which would simply be block of energy or mass existing in space and youd have this sort of thing and after you get enough of these sort of things the person is mocking up enough of them he calls it experience he wants to get experience and how does he hold on to experience he holds on to it with his ability to make stacks and stacks and stacks of pictures wonderful very very wonderful to see the capability of thetan in lousing himself up hes best at that thats the one thing hes really good at what does he do here he gets lazy about making pictures so he adapts another beingness to himself which makes pictures dont you see and he starts making pictures on via of one kind or another we call these other selves theyre still merely collections of pictures we call these other selves circuits or valences and circuits and valences and that sort of thing is what were looking at and we get all kinds of oddities these are all visible things you know you can just take somebody and have him make picture and get him to see the thing and youll see people with pictures these valences are quite interesting if you run down somebodys havingness hes liable to have one of these valence or demon circuits move in on him and all of sudden hell say you know something said something or other but i didnt say it well he can tell the difference between himself and this circuit what is circuit circuit is picture of personality just like i was talking to you about hes got the idea that grandma was like this so he makes composite picture called grandma which then gives him the orders that grandma used to give him and he knew was necessary for survival such as wash your face put on your rubbers sit down at the table now get up and wash your hands you know so he always does that he sits down at the table then he gets up and washes his hands and then he goes back again its series of orders well he doesnt have this around as long as hes got grandma but then he gets substitute grandma but its just series of pictures so you could say this mind is divisible into simple picture and complex picture the complex picture simply delineates personality and the simple picture delineates scene but theyre all pictures and they are all created and this is the one thing the world will never swallow and its secret just between ourselves and can you keep secret the one thing we must not tell people is that they are responsible for themselves personally for all the difficulties that ever occurred to them that you must not tell them i well remember in 1952 when i wrote advanced procedures and axioms i put section in it that said responsibility and people used to pick this book up with what airy confidence you know pick it up oh oh wonderful wonderful responsibility they look at the chart of attitudes that came out with handbook for preclears and it said responsibility full responsibility mmmm well i used to study yogi i think ill go back to that laughing the best trick that thetan does is to make something and then say i didnt do it he starts moving off these responsibility zones and responsibility in itself is tremendous subject all by itself but its the one thing you must not tell people bluntly quickly unless of course you sort of want to give them the shock of their lives you got bad leg youre mocking up bad leg youre in grandpas valence youre mocking up grandpas valence you really hang them with it because thats what you have to assume when you clear people theres theoretically oneshot clear which is what part of existence could you be responsible for and when person has answered that and taken all parts of existence and his own mind and everything else and hes willing to be responsible for all those things within and without microcosm macrocosm he then would be clear if he could do it long road the only place we use that thing today is solving present time problem you say what part of that problem could you be responsible for and ordinarily the problem just goes out flickety flack and solves itself up but nevertheless it is evidently true that willingness to be responsible for coordinates with sanity and total unwillingness to be responsible for coordinates with aberration so we get irresponsibility as the opposite number of aberration neuroses difficulty upset and so on well why is it then that this individual gets all of this silly stuff if hed only be well if he could be responsible for it why does he get all this stuff and become irresponsible for it well part of its content is this life and thetans in general have rigged out one that is super aberrative factor you go and you shoot somebody you know its calm night nothing much is happening you go out and shoot somebody the old days the way the west is portrayed on tv how they loved shooting somebody quite wonderful anyway they shot somebody what happened here well they said so i shot somebody shooting people wasnt aberrative probably dying wasnt either but then somebody came along and said oh you shot him eh well were going to arrest you and were going to execute you and take your body away you took somebody elses body away were gonna take your body away they invented in other words overt act mechanisms and the guy didnt dare say he was responsible for killing somebody he said garbled and bang then he had to go around and say i didnt do it i didnt do it i didnt do it clean hands hey look the gun hasnt been fired i didnt do it and we get way of life which is summed by i didnt do it you realize thats our modern way of life you know you say to somebody did you put out the milk bottles well i dont know why youre asking because you normally put them out every night and you know very well all you want to do is find out if the milk bottles got put out and youre in fight you just want to know that thats all you want to know you dont want to know anything else they got responsibility mixed up in this whos job it is im sure im sure that lot of government officials have their job mixed up dont you think possibly they have and the main thing they would tell you is this department is not responsible for that thats the main thing you hear well i couldnt report my income tax exactly last year because i hadnt received all of the income and i still owed quite few bills but i didnt know what the bills were because i didnt know how much i had incurred the internal revenue says thats none of our responsibility where is your income tax report see this gag runs everywhere i pulled funny gag on some people i dont get in many automobile accidents as matter of fact i havent been in one for years except the other day i was running down past the state war and navy building which is now i guess the presidential annex or something and guy started up at the light and the light was red he noticed that it was red so he stopped and the car behind him started up and hit the back of that front car and i happened to be the third in line that was very embarrassing the only thing i could say to keep from being responsible for it is that there was redheaded girl crossing the street laughing now you think that is gag but it happens to be true and bonnie turner can attest to it i was actually looking in that direction for some reason or another there must have been something else over there laughing so here i was smashed into the back of this car and these drivers came around and they said who did what blah blah blah they were all nervous and shaking and trying to get out their drivers licenses and so forth i was standing there and i was trying hard to get my car started and find out how much damage had been done and i looked at all this nervousness and i looked at them and i said wow i said it was my fault i did that and they both calmed down completely put away the things got in their car and laughing so heres this wonderful factor of irresponsibility versus responsibility and thetan uses irresponsibility to keep himself individuated thoroughly enough as thoroughly as he thinks he needs to be and he over does it and you get aberration thats about all there is to that and even though his creativeness becomes very impeded so he cannot consciously create he nevertheless continues to unconsciously create and evidently the more you step on his ability to create consciously the more he displays his ability to create unconsciously you can shove somebody clear on down into automatic poltergeist i remember in 1950 some of the dianeticists around there were very delighted with young boy who could get on rug and make it shoot underneath the table and make it shoot all over the room it was very amusing situation they got five or six priests in to demon exorcise him and so forth of course they meant to chop out few circuits that kid was shooting rugs everywhere well im sure everybody could shoot rugs everywhere if they wanted to be responsible for it or if they were so irresponsible that it happened anyway well people hang in between and so they cant shoot rugs around on floors and thats why you dont have magic carpets anymore thats why why you have to buy gulf gas laugh now here here is this factor entering into this second part and this second part is very clearly delineated part which is mind now what do we mean by mind we mean it is that product of thetan which compounds his experience personalities and the way he thinks it ought to be and the way he hopes it isnt and we get mass and that mass is actually composed of thoughts the big mistake the buddhists make is to consider themselves thoughts they are not thoughts nobody ever thought them they are not thoughts they consider themselves masses of knowledge now i dont consider myself any mass of knowledge i dont try to remember anything much to the despair of my staff most of the time but there isnt any reason why you cant just create anything you want to know at any time you want to know it or go take look but instead of that people get on storage of knowledge basis storage of experience you cant get hired by the government unless you have just so much experience it doesnt matter if you do anything or not its how much experience youve got see they expect that to be all kind of massed up in the mind and its this plus the personalities person has known pictures of in other words they take pictures of these personalities and they add all these things together and then they may dream up some machinery and say the machinery makes these pictures only the machinery itself is just another picture you see or they say i knew this person who did this obsessively and that person now haunts nothing is haunting them except picture they are constantly making of that person you have to understand that clearly if youre going to clear anybody because the person himself is doing all of this now i give you that simply as technical factor not as factor to be told to people youre going to clear chuckle because they wont like it fellow is sitting there you know normal man chuckle hes sitting there and you say well i tell you how not to audit somebody you say when did you know somebody who was like that the person might say and he might not say you say well just how are you making up that mockup and he says well how im making it up oh i got this way because of the terrible operations ive had the doctors all did this to oh yea well it did happen but it persists on the equation that he takes responsibility for mocking it up and then it gets persistence i was auditing pc one day it was very very wonderful example of this the pc was saying well itsa well alter the facts slightly so the pc wont jump out of his skin because hes here well i cant help it being this way i guess its because of my father you know my father was like this my father did this all the time and i had headaches and he wished them off on just wished them off on and so i got this headache i said well now lets go over this again slowly where did this headache come from well my father wished them off on and sexually he did it and he kicked around and so forth and we went over this for few minutes and then all of sudden it dawned on this preclear he said well my father isnt there and ive been blaming my father for this and its my headache and ive been blaming my fa and bam the headache went and it was severe headache see interesting hey in other words you can audit somebody the rest of their lives without ever introducing any gradient scale of responsibility and you would never get clear but unfortunately you cannot simply audit them directly at responsibility and get clear say well you see that ceiling see all the flaws in it see the wall see how badly those curtains are hung look at how bad that cloth is over there in the curtain see that and get this thread thats loose here in my coat youre responsible for all that laughing youre not going to get any clears so somewhere in between these two courses you get clearing the person sooner or later has to and does by the processes we use abruptly cognite upon this magnificent fact and that is he is mocking it all up himself and has to mock it up consciously in order to have it there then the person becomes much happier because theyve forgotten they were mocking it up so we have this thing called mind as the second part that we were studying and then the next part is very very simple theres hardly anything to it except latin names and thats body and if you look over if you look over corpus look up corpus in the medical dictionary why you will see thereafter that body is very easy thing to understand it is merely tremendous number of latin names they dont have to attach themselves to anything they just are you know and you get all of these parts and theyre all latin names as matter of fact thats unjust that was the scholastics method of teaching this subject the subject of medicine of more recent years they actually did start to cut up corpses and start looking at body to find out what body is well body is machine or it is mockup but it definitely is thing it is something it is form it has persistence it runs certain cycle of action from birth to death it does have parts it is ambulant it has various recognizable factors everybody has different fingerprints than everybody else perhaps people look different one to the next and you get this thing called body now from this we get the idea of ambulant matter or life injected or imbued matter existing in life created space running on life exchanged or created energy and we get the whole class of things that we call bodies and today they are interestingly enough building machines which are almost indistinguishable from bodies they depend they never noticed this utterly upon their operator they dont depend so much upon the operators body as the operators thinkingness and ability to think you take the univac the eneac some of these later thinking machines theyre quite wonderful people stand around all science evidently today is being conducted on the basis of these univacs and eneacs which is one of the more gorgeous things you ever saw because they never noticed that somebody has to ask the question and somebody has to read the answer the two things the machine will not do and yet this current that runs there everything is supervised by life and you have an organism which moves and we get sort of thing that isnt really body but is close to body you know an automobile has this characteristic its little bit further from it but its still life animated and then we have the universe which is life animated well i shouldnt have gone into that quite so quick but we get the next two parts the first of which is body which is intimately life animated biological organism as we understand it these days each part of which is steeply and deeply invisibly imbued with life and that is body now we have bodies of all kinds whether dinosaurs or cockroaches and they all more or less operate on the same basic principle they have to be animated every instant by thetan or they arent now we get something then that endures little more broadly and we call this thing the universe and of course it just runs and nobody gives it any attention at all does it yeah well we get up against this problem of who created the universe i say you did it and you say i did it and we get wonderful persistence chuckle its funny thing this stuff that goes along here with us in one level of time if you start to investigate it little bit youll find out that it has the most complex pieces if you look into piece of matter you find out it has various other elements than the one you thought it did you think its made out of sand and concrete and you find out it also has iron and copper and gold and all sorts of things in it you just take little chip out of one of those columns and youll see at once that it has other things in it many other things its only complicated by the idea that its congealed chaos that is now regimented into less chaotic form now whoever made it whoevers running it we still had it now theres question about the fact that you are running your body this is demonstrable but that you are running the universe is little harder to prove matter who youre trying to prove it to its little harder to prove you try to prove it to certain class of priest in this particular society at this particular time and they throw you in the boobyhatch the psychiatrist he knows that anybody who claims that he is making the universe he knows what that person is that person is crazy but he doesnt know what crazy is i love some of these points of assumption they announce grandly so and so is insane because he thinks so and so and so and so but then they never tell you what insane means well they say well thats easy hes not sane you say fine what is sane garbled not playing the game right to ask questions like that laugh youve done us great error here now if we look at the body we can we can claim an ownership and finite zone of control we say well we lift our hands and so on remember the old gag we used to do flop flop flop flop flop flop and you say after while after the guys flopped his hamnds while whos doing that and soon i am very happy about it he can do something with his hands well now you say flop that building over there well youve just run too steep scale thats all thats the only thing wrong with it so we have to compartment these next two parts into body or bodies and then into universe or universes anybody who says this is the only universe there is is probably lost and we have these next two classes and we actually only have four elements that were studying and any time you believe were studying more that four elements then youve gone astray and you wont clear anybody somebody comes up with new hypertension idea that he has ghost named throgmagog that gives him orders and you suddenly say well this is not part of his mental equipment there actually is ghost named throgmagog and it does so and so and so and so and that is part of his mind and i will therefore have to treat him with witchcraft in order to separate him from the ghost throgmagog youre not going to clear anybody i know because weve tried all these things what do you think weve been doing for eight years but throwing stuff out the window right alright so when we get down to final analysis there are just four elements and they are thetan mind bodies universeuniverses just those four elements and i tell you today this is more important than it used to be we just did this so you people could just view these four things well there wasnt any reason to just view these youve got to be able to look at life in small packages in order to clear anybody because you say alright youre all involved in the middle of this chaos called life in this universe and it has 8762 parts and youve got to memorize them all and just take look at all those and realize youre responsible for all those thats fine youre clear thank you thats not gonna work not gonna work you have to bring it down so that he can focus his sights on it so you have these four parts now youve all heard of these four parts theyre part of fundamentals of thought but they become very important today because all you are doing is asserting control over body and demonstrating creativeness of mind to make clear thats all you have to do the rest of it is ot operating thetan way upstairs to make clear all you have to do is show fellow that hes mocking up his own mind therefore his own difficulties and that he is not completely adrift in and swamped by body and then there he is youve got clear and all the things that they learned about aberration psychosis neuroses libido scribido bibido all of these hocus pocus the economic neural binaural oral system that never matriculated and so forth endlessly 8762 medical terms none of which relate to anything that would cure anybody you can just forget the whole works you see because you just do these two things you just take the first two items the thetan and you get him to confront the fact that he has body and wipe out that mind and youve got clear thats all there is to it as far as the universe is concerned were talking about something which person has to walk way upstairs about just as i say wave your hand okay wave that building and its quite jump but clear is finite state it does exist as finite state it is an ultimate and it is an absolute and those are very interesting things for to say because i used to say they werent when i was trying to dodge away from people saying where are all those clears well im not dodging now clear is thing it is stable and it simply depends upon mastery of the mind in recognition of the body in universe thats all there is to it thats all the thing youre trying to do youre not trying to get person to take responsibility for everything on earth or anything of the sort clear could be said to be basic personality revealed and you have stood up and im going to sit down now thank you end of lecture transcript of lrh video taped lecture number 3 of 6 the clearing congress lectures shoreham hotel washington dc july 4 1958 the freedoms of clear thank you well do we have congress yet well good how are you making out i have doubt that what you will be making out better after youve had some seminars you realize we have upper indocs for the seminar this time it was my idea the you know just as an aside here theres real reason why we might not some day some fardistant future develop group clearing technique its possible not very probable but possible the results which are obtained in group intensive are quite excellent when very competent auditors are auditing for instance nibs and dick and i think burk and one other auditor hal were in this last group intensive and they did very fine job they really got somewhere i dont know if you can see this or not showing an apa graph but that blue line is where they was and that red line is where they went so they did go somewhere on one of these graphs by reason of group intensive its group processing shouldnt be undersold undersold it is an assist to clearing but is not itself clearing at this time people only do few thousand percent better after theyve been through processes for while and we expect more significant gain than that for clearing now the whole idea of clearing people getting off into run here the whole idea of clearing people is not making nothing out of them and it really isnt setting them free its simply making them more capable and more able and increasing in particular watch this carefully their creativeness and increasing in particular their tolerance there are four freedoms we have been told from another decade and these four freedoms were all very well but they were not doable we have four freedoms today in scientology that are very doable clearing does not mean that the individual is free from this universe or its liabilities it merely means he can cope with them thats little bit different from standpoint of average man you know you get somebody who can throw his shoulders back in clearing people we do achieve these four freedoms and ill enumerate them for you here theyre freedom froms im afraid the first one is illness now thats quite remarkable since illness has been considered an indoor sport here for number of years laugh if you cant do anything else to get attention from somebody or to get out of something you can always get sick but medical science has been ending this rather rapidly and as matter of fact even dianetics put large dent into it seventy percent of mans ills are psychosomatic and good auditor auditing out the right engrams got people well people who are clear dont get sick as often that doesnt mean that if you probably inject them with tremendous number of bacteriaof one kind or another and the body would get sick but the person wouldnt ive had more clears say this to they say this to they say they say the difficulties are very simple the body is sick and im not i say how do you feel the fellows going around cough cough cough i say how are you doing how do you feel i feel great cough cough cough chuckle i say whats the matter well the body has touch of flu or something and i feel fine and so on now this means that bodies continue to be subject to such things as trains running into them and bacteria poured into them from the unwashed spoons of the cafe and such things but to this illness is not added the perpetuation of the person himself see he doesnt perpetuate the psychosomatic aspect all illness has psychosomatic aspect i believe that in operating thetan at that level youd be able to take body and smash it up against the wall and it would bounce down in good shape and it would be in perfect condition that is higher condition we have not experienced that condition and we are talking about clearing i remind you we are not talking about anything that we dont know about i can only tell you what happens now the funny thing about it is you clear somebody and for about two three months after that the body tries to get used to not having to be sick and the guy goes around and he starts shelving this and shelving that and one day he gets up in the morning and all of sudden the pneumonia he had ten years ago goes ffft hed be perfectly alright but the body goes through period of selfadjustment there for about i dont know exactly what the period is on the average but as reported its about ninety days as the person himself gets clear then the body starts clearing see all by itself im talking now the body is clearing physiological aspects its straightening itself up physiologically not mental physiologically see i dont know then whether or not it would be an immediate truth to say that the physical universe oh boy am i telling you lie now i dont know if it would be true that the physical universe around the person would start to straighten up too chuckle i can only tell you that very aberrated people have very aberrated machinery their machinery breaks down you get the famous case that we always speak about joe blow you give joe blow brand new car in perfect condition it has been adjusted withinan inch of its name plate on all factors and facets he gets in the car starter rrrrr rrrr rrow rrow battery runs down batteries have never run down before on any new car that just came out of the plant but it ran down then and he runs it for few miles and all of sudden its developed torsion steering laugh you go down to used car lot you can actually take cars that have been owned by one owner and you can diagnose the case state of their former owners now in some under privileged countries in the world that have been very badly beaten around it is as much as your lifes worth to leave piece of machinery lying around for anybody to get at because it will go boom it doesnt matter how many lendlease tractors it doesnt matter how much tonnage of equipment is poured into the country its going to break down thats what you can say about it during the war during the war it was quite interesting that tons and tons of butter were shipped to starving russia taken up on the mermansk run at great expense of us corvettes and british corvettes and german submarines remember they were an expensive item too and when they arrived why the russians used it to grease the tanks with thats quite interesting im not telling you anything now i just dreamed up they did thats what they used our butter for it tasted sweet it didnt have any particular rancid flavor and there were hairs in it and so they knew it wasnt butter chuckle but butter under heat is not good lubricant if youve ever tried to fry steak or something like that in butter in skillet thats too hot it burns and so did the tanks so it isnt exactly mental aura were talking about you know they actually do odd things and one of the characteristics of aberration is to misuse equipment you use fork not to eat with or turn things in frying pan with but to hold the door open with and you go around some places youll find out that the equipment is all misused one way or the other shoes are stored in the ice box all kinds of things are occurring but this is what you see in an under privileged country that is rather aberrated on the average thats what you see but im not just talking about that when i talk about area of influence of person im actually talking about an esoteric exotic incomprehensible not measurable sphere of calm that can surround somebody or sphere of confusion that can surround somebody that actually affects the environment im sure youve had person who has come to see you youve had other people come to see you and everything was okay when you put the dinner on the table and they sat down and everything why dinner got eaten and everybody got up after you know dishes got done that sort of thing you had nice evening you know nice dinner this person were discussing however comes to dinner now they didnt even go near the stove but for the first time in months the rice boiled over the soup burned the best crockery fell on the floor they werent even near the kitchen and they sit down at the table you know and half the things are missing or theres too many of them and they dont hit the plates they hitthe tablecloth you get the idea and half way through dinner theres tremendous emergency that requires that you not finish dinner theres just things go wrong the one thing we can say about these people things go wrong and it doesnt physically evidently take anything to make them go wrong they just do now if we take the converse of this there are people around whom things go right person moves in things start going right the person doesnt do anything just things start going right get the idea i can give you an example of that i knew young officer im awfully hard on ensigns because they cost my life several times laugh and they these few tiny little grey hairs up there each one of thems an ensign failing to put ammunition aboard failing to put the charts aboard you know that sort of thing telling the crew they could all have liberty one hour before sailing you know this sort of thing but this young man came from california of all things you wouldnt expect it but he did and he was rather plump calm young fellow and up to that time the ship had never been able to get any supplies except if i myself would apply for them but he walked aboard and all of sudden we were wealthy people just walked down the deck with five gallon cans of paint and hand them to us you know over at the ammunition depot theyd say youre sure you have enough ammunition we were wealthy this young man i might as well say his name his name was ensign dye very unlikely that he would have name like that and would make things live to the degree that he did but things lived around this person there are other persons youd give him plant it would promptly go zzzt drooping you give somebody else plant it would go zzzoom soaring up you say good god lets get rid of that before it fills the room you know just thrives now when were talking about those things were talking about sphere of influence direct sphere of influence not via mest this person is actually influencing mest events matter energy space and time one way or another ive known person that could never be on time for anything even though they left two hours early this person ordinarily left to take train two hours early he had the whole family sitting down in the waiting room at the depot for two hours before the train left and then miss it i said to this person once i said how do you manage this and the person looked very thoughtful and then came out of it all of sudden and realized that i was coming in little too close now similarly there are people you see if were talking about the physical universe and zone of enturbulation body of course is close up area and body without much causation can simply get sick by being in such zone i have known nurses much as your life was worth to have one on the case they walk in the temperature soars harry leon wilson ruggles of red gap one of one of the better old time writers of novels and things wrote one called oh doctor i think the name of the thing was and he had black watch mary i think her name was and she comes in on the case picks up the thermometer along side of the bed shoves it in the patients mouth takes it out sneers throws the thermometer in the waste basket takes out her own whips it out shoves it in his mouth takes it out and reads it 106 ah thats much better laugh now freedom from illness would then not consist of running away from illness it would just be matter of illness as result of enturbulated zone an area of influence it would simply be negative gain that far but then there is positive thing this society gets so sick that it forgets something that there is positive good people think that evil is positive and only evil is positive thats because you can kill man so quick and you can mock him up so slowly for instance nations which is criteria you cant even talk about the insane in nation in the same breath well have to sensor this film destroy it some day i realize because the way the worlds going why remark like that would be considered high treason but if they manage to hide the master and bring it out few years later some nation will consider it compliment that it is not even insane see its further off than that i dont know why it is but nations do seem to demonstrate an individuality which comes close to insanity you start to add up the characteristics of nation do it some time for sport add up the characteristics of nation what it does and then say what would i think of an individual if it did these things well id throw him in garbled it takes twenty years to grow young man so that you throw him away in brief time in war thats an interesting thing isnt it well if nation as aberrated as it is could mock him up ping you see why it wouldnt have this disproportion of positive good and positive evil so you get this positive evil would not appear quite so authoritative or quite so forceful but that you spent hours and hours making cake and people come in and go swish swish and then gulp cake that appears that evil has great authority and that you have to work very very hard to be good now the harder you have to work to produce something the less creative you are i love these authors who spend seven years writing book they tell you this to impress you with the fact that this is good book thats not true not true i usually tell one of these fellows if you could just mock up the manuscript paper with all the writing on it pop that would be the finest novel ever written they think im being funny its not true i am not being funny its an actual fact that you were that good at creativeness little thing like plot and characterizations and witty words certainly wouldnt bother you any in other words theres positive good so we get this other factor here of zone of influence where good takes place in other words theres positive good here it isnt just absence of evil and so we get freedom from illness we also get proof up against illness by recreation of the body member which would become ill very rapidly where we get such zone you see theres double thing at work here and the modern world has lost sight of the positive aspect of good the next thing we put down just for the multitude because any thetan in his right mind doesnt mind little bit of pain it is after all sensation and if you dont believe this run little process on somebody sometime sit him down and then say waste pain this way waste pain that way waste pain all of sudden pain appears very valuable to him you just have him go on little further have him run enforced pain for little while and you could until he gets to agreeing with the society again take his loose skin and pinch it very very hard and he would say ah thanks thats an interesting thing but pain is defined certain way but if we defined it this way an undesirable sensation then we have truth here in saying freedom from pain which is saying freedom from an undesirable sensation the next freedom that we could write down that scientology would carry with it is ignorance ignorance contains of course potential to know doesnt it we have the old first postulate idea native state in which the thetan knows everything and then he has to notknow the whole lot of it so that he can know something then he has to know whole bunch of particulars see here he is he knows everything he has potentiality of total knowingness and then he has to say i notknow all of these things then he comes down and knows whole bunch of particulars and now again he notknows these particulars this we term forgetting and after hes got all of that suppressed we get ignorance ignorance goes along with obsessive making nothing out of everything if you dont believe this talk someday to stupid man stupid people are not dangerous to have around so much as unnecessary now stupid person stupid person can do some of the weirdest things the great revolutionaries of the world are the very very bright and the very very stupid now you take somebody whos very very bright he could see these various wrongs so he says they ought to be overthrown and then you get somebody else whos very very stupid and he doesnt see any wrongs he just fails to understand anything wrong or right so he says i cant understand it therefore its evil and i will overthrow it and we get hitlerian revolt you know we got to overthrow everything we do not understand well this doesnt carry with it the potentiality of everything being understandable dont ever make that mistake you know how people convince people theyre ignorant they take something which cannot be understood chuckle and then they say you stupid jerk why dont you understand this isaac newton did this one time he invented thing called calculus chuckle now people in colleges people in colleges prove theyre bright by knowing calculus by knowing exactly what to do with it exactly how to handle it and everything about calculus and prove other people are stupid because the other people say this is interesting but does it have any real use or can it be done some other way you get the idea now calculus is not really flagrant example lets go upstairs now into something that is drawing big pay from the government at every side lets take psychology these people say there is subject here and then people rush in and say well teach little bit of it and they say oh well it takes years and years and years to understand anything about it and of course youre stupid because you dont understand anything about it but it takes so many years to understand something about it and this way nobody ever finds out theres nothing there you get what nice trick that is its an interesting trick the first thing science of mind should be able to do is to change minds science should have control of an area the science of physics certainly can change lot of things within its zone if it expects to be effective and when we say science then we have some connotation of effectiveness and i suppose there can be an esoteric science which is not effective at all and which doesnt treat anything but it would only be an honest one if it said so dont ever make the mistake of believing that youre ignorant simply because you do not understand non comprehensible because thats the oldest trick in the universe when im talking about ignorance im talking about very mechanical thing im talking about the fellow who refuses to know what he has already found out now hes ignorant hes stupid this fellow already knows that he only gets one body this lifetime theyre rationing them very thinly at this time have you noticed that very thin rations on bodies youre supposed to make one last one whole lifetime this fellow know this he knows he isnt going to get another body so he jumps into car and goes tearing down the highway drives on both sides of the road comes to dangerous intersection times it so as to cross it at the same time with truck comes out of the hospital jumps into car drives down the road and times it so as to touch at the same time as truck he comes out of the hospital gets into car and drives down the road crosses dangerous intersection and times it to cross the same time as truck that fellows stupid given the fact that hell only get one body and that he wants the body given that fact then we get stupidity now of course if hes merely after if his goal essentially is the destruction of all bodies all cars and all trucks then hes being howling success and in his own right can be considered very intelligent he knows how to make it intersect with truck every time and that takes some doing laughing now wherever we have wherever we have ignorance we generally have the remainder of things that man considers bad one of the first and foremost of them is ignorance you have to have almost willful ignorance before you have hopeless case now iq is not necessarily intelligence or brilliance or smartness jan told about professor one day who said this professor said that iq is what the test measured which i think is very good because essentially in dianetics its the original thesis it gives the purpose of the mind in there brief form of it is supposed to resolve problems relating to survival we dont know what intelligence is but we know what ignorance is and we can put test up here that says he is not ignorant by so many points chuckle you get the idea thats about all we can test we can test his potential now clear of course has to be out of this zone of ignorance 135 i think is some people have told lately that thats genius although i used to consider it college average i use to think that ought to be then i met some college boys of this generation and i found out it wasnt college average any more so well say its genius ive been invalidated there 135 is pretty darn high iq now i found something very peculiar about people who have 135 and above i found out they dont have any real difficulty in communicating thats because they are not in the dark about what were communicating but people who are below 80 have an awful lot of trouble trying to find out what youre talking about and most of your discussion with them concerns the definition of what youre discussing you keep saying the car needs washing and they say the car the car the car the car the car the car and you say yes the car its out there on the driveway and there it is and so on you finally lock on conversation so called and you get this car out there alright you got that located and the you say there you better get bucket and they say why you say well the car needs washing and they say washing washing washing here we go see so that your quote communication with these people is simply voltairs if you would argue with you must define your terms well all you do with these people is define objects you just go on endlessly talking about what you were talking about without ever talking about it you never get anywhere beyond the point of that now youve known such people very often very often boy or girl in his or her teens will conceive this of the parents of the family they conceive the parents to be very very stupid mostly because they can never hold conversation what they miss is this the parents might havebeen stupid in their own sphere or they might have been smart but they are certainly educated into one frame of reference and their powers of observation grasp certain values that apply to their age bracket and the teenager has entirely different sets ofvalues for the same apparent scenery the parents look at car the boy looks at hot rod same vehicle the boy never sees the car properly put together he sees the thing properly stripped down with enough vitties in it and he says why are you driving that old heap and in view of the fact that its comfortable gets to work gets back it is what the neighbors also own which makes it correct the correct tie the correct chapeau the correct gown used to be societys basic discussion point and now its the correct car the correct ranch type you know theyre wearing cars now and you get different viewpoints but person who is very bright can shift his viewpoint with speed he realizes hes talking to teener he picks it up at once that the teener is not talking about car the teener is talking about hot rod hes not talking about performance in terms of comfort hes talking performance in terms of zing hes not talking about smoothness of motor hes talking about loudness of motor i know i ran into this the other day with mary sue she was hoping they hadnt put muffler on new speed boat it sounded so lovely now her idea that sounding lovely was crack crack crack crack the least it sounded like was the cannonade thatpreceded the battle of waterloo i thought it was nice sound myself but the boat people came down and put muffler on it and now all the sound is inside the cockpit so it deafens you if you ride in it chuckle but anyway person who is who is this word intelligent this word smart these words all have connotations we really dont have word to determine brilliance because its not really defined there havent been enough bright people around for anybody to notice what brightness was but its matter of being able to identify this is one test of it identify whats happening whats going on and what the objects are all about and what they mean to the other fellow intelligence then isnt something as the psychologists would have you believe that its innately implanted here just sixteenth of millimeter on the other side of the medulla oblongata it doesnt apply to just the person its second party thing in other words its the ability to know what the other fellow is thinking you get the idea in only that way can intelligence be demonstrated or conversation or communication be held it has to have some perception of what the rest of the world all is about well this also then requires tolerance requires perception observation requires an awful lot of things fellow has to be able to look and identify for himself and look and identify for the other fellow in order to communicate thats just one factor of intelligence its not first dynamic operation at all its multiple dynamic operation i suppose if fellow was smart enough he would know what the supreme being was thinking about but of course if he was that smart hed probably be excommunicated anyway the whole area here of ignorance would also be able to embrace the idea that somebody could not identify so that you would then not keep on saying but its car im talking about washing the car the car you know the thing you get the idea he wouldnt be going down scale on toboggan trying to communicate and thats partially freedom from ignorance freedom also from the other fellows ignorance so hes stupid so what heres bucket of water and heres some wood haul and hew feller chuckle but of course the ignorant cant even draw water and chop wood thats whats remarkable to i went out one time very very stupid fellow that was hired in the woods to do woods workand he was hired because he would work and because he was stupid at least this is what the woodsman told and i went out to where he was working and i found that the tree behind him had more felling axe marks than the tree in front of him and every time he lifted this axe he hit something with it that he didnt intend he was working there for little while and he finally came up the house and he said to he said have you got beach umbrella and i said yes yes i have beach umbrella and he said can i borrow it i said alright alright he borrowed it he took it out lugged it out into the woods when he got it in the woods he came back with the beach umbrella and he says well the sun is so bright when there isnt any sun but its not so bright out in the woods and i never have been able to figure that out to this day theres reason to go on worrying about it i abandoned it years ago laughing he made little bit of chaos where i was concerned i found out he had the rest of the crew on their ears and the rest of the crew in that logging area kept begging the foreman to fire him before he killed somebody they tell him to light up the boiler in the morning you know so hed stuff it full of straw and hed stuff it full of straw and hed stuff it full of straw and the next thing you know he had small forest fire going he didnt light the boiler he lit the forest laugh this was an interesting case now we go little bit further when we talk about clearing and we get another zone which is very important person who is very bright in the determination that ive been talking about brightness who is very bright person who is very very intelligent seems to make other people brighter now thats an interesting fact so that youre pretty good youre pretty good and you move in on this zone this area and theres some other people there and these other people are all enturbulated about some horrible puzzle and they cant seem to figure out which way to shift into low or something of the sort you show up you dont show them but they shift into low ever see anything like this thats zone influence in terms of brightness well i wouldnt go so far as to say that if more people were brighter more people would be brighter but its true if more people were brighter then more people than that would become mysteriously brighter i knew one girl one time she was married to writer he was very very brilliant writer he was tremendous boy and he oh youve seen one of his pictures destination moon this guys real bright bob heinlein anyway bob had the horrible effect upon people of making them very bright theyd get around bob theyd talk to bob for little while and next thing youd know theyd be bright you know young writers and so forth were always coming around to get rubbed off on them little bit and he was married to girl boy was she bright oh she was just sharper than tack and then unfortunately due to the fortunes of war and few other things he wasnt married to her any more i ran into her and you talk about stupid person boy was she stupid and she lived the rest of her life just that stupidly and she didnt live long either but there was fantastic little test of things about the brightest person you ever met was that girl as long as she was in location of very bright person you see that now that doesnt mean that everybodys bright because theyre in the area of some bright person god forbid if youre not bright in your own right youll never be free from ignorance but you can make person bright in his own right by clearing rather easily iq on old time processing used to go up at the rate of one point per hour of processing just as neat as you please if you tested it and it was good processing it went up at the rate of one point per hour now there are some techniques which arent necessarily part of clearing at all it had to do with withholding running various types of withholding and running it in various ways but you could shoot peoples iq up at about five points an hour rather fabulous but this is their own brightness theyre acquiring not anybody elses you see but freedom from ignorance would be basically freedom from liability because of the ignorance of others therefore you wouldnt have to totally depend upon the tolerance of the world you live in it becomes very important the last part of these freedoms here is the most controversial of them all this little thing i have not talked about for some years death ive just not talked about it very much scientologists though have developed considerable awareness of what this is all about they have good grip on the situation we arent good enough yet so that we can overthrow this critter and dispense with it entirely or to pick up one of our friends after hes disappeared down this chute or route but this phenomena depends totally upon fixation of identity in terms of bodies if body is an identity then death defeats us in costing us our friends dont you see until we have overcome death we will still lose friends thats for sure there are many people not many there are only about five that i wish were here today in the flesh because i liked them they were good people and theyve gone off to the four quarters of somewhere now these people comprise very low mortality rate for as many people as there are in scientology they comprise very low mortality rate but they nevertheless they nevertheless have disappeared about five of them over long period of time here several of them very dear friends of mine and very very missed now the conquest with death is personal thing they had not developed the facility and this is not really part of being clear but they had not developed the facility to perpetuate their identity in the absence of an identified body thats the only trick now were really talking about something awfully esoteric arent we when were talking about this were talking about something exotic were talking about something that is magic far beyond that sort of thing one of the first things fellow realizes with great clarity on the road up is that he is not his body and as he realizes this more and more we can see that new thing would take place ill go into that in moment but all recognition and all freedom begins with the individual thats thats horrible thing to have to face because it tells us that the individual is the beginning point of any realization and after that there is sense in talking about the masses when people are really licked they talk about the masses when they are whipped when they dont know where theyre going or what theyre doing they talk about the masses they talk about people i dont know any people i know person but ill tell you this when person who fixates on the masses has failed to communicate somewhere along the line with one person and ever afterwards is putting out generalized communication hoping it will reach that person he failed to communicate to mama every time he said mama can i aw shut up you know some ladylike rebuttal later on he decides that hes going to communicate to the masses why he hopes in some circuitous fashion that the communication on via will get around and get to the old lady after all you got that youll find that people who fixated on the masses cannot talk to the individual now you wanna watch one of these boys and you wanna watch yourself because you become dangerous person when this happens to you that when you can talk to many and also talk to one now when you can sell somebody out of his eyeteeth individually visavis and you can also talk to group you become dangerous person the world at large recognizes this the american government today likes nothing worse than people who are in charge of groups leaders of groups they think hmmmm however they are usually victimizing only people who are talking to masses theyre not dangerous theyre not really dangerous at all because they never communicate to person i never saw mass of people sit down to read book have you its not happened at all so therefore we have to start with the one we start with basic unit of youness basic unit of you before we start anywhere id like to draw you this little picture of the dynamics large sketch pad is set up on an easel we talked about these freedoms we talked about freedom from death well freedom from death depends in large degree upon this graph i never showed you this graph before i talked about it in angeles i think in the fall of 50 and then came right off of it its the eight dynamics its very easy to enumerate they simply consist of self which is the urge towards survival of ones self sex the urge towards survival through sex the second dynamic the third dynamic group the fourth dynamic mankind the urge towards survival through fifth the animal kingdom or the world of bodies or bodies in general the urge toward survival through bodies sixth the physical universe the urge toward survival through the physical universe seventh which is the dynamic of the spirit which is the urge towards survival through the spirit and eighth which is merely infinity and we turn it right side up and we get eight you can call that supreme being or anything else you have found out about it laugh now heres peculiarity on the eight dynamics theyre matter of reach they are matter of spirit influence theyre matter of reach here is the first dynamic drawing tiny circle in center of pad person who would only be on the first dynamic would have this area of reach of merely self but dont think thats bad thing youve been educated some of you to believe that the thought of self and awareness of self and that sort of thing is bad thing you should think of the other fellow never of you and that sort of thing now were talking about below the line lets go on up here very rapidly drawing concentric circles outward from the tiny center circle heres your second dynamic third dynamic fourth dynamic fifth dynamic sixth dynamic seventh dynamic and out here of course is your eighth now this is very fascinating your first dynamic here pointing to it on pad has to be real now up above this line drawing horizontal line across the middle of the pad and through the center of the 1st dynamic this is matter of reach dont you see were talking about reach were talking about how far an individual can go not necessarily in terms of space but how far his influence exists when we talk about this first dynamic we say well he can influence himself pretty well we probably mean body and so forth out here would be your second dynamic well what about your second dynamic well if he could control that pretty good hed really be something the third up here the handling of groups this becomes little more rare but can be done that is handling number of first dynamics we get up here to the fourth were merely talking about handling that species to which he belongs if we were talking about the fourth dynamic of cockroaches wed be talking about all the cockroaches that are in this universe we happen to be talking about physical bodies of human beings so were not talking about cockroaches now this fourth dynamic merely means body of the species fifth dynamic would be all life forms thats your combination of life plus material objects making body forms this would be trees and grass and all the rest of that alright theres your command there and your sixth dynamic would be the physical universe heres your seventh dynamic and would be all of the spiritual world on this last circle and then outside that you got an infinity pointing below center line and writing and you got two three four five six seven eight minus we also got minus one where does the average person sit in this community or this society today you dont think for moment that hes totally aware of himself do you if he did he would be able to influence his whole history and everything else hed be natural clear and there arent very darn many of them his zone of influence and so forth just around himself he would become so darn notable that just oh gee you know so people are at least at minus one you know well i dont amount to much i m nobody you know how it is erase erase i know i want the trophy but i slipped negation of self alright now lets walk down hill here and we see minus second well this individual is inhibited sexually thats enough to put him on minus second thats enough he read freud once finished chuckle minus third he thinks of groups as masses not as firsts he knows what group is its mass thats the way he defines it but how about this fellow at minus four who is talking about mankind little boy runs up to him and says daddy can i have nickel get away you little brat mankind has got to be saved get away from here laughing get the idea hes not upstairs on any of these dynamics above him but mankind this is weird deal when you get to thinking this over hes just going on an avoidance the further we go south the more hes avoiding the things just north of him you see these things up here to the north from the south are beyond his ken and as he goes down here to minus six nuclear physicist he never looks at it but he says theres something in it i know theres something in it if i combine enough stuff this way mumble itll go booom and there will be fifth fourth third second wheee so we actually have your divisions here of constructive and destructive person who is in very good shape can construct and destroy but persons who can only destroy are certainly below this line and persons who can construct and gradually as we go up we get them to destroy too but they can do this at analytical choice are above this line now we get then negative dynamics and this is the way they are laid out and where do people normally exist on these negative dynamics its very interesting but theyre some where around there antisocial you have to get somebody up the line up here at least get him sexually inhibited freud undoubtedly improved the whole society you have to get enough of him there so he can make nothing out of it before he can find himself judgment which is an ot subject which well be talking about in the next acc actually consists of ive been searching for years for what judgment is it is how many and what side dynamics does person compute on instantly thats judgment if an individual computes on the first dynamic only hes got more judgment then most people now if he can compute when he thinks of solution to an automobile accident or something like that he thinks in terms of first second third fourth you know and thats his solution it embraces that many positive dynamics okay but if it embraces that many negative dynamics you can peg him about where he sits and then you can tell him after that what he ate what hes trying to get rid of what hes fleeing from and so forth where his obsessions lie its quite interesting that is judgment how many dynamics he can simultaneously compute on but that is not really what were covering here what were trying to cover here is that as an individual goes up here he is running away from the world pointing below the center line and up here he is reaching into the world pointing above the center line and the further an individual can reach the more he can control and if an individual is totally aware of himself as an immortal being he has not yet come up to point where he can make somebody else aware that he of himself without body is an immortal being and then we get up here to the third dynamic on the subject of death so death perhaps is just little bit beyond the scope of clear but death is certainly at the first dynamic and the individual would be free from death these are the four freedoms that we are talking about here today and they actually do pose new view of society and without anybody inventing new society if you look this over and thought of society free from these things you might ask yourself two questions whatll we do for game i think we could dream that up if we were this good and the other one is what would society look like how much security would there be and wouldnt people be little bit happier in it we can ask that question and whether you answered yes or is beside the point because you have total freedom of choice to be as bad off as you want what were talking about here is that person shouldnt be forced to be bad off now therefore the gate opens and the gate opens certainly on these things and many many more that we wouldnt really be able to embrace in very fast rundown the next lectures that im going to give you are going to immediately concern the techniques of how you bring an auditor up to being able to run techniques and the techniques themselves with their present day auditing commands which do make clear and i do hope that you appreciate the information and that it has some slight value thank you end of lecture transcript of lrh video taped lecture number 4 of 6 the clearing congress lectures shoreham hotel washington dc july 5 1958 prerequisites to auditing what did they do where are you at with the upper indocs let ask this question today has anybody arrived yet at the congress laughing very good very good well todays lectures are dry uninteresting extremely old hardly anything in them that you want to know so pay attention laugh today weve by the way heard from some more countries you know this is country weve very often slighted little bit you know because its so close next door but thats canada and weve heard from our old friend johan templehoff up in toronto i know this will be the best congress until the next one good listening you know scientology is occupies the most space on this earth than practically anything were certainly occupying more space than several other things we are in countries that havent even heard of christianity thats pretty good were also were also to be found i heard recently inside the iron curtain some fellows telling that this situation and i wanted to know which side was inside garbled laugh well i promised you here in these early lectures that we were going to review this subject called scientology take look at it and find out what are the essential parts that we had to have in order to clear people and im going to sail into it right now and talk about just that its very good thing to summat importances one of the first things you must know in the development of anything is that importance the evaluation of datum in comparison with other data is more important than an ocean of data i hear every once in while somebody saying that some student he studied it he just got all swamped with data and so on well ill tell you whats wrong with that student he couldnt evaluate importances be on time at nine oclock at the academy very important datum always run process so long as it produces change and longer obviously of equal importance arent they actually the first one is slightly more important because nibs said it laughing the whole trick of developing an adequate and workable and practical science of life was connected with this evaluation of importances i might let you in on little secret one of the things one of the operating principles many of the operating principles by the way are in dianetics evolution of science and weve never seen them since but they are still standing there as operating principles behind the organization of this particular subject but i took such blocks of knowledge such wide blocksof knowledge as religion let us say yoga and examined it to find out whether or not it ever done anybody any good and determined whether or not it had or hadnt as i viewed it and then set the whole block of knowledge aside and further examination was given to it in this way i could weed out all the pieces of knowledge that hadnt gotten man anywhere and then this left very few this left very few it left such things as mathematics and the physical sciences as apparently something had done something for him but not too much so this established proper pattern of thinkingness in order to go about the development of the science now i assure you if yoga had worked everything out very beautifully and if we had very nice result we would haveused mystic pattern of thinkingness but it hadnt apparently worked now that is what is meant by evaluation of importance what were the important bodies of data into which one could look i found out before id been on the road very long that even mathematics and the natural sciences werent legitimate areas of examination i found out there were some much more legitimate areas life laugh it never occurred to anybody to look there before everybody had been studying this subject of livingness you see on great many vias and it never occurred to them to look at the guy and it never occurred to them that mind was visible and it is it might not be to the practitioner but its certainly visible to the person he can see it hear it and smell it and ive had people tell well i dont go into things that you cant see feel hear experience so i dont pay any attention to the mind i had some physical scientists say this to and of course its rather deadly thing to say to an auditor you know laugh you get into chanting its boy for little whileand he sees feels and experiences mind some of you people who were around with dianetics and that of course throws them at once into birth and birth engrams bite ive seen people run out their noses and ears and sweat and strain and have head somatics and all the contractions of delivery and so forth and this fellow says i cant be being born im 40 years old chuckle thetan certainly can mock up well now if if evaluation of importance is important then what do we mean by one some thing more important than another thing and lets just put it this way something more real to you than another thing and we get the basic study principle of scientologythat which is real to you is real and scientology is that which is real to you and if part of scientology isnt real to you set it on the back burner itll boil over sooner or later laugh i had to explain one time to fellow of rather limited education what scientology was this was coined word we used to use that back in the days when we were ashamed of past lives and i asked him some questions about what in scientology was real to him it was parascientology well what in scientology was real to him well not very much so i said then the subject of scientology in the main to you is parascientology here is the way we go about it we have fellow walking down the street he knows nothing of scientology hes never even heard the word therefore its totally parascientology its totally unreal to him it doesnt exist there is existence nowhe hears of scientology and hears that it did something good for friend of his and he has little hope that it might help him or somebody else that he knows this little tiny bit of hope and the word which hes trying to pronounce correctly that much is scientology and all the remainder is parascientology and then one day he comes along and hears about such thing as an overt act motivator sequence oh what formidable the difference between formidable words in scientology and the formidable words in earlier bungled studies about the mind the difference is that the words in scientology are not there to confuse you they are not there to obscure things and they have meaning now some of you may suspect that theyre just there to boobytrap chuckle the subject for you but the truth of the matter is is they are rather carefully selected theres been whole system of nomenclature in which we have simply tried to pick the simplest word we could get hold of that would describe the thing and then describe it very precisely theres scientology vocabulary i think of about 476 words which covers all of the words used in particular connotation in dianetics and scientology thats not really very large vocabulary in that it that whole vocabulary describes life the spirit the physical universe in like 476 words so almost anybody can learn this alright this fellow goes along and runs into one day the overt actmotivator sequence you do something to somebody and you think it happened to you he remembers vividly kicking his governess in the shins you know and getting his silly head knocked off and he says you know theres truth in that overt actmotivator sequence now he has some he knows the word he has some hope and although hes read lot of scientology nothing had any reality to him except when you do something to somebody else something happens to you and he hasnt even got this right laughing you understand but thats real its real to him therefore scientology to this person now consists of these parts the word the hope that it can do something and his version of the overt actmotivator sequence and thats the total of the subject hes read eighteen books but thats the total of the subject that is now scientology to him you see now we move up the line little bit further and one day hes reading bookand it says something about auditing and he he hasnt read the auditors code he doesnt know very much about it but he hears of something like straightwire something like this he runs into this fellow who cant remember thing so he uses this process and he says well the fellows trying to remember what he said to somebody so this fellow remembers this little process so he says can you recall time when you communicated with someone can you recall time when you communicated with someone and so help this fellows memory opens up and he becomes very cheerful very happy now he did some auditing before his wife had an operation was unconscious he tried to do some auditing and nothing happened the doctor standing right there kept saying you know the doctor was right because the doctor standing right there kept saying well nothings going to happen if you do that chuckle and here this fellow did though run on his friend little bit of straightwire and his friends memory opened up and all of sudden he remembered some incidents that hed totally forgotten and suddenly remembered he was married and laugh after that why his friend went around looking at this fellow that tried it hed say you know he said thats smart man i dont know what he can do but you know hes smart man he does psychotherapy or something of the sort the guy modestly walks around demos thumb in lapellaughing now he has these parts real scientology and the hope is something hes giving other people now thats so real to him he gets it up as i showed you yesterday on the scale of dynamics he got it up to the third dynamic you know and so thats so real he takes that for granted now thats part of believingness and hes got the overt act motivator sequence wrong version laugh thats real and the fact that there is such thing as auditing and that you can produce results with it and he can do it of course theres only one process laugh and thats recall time when you communicated with someone heres an interesting state of affairs ill let you in on something there are actually students who have come and gone some of them dont have that much reality on scientology because their idea of study is quite different their idea of study is not assimilation of the subject but regurgitation of it they believe that study has one purpose only and that is to record on some superficial area they all when theyre this way they all are sure they have part of the skull they write on in shorthand or something that erases very easily and they take this and they read it in book and they write it down on the inside of the skull and then somebody is supposed to come along and say to them what did you study yesterday suspiciously you know and theyre supposed to get off the hot seat simply by copying down what they wrote on this part of the skull on piece of paper and handing it to them thats an examination and they pass the subject they got and now theyre through with it arent they now were embarking on new system of studying when we embark up on study of scientology its new thing its brand new thing nobody demands of you in spite of what your instructors do sometimes when you go to school on it nobody is really demanding of you that you swallow the whole thing and then spit it out and have done with it that is not the system its the instructors plea more or less goes this way please for gods sake understand it because youre not going to be able to do anything unless you grab hold of it the instructor is trying to say get some reality on it or miss get some reality on it now the best instruction would simply be on basis of study all of it you please but pick out that on which you have some reality then get further reality on what you have picked out that was quite real and then study it again and what do you know another little iron door would have opened up and youve got some reality on something else because the study of this subject is not the study of subject its the study of life the subject came from life it applies to you it isnt invented or created in any way shape or form if it hadnt been for an agreement on what to have wrong with you called the axioms if it hadnt been for this you wouldnt be here i had somebody say to sometime you know he looks at through glasses that thick demonstrating an inch with fingers and back of that hes looking at through field that thick demonstrating about 3 feet and so forth and he talks to about your ideas on the mind and i say well i said you know my ideas on the mind are entirely different than scientology and yeah he says mine are too laughing wonderful all we have traced here is that system of agreements which has brought about condition of we call life condition of livingness and unless we address these specific agreements we get nowhere unless you know scientology before you study scientology you couldnt study scientology you get the idea you have to know it first and this is the only subject i know of that we can guarantee that you did it first we dont find people without engrams unless we clear them we dont find people who have to wear an anchor on each ankle to be able to walk down the street because they havent agreed to gravity we just dont find people around who are disobeying all these things because if they were they wouldnt be here its process of elimination now somebody else in some other universe may have agreed to number of other postulates but the funny part of it is they undoubtedly agreed to these postulates on the same pattern that they agreed to the postulates in this universe and we could undo theirs too now the point were making here then is it is study of something it is study of life and the universe and it is study along certain patterns but an individual can find life and all other things so terribly unreal that when they study some part of life they go and enroll in psychology class thats about the most horrible thing that could happen to anyone you know now there are people undoubtedly that hear about this and theyll think im being much much too severe on past psychotherapy and it is professional jealousy or something of the sort im not probably the only reason i mention it is to sort of shake people little bit loose from it make them question it just little bit please because subjects which dont do anything for anybody except confuse them are always held in suspicion by i mean its peculiarity on my part i know other people cherish subjects that do that im peculiar i like to see subject effective and workable and usable and that in essence is what we have but how do we communicate this subject to person who already knows it to whom life is totally obscured now theres quite trick and the trick i was just showing you about make them pick up that which is real to them and then something else thats real to them in the subject and something else thats real to them the possibility exists that they went over the whole subject on all its literature and all its tapes and i assure you theres millions and millions of words on that subject picking out each time that thing which seemed absolutely true and real and which they could agree with and so on they would probably wind up at the end of couple of centuries clear therefore the knowledge that is being picked up isnt second hand knowledge when we say reality or that which you agree with we say when you find in scientology something you already find in yourself you got it you see its there therefore its real because you can own it and take responsibility for it because you sense its true you could never educate anybody in scientology by making them sit down and grind through all the material and say well i dont care what your opinions are the truth of the matter is that axiom 41 is axiom 41 and if you dont get it youre going to flunk and that of course means social ostracism the father and mother wont like you anymore the usual thing they do in public schools the first thing you have to have to train somebody in scientology is somebody who wants to know something about life that immediately skims off of the human race the upper few ten thousands they want to know something about life they really want to know some people tell sometime well people in scientology you know garbled of course they get very short shrift from because i know in actuality having shopped around and looked under the stones and back of the pillars and few things like that ive looked around and i found people that did not want to know anything about life didnt want to go anywhere were in total apathy of utterly sunk and there is limited number of people on earth who will suddenly up and volunteer to look over and study something its limited number theyre the upper intelligentsia im not telling you that for your egos sake out profiles prove it people when they come in theyre the smarter people one of these days why these people picking up other people you see will make another strata and when they can look will want to know too when they can look someday you will be processing cases scraping the bottom of the barrel so to speak he didnt want to know he didnt want to be there all he wanted was to do was to keep on shooting people like he always did you know and he wanted to lead normal life with his proper quota of antisocial diseases you try to get him into the auditing room and he screams all the way down the hall and the neighbors complain and an auditor should be able to handle such case and you can actually do something for this case it wasnt true yesterday but it certainly is true today and when we get such case to be able to unwrap him and put him up into an ability to see an ability to experience and feel and live again why of course we will actually have done something the cases you are auditing by and large are those cases that you have told enough to so that they volunteered so of course youre just skimming the upper cream of earth in clearing we crack the person who didnt want anything to do with anything anyhow he went all the way down as matter of fact we went further south than that to person who is normally psychotic is now in coma and now we can process this person the only person we cant process at this time i will confess to you clearly is the person we cant find because hes left the body now we cant process that person at this time chuckle in the next acc were taking that up laughing so weve gotten it weve gotten it pretty well pretty well dusted off were long way from dianetics where we asked somebody to lie still at least and pull an engram up and run it he had to be willing to lie still and he had to be in good enough shape so that he would follow an order we could not inspect ive had such cases as would not they would pretend to submit to auditing and i had such cases come around to that say later boy i sure fooled that auditor i have been saying yes yes yes all week long and i havent done thing of course he walks out the front door and falls flat on his face hes been restimd totally laugh but heres heres long look in other words we can process anybody god help them now processing person today is an enforcement of reality only for short period of time that is when they are totally unwilling because the processes themselves then snap them up to point where they can see theres some point in it which is good thing pretty good thing now you compare this to theres an old practice that the witch doctors in the ubangi territory used to practice i think the witch doctors were known as sukiryatrists laugh they had they had electric shock machines that they pulsed against peoples heads and they thought this made them well and when it didnt make them well then they went in with drills and bits into the brain you know and did something or other in the brain and killed the thetan the psychiatrists er sukiryatrists excuse method of approach is totally enforced insanity under the guise of enforcing sanity well its only legitimate to enforce reality on somebody when it is reality which they then will find freedom by embracing theres bunch of prisoners in the stockade and you know theres door unlocked so you go to them and you say the south door is unlocked and they say you silly fool you know the south door is never left unlocked and were gonna stay right here its perfectly legitimate boy to sock em on the jaw drag em over open up the south door and throw them out laugh as long as theyre outside its legitimate laugh its true because when they wake up they say you know im free thanks bud you know big difference its evidently not the way to play the game to throw them in deep hole on an enforced reality and close the lid over on them thats the way theyve been playing the game so long weve got to reverse the flow theres further flow in the direction of entrapment see thats totally stuck flow now the subject itself has advanced apparently in leaps and bounds and most people believe that every time the subject advances every thing that was known before is forgotten and lost the only thing that happens to the stuff that went before is its amplified you can understand it little better the evaluation of importance makes some of it not quite so important not quite so important as it was but its still there and still part of the subject now the question comes up what part of the subject is most important if were going to clear somebody well this subject is yours it isnt my idea this subject is yours nobody demands of you that you receive tremendous arduous formal training and so forth in order to use this subject or any part of it we try to regulate it to keep people from getting their silly heads knocked off something like playing with firecrackers occasionally or pieces of dynamite pieces of atom bombs and there are certain things you should know and do in order to use the subject providing you want to use it effectively now if you dont want to use it effectively of course just skip it skip anything you have to know and just pick up any old part of it and see whether or not it works and kind of mess it up and chew up preclear and throw him in the ash can and get another one you could do that nobodys going to interfere with you if you do that however you by and large are men of good will and women of good will you notice they omit that in the bible i think its possible laughing and as person of good will you have right to know the proper approach in the use of the subject which has proven most effective and the most effective levels of approach are those which increase reality on your part up to point where you actually command the subject when you yourself attain reality on the various parts you know the subject longer commands you scientology is legitimate to this degree that it undoes itself and therefore becomes the only legitimate mental study man has ever had other mental study undoes itself in other words anything you learn about scientology or any restimulation that takes place by reason of scientology quite interestingly enough can be undone by scientology scientology can run itself out thats fascinating thing it can even run out chuckle people try it on once in while preclear gets down to thelast garbled chuckle i hear about this every once in while and im immensely flattered i tell them the reason the fellow still must be awfully aberrated chuckle you see on some other line to want to hold on to any valence or any part of one the knowledge which we take up here ive made short brief list here i can read very rapidly the essentials which you would have to have in order to clear somebody and the things which you would have to know in order to clear somebody can be very swiftly related maybe not so swiftly studied but swiftly related here now its the knowledge you see your command of the subject that gives you the results it isnt your ability to walk like an automaton through number of paces your understanding must part of your auditing first thing is the auditors code the next the code of scientologist the next is what we call the training drills the next not quite as important but you find yourself relieved if you know that this is all there are the axioms then you have to know the following scales the arc triangle emotional scale the old arc scale the know to mystery scale and the effect scale these are important scales an auditor has to know something about these things otherwise the preclears reactions dont make good sense to him now the processes he must know before he runs clear processes and on which he should have good reality are as follows what we use to call arc straightwire havingness the old subjective havingness mock it up and push it in mock it up and throw it away he should know about this he should know the objective version of havingness which is trio he should know thinkingness process like assign an intention to that chair assign an intention to that wall just see what this does to preclear he ought to know how to do assists how to make sprained ankle go down you know you keep touching the ankle and tell somebody to look at your fingers and oddly enough he should know how to and should have done engram running the running of engrams and secondaries he should know this because he wouldnt possibly believe that anybody could be this butchered up by pictures and he wouldnt know how pictures act and sound and look like and so forth unless he has really run few of these heavy pictures in other words he should have some personal acquaintance with the reactive bank or hell never know what he got rid of when he clears somebody sort of like bailing for hours and hours and hours and not knowing whether youre bailing mud or quicksilver or water after while the boats empty and its apparently alright but what have you done hang you up on mystery on every preclear you audited you ask why does this fellow feel so good cant understand it youd feel good too if you longer had sword going through you knitting needle going through your head you know how it is laugh he should be able to handle present time problems and thats done of course by problems of comparable magnitude and so forth he should be able to do these things before he gets in to the subject of clearing now you say these are old processes and they apparently have great bearing upon clearing and so forth yeah but you dont get reality on clearing processes unless you already have reality on you might say bank processes now you get reality on the processes ive just named can havingness subjective havingness old time subjective havingness can it do anything for anybody oh boy it sure can its rather easy to handle can trio what we call trio look around here and find something you can have and then its other two steps which is why we call it trio can that do anything for anybody wow if person has just had any bad accident or something of the sort it is easily the best process if they can be audited and are alert you know more or less awake its better process than notice that wall or where did the accident happen or where are you now these knock out havingness and if you can run this process its wonderful process but its very good process in its own right now it doesnt have any lasting place in the clearing processes but its something you should know how to do because when preclear starts to quote run out of havingness he gets nervous he gets upset he gets lot of things you have to know what happened you have to know what this thing is and the best way to know what it is is know that process and know how to run it now actually thats not very many things to know thats not very many things to know youll find them in various text books scientology eight eight thousand eight dianetics modern science of mental health youll find it in the various text books that exist on scientology arc straightwire the simplest thing you ever heard of its earliest version was rather complicated it took some judgment but the pattern version which appears in back of self analysis is oh its killer you can run it on group youll have the group linecharging all over the place in about an hour or fortyfive minutes of an hour you just keep running arc straightwire on the group recall something thats really real to you and all of its various bracket versions if youve never run it on group have ball sometime get group of people and start running this just back of the book back of self analysis arc straightwire youll have some interesting things happening there will be three or four people there wholl just sit there of course thats to be expected if you were running them on engrams theyd just sit there if you were running them on anything else but the very arduous physical processes they would just sit there and theres reason for you to worry about the fact they didnt participate in the group auditing the truth of the matter is they dont participate which is their keynote you can cure that too now youd say then an introduction to scientology would be able to use some of its principles in life but theres nothing short of good command of auditing itself nothing short of good command of it will produce good uniform results and it requires very good command of it to produce clears so dont think that we now have some sort of button whereby the auditor walks up to the preclear presses this magic button and we get clear dont the auditor has to have great deal of understanding he has to take this case apart he has to know what this case is about he can run it there are auditors who actually had to be retrained bit before they can start clearing somebody unfortunately the most rapid clearing requires judgment on the auditors part he has to have the ability to find out what is wrong with the preclear well take that up later but the point is that without knowledge of preclears and without knowledge of the mind without knowledge of the bank without knowledge of all these things he hasnt got prayer think of handing sigmund freud as good as he was as practitioner he was pretty good practitioner do all sorts of tricks with people you just hand him the commands of clear procedure to run on somebody whew freuds pretty sharp boy i tell you he wouldnt have made it i well remember lecturing before number of st elizabeths psychiatrists many many years ago some of you heard this story before there were numerous stories came out of that particular incident i lectured for week and i gave the same lecture which was the basic fundamentals of dianetics and i told them about time track i told them garbled and then id say to them now in the other room are some practitioners and they will show you how to audit people the psychiatrists never went in the other room they sat and listened to these fundamentals there were patients in the other room to be audited but they never went in there they listened about the time track they listened to about dianetic reverie the fact that you could tell person to go back in time you see you could tell these and theyd listen to this in theory and one of them finally came to at the end of the week and he says say you got something there in dianetics that we can really use i said sooo hah and he said yes i had patient whos in terrible shape and ive been trying for years to get this patient to find something in his past that i could analyze laugh he started ranting down the track the time when he was two tears old he says nobody can remember when theyre two you know the myelin sheathing isnt formed and i got him back down there and there he was lying in crib with his father cursing him for having dirty diapers there it was the father complex right there he says i started right in and i told him what it was yes of course the information rather dazed him but youve really got some things in dianetics that we can use and i said to myself yes mister but we cant use you as practitioner laugh one of the first things which old time psychotherapy didnt have was the auditors code every once in while somebody whos been auditing for couple or three years goes back and reads the auditors code and finds couple of points that if hed just kept with he would have had it made on case or two that one about not changing the process so long as it produced change of course really tells you all you really need to know about how long to run process if freud and other people practicing in that wise had had copy of the auditors code they would have made much more startling results because it isnt necessarily true that all their theories are totally wrong boy did you get the modifiers in that chuckle it isnt necessarily true that all of their theories are totally wrong chuckle almost as covert as their psychotherapies chuckle now every good hca has this memorized book in hand i dont laugh the auditors code is important enough to give good look at here because unless an auditor gets across this bridge or agrees with some part of this as an operating activity horrible things happen that he doesnt want to have happen we collected these things the first auditors code was when knighthood was in flower i think it was taken directly from chivalric code the one thing we should have preserved out of it an auditor has to have guts i dont think thats the way the knights said it but thats the way i would say it he has to have guts courage i was having preclear conferences with an auditor in another country over long distance telephone it was rather complicated because he was not in the capitol city of that country and its phones were indifferent and i didnt happen to be in washington i happened to be in place down in virginia and its phone connections were rather indifferent and we actually got case on the road just because of the fact that the auditor had stark nerve just guts that was all he was in household that spoke foreign language that was totally psychotic he had the relatives the local medicos trained nurses and so forth screaming at him in all directions he just kept on going to work on psychotic girl and he got her back on her feet squared around that auditor by the way is rare auditor he is superlative in this particular line i can tell you some stories about him practically gruesome hes one of the best auditors in the country laughing he was auditing criminal one day i must tell you he was auditing criminal one day and i said well the man is so combative have him fight the wall this auditor by the way is fernando strata and he called up few minutes later and he says he wont do it shall i tone 40 it so i said oh sure go ahead fernando laughing after while i heard the building shaking next door i didnt pay very much attention to it finally the preclear comes in his hands running raw red blood the building next door one whole wall of bedroom there that we were using plaster lathe right straight on out to the brick just totally wiped out fernando said well he was sort of unwilling to do it laugh fernando had just taken his fist and made him fight the wall the criminal by the way i dont think hes been up before the cops since it was quite long time ago this took quite bit of doing now i dont say that all auditing should result in blood but it was better that his hands bled little bit than he spend the rest of his life in jail thats just about what it amounted to because he was homicidal but fernando didnt care guts thats the one thing we should have preserved that isnt in this code heres the code do not evaluate for the preclear we call to your attention that psychoanalysis was total evaluation the analyst was supposed to find out something and then analyze that fact into the persons head with his explanation that was the way he went about it scientologists do not evaluate for the preclear sometimes we can stretch this little bit too strongly and never tell the preclear that its the end of session because that would be evaluating for him you see laugh 2 do not invalidate or correct the preclears data preclear says you know i remember i was out at that summer place i must have been five or six if youve got somebody else in the room that knew him john that was when you were ten you remember that its not when you were five or six its when you were ten if an auditor does something like this the preclear comes up with datum and he hasnt got it straight and the auditor knows he hasnt got it straight if the auditor points it out well youve just finished one session and not likely to get the next one started either 3 use the processes which improves the preclears case thats dirty snide remark chuckle of course you dont know what processes improve the case until youve used some process on the case right that of course gives you latitude never to use process which improves the c it doesnt really laughing now 4 keep all appointments once made thats the only one i find auditors breaking once in while they say to the preclear ill be there at four oclock they appear at fourfifteen preclear says he doesnt want to help garbled they spend the remaining auditing period running this out as present time problem next day auditor says hell be there at four oclock doesnt appear til fourtwenty preclear says he didnt want to help and they spend the rest of the auditing session tunning this out as present time problem i dont think that would get anywhere do you another one do not process preclear after ten pm and do not process preclear who is improperly fed very very interesting pair of data every single datum in this auditors code was developed the hard way by the early birds in dianetics and scientology developed the hard way we found out every person who had ever spun under processing had been audited after ten pm and had been audited when he was improperly fed that was enough to put this into the auditors code we cut that down to ribbons then people dont ordinarily spin under processing and we havent had anybody do it for so many years ive almost forgotten how it is mostly because of this auditors code do not permit frequent change of auditors do not sympathise with the preclear now that that of course is stretching it that of course is stretching it too far you should be able to sympathize with the poor fellow now ans then shouldnt you chuckle ive heard it said that when you can longer do something for person you can sympathize with him never permit the preclear to end the session on his own independent decision when the preclear runs out the door you go out the door and you bring him back and say end of session of course laugh never walk off from preclear during session its alright to threaten to but never do it laugh never get angry with preclear thats another one that will spin one for while half way through session all of sudden the auditor is furiously angry with him he just sits there and spins in it takes him few days to come out of it always reduce every communication lag encountered by continual use of the same question or process always continue process as long as it produces change and longer be willing to grant beingness to the preclear never mix the processes of scientology with those of other practices and number 16 which is always stay in twoway comm with the preclear now that code of practice is really more desirable in your kit of knowledge as an auditor although instructor will tell you this i can than superficial knowledge the trs the training drills in other words its more important to adhere to the auditors code than it is to adhere to training drills training drills make it possible for you to tolerate the activities called for in the auditors code do you see that so its actually the auditors code that bring the training drills into existence and the training drills then make it possible to do so person studying scientology with the desire to help his fellow man must enter on such bridge otherwise he will start doing things that undo the good he is trying to do now the training drills are part and parcel to it and these other skills are part and parcel to it all of this data can be found in the books and i call to your attention that there are certain scales the arc emotional scale the know to mystery scale the effect scale that these scales are still very valid and they are still very important now that tells you theres vast amount of data and tremendous number of odds and ends of processes and types and so forth that are not now considered vital even though they do good things but are not vital and it sort of narrows the look down little bit dont you see that doesnt omit these other things from scientology and say they dont exist anymore but it does say that these are absolutely essential and anybody whos being trained or who wants to know this subject should enter it through this sort of door now everybodys always asking for fast way you know to hand friend to hand friend book they want to write book they can hand friend book read it garbled very interested and then immediately becomes your friend garbled and so on and thats all very nice its all very nice im afraid that doesnt exist yet because and i dont think it will ever exist because it presupposes the ability on the part of your friend 1 to read and 2 to understand what he reads and i will write such book providing you will audit all of your friends up to point where they can get some reality on what i am saying laugh thank you end of lecture transcript of lrh video taped lecture number 5 of 6 the clearing congress lectures shoreham hotel washington dc july 5 1958 clear procedure cch0 help thank you ive been informed were having congress down at the shoreham and i just found out about it and im little bit late but i wanted to come down and tell you couple of things ive learned lately if you want to hear them thats whats known as running the effects scale laugh the next two hours are going to concern themselves now that we have led up to it rather carefully going to concern themselves with clear procedure and this i trust if youre not clear already in the next few months this will concern you intimately okay i want to give you the rundown the exact processes and the commands in order to clear homosap okay alright the first things are the conditions of auditing first requisite preclear next requisite an auditor next requisite place to audit even if you have to make the space you have to have little place to audit in if youre doing this out in some other universe why remember that it might be universe around with space in it the state department i think has universe with space in it laugh theyre in germany all the time or some place now the auditor as i have talked about in the last hour should have pretty good idea of this thing called the auditors code and he should be pretty well drilled on his trs this is particularly so of clear procedure because youre using processes which have teeth and if you flub on this one why its little more important flub than it is well recall time you communicated with someone thats fine recall time you communicated with someone recall time when er you talked to somebody ah er oh i forgot to acknowledge you the last time didnt i ahem well recall time recall time lets see whats the command recall time when you said something youll still get away with it youll still get away with it running that process how could you help another how could what was that command ssssssst hand rising up pcs temperature laugh now the first process of course involves the session itself which is cch0 you must remember that there are some subprocesses that are sometimes necessary in clearing someone cch1 cch2 cch3 cch4 what are those processes cch0 of course simply opens the session its the various things that you ask you say what goal do we have for this session is it alright if i audit you these various preliminaries such as start of session you know lot of people forget that they forget to start session thats been going on for three or four hours and they all of sudden say say you know i never started this session lets start the session now laugh of course youve never done this chuckle some people talk and talk and talk and talk and never do start session but cch0 is merely the techniques involved in starting session thats the only thing that is involved in cch0 except one and that is present time problem now we get right down to auditing person to clear and this one we have to confront and take up all procedure being good all agreements being established and everything we take up this one present time problem we take it up at the beginning of every session matter how many sessions there are in clearing ill tell you why because the one thing that can keep profile from changing or iq from rising is present time problem present time problem by definition is some disturbance viewed by the preclear which is occurring in present time or the physical universe right now now you say his present time problem is the fact that he has birth engram in restimulation oh that is not present time problem because hes not being born right now you get the idea you say well the present time problem is hes been divorced several times and so forth and this is his present time problem this is what worries him well dont get the idea that what worries the preclear is present time problem present time problem is particular item its something thats going on in the physical universe right now it has terminals it has location its disturbances are actual and the preclear can be so involved with it that he never gets into the auditing room and therefore he never gets any benefit from the auditing and youre wasting your time as an auditor because his profile demonstrably will stick right where it was until that present time problem is out of the room person has actually been audited for five consecutive intensives without the auditor clearing present time problem with slightest gain in processing that is the chief reason why there is gain on profiles because the preclear had present time problem and it was constant going on all the time auditing was happening and the auditor never straightened it out well the preclear is out there at the oil factory or some place or another hes not there in the auditing room now theres theres an interesting fact that you could absolutely stall clearing an individual by not handling present time problem you might be able to break the code here and there you might be able to flub process you might be able to run tr upside down and backwards and never acknowledge or something of the sort you still might clear somebody but im guaranteeing you will not clear somebody if you leave present time problem in restimulation thats how serious that one is its right there and its definitely part of clearing procedure now when you start to clear present time problem on preclear very interesting you say what are you worrying about what are you worrying about or is there anything worrying you or any other statement you care to make or question you care to ask on this sort of thing quite ordinarily will not be answered on serious present time problem in the affirmative the first answer that was very interesting so you say to the individual present time problem now do you have present time problem is there anything worrying you you say well thats fine we can get on with the session cant we chuckle if hes really up to here touching throat in enturbulance in the physical universe hell say nothing worrying im all detached from it all im above such things of course i can go on being audited i can put it out of my mind you say well what can you put out of your mind well my house burned down this morning and my children are still there standing on the street but thats alright if i get audited i can take care of it little bit better so lets get on with it aw sometimes you have to beg for fifteen minutes to find one of these problems and find out what its all about thats the truth you have to sit right down and beg as an auditor to get this person to be honest enough to tell you that hes in trouble funny part of it is the present time problem very often will not seem very important he got traffic ticket this morning hes got to go down to court after the session it isnt anything so we could let it go couldnt we you start auditing it and you find out its got bite to it and it will clear but supposing you neglected it then all during the session you keep asking the preclear what hes looking at now and what hes thinking about and so forth and he says oh nothing of course he says i see jail and policemen laugh quite fascinating quite fascinating an individual who gets then involved with plus randomity or minus randomity lets get real technical here whats plus or minus randomity well to people that werent in the first acc that werent at philadelphia you know they have trouble with this but its very simple minus randomity is bored stiff with nothing to do and plus randomity is going around in small circles that nobody could possibly do the banks of chuckle in other words theres too much going on or too little going on and the preclear considers it an abnormal state of motion either too little or too much and either one of these things is present time problem there is something going to happen well of course theres something going to happen if hes going to have dinner that night but he doesnt happen to consider that problem so its what the preclear considers it problem after youve beaten his silly head in to get him to admit he got one and its better to be very careful and very insistent much better to be very careful and very insistent than it is to just brush it off because the direction you can err is neglected you cant err in the direction of beating it to death unless as some auditor did the other day and id be ashamed to say who it was i told him there was probably present time problem on the case that wasnt flat so he ran it for five hours four and half hours after the preclear said it was totally flat and wondered then why the preclear remained out of session for the next two days in other words the auditing session became present time problem thats disobedience of the auditors code the process was longer producing change and the auditor continued to audit it ad nauseam this is pt problem run the wrong way pt problem run right is run very simply there are various ways to run present time problem how long do you run it until the preclear oh this sounds very funny sounds very funny to some practical get up and do individual until the preclear longer has to do something about it thats how long you run pt problem i remember i was talking to you about spheres of influence in an earlier lecture the great oddity is if you flatten present time problem it quite often ceases to be problem in the physical universe not only does it cease to be problem where the preclear is but it ceases to be problem over here it is so much the case that we have one on record where the wife was dipsomaniac thats where they keep dipping into the old mans pocket book to run down to the liquor store and the preclear was audited on present time problem why well definitely it definitely was present time problem because the wife at the time the preclear was being audited had just got through busting up most of the furniture and so bit of pt problem the pc was rather disturbed and the auditor sat down and beat this thing through on what part of that problem could you be responsible for that is by the way the optimum technique to run present time problem if it can be run on the preclear sometimes its little high for him what part of that problem could you be responsible for is the exact auditing command and the only auditing command for clearing present time problem thats the optimum sometimes you have to get into invent problem worse than that problem or invent problem of comparable magnitude to that problem but these these are these are things sometimes you have to run merely locational processes notice that wall notice the floor notice the ceiling to get the pc into the auditing room they cant even audit this pt problem its so strong its so fabulous but the optimum one and this will work on practically any case your working on if the persons conscious enough to talk to you it usually works and thats what part of that problem could you be responsible for well in this particular case the preclear was asked what part of that problem his wife could he be responsible for and he was run until he longer though he had to do anything about to or with his wife quite little while it took about three hours to get this one shaken out couple of days later the auditor asked him well hows your wife getting along how are you getting along with your wife wife were getting along alright yes well just how it going you know pots and pans had been flying out of the window and furniture had been breaking up and bottles crashing on cops heads the last time we heard about this you see oh shes doing alright shes straightened up now this was reported to so i became interested enough to check into it at regular intervals for the next three four weeks she stopped drinking she wasnt audited he was audited but she was in his sphere of influence and she stopped drinking you very often find this sort of thing taking place so much so that we still have little test running running problems of comparable magnitude to hydrogen bombs we havent completed this process chuckle but were running this one on some people and some day why somebody will ask the defense department where do you have the hydrogen bombs stored and theyll say hydrogen bombs hydrogen bombs what hydrogen bombs see theres some dim possibility that if you audited this on couple of ots why atomic warfare would disappear now i dont want to give you any ideas and i dont want you running on anybody laughing now heres heres our heres our weve weve entered the field of magic and mystery right there as to how this sphere of influence can adjust around but the reason you audit it is so that it wont keep banging at the pc now you dont solve it you simply get the pc disentangled from it and evidently when he is longer party to it it loses the power to bite him in other words every time you have died i hate to go into that i mean the undertakers already have but every time something very bad has happened to you you had to consent to it first you had to consent to get getting finger cut off before it could be amputated sounds very funny but perfectly true it requires anyones participation and consent before anything can happen to anyone anywhere thats why when we say clearing is freedom from you certainly do get freedom from if you run out your consent to be shocked maimed diseased and so forth if youre longer consenting to these things they dont happen isnt this interesting an interesting broad look at life that we get out of something weve had for years and years and years weve had this thing pt problem i dont think ive mentioned it very widely or very strongly i dont think its come up very often chuckle but pt problem is something that has more to it than simply getting session started youve stopped some portion of the physical universe from banging at this pc and it isnt so much that the pc would sit there and continue to worry about it as the fact that this enturbulance still evidently has the strength and power of entering the auditing room see from elsewhere if you get that as well as the fact that the pc would continue to be worried about it and be out of session you have more or less the truth of the condition that you would be trying to audit against if youre trying to clear somebody who had present time problem so this one you must handle and as i say the auditing command for it is what part of that problem could you be responsible for the first part of the process of course involves isolating the problem finding out what the problem is what is this problem now that that takes some doing i had fellow who was very nervous and very upset i looked at him i found his auditor i said hey what goes on here this person this person seems to be quite upset he isnt often that way well the auditor said i checked for present time problem i had him on meter and i checked for present time problem i didnt get any registry at all so i grabbed hold of the preclear and i put him on meter of course he didnt get any registry the meter was totally stuck just like it was frozen you could reach over and kick the pc which i did chuckle you got wobble on the meter well i guarantee that if you can get wobble on the meter the meter isnt going to tell you anything because it is stuck on what it is stuck on and you guess from there on out the only real liability meter has is you know something is wrong if the needle is stuck but the needle doesnt cooperate with you anymore to tell you what it is it just sticks harder but you cant see something that is motionless get more motionless chuckle now the pc didnt have much of pt problem he was merely going to be operated on the following morning and didnt want to tell anybody in the organization it left with the problem of sitting there and having to take thirtyfive minutes of my valuable time and get rid of the necessity of an operation laughing this thank you the the situation with regard to session then does require that one now theres another thing that creeps all the way through session its sneaker ive had rather experienced auditor argue with on this one the only thing that will make preclear drop profile its funny thing i say the only thing its the only thing i know of though that will make profile drop during an intensive while youre trying to clear somebody is an arc break theres been break of communication the preclear longer believes the auditor is on his side theres been breakdown of their affinity their reality their communication and when that breakdown exists whether its real or imaginary the preclear believes its real and auditing continues long beyond that point you get depression of the profile in other words present time problem makes it stay the same but the arc break with the auditor makes it sag i had an auditor recently say couldnt have been one couldnt have been one couldnt have been one i checked it over carefully thoroughly i said check it again the auditor checked it again and something on the order of four years ago out of session this auditor who was auditing the same pc that many years ago had said something the pc considered at that time an arc break and auditing subsequent to that time was depressing the profile thats how silly pcs are chuckle but it was there this auditor being careful auditor and good auditor of course checked it and checked it until it finally revealed itself and we had an advancing im sure an advancing profile after that the point is here that you could do something or the pc could feel that you did something or said something which was hostile and it breaks up the arc of the session in the original thesis the first book written on this particular subject the first published book on this subject 1947 it gives three equations so called the pc less than the reactive mind thats number one cannot solve or handle the reactive mind the pc is less than the reactive mind number two auditor is less than the pcs reactive mind and therefore just cant solve it auditor plus pc is greater than the reactive mind and so they can unravel it get the idea so as soon as you drop the auditor out in present time problem we drop the pc out as participant you see and with an arc break we drop out the auditor as participant as far as the preclears concerned and the reactive bank and so forth does not get handled thats elementary so these two things must be maintained the preclears cooperation must continue and the auditors arc with the preclear must continue and when these things dont continue then we get the whole thing going to pot the funny part of it is it is more important really if anything to have the auditor continue in arc with the pc than it is to have the preclear handling his own reactive bank because evidently the auditor can do it better than the preclear because when you drop the auditor out of the session and yet auditing continues you get reduction of profile reduction of the factors of capability of the case but if you just drop the pc out with present time problem you just get the profile staying the same now thats fascinating i consider it considerable commentary upon the necessities of arc in session now another thing that you must do in auditing of course is flatten these processes you have to flatten them for this reason the universe and the people out there will sooner or later start flattening them or restimulate the unflattened process see how that could be and we get an unstable gain the pc was way up and then he went out and walked around in the society about four or five blocks and he went way down what would cause that the gain was unstable and it comes about because processes have been started on the case which have not been finished and the environment runs them only the environment isnt good auditor and so we get reduction of case in other words an unstable gain gain not holding up is apparently caused by just this one thing of unflattened processes on the case only scientology can undo scientology quite interesting person has to be audited down scale to be pushed down scale but when process is half way finished was dropped when in full restimulation in an auditing session and then the preclear walked out into the environment and tried to do his job tried to work when he went through all of these things something clicked that process and it will run it the wrong way too and he gets bad auditing on the same process you see and the auditing is unintentional and it can reduce the profile it doesnt however go below where it was in the first place now with these conditions existing auditing can exist on clear procedure without these things well theres reason to get superoptimistic because just auditing wont happen what does it take to make auditing happen it obviously takes good auditor and preclear who still thinks the auditor is on his side well how do you repair an arc break i ran an interesting session once this was the test session which established what havingness was in its manifestation for half an hour i ran process which was guaranteed to cut to pieces the mass and havingness of pc it was chosen with maliceaforethought as something that choked to pieces the preclears concept of mass his concept of possession his concept of being anything anywhere anyhow and in view of the fact of being among friends i can tell you what process this is look around here and find something you could go out of communication with thats guaranteed killer now listen please promise youll only run this on psychiatrists chuckle now this was guaranteed to just cut everything to ribbons but i ran it for half an hour on this basis every time the pc would twitch or squirm or start to go little bit anaten i would say what have i done wrong the pc would say what have you done wrong you sure i didnt do something wrong as matter of fact couple of minutes ago there you when you made that noise it upset there had been noise but each time the pc could find something wrong and the session would come back to battery the pc would wake up the nervousness would drop out the twitchy feet would go you see how this is in other words i was patching up havingness with just one auditing command what have i done wrong and the pc was then permitted little by little to continue arc with the auditor even though the auditor although the pc didnt realize it was cutting the pc to ribbons the auditor really was doing something wrong the auditor was running process guaranteed to kill anybody and so it becomes important then to keep the pc in session and one of the best ways of doing it is to ask the pc when he appears to be upset has something gone wrong with session or have i done something wrong well now theres something you dont do you say what have i done wrong and then the pc says well moment ago there when you said that command and made the mistake and didnt give an acknowledgement there and dropped the book when you did that it why it upset little bit it distracted ill tell you what the auditor can do wrong at this point what he can do wrong he can fail to take responsibility for his action he can say well actually the book was just teetering there and you put it there when you came in the auditing room chuckle and youve got sort of an emanation coming off you that makes it very difficult for to remember the auditing command and its totally natural that i would make that many mistakes in other words the auditor starts to shift responsibility from himself to the preclear removes himself from the session the second he does that why you got it now he can run what part of that problem could you be responsible for the one shot command that doesnt work by the way is what part of that bank could you be responsible for isnt that nice command apparently worked like mad what part of that bank could you be responsible for what part of the physical universe creation or destruction of could you be responsible for he just went unconscious for some reason or another laugh obviously it was the perfect command very often we have perfect commands originated and then without checking them of course we can always be right when we check them were sometimes wrong chuckle but the auditor has to retain responsibility for the auditing session while the preclear recovers responsibility for his past present and future and thats really what happens in this combination now given all these things the auditor gets to the most important process ever developed in scientology easily the most important process and some of the sharpest auditors around have not heard all there is to know about this process by one awful long ways and sitting right there will be very surprised with this process help the most important process ever developed why because running this process help will put into session and make auditable people who formerly werent even vaguely auditable now thats just one test of it it splits valances it heals psychosomatic illnesses it moves ridges out of heads it exteriorizes preclears it does almost anything as single panacea process that you have ever asked of any process nobodys ever tried it that far they think its just something you audit in clear procedure to get it out of the road so that you can get on to something important like step six somebody said to very very recently i didnt have any idea help had that much breadth it makes the most lovely assist you ever tried to assist anybody with lovely assist person comes in in normal state homo sap you know got terrible hangover hives you want to get him back to battery something like that run help the test of help is that it shouldnt really be run on condition it should be run on terminals but if you can get away with running it on condition which is quite interesting gives you the command value of the process it handles something like tnt if you dont handle it right your pc has had it hes had it now what are you trying to do for pc youre trying to help him and the pc that never got gain in auditing is simply wasting this commodity thats the only thing hes doing he came to you for help didnt he he said oh im so bad off you know i have these horrible pains and these awful aches and i cant see and i cant smell and i cant talk and i want you to heal all up and so forth and ill pay you lot of money if you will do this and get all this nonsense going on you sit down and you audit him he sneers and does the very things he shouldnt do and he fakes the process and so on what is he doing hes just wasting help he cannot be helped and herr doctor sigmund freud at the end of his 28th lecture i think it was said and these by us cannot be helped and these by us cannot be helped this is the one thing that made him sad there were several types of case that couldnt be helped by him he included the sane the insane the laugh but he said these by us cannot be helped now that becomes fascinating when you look this over carefully because it tells us definitely that the case that could not be helped is the case of course that cant be helped so you run help on him chuckle its one of these horrible simplicities that is just painful in its stupid simplicity now the auditor who goes along and he audits somebody you know out of book and he says now what part of this problem could you be responsible for thank you what part of this problem could you be responsible for thank you what part of this problem could you be responsible for thank you and the pc says what did you say oh you heard the command laugh so we have an auditor who cannot help pc really whats wrong with his auditing he cant help preclears now in view of the fact that you run into an awful lot of preclears who are anxious for just one thing to convince you that you cant help them you are liable to get the idea after while that you cant help them and this is what gets wrong with your auditing the only thing that gets wrong with your auditing is you cant help people now what about this help is it therapeutic to help people or is it aberrative is it right to help people or wrong to help people or shouldnt you go along in your own little cocoon sailing on the sea of idle dreams and let the rest of all that silly nonsense going on in the world just take care of itself is that right should you help it or leave it alone or what should you do about it well these are moral and ethical questions that have to do with you whether its right or wrong for you to help somebody or not help somebody should however have bearing on the fact that you have an aberration on the subject of help you see there could be two different things whether you should or shouldnt help does not at all influence this other factor could or couldnt i cant help him the person who has bad habit is always telling you i cant help it laugh help you know is forbidden its illegal to help several things did you know that there are twentyfive illnesses that it is illegal to help in the state of california they are listed by the legislature of course nobodys ever asked this burning question this frying question i should say is the state legislature of california capable of helping anyone thats the aberrative side of the question dont you see capability of help is entirely independent of the duty or obligation to help these two things should be entirely different things and an individual cannot make up his mind on the rightfulness or wrongfulness of help so long as he himself is not totally clear on the subject of help now then fellows who run around and are criticized by their fellow man because they got to help everybody they got to help this or they got to help that theyre always helping stray dogs or theyre always helping stray cats i think some lady who can only help stray cats is still luckier than any policeman i ever met who could never help anything til the end of his days we are looking at the heart and soul of the upper dynamics when we are looking at help because this is the woof and warp of association man is alive so long as he can help things and so long as he himself can be helped if he can do this hes alive and hes dead when he can longer help anything and nothing can help him that is new definition of death because really that is death when carried through to total absolute definition of death that would be the most absolute death there could be that wouldnt be death of body you understand just some light thing like that that would really be dead the funny part of it is everybody responds somehow and increases on help if it is run in this right fashion first you have to know about bracket whats bracket bracket is the number of ways or number of combinations that something can occur for instance can give b stick b can give stick can hold stick for himself b can hold stick for himself b can hold stick for somebody else other than this person over here c can hold stick for himself or for b you get the number of combinations you just had an idea of stick being passed around and handed to one or another you get the auditing command that this is run in bracket i think somebody added up brackets one time and the highest series of bracket numbers i know about i think is 139 i think its something like that ways of running bracket what do we call bracket that means to cover all possible flows artillery term bracket throws the preclear out of the water now help is run in that fashion and the auditing command is again very simple command and it is other command it isnt invent way to help somebody thats not right its an asising type of command its command that really erases thoughts and old postulates and things like this you dont care whether youre draining somebodys bank or otherwise because every time you increase potential to help you increase havingness so you dont care whether you drain the bank or not the optimum way to run this theres just one way to run it funny thing when you say theres just one way to run it im talking now about clear procedure i know what i know about clearing people i know you can people to be three feet in back of their heads and they stay clear for two days i know you can run engrams until they can get used to running engrams and handle their engrams and to have to that degree clear and i know definitely this procedure is producing results when it is used with the provisos which im giving you and the help command is how could ____ help ____ now the blanks are filled in by the sides of the bracket in other words how could you help mother how could mother help you how could mother help herself how could you help yourself how could another person help mother how could mother help another person theres another one out there how could another person help another person than mother we could keep on going out this way dont you see and we get these various commands we get these enormous brackets theres fiveway bracket nineway bracket it goes on up as i said theres 139 combinations garbled i think there are more than that that was persons name in england got that together for 139 which was page after page page after page and he says how many sides does bracket have shall i run all these on my preclear laugh five five will produce adequate results nine is quite safe you could get the listings of exactly what bracket is from an hco bulletin now how could ____ help ____ you understand you didnt ask him to dream up new way you didnt ask him not to dream up new way you just asked him more or less to tell you way now if youre allergic to people talking while youre auditing and it gets you upset too much there is an alternate command which is still workable providing you can police it and youve got him there on emeter good and solid and youre watching the emeter you could say think of way to help mother think of way mother could help you you could actually run think of way but theres not any particular reason to because i dont think the preclears conversation is going to aberrate you more than he ordinarily would be if you were worried about it chuckle if you were worried about it it probably wont aberrate you any more than the garbled how could mother help you this sort of thing thats now how many ways and different combinations and so forth how many things could we run this on well you could say how could you help bacteria how could bacteria help you how could atomic particles help you how could you help atomic particles how could atomic particles help another person how could another person help atomic particles you get the idea how could atomic particles help themselves you can actually run that and get away with it of course probably burn up the preclear but you could get away with it you get the idea help you have to settle this idea of help now what happens what gets wrong with help well there are probably many other things get wrong with it but the main one is you tried to help somebody and failed and after that you could think of only one thing to do and that was kill him probably all savage impulses derive from failure to have assisted anybody you want to kill you couldnt help in other words something gets wrong with the balance of help there is hate so pure not the hate of woman scorned but the hate of woman who wouldnt let you be helped or wouldnt help you or you wouldnt permit to be helped in other words theres going to be something wrong with help for her to hate you now maybe it was so wrong with the person in the first place it was already wrong before they met but certainly something happened to key it in you wonder why youre having domestic troubles wife comes in says dear wouldnt you like to get your slippers and you say boy is she rubbing it in get my slippers hah i suppose this is fast touch for five spot something like that you say well wife shouldnt do that sort of thing shes been busy all day i feel self conscious the idea of her in other words you got an aberration on the subject of help so you say dear thank you well couldnt i get you drink she says not thirsty dont bother yourself youre tired and youve been working all day and so forth just go sit down some place youre tired and be quiet well what would you like for dinner oh anything anything few minutes later why you sit down at the table and she throws this plate of food on the table and says well i dont know where youre going but im going over to see mother for little while and you say whats wrong and then she and you are liable to figure out something else thats wrong see some other squabble it has nothing to do with this other sequence this other sequence was totally hidden this causation and you can remember that that morning something or other happened and you refused to let her do something of the sort or you accused her of something you know it will all build up on some tremendous aedipus here that had nothing to do with the actual activity which began with pair of slippers you watch it you watch it if you want to take your life in your hands just as an experiment for any given twentyfour hours make out your will give us your next of kin refuse every help offered you by everyone for the next twentyfour hours now that thats pretty wow theres some stories about people doing other things for twenty four hours but this one would be suicidal everybody would be mad at you if they didnt practically destroy you you just refuse all help offered you actually its one of the more its one of the more interesting things to do laugh and if you feel tired of life why i advise it strongly i have unfortunately on two different occasions not meaning to at all having understanding of what was going on and not at that time having this process this process by the way was evolved for the hca manual which was never published and probably never will be i wrote the opening gun of it and i had to find the basic fundamental of auditing and the basic fundamental of auditing was of course help i wrote it down very glibly and wrote nice little essay and got it all set up and i got down to the end of the essay and i said just moment lets look this over again oh i said its not important and let it drift for three whole months before i really clamped on to it and made thorough going test and then psychosomatics started flying off and valences started breaking up and all sorts of miraculous things started happening with the use of this thing help i only had to work for about week to find the command it should be run with it was quite remarkable though it developed out of auditing itself now the individual the individual is evidently part and parcel of existence only so long as he can stay in an exchange of assistance with it as long as he can be of use as long as he can have game or goal or something common denominator of all these things is help now help goes over into something very interesting you really dont have dichotomy it isnt that you have help is plus and destroy is minus this is not true help goes into destroy you get help destroy interaction and wherever you have destruction you had failure of help thats just as invariable garbled now this dichotomy works to this degree fascist regime comes in of some kind or another and they know how to make the populace help them give up produce and so forth they threaten to destroy them for instance theres one country i dont know its not very far from here it used to be great state garbled cave in they have income tax i think there and this this country this country threatens to destroy you if you dont give it some taxes see your taxes will help that government but their threat is to destroy you thats the only way they think they can collect they cannot help you theyre getting more and more laws forbidding them to help you you used to be able you could go in and lean across on the counter and say fix up my return then they scribble on for while and say oh thats alright joe and so forth and take small amount of money and that would be all there is to it now theyre running help destroy well helpdestroy goes just down to point where it becomes destroydestroy and helpdestroy will become destroydestroy so that you get helphelp help begets help and then returns help this is fairly sane and rather optimum then we get helpdestroy and then helpdestroy the other way and then destroydestroy and clear down here we get suborder of insanity the like of which well you people in this world of course have never experienced its called war doesnt ever do anybody any good any place and for years afterwards now days the victor is faced with the problem of helping the vanquished enough to wipe out the war and all you win is the right to help but thats all anybody ever wins now isnt it silly for somebody to fight for the right to help when all hes got to do is to help somebody and all hed have to do to help somebody without liability is to make up his mind that he was not necessarily destructible if he assumes that he himself is relatively indestructible then he is capable of helping everybody matter what they do but there are people around that all you have to do is offer them some help and they cut your head off i went into an institution and it happened two cases ive seen spin on this offered help proposition one girl walked up to immediately after the first phoenix congress and she said ive been told i should help you and i said well theres nothing for you to do right now and i just walked off and left she went out on the street and spun in was picked up by the police put into local spin bin garbled i wrote that down in the notebook as inexplicable and only what was inexplicable i thought for long time was there must have been some other event took place between my conversation with her and that spin there wasnt there is evidently other thing necessary ive known two such cases where it happened they offered help it was refused and they spun right in theyre on such delicate balance of being part of the human race that they spin right out of it when they get the least inkling of the fact that they cant be of assistance isnt that an interesting commentary this is how much this means to person this is how much of button this is but to you walk up to raving psycho and you say i want to help you well be sure there are axes or ice picks or anything around because hell finish you just offering help to him is enough for him to decide that destruction is necessary now you notice there wasnt single word i said there applicable to national government laugh now as we look over helpdestroy we begin to understand so much that for while as we look over the universe and find instances of this we tend to be overwhelmed but its good thing to do because almost anything equates into this helpdestroy curve almost anything it can be added up some part of it fundamental can be added up on help person gets up in fairly good state they can tolerate an enormous amount of help did you ever see little kid little suzette right now is going through period of not wanting to be helped she wants to be selfsufficient thats good thing good mechanism nothing wrong with it but i have eventually let her help things enough that i can now help her i dont think anybody else in the family can help her but i can help her why because i let her help i dont have to dream it up either shes gotten awfully good at it she gets bright and polite and dignified as long as i let her help something and of course there isnt any coordination between americas refusal to let children work and juvenile delinquency not much if you forbid them to help for years you wonder why then they destroy everything its inevitable the way to get teeners and so forth into an awful state and get them to destroy everything is to deny them the right to help so the biggest right there is is not the right to vote is not the right to freedom of speech or press or religion or anything else the biggest right there is in human rights is the right to help and now i just want to ask you one more question looking at this the index of willingness to help being the highest index in demonstration of clearing do you any longer doubt my statement that those people in dianetics and scientology are the upper tens of thousands of the population of earth because they volunteered to help didnt they thank you end of lecture transcript of lrh video taped lecture number 6 of 6 the clearing congress lectures shoreham hotel washington dc july 5 1958 clear procedure creativeness thank you we have lecture now on the remainder of clear procedure were going to wrap it all up and these boring technical details to get over with and we can have something interesting there are only two processes which clear people dont forget if they dont work they arent being run right we have to look that over as fact because each time i found them not running they were not being run right that is to say the various items which i have been taking up with you such as bad auditing arc breaks present time problems in restimulation not starting session you know and skipping all of this and that falling off of the chair and telling the preclear h did it it takes something to make these things unworkable or some off beat command is being used or the command isnt being cleared and is never understood by the preclear in the first place see those things could all happen processes which clear people are help and what we call step six the reason we call it step six is that there was book clear procedure and thats step six of that book the whole first step of that first clear procedure issue one was devoted to participation of the preclear in the session and this oddly enough adds up to nothing more serious than help how do you secure his participation help of course well step six run subjectively that is with mock ups mental image pictures mock ups on the basis of keeping them from going away holding them still and making them more solid and if you will notice this is devoted to making creation possible ill go into that in moment very few auditors understand that even yet and this is devoted to creating this makes creation by the pc possible and this is creation betterment and you could run help step six help step six help step six help step six and youd eventually get somewhere but thats the way you more or less do it run help on some things and get it more or less flat and then run some step six and get that in pretty good shape and run some more help and then run some more step six run some more help and somewhere up along the line you say i just found out something he probably doesnt know this you better write ron and tell him because you know all those engrams and facsimiles in fact im mocking all them up all involved laughing you say kidding if you wanna be wanna be dont leave him with that one you know telling the preclear what to think do believe and cognite on is not part of the game of auditing matter how tempting it is the time worn example of the fellow who sat there with bad leg i managed to audit him long enough so that he cognited on the fact that he had bad leg but it was obvious to that he had bad leg but it wasnt obvious to him if you start evaluating for the preclear and tell him what to cognite on why if you find you must do this you have two recourses one get audited and if you cant or wont do that take up hypnotism if you have success with that you might as well go all the way south and take up psychoanalysis now help and step six then are the processes which clear people and any other process is simply subsidiary auxiliary and makes auditing possible all other processes make auditing possible these processes clear people got that so sometimes you have to run some other processes to make auditing possible but dont think youre clearing anybody because youre not youre merely making clearing possible when you get around to it because you can run the other processes we have some hundreds of thousands of hours without clearing anybody all youre doing is setting preclear up to become able to run these two processes now how would you what do i mean by setting them up we have an old process that had been demonstrated right here at congress called scs stop change start change and stop now scs in its milder version or its more serious version stop cs which is just emphasis on stop of course are the elements of control and these elements of control are very definitely part and parcel to an auditing session if you think the preclear is going to be uncontrollable on body process like 8c which is good control process the only trouble with 8c when you start to run 8c which is guiding him around the room which is part of upper indoc training thing you start guiding him around the room feeling the walls and that sort of thing if he turns on somatics or gets restimulation because of it you are saddled with flattening it you have to flatten it it might take you the next seventy five hours its alright its good process but it doesnt clear anybody if you start it you have to flatten it because the preclear will make further advance because life itself goes on running the process every time he sees wall he gets somatic get the idea youve just thrown him up into being set up to be run by life thats why we dont talk too much about 8c these days although its very valuable process scs is less susceptible to these somatics and does the thing we want to have happen it puts the preclear under the auditors control and if you think that hes going to be little bit difficult to control physically think how difficult he will be to control when you cant see what hes doing you say well he couldnt run any he didnt handle stop cs couldnt handle that at all it annoyed him so i went immediately into step six and i say well mock up small object in front of you and of course he did and so forth and we ran it for 872 hours it didnt seem to do anything for him now why he was doing something that we could not directly observe if he couldnt be controlled in the body believe he cant be controlled in the mind and the auditor has to control his mental actions and thats why you run scs it just tells the person to start the body and change the position of the body and stop the body on command after hes done that these are the three elements of control he of course has the idea that he can be controlled he can be controlled and hes better off for it because he can control himself now too people who cant be controlled cant themselves control i dont know that the first lesson person must learn in order to command is to learn to obey i dont know if thats true but i certainly know that its directly true if person would control he has to be capable of being controlled himself you dont get stuck flow on this to have it work out so if person is going to do something in hidden way youre going to say mock up cat and he says uhuh but did he or didnt he if he cant be controlled i will inform you that maybe he did or maybe he didnt but probably he didnt and you would be running mental image process this step six youd be running this thing without the preclear doing the process you see but then the preclear wouldnt be getting clear on clear procedure because he isnt doing clear procedure the auditor is running clear procedure but the preclear isnt and it would probably clear the auditor but laugh therefore therefore scs becomes an intimate part of clear procedure but its just an auxiliary process it isnt going to do anything for him but this can do pointing to chart listing clear procedure but it makes possible running called scs scs by the way is pretty good process all by itself and the only trouble with running an auxiliary scientology process today is that theyre so good the old ones they worked well they did well and you can say boy am i making gains you know and you can just run that 8c and run that 8c and run that scs and the pc is feeling better hes more capable of taking care of life hes just getting along splendidly and you say well lets continue on this basis its practically matter of why waste your time theyre just auxiliary to this pointing to chart of clear procedure you can be trapped into the goodness of the thing now the other one is connectedness and connectedness is the broad process which covers havingness its you get the idea of making that wall connect with you its not you get the idea of connecting with that wall you get the idea of connecting with the floor you get the idea of connecting with the ceiling you get the idea and the preclear goes dadada moving hand downward gone because we have valuable formula operating here the formula for operating thetan which well talk about later is the person capable of being at cause over life matter energy space and time being at cause and when in doubt always put the preclear at cause over the situation hes being victimized by circuit the long way to do it is just have him cause circuits see hes being victimized by the circuit so hes being the effect of the circuit so the thing to do is to turn him around and make him at cause over the circuit put him at cause put the individual at cause and you will always advance him now we said the individual didnt we we mean the thetan the funny part of the body is and this is total aside it would much rather be at effect how body loves effect oh if someone would only hit over the head with sledge hammer body thinks wouldnt that be nice wouldnt it be kind of them if bodies could think thats sort of the way that they would think about it and the thetan becomes deluded into believing that the ambitions of the body are the ambitions of the self so they go around and try to find varied and fancy effects but the road out is cause not effect in scientology we have cause distance effect as being the most vital simplicity we have what do we means by cause we merely mean emanation point what do we mean by effect we mean receipt point what do we mean by distance we mean the space between when cause and effect are on the same point you have nut you get somebody saying well i dont know why i victimize myself this way isnt that an interesting interesting question for somebody to ask himself actually hes being another cause but hes also being the effect at the same time and he doesnt know whether hes the cause point or the effect point but probably hes both but whats obvious to him is that somebody is doing something to something and theyre both occurring at the same place his sole effort to get to cause point in the thing is to say i wonder why i am victimizing myself and hell make an actual effort to get to cause there are people who obsessively assume responsibility theres nothing wrong with assuming all the responsibility in the world so long as you are assuming the responsibility when you are reactively taking over responsibility and you dont know that youre taking it over you get an entirely different picture you get something very amusing fellow gets hit by railroad train out in california the person commenting or hearing about it is in rhode island and they say i wonder why i let him go out that night you say to the person you wonder why you let him go out did you talk to him that night but i might have well did you think you should have called him that night well have you called the person for years well how could you have prevented him from going out that night well i just could have you press it little bit further well its just my fault i killed him there are people actually walking around guilty of murders they never committed thats obsessive responsibility responsibility going totally out of control longer able to define responsibility at all theyre being reactively responsible for all sorts of things by the way when you run what part of that problem could you be responsible for you are really merely erasing the reactive responsibilities for that part of the problem the person eventually comes up to really taking some responsibility but obsessively they will say well im responsible for the sun the moon the stars the god im sure there are lot of ministers and preachers in the past who themselves personally invented god im sure this is the case because its true anyway nobody got that chuckle garbled comm lag anyway where we have where we have cause pc at we have things running along fine where we have the preclear causing something over here and thinking hes the effect over here pointing in different directions and then not taking any responsibility for the actual causing of the thing we then get him into the vast mystery known as being an aberree and hes in that mysterious state of not knowing where of where for my mother is mocking up this facsimile and is punishing with it this mental image picture of birth is totally responsible for my horrible condition dont you see and somebody else or something else is mocking it up it took us in scientology reason to ask the people who are in this state it took us in dianetics and scientology years to get around to the actual crux of the fact that the individual is mocking up his whole and entire bank there is crux you want to know what the crux is it might be interesting when an individuals ability to mock up to create mental image pictures is improved the bank improves proportionally isnt that cute isnt that interesting so we improve somebodys ability to create mental image pictures and his facsimiles get better you say well maybe we really improved his vision the only thing we worked on was his ability to create ill show you another way this is done by running help on him we improved his ability to create ill tell you why that is in moment we improved his ability to create and we then get him to create for very short time and then get him to look at facsimile its much brighter much brighter the facsimile is much brighter so then we further improve his ability to create and then we run little bit more creativeness and then we get him to look at the same facsimile its broader its bigger and its fatter and its solider so we run some more help and some more step six on him and we get him to look at the same facsimile this is an actual test thats been run many times boy is that the fattest solidest engram you ever saw now here is place in case in processing on clearing where person would rather be dead all the facsimiles that he puts up are much more solid than they ever have been before and much more real with many more perceptions in them only he doesnt yet know hes making them so he becomes the victim of them and they are this tougher so somewhere along the line of clearing the preclear possibly had asthma or something this isnt necessarily true because the smoothness of auditing takes the curse off of this thats why you have to audit smoothly so please listen audit smoothly otherwise this hump cannot be passed the pc will start up toward it and say thats too much for fall off the ledge and skip it see you just ruined him you find another auditor the auditor runs some more help on him patches up auditing and so forth and take him over the hump this could happen you see but the reason it would happen is that the individual is can be victimized thoroughly he gets so good at these engrams locks secondaries these mental image pictures get so much bigger and so much fatter and his psychosomatics can get so much worse that only smooth auditing takes the curse off of it gets him over the hump and then all of sudden he realizes hes beginning to realize that hes mocking these things up himself at that moment he had the smell of ether from the operation you know he could smell the ether you know thats funny do you smell any ether in this room now if you were playing dirty pool doing bad auditing or research work something like that chuckle youd say look up as he smelled the ether you know he says how did i get back in this operating room because if he was stuck in facsimile or an engram of an operation hell get the whole thing back again twice as twice as good as real the usual thing is the pc doesnt flinch or wince or go into bad condition because of this he ordinarily perseveres and goes on through and smooth auditing doesnt really kick these engrams into restimulation heres where heres where you actually get the most wallop out of case you start separating valences and circuits with help and half of the preclears body falls off at the right side and half falls off at the left side and he finds himself in totally strange body he says where did this body come from you know hands hands he realizes he always thought of himself as having had talons or something he says where did i get this body you know its just like coming into present time hes been going around in that body that was so successful back there in 1710 now thats more spectacular but this can become quite interesting you start running it up and they get better and better and better thats why you run help step six help step six help step six back and forth thats one of the best reasons why you vary between the two because youd never hit this hump head on now what is all this about create what does creation have to do with clearing boy thats stupid question what does it have to do with clearing it has everything to do with clearing of course the person is creating an aberrative state creating an aberrative bank hes creating freudian unconsc i knew fellow i ran across fellow one time that was creating freudian subconscious it was complete he read about it in book and after that he created it anyway chuckle complete he was perfect text book case as soon as i ran where he read the textbook and where he was now about eight or nine commands he ceased to be good freudian case so we got on and fixed him up now where creation is unknown unknowing subrosa preclears here and some mysterious force is creating from over here over which of course he has control or responsibility for we get reactive bank we actually get mental image pictures of one kind or another at which the preclear is not looking but which which are really terrorizing him doing all sorts of things to him these things can contain anything and do now we have to get him to take over the responsibility for creation so this is little bit broader statement than saying get him to create see we have to get him to take over the responsibility of his action of creations well we do that by separating out all of the items all the major items that he has used to assist himself to create you got that thats why you run help and its the only reason you run help not to make him better boy hell become better boy hes okay but as long as hes in this aberrative cross mock up riff raff state hes mess you dont even have to make preclear better to clear him when hes clear he will be much better because fortunately thetan is basically good that stands in our favor he might as well be basically evil but he doesnt happen to be from our standards hes basically good the better he gets the more able he is to operate on an optimum solution which is the best that can be done for each one of the dynamics in other words an optimum solutions definition is simply this the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics and thetan in good shape starts operating on that basis so right up to the point of his getting clear he could be stinker and hed suddenly be saint you get the idea but he doesnt have to be saint after hed lived for little while hed find out that was bore and hed settle back to being scientologist laugh therefore we have to examine if responsibility for creativeness is so important then we have to examine the things that are impeding his creativeness and we find out that the things which first helped him and then sought to destroy him are aberrative only so long as they impeded or assisted and impeded his creativeness the who the who for instance who has mother who was painter and he goes along for years and he cant paint lick he cant do thing with paint brush its just wonder to him its an utter marvel to him the fact that he cant paint anything one fine day his mother dies and he can paint suddenly oh well he says competitions removed and so forth it isnt quite that simple mothers valence was the one that could paint and mothers valence came in snap only he wasnt himself any more mother also had bunions so now he has bunions get the idea hes not being himself hes gotten new beingness through the mechanism of life continuum or something of the sort but his mother helped him paint when he was little boy see also knocked his head off every time he spilled paint pot so she was also creative and destructive but the creativeness tended to overwhelm him just little bit and you run help on mother and you would get rid of this particular combination why would you run help on mother to make him feel better because mother was bad woman because you want to make him sane none of those reasons at all youre running help on mother to increase his ability to create himself and so you run help on mother and that gets mother off the case as valence and youll find out he can do little bit better step 6 but im going to let you in on terrible secret for years now weve had to be careful we havent wanted to offend anybody with past lives i know its very hard for people to face the fact that theyve lived before i know its very bad as matter of fact its blasphemous because you know that when youre dead you go to heaven or you go to hell and thats the end of you isnt it that gets rid of you complete well unfortunately research has been able to discover the whereabouts of these two places although i was in place one time identified with the latter chuckle lecture continues in part 1212 now what does person do well clearing people is path of truth not falsity its path of truth if you dont have any reality on past lives then get somebody to run you on how you could help dead body you will wonder how on earth you got so much stuff on dead bodies youve only lost couple of relatives where did all these dead bodies come from you could run that for quite while you could run it up to point of where you had vivid recall by the way this is the way to turn on full track memory anybody who says i dont believe in past lives i wont have anything to do with past lives ive never had any past lives whats the idea of publishing something on the subject of past lives past lives thats terrible brrr uhgg you know were all born from mass of myelin sheathing and laughing and when were dead were dead thats that hey you know an old physics professor i ran into recently died very short time ago and he lived out his own prophesy he said well he said ill die he says before they have an atomic war and then it wont make any difference to get the horrible trap this lie puts out there for somebody he says i want to be garbled of it all i want responsibility for this civilization i want to do nothing for it because when im dead im dead from there on out and i dont have to be victimized at all toward the end of his life why fascism moves in or they elect more republicans chuckle or something and you get the whole society sort of caving in at the edges and things falling apart and somebody passes law and he was right there in the assembly house you see and he had friends and all he had to say joe for heavens sakes an educational law that forces child to go to school at six oclock in the morning and study til tenthirty at night so that he can become scientist joe you know thats never going to make him scientist he could have said that but he didnt so he gets born again kicks the bucket picks up new mock up gets born again finds himself walking up the school steps at six oclock in the morning laugh the horrible poetry of it all well where we where we look over mans idiocies on this particular line we discover that the person who says there can be such thing can run the least easily how could you help dead body how could dead body help you isnt that an interesting coordination its an immediate coordination the person says past lives bla bla ask him now come on right now right here how could dead body help you you put him in the nicest comm lag you ever heard of thats the one thing hes trying to escape is that dead body and he thinks even if he thinks thought about that life hell be dead again and so hes busy mocking up this dead body all the time hes creating dead body all the time so that he can stay away from it which is one way of doing it laugh but hes at the same time inhibiting the mock up and putting cap on the mock up so that at time will the mock up ever spring into his view while he mocks it up so that nearly everything thetan isnt looking at in his own subjective universe actually has these two things going on its being mocked up and its being blanked out and sometimes person is awfully hard put to blank out all the things he mocks up he can get so hard put they have to electric shock him i dont know what it has to do with it at all but they do it now the individuals ability to create heres news has not been impeded in the present lifetime im sorry to have to tell you this because if it didnt make any difference i would skip it but it happens to be the difference between clearing people and not clearing people nobodys forcing you to accept this as concept all you have to do is accept it intellectually and use it in clearing yuk yuk yuk boy thatll hang you with it laugh but the point is simply this that if we if we use only factors which hes met in his present lifetime the only thing well achieve is an assist hell be alright for this environment but thats all hell be alright for now we suddenly shift his environment and what do we get he spins in why honest im afraid theres not i know youve been in terrible straits in this lifetime i know its been rough but do you know there hasnt anything happened in this present lifetime of sufficient magnitude to aberrate you ill tell you why because youre alive youre here so its obvious youre still sane why you had lifetimes when the lights finally went out you were nuttier than fruitcake you know it lifetime that didnt ever make you stark staring mad is hardly any duress at all and we face this fact in clearing and those people who are attempting clearing walking the nice little tight rope of one life and im born into it and i die out of it and thats it arent making the grade theyre just not getting anywhere you cant clear person by running help on his wife agnes you get the idea you have to run help on wife you never have to brief preclears with past lives all of sudden he says whats this old hag doing here laugh you have to run help on wife man woman husband baby dont mess around with this stuff of run help on joe and bill and pete and his wife agnes or her husband joe see just dont fool around with it because youve got the person pegged right here and hell be way up here on top remember basic basic on old dianetics chains huh well youre auditing way up here on top of tremendous chain of events which have experiences by the tens of thousands preceding it and is boy its as sticky as garbled as solid tar and you audit his wife agnes for hours and hours and hours and hours and he feels little bit better about his wife agnes he hopes his wife agnes only drinks and runs around with other men nothing she does thats aberrative how how about the woman he married back in the roman empire the fourth time she tried to murder him and he found out about it he found out that also his worst enemy was in on it as her lover and when he reported it to the senate he found out that the master at arms was also in on the plot and about the time he was totally outraged the emperor had him fed to the lions and just as they swished him out the gate and into the maw of their largest and best black maned lion he wasnt feeling well that day and it took two hours to kill him we got situation where the guard said thatll teach you to get married laugh so the long and short of the situation is that people dont get aberrated in this lifetime thats all there is to it they just dont get aberrated in one lifetime it takes longer than that fortunately it doesnt take longer than that to clear them now thats news for you if it took more than one lifetime to clear somebody wed have had it it doesnt even take lifetime if youre very good auditor it doesnt take month very good and if the preclear is very cooperative and nothing odd happens in that month like getting somebody shocked the reason people go on and on and on and on and on with auditing toward clear is because theyre not auditing the vital points that should be audited now well get on to this other mock up thing why cant this individual do mock ups why cant he do mock ups that is to say when you say cat why cant he put cat up in front of him easily why does he have screen in front of him or an invisibility or this or that whats the matter there whats impeding his ability to mock up he isnt doing it hes doing it on circuit thats what is impeding him he has somebody over here mock up something over here pointing in two different places and hes busy mocking up this person here but theres something else going on thats very important in clearing remember we used to say if you can get the mind to do what the mind is doing the whole problem would come to pieces well i finally found out what the mind is doing it is obsessively mocking up certain set of mock ups and if you can get the mind to mock up what it is mocking up youre preclear will have reality but if you ask somebody to mock up something he isnt mocking up he has reality on it therefore you can take very aberrated preclear and run step six all the way around and so forth and mock up this and mock up that well he isnt mocking those things up so he doesnt mock those things up and he doesnt get very far but we ask him to run 8c and he walks around he can do 8c you know slaps this wall nothing to it and so on totally unreal everything is unreal run concepts totally unreal straightwire totally unreal you got preclear that week after week of auditing simply sits there and says yeah pleasant nothings happening nothings happening nothings happening but its alright anytime you had that case where nothings happening you havent asked him to mock up what hes mocking up only itwould be too catastrophic to do so so you run help on it you find out what hes mocking up obsessively now every mock up that goes out there is being put up by this figure well we try to find this figure in this lifetime who is this personality this valence that does his mock ups for him now who is that person we try to find it in this lifetime and this is why i tell you past lives im afraid if youre going to clear anybody you have to recognize this fact and find some subjective reality on it because so far weve never found current lifetime personality guilty its always somebody back there eight planets ago or something of the sort with bunch of half billion personalities stacked up on top of it and theres real duress and he just goes on obsessively mocking up this mock up and this mock up then does things for him in other words it helps him basically it helps him create things he knows its winning mock up because it killed him thats how he knows its winning mock up its the best test in the world you see how that would be we ask him to mock up or do anything else but mock that thing up and he tells us its all unreal and nothing is happening and he is auditing this mock up in some fashion while were auditing him and if we dont get in there and figure out what kind of mock up hes mocking up were not going to get very far we should run help on it how could you help that now you merely have to have type of thing you dont have to know where it is on the track you dont have to know what it is you dont have to know the name rank and serial number of the last roman soldier that pierced his gullet after raping his wife you dont have to know all these things in specific detail itll fall to pieces on helping soldiers you know how would you help soldier oh he thinks of soldiers known in this lifetime in the last war and so forth he thinks of soldiers here or one soldier there muttering sort of dim rather unreal but it has to do with soldiers somewhere else sometime or another must have read about it in book here he goes with soldier soldier soldiers of one kind or another running help on them and them helping him and all of sudden wow something happens something starts to move out of his body something starts to go this way or that way and all of sudden its different hes suddenly able to mock up something field whole black screen that he wore between himself and his mock ups and his bank and so on disappears that requires judgment and it also requires the use of generality i found person one time that was very very certain that women were the most aberrated thing in the world because he went out every two weeks and found himself new girl would tear around for couple weeks and find another girl tear around for couple weeks and find another girl and when i got down to what he was stuck in and what he was obsessively mocking up so help it was house he couldnt stay home laugh thats certainly far cry from women isnt it i have rule whatever the preclear says it is i use something else if he knew that much about it it wouldnt be aberrative now men and women are method of creating new bodies and his dependency on men and women for the creation of new bodies has rendered him incapable of mocking up body that you or i could see now were talking about ot operating thetan he doesnt any longer mock up body whenever he needs to be recognized because men and women mock up bodies for him according to certain set of rules which are laid down in this district obstetric code and freudian analysis if they dont know how now here you have this thing though this new proposition of creativeness hes dependent on men and women to create well funny part of it is you might run help on men in brackets and run help on women in brackets and not get any place and all of sudden hit gold mine on baby you see but this then cleared up and all of sudden away he went it requires certain amount of judgment you have to look for something on the case now an emeter is of assistance to certain degree on handling cases its greatest assistance however is not necessarily the location theres an emeter emeter in hand the location of thing on the track or something like that can be spotted with an meter and they have many uses but its main use is to know whether or not the preclear is still under control now the manifestation on an meter when you strike one of these valences im talking about obsessive mock up you realize that an obsessive mock up is more mass on the person and therefore more resistance more electrical resistance not emotional but electrical resistance and you get stuck the needle starts to stick and the longer you guess the more the needle sticks you just start piling stuff up on the stuck spot so you better take the first thing you had that it got stuck on and run help on it the needle seemed to be nice and free until you started talking about young boys and hes had it the needle all of sudden started to get stiff you insisted on talking about it little bit further and you mentioned young girls and got about the same then you talked about men and then you talked about women then you talked about cheesecake then you talked about houses and then you talked about something else the needle from there on out is going to get still and more and more still its going to stick but its stuck the first time it stuck and if youre good auditor you noticed the first time it stuck and you cleared help on that you see you have to be very alert the main use of the meter is making sure that the individual gets unstuck when youve stuck him now where an individual is demonstrating disabilities in creativeness he has accepted too much help which has then betrayed him taking somebody into universe to teach him how to write probably restimulates people who have tried to teach him how to write and tell stories and have then dumped him in the river when he became too much competition get the idea so that somebody tries to help him write in this life and he runs into helpbetrayal in some earlier situation which is quite brutal and violent dont you see he wouldnt clear up at all by simply running the situation in this life you know lets clear up his writing by running his university classes because obviously he could write before he went to university and when he came out he couldnt standard situation you see somebody helped him create now its good actually to blame that situation and try to audit it because it isnt going to go any place what youve got to do is get this class of things this class of things truly as you run into these things adventure is with us again you remember when we were running engrams and secondaries we were running bloody adventure we had preclears rolling around on the floor and rolled up in prenatal balls you know and screaming at high c that human voice could possibly emit or tolerate we had situation there where we had lots of adventure tremendous adventure we got another one because help never gets upset this side of stark violence you cant upset peoples help by slapping them on the wrist you can by they offer you something and you start cutting their fingers off one quarter inch at time theyre liable to get little upset but the magnitude of violence required to aberrate thetan on the subject of creativeness escapes the modern imagination i wont bother to give you any examples you start running men man which will take care of all things body woman baby mother house planet sun anything that apparently is the case combination be willing to change your mind if youre wrong dont beat one to death that isnt producing results it says right in the auditors code and all of sudden youll get some kind of an idea of what it takes to aberrate thetan theres plenty of magnitude theres plenty of betrayal theres plenty of injustice large gobby doses of gore for somebody to come along and say that some little girl met some little boy and they noticed things and then ever afterwards the little boy was aberrated and later on became homosexual for anybody to put this out as fact showed him to be very bad investigator or dam liar or both sex you say is one of the primary factors of creative aberration to create an aberration by sex you would think is dead easy the guy is at least creating something with sex even if its only even if its only trouble chuckle here to some degree on creativeness its not nearly as aberrative as whole group of oh sexual incidents of great magnitude would not be as aberrative as great group of people they get together to build building the preclear is part of the group and hes building the building too and theyre all building along garbled going along fine one day the rest of the group turns around to him and says get out of here and they ejected him they wouldnt have anything to do with him anymore and he could never find out what he did im afraid that sort of thing third dynamic aberration would be much stronger fellow who was going along quite happily he was being man and all of sudden grew great alligator scales all the way down his back that would be worse than any sexual aberration hed be ejected from the human race in some fashion or hed become such tremendous curiosity and become so wealthy exhibiting these scales hes be such loser or such successful boy on the subject that the thing would aberrate his normal ideas more importantly some individual has been able to make it for years generations millennia as lets say an officer of police always been able to make it all the way up the line always been able to make it made better societies made people stand in line created things everybody respected him you know boy hes just going along fine one day hes the emperors captain of body guards something of the sort and they he didnt do any treason so they arrest him for treason because they want to get him out of the road or something of the sort and then they garotte him but then they decide not to garotte him at the last moment and put him on public display garbled and he finds out his wife did it all in the first place and thats the end of that life he went on for years generations millennia as terrific success to create society from this viewpoint so its obviously successful mock up now hes taught not just once but maybe the next sixteen times he tries it that when you be come police officer or captain of police or chief of body guard or something like that you get executed thats the first thing that happens now he has two data that cannot compute and we get the basis of every obsessive mock up and computational situation on case the situation cannot be computed one day one day he runs into friend who is cop whos been guilty of killing wife and we find him as an auditor we find him in the valence of the cop who killed his wife and we say good heavens what is all this about what is all this about we say well obviously wife killing hes just being cop run help on cops thats all you have to do all of sudden the case will fall apart hed be able to mock up hed be able to get the show on the road in all directions but if you were unlucky you could go for long time without finding out that it was cop valence he was up against youd be running mothers and mothersinlaw and babies and houses and parambulators and bicycles and mayors and politicians and soldiers and sailors and cows and almost everything then nothings happening its alright im getting along alright i enjoy auditing im enjoying being audited then one day when you get smart and you start to get interested in the preclear and you talk to him little bit and find out the one thing he has never mentioned was that he went to the university and roomed with afterwards fellow who was police officer killed his wife and who was executed hell tell you at first that he didnt even know the guy but this is gone get the idea you suddenly get this type of person you run that type of person on help not that individual but that type of individual and you run help on it in brackets the case falls apart and he can do step six like startled gazelle he can really do step six ive audited him now the point im making is then the actual commands of step six are relatively simple they are the subject of publications all youre doing when youre running step six is getting the individual practice in simple form mock up you have him mock up something in front of his body and keep it from going away mock it up behind his body and keep it from going away below his body above his body the right of the body the left of the body each time keeping it from going away each time asking if he did so and thanking him for it and then you run simple mock ups in front behind left right above below the body on holding them still and then simple mock ups again lot of auditors miss on this they just have him mock up anything you want him to mock up simple mock ups cubes circles little things and you run the same type of thing on make it little more solid and ask him if he did and you get then an individuality improving improving showing up being more and more able to create and at the same time getting more and more confidence in creating so youd say help makes it possible for him to create and step six gives him the confidence and practice of actual creation this is clearing he eventually winds up without reactive bank and hes happy about it because he can mock up one any time he wants to but he doesnt have to now the fact of clearing was for many years barred from our knowledge by the simple fact that we could not ourselves believe the horrible truth that people through irresponsibility mocked up all of their own difficulties theres good to merely challenge them they got to assume all these responsibilities youve got to sneak up on them much more quietly than that and we can do so now with clear procedure therefore clearing is fact clearing can be done and you can do it thank you end of
