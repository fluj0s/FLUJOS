doeeia annual energy outlook 2005 p 87major coal issues in the 109th congress introduction the bush administration considers coal major component of its national energy strategy the administration anticip ates longterm reliance on coal because of its lowcost abundance numerous issu arise when harnessing this cheap abundant fuel source this report examin some of the major legislative issues related to coal in the 109th congress including coal and energy security clean air and environmental concerns funding strategies for technology rd loan guarantees for coal gasification projects and the abandoned mine land program energy security and coal1 energy that is available reliable and affordable is focal point when discussing energy security concerns2 and coal will be part of th at conversation out of the four major fuel sources oil gas uranium and coal coal has the largest domestic reserve base the largest share of us energy production in btus and the smallest percent met by imports the energy information administration eia projects that coal imports will continue to be neg ligible through 2025 while there will be growing reliance on foreign sources for ot her major fuels in addition coal is forecast to be the largest source of domestic fuel production in the foreseeable future coal supplies 22 of us energy dema nd but over 50 of the energy used by the electric power sector both utility nd nonutility consumers the electric power sector consumes 90 of all coal in the ited states the remaining 10 is used in the industrial and commercial sect ors or used in coke plants coal use in the electric power sector has maintained share greater than 50 for the past two decades the eia forecasts electricity consumpti on to grow by 19 per year through 2025 from 3481 billion kilowatt hours kwh to 5220 billion kwh3 the increase in demand is largely to be met by new co alfired or natural gasfired power plants the price of each fuel the capital costs asso ciated with power plant construction and plant efficiencies will determine the co mpetitiveness of each fuel source buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32790crs2 4 annual energy outlook 2005 doeeia p 3because of limited domestic suppl natural gas supply is unlikely to keep pace with demand this will lead to increased impor ts according to eia forecasts perwell reserve additions are expected to conti nue to decline over the eia forecast period 20042025 eia further forecasts that na tural gas will not displace coal as the dominant fuel supply for power generation despite projected increases in liquefied natural gas lng imports additional domes tic supply from the lower 48 states and alaskan natural gas from newly constructed pipeline4 coal vs natural gas power plant development for electricity generation is primarily driven by economics the lowercost more efficient operations are the plants that get built production costs include the costs of fuel operation and mainte nance and capital fuel costs are major consideration for fossil fuelfired plants and the fuel cost differences between coalfired and natura l gasfired plant are significant for instance fuel costs for co alfired plant are about 24 of total costs whereas fuel costs for natural gas facility are close to 69 of total costs this price difference could give coal an advantage however new plant capital costs favor natural gas accounting for only 23 of total electric pr oduction costs capital costs for new coalfired plants are closer to 60 of total costs table 1 below illustrates the dynamics of power plant economics for advanced coal and advanced combined cycle natural gasfired plan ts expected to be built in the years 2015 and 2025 table 1 costs of producing electricity from new plants 2003 millskwh costs2015 2025 advanced

coalfired capacity5 this build up has led to excess capacity which should diminish after 2010 capacity utilization would rise from 72 in 2003 to 83 in 2025 according to eia eia projects that total of 281 gw of new capacity will be needed by 2025 including an estimated 19 gw annually fro m 2011 to 2025 268 gw total natural gas facilities combined cycle combustion turbine or distributed generation technology are forecast to account for 60 of the new capacity total new coal capacity of 87 gw is to come online be tween 20042025 thus coal capacity will be 33 of new capacity after 2011 according to eia new coal capacity becomes more competitive with natural gas late in the for ecast between 2016 and 2025 despite relatively low coal costs the high capital costs will likely limit the number of advanced coal integrated gasification combined cycle igcc facilities to about 16 plants or 6 gw of commercial capacity by 20256 rising natural gas prices will lead to the construction of more coalfired facilities between the years 2010 and 2025 accord ing to eia coal is competitive at natural gas prices of 46 per million bt us prices above that range push up the total cost of gasfired power facilities above coalfired plan ts even so natural gas as percent of the total electricity will increase to 24 in 2025 from 17 in 2003 projects eia while nuclear and petroleum will remain flat renewables rise from 359 billion kwh to 489 billion kwh during the same time period coal maintains 50 share of the electricity market in 2025 says eia new capacity is also needed to replace retired capacity and to meet rising demand an estimated 43 gw of fossil fuel capacity is expected to be retired from 2004 to 2025 3 gw coal 15 gw of older oil or gas combustion turbines or combined cycle and 25 gw of oil and gas steam plants if the eia forecasts prove to be accurate then longterm investment in clean coal could pay off because of the great er coal capacity needs beyond 2016 among the most important factors to watch regarding coal versus natural gasfired plants are the natural gas prices capital costs for igcc plants and stricter environmental regulations aimed at pollutant s derived from burning coal clear skies legislation7 by mandating significant reductions in three pollutants emitted by coalfired electric generating units proposed clear sk ies legislation could have

interstate transport of ozone and thus assist states in achieving the one hour national ambient air quality standard for ozone26 in 2020 obviously the actual mix that would result from any enactment of clear skies would be heavily dependent on future natural gas prices and utility decisions with respect to compliance strategies with respect to compliance strategies th epa analysis projected

to hg controls s 131 w ould weaken the proposed phase 1 hg cap from the 26 tons originally proposed by the administration to 34 tons based on doe estimate about the actua l level of emissions that could be achieved without dedicated hg controls ie cobenefits there are substantial differences between the hg characteristics of bituminous and subbituminous coals and uncertainty about what the actual cobenefits levels for hg control are if clear skies reflects the actual cobenefits levels the effect of hg controls on coal production would be nilhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32790crs6 14 prepared by marc humphries analyst in energy policy crs resources science and industry divisionbeyond that estimated for so2 and nox controls likewise the commercialization of emerging hg control technology such as activated carbon injection aci would eliminate any shift between coal types however there is substantial controversy over what any cobenefits level is and the future availability of aci and other alternatives the pivotal issues for coal and clear skies include the following 1 the potential for natural gas to erode market shar for coal due to higher pollution control costs under clear skies 2 the potential fo r market shift between western suppliers and eastern suppliers because of increased so2 controls and 3 the uncertain effects of hg controls if they exceed cobenefit levels or if emerging hg controls are not available outlook clear skies faces an uncertain future in march 2005 the senate environment and public works committee killed s 131 on 99 vote however many of the issues identified here also manifest themselves in epas final clear air interstate rule cair and its final hg rule so the issue is not likely to disappear clean coal technology14 background the original clean coal technology cct program began in 1984 to demonstrate emissions control technologie s advanced electric power generation facilities and coal and indus trial processing projects congress had appropriated 25 billion for the cct program by 1990 but since 1994 as much as 300 million had been deferred or rescinded because of limited commercial prospects and less administration

recent appropriation trends the greatest interest for closerterm rd is with igcc projects for electricity s upply and emissions reduction there are two smallscale igcc commercial plants operating today 250 megawatt mw facility opera ted by tampa electric power in florida and 300 mw facility operated by cinergy at its wabash river site in indiana igcc technology involves the gasification of coal to pro duce electricity during the gasification process coal is cofed with water and oxygen in reducing atmosphere at high pressure to produce synthetic gas carbon m onoxide and hydrogen sulfur and carbon dioxide are also produced and removed the synthetic gas drives combustion turbine whose exhaust is used to make st eam to drive secondary turbine one of the biggest obstacles facing igcc is the reliability of the gasification process because of reliability questions among ot her challenges largescale competitive commercial plants may still be years away both congress and the administration continue to invest heavily in igcc because of the potential benefits from reduced nox sox mercury and particul ate matter moreover lower co2 emissions through greater plant efficiencies andor poten tial sequestration coul d be substantial the administration is looking at very l ongterm investments as well futuregen represents that strategy futuregen an integrated sequestration and

carbon dioxide annually the project is designed to bu ild international suppor t to address global warming and energy security15 the prototype will allow doe to operate large scale facility to prove the technical feasib ility of zero emission production out of the 950 million cost estimate of the project doe would invest 500 million plus an additional 120 million from its sequestration program the private sector would contribute 250 million which would be capped and about 80 million is anticipated from the international community the funding for futuregen began in fy2004 at 9 million appropriations were nearly doubled to 175 million in fy2005 the bush administration is seeking 18 million for fy2006 project funding between fy2004 and fy2006 is for plant definition and nepa

ar proposed which would reduce the total fossil energy program to 4915 million 14 805 million less than the enacted amount for fy2005 coal gasification within the coal rd program the administrations request for gasification research went up from 345 million in fy2005 to 564 million in fy2006 fy2005 ppropriations were 458 million this level of increase is an indication of more commitment by the administration and congress to igcc efforts aimed at commercialization of the technology carbon sequestration the rd program would receive 672 million in the administrations fy2006 re quest 218 million increase over fy2005 futuregen the fy2006 administration request is 18 million outlook the fy2006 funding request for fossil energy rd is heavily weighted towards clean coal technology potentially at the expense of other fossil technologies such as natural gas or petroleum t echnology rd however the ccpi may need consistently higher investments in constr ained spending environment to provide the desired longterm results commercially affordable coal tec hnology for electricity generation while substantially reducing emission levels if funding support or incentives are not high enough industry may forgo the longterm commitment needed and instead abandon gasification pr ojects altogether even with heavy investment in clean coalgasification strategies natural gasfired generation may retain its economic advantage over the longterm because of moderate natural gas prices andor more efficient gas units on similar note technology obstacles with igcc may not be resolved
