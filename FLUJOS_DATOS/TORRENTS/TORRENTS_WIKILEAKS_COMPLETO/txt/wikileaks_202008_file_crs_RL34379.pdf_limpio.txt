country over the past year many belie ve that the problem will get worse the joint economic committee estimates that around 2 million foreclosures of subprime mortgages will occur from the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2009 as way to slow the decline some in congress have suggested passing legislation that would impose temporary re duction or freeze in the interest rates of certain mortgages in order to give mortgage market participants such as borrowers servicers lenders and investors time to refinance or otherwise adjust the mortgage terms of borrowers who would not likely be able to keep up with their scheduled payments such measure would modify existing contracts which would result in the loss of property rights of some individuals in the mortgage market for this reason this type of

the overall potential liability of the federal government for those claims and the litigation costs of unsu ccessful claims is not possible to assess at least within the scope of this report3 legislative authority to pass an interest rate freezereduction the constitutionality of legislation that imposes an interest rate freezereduction on mortgages may be affected by the context in which it is raised and by extension the authority by which congress passes such statute for example piece of legislation providing general regulatory reform of the housing finance market is more likely to fall under congresss commerce clause authority whereas legislation that is more tailored to asset allocation between debtor and her creditors is more likely to be considered an extension of congresss bankruptcy clause authority the parameters of congresss authority pursuant to these two clauses are addressed in turn the constitution grants congress vast authority to enact laws involving interstate commerce article i 8 clause 3 of the us constitution states congress shall have the power to regu late commerce with foreign nations and among the several states commer ce among the several states must by necessity include commerce between the states4 the power extends beyond thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34379crs3 5 new york v united states 505 us 144 158 1992 the volume of interstate commerce and the range of commonly accepted objects of government regulation have expanded considerably in the last 200 years and the regulatory authority of congress has expanded along with them as interstate commerce has become ubiquitous activities once considered purely local have come to have effects on the national economy and have accordingly come within the scope of congress commerce power 6 united states v morrison 529 us 598 617 2000 united states v lopez 514 us 549 561 1995 the criminal statute by its own terms has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise and is not an essential part of larger regulation of economic activity in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated it cannot therefore be sustained under our cases

omitted 8 id at 561borders of individual states because it woul d not be possible for congress to regulate commerce that takes place exclusively on states borders while there was time when the courts interpreted the commerce clause more restrictively the melding of 50 different economies into si ngle national economy has played significant role in its expansion5 indeed the us supreme court has only twice since the 1930s invalidated fe deral legislation be cause congress had exceeded its commerce clause power in both of those cases the court held that the statute being challenged was not economic in nature and therefor did not have substantial effect on interstate commerce6 the court has said that statutes that regulate one of three categories of commercial activities are within congressional authority first congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce second congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or persons or thin gs in interstate commerce even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities finally congress commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having substantial relation to interstate commerce ie those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce7 the last of these categories allows courts to examine the cumulative effect of commercial activity on the economy as whole this is the category within which an interest rate freeze reduction likely would fall federally mandated interest rate freezereduction designed to reduce the effects of slowing national housing market seems to pertain to financial transactions that viewed in the aggregate substantially affect interstate commerce8 even if viewed as entirely intrastate such law also would likely be considered part of larger regulation of economic activity in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated due to the fact that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34379crs4 9 quoting id at 549 10 us c onst art i 8 cl 4 one important diffe rence between the commerce clause and the bankruptcy clause is that laws passe d under by the bankruptcy clause must be uniform railway labor executives assn v gibbons 455 us 457 465 1981 the court in gibbons held that bankruptcy statute that pplied to only one debtor was not uniform id at 471 the court also explained the difficulty in distinguishing congressional exerci of power under the commerce clause from an exercise under the bankruptcy clau although we have noted that the subject of bankruptcies is incapable of final definition we have previously defined bankruptcy as the subject of the relations between an insolvent or nonpaying or fraudulent debtor and his cred itors extending to his and their relief congress power under the bankruptcy clau contemplates an adjustment of failing debtors obligations this power ex tends to all cases where the law causes to be distributed the property of the btors among his creditors it includes the power to discharge the debtor from his contracts and legal liabilities as well as to distribute this property the grant to congress involves the power to impair the obligation of contracts and this the states were forbidden to do id at 466 internal citations and quotations omitted 11 hanover natl bank v moyses 186 us 181 1938 in re klein 42 us 1 how 277 1843 12 this deference probably would increase the fo reseeability of statutorily imposed interest rate freezereduction which is important to an analysis under the impairment of

expectations s ubsection of the application of penn central to an interest rate freezereduction section of this reportsecondary market links local real property into national market9 although not beyond debate it seems likely that court would find statute imposing an interest rate freezereduction to be within congresss constitutional authority congress also has broad authority conc urrent with its authority under the commerce clause to enact uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies10 the supreme court has approved of congresss use of this authority to impair contracts and even to avoid liens11 in fact the modification of c ontract rights is one of the main purposes of bankruptcy for these reas ons if court finds such legislation to be valid extension of c ongresss bankruptcy power th that court may provide congress greater deference under takings analysis than it would for legislation passed pursuant to the commerce clause12 whether or not an interest rate freezereduction would fall within the bankruptcy clause likely would depend on the scope and nature of specific proposal as well as congresss intent for its passage the more limited the application of such legislation is to debt ors who meet the qualifications to file for bankruptcy probably the more likely court would find the legislation to be valid extension of bankruptcy power such termination also ma be contingent uponhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34379crs5 13 measures such as hr 3609 the emerge ncy home ownership and mortgage equity protection act as it was ordered to be reported favorably by the house judiciary committee likely would be valid extension of congresss authority to pass uniform laws on bankruptcies because those bills seek to am end how certain debts secured by the debtors primary residence are dealt with in chapter 13 bankruptcy reorganization plan it is less clear if piece of legislation that places an interest rate freezereduction on all mortgages originated nationwide or

predicted13 regardless of which of these two sources of authority are applied the legislative proposal in question would still be subject to certain constituti onal protections such as those provided by the fifth amendm ents due process and takings clauses contract clause and s ubstantive due process before discussing the relevant portions of the fifth amendment some common misconceptions regarding the contract clause should be addressed artic i 10 clause 1 of the us constitution states state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts this clause prohibits states from passing legislation that makes certain changes to the terms of existing contracts14 the language of the contract clause is expressly limited to the states additionally the court has held that the principles of the contract clause are not incorporated against the federal government by the fifth am endments due process cause15 the court explained we have never held that the principl embodied in the fifth amendments due process clause are coextensive with provisions existing against state impairments of preexisting contracts rather we have contrasted the limitations imposed on states by the contract clause with the less searching standards imposed on economic legislation by the due process clauses16 therefore the contract clause doe s not apply to fe deral legislation federal legislation

2006 prior to 2005 there was great deal of confusion among courts in how to properly delineate between takings law and substantive due process analysis which was partially alleviated by the supreme courts 2005 lingle v chevron usa inc decision 544 us 528 2005 see eg agins v city of tiburon 447 us 255 1980 kavanau v santa monica rent control bd 941 p2d 851 cal 1997 while some confusi on remains the court has clarified that substantive due process and takings law address unique concerns 18 see eg eastern enterprises v apfel 524 us 498 1998 19 it also is possible for one to claim an equa l protection clause violation especially if the claimant believes that she was treated unequally see eg village of willowbrook v olech 528 us 562 2000 an equal pr otection clause violation is not likely to result from an interest rate freezereduction that is not limited to members of protected class such as race or ethnicity 20 mortgages and the contract rights to mort gagebacked securities investments are private property for the purpose of fi fth amendment protections 21 lingle 544 us at 538 22 id 23 506 us 1003 1992legitimate government purpose17 an interest rate freezereduction that is implemented for the purpose of providing lenders and servicers time to initiate loan modifications and loss mitigation in order to strengthen an ailing market would not likely be violative of substantive due pro cess in light of the vast deference courts provide the government in the context of economic regulation18 consequently this report focuses on takings law analysis19 overview of takings clause jurisprudence the fifth amendment concludes with th words nor shall private property be taken for public use without just comp ensation the takings clause requires striking balance between the government s public goals and the burdens suffered by private property owners as the government takes measures to meet its goals the courts have recognized relatively few governmental infringements of private citizens property as constitutional takings where outright seizure or permanent physical occupation of the property occurs the infri ngement must rise to certain severity or be of particular kind before courts will say taking has occurred only then must the government provide just compensation to the property owner20 the courts have developed an arra of tests rules and factor s to determine what does and does not constitute taking four types of takings the proper test to appl depends on the type of governmental action involved there are four broad categories of takings recognized by the supreme court21 two of these tests are clearly not applicable to an interest rate freezereduction one is landuse exacti on taking such as mandatory set aside for certain portion of new housin g development to be green space22 the other is type of regulatory ta king as described in lucas v south carolina coastal council 23 where the government deprives an owner of all

has only been used in real property cases such as lucas v south carolina however at least one federal circuit case has applied total takings analysis to personal property though it did not find taking

2007commonly referred to as lucas total taking24 most courts agree that lucas total takings only apply to land not personal property such as contract rights25 an interest rate freezereduction could be assessed pursuant to one of the other two tests one is physical taking or appropriation wh ere the government requires an owner to suffer permanent physical i nvasion of her property26 the final test is for all regulatory takings other than total takings which are analyzed pursuant to the test originally set out in penn central transp co v city of new york 27 physical takingappropriation vs regulatory taking plaintiffs would likely argue that legislation imposing an interest rate freezereduction resulted in permanent physical occupation of their property as these are considered per takings warranting just compensation while on the contrary the government would likely argue that this type of legislation should be analyzed under penn central where the government usually wins on takings law commentator explains the courts decisions using per physical taking analysis typically involve physical invasions in the literal sense invasions by aircraft flood waters the boating public government personnel cable boxes and mobilehomepark tenants but in some factual contexts physical and regulatory takings have proved difficult to keep separate the tendency to blur the two is enhan ced by the powerful incentives plaintiffs have to urge physical versus regulatory theory in case first there is the lesser showing needed for plaintiff to win on permanent physical occupation claim second is the extremely narro w range of application for the total taking test leaving the physical occupation rule as the only per rule left to plaintiff in many cases one example of where this line is blurred is where government program causes physical in vasion but affects the property owner in way more or less akin to an appropriation here the takings analysis may go either way regulatory or physical the issue played out at length in cases involving state demands that small interest amounts on lawyers trust accounts be paid to staterun program funding legal services for the poor and was ultimately resolved as physicaltype taking28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34379crs8 29 for more information regarding the securitization process and provisions of typical psas see crs report rs22722

freezereduction physical taking or an appropriation of an mb s investors rights to the income stream lost due to the legislation nd therefore per taking this argument would likely be given some credence because the focu s of the proposals being considered for legislation interest payments is such central element of mortgage what might be fundamental to courts inquiry is wh ether the interest ra modification would have been allowed under the pooling and servicing agreement psa psas are the contracts for mortgagebacked securitized trusts that govern the legal relationship between mbs trustees mbs investors nd servicers of the mortgages comprising these trusts while not all psas are exactly alike one relevant feature of typical agreements is the scope of the permission of servicers to perform loss mitigation and loan modification for borrowe rs in instances where mortgage would qualify for an interest rate freezereducti on under federal legislation but where the borrower would not have qualified for modi fication under the psa finding physical taking would be more likely the more tailored the scope of any legislation to the situations in which servicers have authority to adjust mortgage interest rates pursuant to governing psas the less likely court would find physical taking29 more probable scenario especially in light of the fact that the income lost as result of an interest rate freezereduction would not directly accrue to the government as was the case with the intere st from the lawyers trust accounts is that court would consider such statute as possible regulatory taking to be analyzed pursuant to penn central historical precedent vinton branch and radford while it seems most likely in light of recent jurisprudence that courts would address takings claim raised in response to an intere st rate freezereduction under the parameters set out in penn central it is possible that court might be influenced by the similar fact patterns of tw supreme court cases from the 1930s wright v vinton branch30 and louisville joint stock land bank v radford 31 congress enacted the frazierlemke act of 1934 which amended the bankruptcy act to provide farmers five year mortgage foreclosure moratorium allow farmers to keep possession of real property for reasonable rent and allow them to pay judicially appraised purchase value at the end of the five years for the purpose of preventing widesp read farm foreclosures32 the supreme court inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34379crs9 33 id at 58990 34 vinton branch 300 us at 45657 internal citations ommited 35 id at 470 36 idradford held the frazierlemke act to be in violation of the fifth amendment and thus unconstitutional33 the court stated the decision in the radford case did not question the power of congress to offer to distressed farmers the aid of means of rehabilitation under the bankruptcy clause sic the original frazierlemke act wa s there held invalid solely on the ground that the bankruptcy power of c ongress like its other great powers is subject to the fifth amendment and that as applied to the mortgages given before its enactment the statute violated that amendment since it effected substantial impairment of the mortgage security the opinion enumerates five important substantive rights in specific property which had been taken it was not held that the deprivation of any one of these rights would have rendered the act invalid but that the effect of the stat ute in its entirety was to deprive the mortgagee of his property without due pr ocess of law the rights enumerated were 1 the right to retain the lien until the indebtedness thereby secured is paid 2 the right to realize upon the security by judicial public sale3 the right to determine when such sale shall be held subject only to the discretion of the court 4 the right to protect its interest in the property by bidding at such sale whenever held and thus to assure having the mortgaged property devoted primarily to the satisfaction of the debt either through receipt of the proceeds of fair competitive sale or by taking the property itself 5 the right to control meanwhile the property during the period of default subject only to the discretion of the court and to have the rents and profits collected by receiver for the satisfaction of the debt 34 however the radford decision was called into question just three years later by the vinton branch court in which slightly modified version of the frazierlemke act which was found to long er deprive three of the fi ve aboveliste d substantive rights was deemed in accordance with the fifth amendment35 the court explained the power here exerted by congress is the broad power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies th roughout the united states the question which the objections raise is not whether the act does more than modify remedial rights it is whether the legislation modifies the secured creditors rights remedial or substantive to such an extent as to deny the due process of law guaranteed by the fifth amendmen t for the reasons stated we are of opinion that the provisions of subsection s of the frazierlemke act make unreasonable modification of the mortga gees rights and hence are valid36httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34379crs10 37 as one court explai ned whether or not

emphasis added 39 vinton branch 300 us at 470 emphasis added 40 lingle 544 us at 54243 the substantially advances formula suggests meansends test it asks in essence whether regulation of private property is effective in achieving some legitimate public purpose an inquiry of th is nature has some logic in the context of due process challenge for regulation that fails to serve any legitimate governmental objective may be so arbitrary or irrational that it runs afoul of the due process clause but such test is not valid method of discerning whether private property has been taken for purposes of the fifth amendmen t test that tells us not hing about the actual burden imposed on property rights or how that burden is allocated cannot tell us when justice might require that the burden be spread among taxpayers through the payment of compensation the owner of property subject to regulation that effectively serves legitimate state interest may be just as single d out and just as burdened as the owner of property subject to an ineffective regulation it would make little sense to say that the second owner has suffered taking while the first has not likewise an ineffective regulation may not significantly burden property rights at ll and it may distribute any burden broadly and evenly among property owners the notion that such regulation nevertheless takes private property for public use merely by virtue of its ineffectiveness or foolishness is untenable emphasis original internal citations omitted while it is possible that current court would look to vinton branch as authoritative on the question of takings claim raised as result of federal interest rate freezereduction because that opinion addresses similar fact s as those assessed in this report and because it has not been expressly overruled it seems more likely that court would analyze such ta kings claim under the test outlined in penn central first of all the vinton branch decision came down more than 40 years prior to penn central in those 40 years and the subsequent 30 much has changed in takings jurisprudence37 most notably vinton branch was delivered at time in which the courts did not delineate between the fifth amendments due process clause and the fifth amendments takings clause this point is emphasized by the varying language used in the radford and vinton branch cases the radford decision states that the ultimate question to be addressed is whether the frazierlemke act as applied has taken from the bank without compensation and given to radford rights in specific property which are of substantial value38 whereas the vinton branch opinion characterizes the ultimate question as whether the act modifies the secured creditors rights to such an extent as to deny the due process of law guaranteed by the fifth amendment39 it was not until the 2005 supreme court decision lingle v chevron usa inc that the high court made it clear that the tests to be applied under takings claims are distinct from those analyzing potential due process violations40 the lingle court confirmed that plaintiff seeking to challenge government regulation as an uncompensated taking of private property may proceed unde r one of the other theories discussedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34379crs11 41 id at 548 citing nollan v california coastal co mmn 483 us 825 1997 and dolan v

dentally interfere with the performance of private contracts constitute only frustration not taking of contract rights omnia commercial co v united states 261 us 502 1923 the legislative issue this report is addressing on the other hand would directly target private mortgage contracts as opposed to incidentally interfering with the contr acts when legislation specifically targets an existing contract or class of cont racts the courts have found that omnia does not apply and instead have applied penn centrals balancing test see cienega gardens v united states 331 f3d 1319 1335 fed cir 2003 omni refers to legislation targeted at some public benefit which incidentally affect s contract rights not legislation aimed at the contract rights themselves in order to nullify themabove by alleging physical taking lucas type total regulatory taking penn central taking or landuse exaction violating the standards set forth in nollan and dolan 41 while penn central is likely to govern this does not mean that piece of legislation crafted to meet the test set out in vinton branch could not also pass the three balancing factors of penn central these three factors are analyzed in great detail below but as an example an interest rate freezereduction statute that lasts for relatively short period of time and that requires borrowers to make reasonable monthly payments in order to qualify for the interest rate adjustment will reduce the economic impact of the legislation on mbss mortgagebacked securities investors property rights thus diminishing the strength of their takings arguments application of penn central to an interest rate freezereduction penn central overview before beginning any analysis it should be noted that takings clause jurisprudence is highly amorphous and an everevolving area of the law additionally the question of wh ether statutorily imposed interest rate freezereduction violated the ta kings clause has never been addressed directly by court the penn central test is as the supreme cour t has stated an essentially ad hoc and factual inquiry42 finally the mortgagebacked securities industry is highly complex yet largely unregulated industry which makes garnering specific information about the tranches of each mortgagebacked securitized trust very difficult all of these factors make analys is of how court might rule on takings issue quite difficult even where all fact s are known with those caveats in mind the following analysis informs on how courts have assessed each of the three penn central factors and highlights certain contex ts or facts that courts emphasize as triggering takings clause protection that may be implicated by such legislation legislation targeting private contracts usually survives takings attacks under penn central analysis43 however this does not mean that court could not find takings under certain circumstances nor does it mean that secondary market investors would not bring suits claiming takings had occurred which comes with its own costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34379crs12 44 penn central 438 us at 12428 pennsylvania coal co v mahon 260 us 393 415 1922 nollan v california coas tal commn 483 us

below that statute imposing an interest rate freezereduction could have significant enough effect on minority of mbs tranches as to rise to the level of taking the penn central test consists of three factors that are designed to determine whether the government regulatory acti on has resulted in the deprivation of property right sufficient to violate the takings clause the three factors are 1 the economic impact of the government action 2 the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investmentb acked expectations and 3 the character of the government action44 the supreme court has shed little light on the content of these three factors or on how to balance them and each factor raises vexing subsidiary questions45 economic impact the penn central inquiry turns in large part albeit not exclusively on the economic impact factor46 in assessing the economic impact courts evaluate the proportion of the loss caused by the regulation to the parcel as whole47 this means that in weighing th economic impact the courts look at entire property rather than exclusively at the portion of the real property affected by the legislation in isolation the s upreme court explained it this way claimants parcel of prope rty could not first be divided into what was taken and what was left for the purpose of demonstrating the taking of the former to be complete and hence compensable to th extent that any portion of property is taken that portion is always taken in its entirety the relevant question however is whether the property taken is all or only portion of the parcel in question48 the parcel as whole concept has three different dimensions physicalspatial functional and temporal in the context of takings claim raised by investors of mbss compelling arguments could be made to define the physical parcel as either the tranches of each trust or the securitized trust as whole this report focuses on the tranches as the physical parcel inte rpretation because such definition would result in the strongest arguments for taking thus emphasizing potential legal issues that interest rate freezereduction legislation may raise which is the purpose of this report the other option would make successful takings claim less likely because the impact of such an interest rate chan ge would be spread out over the hundreds or thousands of other mortgages within each

massachusetts 989 f2d 13 1819 1st cir 1993 however this type of analysis would not fit well in the context of takings claim raised by an investor of mbss 52 see concrete pipe 508 us at 645to address the functional dimensi on courts would look to how the governmental interference affects the entire bundle of rights as opposed to single right within the bundle49 in the mbs context an investors bundle of rights would include everything provided in the gove rning psa including rights to certain income stream and contract claims for violations of the psa the temporal dimension requires an assessment of the physical parcel for the entire time period during which the plaintiff has an interest in that property50 for example if an investor owned tranche that consisted of the 12month income stream from both principal and interest payments of group of mortgages and sixmonth interest rate freeze was imposed in the middle of that period the court would analyze the economic impact to that investor in relati on to the whole 12 months not just the six months of the freeze tempor dimension and in rela tion to the income from both principal and interest not just the in terest payments changed by the freeze functional courts vary in how they determine the economic loss caused by regulations most courts look to either the propert ys diminution in value or diminution in return caused by the regulation51 under both courts are in agreement that the loss must be significant the supreme cour t has in past cases found diminutions in property upwards of 75 to not by themselves be enough to be considered taking52 determining the severity of the lost value or return caused by the legislation in question would be an entirely facts pecific inquiry the complexity of the secondary market coupled with its lack of governmental oversight hamper the ability to fully assess how many and to what extent tranches of mortgagebacked securitized trusts would be affected by statutorily imposed interest rate freezereduction of certain mortgages when mortgages are sold in the secondary market they are often lumped in trust and then separa ted into tranches on the basis of certain common characteristics mortgages can be left intact or they can be diced into pieces for example tranche could consist entirely of 30year fixed prime rate mortgages that do not include prepayment penalties or tranche could consist of only the income stream from the interest payments of subprime mortgages with twoyear arms or tranche could be comprised of 25 of the first group and 75 of the second group there are virtually limits to what can comprise tranche it is conceivable that there are or would be tranches that represent in whole or in part the income from the planned interest rate adjustment

the tranches where tranche loses its entire value due to fe deral legislation taking likely has occurred it is unclear where court would draw the line in cases where some but less than 100 loss results though almost certainly the percentage would be quite high for interm ediate percentages the other two prongs of the penn central test likely are to be of importance impairment of investmentbacked expectations when examining whether congressional impairment of privat contracts interferes with investment backed expectations courts typically ve focused on whether it was reasonable for the harmed party to assume that the impairment would not occur53 the critical question is whether extension of existin g law could be foreseen as reasonably possible54 to do so courts generally look to the type and level of regulation the claimant faced prior to imple mentation of the regulation in question if for instance the subject of the regulation was part of heavily regulated field prior to the additional legislative impairment then additional regulation is more likely to have been foreseeable to the harmed party the courts have concluded for example that national banks55 and employee pension plans56 are in heavily regulated fields57 however lowincome housing is not58 the proposals for legislation addresse d in this report would regulate the mortgage lending mortgage servicing and mortgagebacked securities investing industries the mortgage lending indus try would likely be considered heavily regulated however credible argument s could be made that the other two especially the mbss industry are not heav ily regulated which would strengthen the argument that taking has occurred yet secondary market investors understand that each mortgage they invest in could end up in default and this possibility is accounted for in the psas governing when and how servicers may modify these loans while government imposed modification of th interest rates of certain mortgages arguably would be departure from the norm of servicers modifying mortgages in accordance with the terms of psas the more important question would seem to be whether the statutorily impos ed modification would have been allowed pursuant to the governing psa httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34379crs15 59 for more information on congresss power s pursuant to the bankruptcy clause see the legislative authority to pass an interest rate freezereduction section of this report 60 544 us at 542 the substantially advances formula suggests meansends test it suggests in essence whether regulation of private property is effective in achieving some legitimate public purpose an inquiry of this nature has some logic in the context of due process challenge but such test is not valid method of dis cerning whether private property has been taken for purposes of the fifth amendment emphasis in original 61 see eg tahoesierra preservation council inc v tahoe regional planning agency 535 us at 333 were it not for findings that the agency acted in good faith the court might have concluded the agency was stalling and found takinga mbs investor could make stronger ar gument that the legislation in question was not reasonably foreseeable where the statutorily imposed interest rate freezereduction would not have been llowed under the governing psa the more tailored the application of any interest rate freezereduction was to those borrowers who would qualify for such loan modifi cation pursuant to the governing psa the fewer mbs investors that would have stronger ar guments under this prong consequently the scope of legislation might play an important role in courts analysis under the investmentback ed expectations prong of the penn central test another factor that may strengthen foreseeability argument and thus augment the governments defense against takings claim is if the legislation in question is considered to be valid extension of congresss authority to pass laws on bankruptcies because the modification of contract rights is such an integral part of bankruptcy and because mbs i nvestors should be aware that all mortgages could end up in bankruptcy these investors arguably s hould be less surprised by change to the bankruptcy laws that impose some form of interest rate freeze or reduction than more broadly applicable statute pa ssed pursuant to the commerce clause59 character of the government action the third factor the character of the government action is arguably of diminished importance in light of the supreme courts lingle v chevron usa inc decision where the court stated unequivocally that inquiry into whether regulation dvances some public pur pose is not relevant to the question of whether taking occurred for fifth amendment purposes60 the effect lingle will have on how future courts will apply the nature of the government action factor is presently unclear histori cally courts used this factor to assess whether regulation that impaired priv ate contracts direc tly benefited the government disp roportiona tely imposed the costs of public benefit on small class or was somehow the resu lt of governmental bad faith61 it is doubtful that legislatively imposed interest rate freezereduction would take rights from investors and appropriate them to the government or would be enact ed as result of bad faith rather such legislation likely would be an attempt to help stem the current housing downturn that is affecting the entire market in the absence of specific legislative language to delineate which mortgages w ould be covered by an interest rate freezereduction it is unclear if such gislation would impose disproportionate amount of liability on small number of i nvestors the nature of the government action authorized by the proposals in ques tion would not appear to greatly augment takings claim but more informati on would be needed to know for sure httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34379crs16 62 facial challenge would not succeed under penn central because the particular facts of plaintiffs property would be pivotal to regu latory takings analysis facial challenge would be possible if the court found an interest rate freezereduction to be physical taking see the physical takingappropriation vs regu latory taking section of this report 63 the value of securitized mortgages was around 2 tr illion in 2006 see crs report rs22722 securitization and federal regulati on of mortgages for safety and soundness by edward vincent murphyconclusion in sum it is unlikely but possible that court would assess an interest rate freezereduction pursuant to the test ou tlined in the 1937 supreme court decision vinton branch courts would be more likely to assess such legislation as regulatory taking under penn central if analyzed as regulatory taking it is unclear how court would decide an asapplied takings cl aim especially wit hout specific facts that would allow an assessment of the severity of the regulations economic impact on an individual investors property rights wh ich seems to be the most important penn central factor62 in such an analysis court could define the physical parcel as either the securitized trust in its entirety or the i nvestment tranches of each trust if court adopts the tranche as the parcel interpre tation it is not difficult to envision some tranches being significantly if not entirely diminished in value by an interest rate freezereduction due to the great diversity of investments in the mortgage securities market the economic impact in some of thes situations could be substantial enough to be considered regulatory taking findi ng taking would be far less likely if court accepts the argument that the physical parcel s hould be defined as an entire trust it is impossible to predict at what vel of economic impact court would hold that taking has occurred though in the pa st it has almost always been quite high the strength of an impairment of inves tmentbacked expectations argument would likely turn on the scope of the legislation and how that coincides with the loan modification authority provided by the gove rning psa and if court determines the legislation to be pa ssed pursuant to congresss bankrupt cy powers the nature of the government action does not appear to warrant takings concerns on its own if taking were found then the legi slation would stand but the government would be required to provide claimants just compensation for their losses there is way to predict how much if any the government would be liable for in just compensation claims but in an industry va lued at more than 1 trillion in 2006 the potential liability could be large63 additionally investors who lost large sums of money due to an interest rate freeze reduction could sue the government and regardless of the outcome of these cases the litigation itself would likely be costly
