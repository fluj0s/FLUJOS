the chairman of the federal trade commission ftc and the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division of the department of justice3 there is an initial 30 day waiting period before the transaction can be consummated it begins on the day the reviewing agency receives the material to be filed as specified in 15 usc section 18ab1a b that waiting period may be extended for an additional 20 days if before the expiration of the initial 30da period the reviewing agency asks for additional material or docum entary material relevant to the proposed acquisition4 or the original waiting period may be terminated prior to the end of the 30day period if the reviewing agency indicates in federal register notice that it intends to take further action 15 usc 18ab2 the ftc was th reviewing agency in this instance simultaneously with the ftc s review of the proposed chevronunocal merger the commission was involved in an administrative hearing with unocal over the ftc charge in march 2003 that unocal had unlawfully monopolized the market for reformulated gasoline meeting the specifications of the california air resources board carb the alleged monopolization the commission said re sulted from the fact that unocal had misrepresented that its research concerning the reformulated gasoline was nonproprietary while at the same time pursuing patents on the technology inasmuch as carb has incorporated the technology in its regulations concerning reformulated gasoline entities that produce such gasoline are obligated to pay patent royalties to unocal upon review of the proposed chevronu nocal merger the ftc acknowledged that because unocal neither refines gasoline nor ma intains any retail stations virtually all of the competitive overlaps between the two firms are in unconcentrated upstream markets exploration and production of cr ude oil and natural gas and the merger thus creates competitive risk5 nevertheless the ftc noted that if chevron were to acquire unocal it would be in position not only to enforce the questionably obtained patents but also to receive the detailed reports currently collected by unocal from producers of the carbcompliant gasoline if chevron had continued these license agreements after inheriting union oils patents it would have received information not otherwise available to members of the industry chevron could have used this information to facilitate coordinated interaction and detect any deviations chevron might also have been able to use the patents to discourage maverick behavior our present knowledge suggests that the likely competitive harm from this potential coordination and discipline wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22192crs3 6 id 7 see crs report 94610a foreign investment in the united states by michael v

for further anticompetitive activity arising from the chevronunocal merger were resolved in single proposed consent orde r that the commission believes to be in the best interests of california gasoline consum ers it mandates th at neither chevron nor unocal will take any action to enforce the patents or collect royalties including pursuing any litigation that may be pending and requires that unocal disclaim its reformulated gasoline patents and release the patented information to the public but because the consent order became effective only upon th consummation of the chevronunocal merger in the event that the bid by cnooc had been successful unocal would have been faced with reopening of the ftc administrative hearing on the patentmonopolization matter the united states has for the most part welcomed foreign i nvestment although in certain industries considered v ital to national interests such as airlines shipping and communication7 there are restrictions on how much of business may be owned by foreign citizen further there are specific statutes which allow or require depending upon the circumstances the president or the pres idents designee to investigate the effects on national security of merg er acquisition or takeover of an american company by foreign person and to take appropriate ac tion if threat upon national security is determined these statutes would likely have been crucial in cnoocs bid for unocal section 5021 of the omnibus trad and competitiveness act of 19888 often called the exonflorio provision amended secti on 721 of the defense
