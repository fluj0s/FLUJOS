whitecollar employees are inte nded by law to receive an annual pay adjustment and localitybased comparability payment effective in january of each year under section 529 of pl 101509 th federal employees pay comparability act fepca of 1990 the law has never b een implemented as originally enacted annual and cality payments pursuant to the statute have been reduced each year federal whitecollar employees received 17 annual pay adjustment and 05 localitybased comparability payment in january 2007 president george w bush authorized the average 22 pay adjus tment in executive order 13420 issued on december 21 2006 although the annual adju stment and the locality payment are sometimes referred to as costofliving adjustments neither is based on changes in the cost of living the annual pay adjustment is based on the employment cost index eci which measures change in privatesector wages and salaries the size of the locality payment is determined by the president and is based on comparison of nonfederal and general schedule g s salaries in 32 pay areas nationwide by law the disparity between nonfederal and federal salaries was to be gradually reduced to 5 during the years 1994 to 2002 continuing in each year thereafter fepca requires that amounts payable may not be less than th full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity to 5 for the january 2007 pay adjustment the eci showed that the annual acrosstheboard increase would be 17 the federal salary council and the pay agent recommended that to carry out fepca the 2007 locality payments range from 1410 in the rest of the united stat rus pay area to 4965 in the san josesan francisco pay area and be 3136 in the washin gton dc pay area because the new locality rate replaces the existing locality rate the rate change is derived by comparing 2006 locality paym ents with those recommended for 2007 this comparison results in recommended net increases for 2007 if the eci and localitybased comparability payments were granted as required by law of 313 in the rus pay area 1827 in the san joses an francisco pay area and 1370 in the washington dc pay area the nationwide av erage net pay increase if the eci and

comparability payments would be payable by nove mber 30 2006 for the 2007 payment the president would have to prepare and transmit to congress report describing the intended alternative level of

of pay in each of the pay areas and compares nonfederal and gs salaries by grade for each pay area the av erage salaries at each grade both federal and nonfederal are then aggregated and compared to determine an overall average percentage pay gap for each area by law the disparity between nonfederal and federal salaries is to be reduced to 5 therefore the overall average percentage pay gap for each pay area is adjust ed annually to this level by opm this adjusted gap called the target gap is used to determine the locality rates for each pay area recommended to the president by the pay agent after receiving advice from the federal salary council the pay gaps on which the locality payments are based are 22 months old by the effective date of the adjustment thus march 2005 gaps determine the january 2007 locality payments fepca also stipulates that certain percentage of the target gap between gs average salaries and nonfederal average sala ries in each pay area is to be closed each
