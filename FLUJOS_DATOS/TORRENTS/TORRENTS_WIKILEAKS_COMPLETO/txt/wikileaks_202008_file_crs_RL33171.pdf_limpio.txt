donald j marples government and finance division march 12 2008 abstract various hypothetical alternatives exist for reforming the business tax system one possibility is to move in the direction of the 1986 tax reform act by broadening the existing tax base that is by eliminating tax beneﬁts and preferences another possibility and one that is favored by many economists is to adopt some form of tax integration that would eliminate the double taxation of corporate income third option is to adopt form of consumption tax under which new business investment would be exempt from tax either corporate tax integration or consumption tax could improve economic eﬃciency but only if the design were to avoid the types of distortions present in the current

implemented 22 years ago by the tax reform act of 1986 was tax neutralitythe idea that economic efficiency and economic welfare are promoted if the distorting impact of taxes on business and other economic decisions is minimized based on this principle the 1986 act broadened the tax base and reduced statutory tax rates set forth by the tax code in time however the underlying thrust of tax policy has changed rather than neutrality and efficiency recent business tax legislation has been guided more by concern for promoting investment and capital formation and by attention to the perceived impact of taxes on the ability of us firms to compete with foreign companies further recent interest in fundamental tax reform has been partly stimulated by these same concerns for capital formation and competitiveness twenty two years after the 1986 act business tax policy is thus potentially at crossroads and it is useful to take stock of where the system stands the economic effects it is known to have and the principal options for reform several data series show similar pattern in the level of corporate taxes corporate income taxes have generally declined over the postworld war ii period at the same time however significant disparities in the structure of business taxes have remained suggesting persistence of distortions caused by the tax system corporatesector investment remains heavily taxed compared to noncorporate business and owneroccupied housing debt is favored over equity and equipment is favored over structures the base of business taxation is the return to business investment business taxes thus influence the economy through their impact on investment in broad terms business taxes can at least in principle reduce capital formation and thus impair longterm economic growth by making saving and investment less attractive this effect however depends on robust saving response to taxes the presence of which is uncertain another impact is on the allocation of investment among different sectors and asset types here business taxes likely distort investment decisions reducing economic efficiency and economic welfare in the case of equity economic theory suggests that in the long run the burden of business taxation is shared among all owners of capital and has progressive effect on the tax system various hypothetical alternatives exist for reforming the business tax system one possibility is to move in the direction of the 1986 tax reform act by broadening the existing tax basethat is by eliminating tax benefits and preferences

reform act of 1986 pl 99514 were based on tax neutralitythe idea that economic efficiency and economic welfare are promoted if the distorting impact of taxes on business and other economic decisions is minimized to this end the 1986 act broadened the tax base for both businesses and individuals scaling back various narrowlyapplicable tax preferences and benefits and reduced the statutory tax rate in time however the general thrust of businesstax policy began to change and in recent years policy has been guided more by concern for the level of investment and capital formation as well as the perceived impact of taxes on us competitiveness thus measures designed to promote taxconsistency across investments and activities have been supplanted by provisions designed to stimulate investment and assist in the ability of us firms to compete with foreign companies cases in point are the temporary bonus depreciation provisions enacted in 2002 and 2003 and the broad tax deduction for domestic production included in the omnibus businesstax bill passed in 2004 1 at the same time there has recently been renewed congressional and public interest in broad reform of the us tax system in contrast to 1986 however much of the recent interest in reform has centered on shift in the tax base to consumption rather than comprehensive measure of incomea change in focus that is based in part on the same concerns for capital formation and competitiveness that underlie much of recent businesstax legislation twentytwo years after the 1986 act business taxation is thus potentially at crossroads will the thrust of tax policy continue to shift away from the principles of efficiency and neutrality that guided tax reform two decades in the past if fundamental tax reform is adopted in the near future would it include revamped system of business taxation if so what would business taxation look like regardless of the outcome it is useful at this point to take stock to pause and review the current system and its effects the charts and discussions on the following pages are intended to assist in that exercise the report fo llows with discussion of the principal economic effects of business taxation its concluding sections review the various theoretical principles on which fundamental reform of business taxation might be based

large publicly held corporations to more closely held corporations to partnerships large and small to firms that are run by only single selfemployed owner with some exceptions the rules for

were entities with an existence separate from their owners the stockholders the tax applies to taxable corporate income corporate profits after deducting interest as defined by the tax code it applies separately and in addition to the individual income taxs applicability to shareholders dividends and capital gains as discussed in more detail below see the section on the economic effects of the tax this means that income subject to the corporate income tax is generally taxed twiceonce under the corporate income tax in the hands of corporations and on ce under the individual income tax when stockholders receive dividends or realize capital gains the double taxation does not occur however in the case of corporate in come generated by debtfinanced investment since the return to such investment is paid to creditors as interest and is taxdeductible double taxation also does not apply in the case of income paid to taxexempt stockholde rsfor example pension funds income earned by relatively closely held corporationstermed s corporations by the tax codeis not subject to the corporate income tax and so also is not taxed twice instead an s corporations income is passed through to the firms stockholders and taxed to them under the individual income tax regardless of whether the income is actually distributed to qualify as an s corporation firm can have more than 100 shareholders and must meet certain other requirements as with scorporation profits partnership taxable income is not subject to an entitylevel tax such as the corporate income tax instead each partner is taxed under the individual income tax on his or her share of the partnerships profit 2 individual income taxes also apply to business income earned by selfemployed persons who operate sole proprietorships as with partnerships and s corporations separate tax is applied at the entity ie business level according to recent estimates by the congressional budget office 62 of tangible business assets are owned by c corporations the remainder 38 is owned by other business entities ie partnerships sole proprietorships and s corporations3 as noted above rules for determining taxable income are generally the same regardless of the form of business organization4 the base of federal business income taxes is generally profits net of interest payments profits in turn are gross receiptsfor example salesminus deductible costs important categories of deductible costs include interest payments wages purchased materials and other inputs and depreciation allowance for the decline in value of tangible capital importantly the tax codes definition of these elements frequently differs from how an economist or accountant might define them for example the tax code may fully or partly exempt certain types of income from inclusion in taxable incomea specific example is the partial deduction the tax code permits for income from domestic production activities or the tax code may require the recognition of income at different point in time than when economic theory indicates it is actually earned or permit deduction to be claimed at different time from when the cost is actually incurred

or tax penalty and as described more fully below influence how the economys capital resources are allocated us firms increasingly participate in international markets and so an overview of the us structure would be incomplete without including its international dimension in the international context the us applies what is sometimes termed residence based tax system but with important exceptions the united states generally applies its corporate income to the worldwide income of corporations chartered in ie res ident in the united states at the same time however us firms can generally indefinitely postpone defer us tax on foreignsource income as long as the income is earned by foreignchartered subsidiary corporations and reinvested abroad to alleviate double taxation the united states permits its taxpayers to credit foreign taxes they pay against us taxes they would otherwise owe subject to the limitation that foreign taxes can only be credited against us foreign and not us source income foreign businesses in the united states are generally subject to us business taxes on their us source income if foreign firm operates in the united states through uschartered subsidiary corporation the subsidiary is generally subject to us tax in its role as resident us corporation like other uschartered corporations it is subject to us tax on its worldwide income regardless of the nationality of its owners if on the other hand the foreign firm operates in the united states through branch of the foreignchartered parent corporation the foreign firm is subject to us tax on its income from us but not foreign sources the united states taxes foreign persons and corporations on their income from the active conduct of us trade or business the economic effects of international aspects of the federal tax system are discussed below another structural component of the system is the alternative minimum tax amt the tax code provides both corporate amt and an individual amt business may be subject to either depending on whether it pays the corporate income tax or is taxed under the individual income tax as sole proprietorship or passthrough entity both amts essentially require taxpayer to pay either the regular tax or the amt whichever is higher the two liabilities will ordinarily differ for business because they are computed differently the amt is imposed at lower statutory rate than the regular tax and the base of the amt is more inclusive than that of the regular tax permitting fewer omissions and tax benefits the purpose of the amt is to ensure that few truly profitable corporations escape paying at least some tax the importance of the amt in the structure is difficult to quantify recent data on the share of corporate investment subject to the tax are not available the numbers that are available show that prior to 1999 the amt was important in 1998 more than onequarter of corporate assets were held by firms paying the amt and within the manufacturing sector over onehalf of firms were amt firms beginning in 1999 however new more generous amt depreciation rules likely reduced the portion of investment affected by the amt

business taxes and how has it changed over time this review of the data focuses primarily on the corporate income tax there are variety of ways to gauge its size first the general importance of the tax in terms of any economic effects it has can be assessed by looking at the level of the tax compared to the size of the economythat is by assessing corporate tax revenue as percent of gross

ul as rough indicators of how the level of corporate taxes in the economy has changed but lack precision in showing the burden of corporate taxes and the causes of the taxes fluctuations for example decline in the share of national income comprising corporate profits is partly responsible for the reductions shown in figures 1 and 2 figure 3 corrects for this with series that holds profits constant it shows average effective corporate tax rates aetrs which are the ratio of federal corporate income taxes to beforetax corporate profits according to the aetrs the aggregate burden of corporate taxes steadily declined during the 1960s and 1970s reaching low of about 20 of corporate profits during the early 1980s before rising to plateau of around 25 that has generally prevailed from 1986 to the present the anomalous year in the last two decades was 2000 which registered spike in the aetr to 34 since aetrs hold the level of corporate profits constant principal determinant of variations in the rates is legislated changes and several can be linked to the fluctuations in the aetrs at least three factors are likely responsible for the decline in rates during the 1960s 1970s and early 1980s first during the 1970s and 1980s several reductions in the statutory corporate tax rate that applies to taxable income were enacted second while taxable corporate profits were artificially inflated during the 1970s by rising price level firms were also permitted to claim investment

accelerated depreciation deductions which likely played prominent role in the sharp drop in tax rates in the early 1980s following the reduction rates increased again in the mid1980s part of the increase was likely due to timing results from the 1981 act but the tax reform act of 1986 was also likely responsible for part of the increase the act reduced statutory tax rates but also repealed the investment credit and scaled back depreciation allowances aetrs have their own shortcoming as gauge of the corporate tax burden they provide only oneyear snapshots of firms tax burden while according to economic theory taxes impose burden on capital income by reducing the expected rate of return over the life of new investment for example the tax burden on an investment consists not only of taxes paid in its first year but also those paid in say the fifth year of its life in addition because of discounting the tax burden on investment depends partly on how taxes are distributed over an investments life given amount of taxes matters more to firm the sooner it is paid the same is true of deductions but in reverse given deduction is more valuable the sooner it is claimed marginal effective tax rates metrs take these factors into account measuring the impact of taxes over representative investments entire lifetime as well as the timing of payments and deductions unlike aetrs metrs can thus accurately register the impact of provisions such as accelerated depreciation whose value depends crucially on timing metrs also take into account the interaction of inflation and tax rules statutory tax rates and investment subsidies such as the investment tax credit in general marginal effective tax rate is the difference between the pre tax and aftertax return on prospective investment divided by the pretax return 5 figure 4 below presents set of metrs for the period 1953 through 2003 the top line in the figure shows metrs for corporate investment the second line is rates for noncorporate business and moves in tandem with corporate rates but at lower level the third line is the metr for the remaining broad category of ca pital investment owneroccupied housing the series shows decline in rates from the early 1950s to the mid1960sthe result of accelerated depreciation introduction of an investment tax credit and reduced statutory tax rates rates then rose in the late 1960s and varied during the 1970s consequence of repeal and reintroduction of the investment tax credit as well as inflation rates declined sharply in 1981 reflecting the economic recovery tax acts accelerated depreciation provisions metrs then remained relatively stable until 2001 to 2003 when reductions in shareholderlevel taxes including reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividends as well as bonus depreciation caused reduction in effective rates rates picked up again in 2005 with the expiration of bonus depreciation 6 5 more precisely metrs begin by assuming that investments must earn particular return after taxes in order to attract funds from savers the metr calculation then works backwards and derives pretax return investments must earn in order to generate the aftertax return required by savers the difference between the pretax and aftertax returns is sometimes referred to as the tax wedge an investments metr consists of the tax wedge divided by the pretax return 6 for discussion of factors underlying the variation in metrs see crs report rs21706 historical effective marginal tax rates on capital income by jane g gravelle

taxes as share of gdp corporate tax revenues as percentage of federal revenue average effective corporate tax rates and marginal effective tax rates each series shows the same general pattern in the period after world war ii general decline in the level of corporate taxes but before accepting this broad pattern as the conclusion of this look at corporate tax data note the relative position of the three lines in figure 4 denoting metrs for corporate investment for noncorporate business and for owneroccupied housing in contrast to the general direction of each set of metrsthey have all declined showing decline in capital taxes in generaltheir relative position has remained the same and importantly it is the relative tax treatment of investment that affects the allocation of investment among different uses and differences in the treatment of different investments that distort the allocation of capital thus to the conclusion that business taxes have generally declined in the postworld war ii period there is an additional important result corporate investment remains relatively heavily taxed compared to noncorporate business and especially owneroccupied housing 7 the reports next section explores the implications of this result by discussing the economic effects of business taxes 7 tax distortions among assets also pers ist within the corporate sector while di fferential treatment of assets declined under the tax reform act of 1986 subsequent changes in law have reintroduced significant differences in the treatment of equipment structures and inventories with

in general is income from capital investment it is thus not surprising that business taxes exert their most direct effects through their impact on the return to new investment by reducing the return to capital investment business taxesat least in principlecan affect the economys commitment of resources to capital formation in general although this effect may be muted business taxes can also affect the allocation of investment funds among different sectors as suggested at the end of the preceding section and while businesses are not people the burden of business taxes is ultimately borne by individuals business taxes thus have an impact on the fairness of the tax system

taxes can potentially reduce the economys overall level of investment and its stock of capital there are indeed some who advocate cutting business taxes as means of boosting capital formation according to economic theory an increase in the capital stock boosts long run growth which in turn increases living standards and per capita income in the future 8 yet business taxes do not necessarily have pronounced effect on the aggregate level of capital in the economy key element is the economys supply of saving and there are indications that individual savers may not respond robustly to tax cuts by increasing their saving note first however that business taxes do likely have an impact on firms investment demand taxes on business profits increase the rate of return given asset must earn before taxes in order to generate the rate of return required to attract funds from savers tax on business investment thus encourages firms to forgo range of less profitable investments they might otherwise undertake and indeed as described below uneven application of business taxes results in less investment in heavily taxed areas and more investment in lightly taxed projects but investment demand is just one side of the market for capital the other side is household saving and if individual saving is unresponsive to changes in the aftertax rate of return then changes in investment demand will have little impact on the overall stock of capital boosts in demand will principally serve to increase the economys real interest rate for example provision of tax credit for businesses to undertake investment may indeed boost business demand for the particular type of investment in question and firms may boost the rate of return they are willing to pay savers for each quantity of investment but unless savers are willing to increase the quantity of funds they supply in response to the higher return there will be increase in the capital stock continued income tax revisions and effective tax rates by jane g gravelle see also us congressional budget office taxing capital income effective rates and approaches to reform washington gpo 2005 p 8 8 some economists have concluded that the distortions from taxing capital are so great that the optimal tax on capital from the point of view of economic efficiency and welfare is zero acceptance of this analysis even in principle requires particular theoretical construct that includes for example an assumption that individuals have infinitely lived time horizons but even if this an alysis is accepted it does not necessarily recommend repeal of capital income taxation for number of reasons the unresponsiveness of saving may reduce any distortions any tax that replaces tax on capital likely has its own distortions and the transition costs of moving to an alternative tax may be costly enough to offset any benefit

responds to its rate of return after taxes and is subject to countervailing effects in isolation tax on investment incomethat is on savingreduces the price of current consumption compared to future consumption and may thus reduce saving on the other hand tax on saving increases the amount of saving an individual must undertake before taxes in order to achieve particular dollar amount after taxes and may thus increase saving the answer to the question therefore depends on the empirical evidence and while there have been numerous econometric studies of saving their results differ 9 this has led some to suggest that instead of providing tax incentives for saving and investment more certain approach to boosting aggregate na tional saving would be reducing government dis saving by reducing the governments budget deficit10 g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g561g22g138g161g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g7g143g143g146g140g146g142g151g140g162g561 not only does the amount of capital matter for economic performance but so too does how that capital is employed and while business taxes likely have little impact on longrun growth and capital formation they do affect the allocation of investment among different uses and thus affect economic efficiency because taxes affect investment demand they distort the allocation of investment where they apply unevenly channeling funds to taxfavored assets and away from more heavily taxed assets the results for economic efficiency follow economic theory indicates that undistorted market prices and investment returns generally allocate resources to their most productive use so that capital and other resources produce the mix of output that consumers value most and economic welfare is maximized to the extent business taxes distort the allocation of resources they reduce economic welfare one prominent distortion posed by the us tax system results from the doubletaxation of corporatesource equity incomeits taxation under both the corporate income tax and the individual income tax as result investment is channeled away from the corporate sector into less heavily taxed areas such as owneroccupied housing and noncorporate business see the effective tax rates in figure 4 above second distortion posed by the corporate income tax is its favoring of debt over equity in the financing of investment the return to debtfinanced investment consists of corporate interest payments to creditors the return to equity consists of dividends and capital gains since interest is taxdeductible at the corporate level but dividends and capital gains are not firms are encouraged to use higher levels of debt than they otherwise would increasing the risk of bankruptcy to an inefficiently high level different types of business assets are also taxed at different rates encouraging firms to invest more heavily in favored assets than they otherwise would the depreciation allowances that apply to machines and equipment are relatively generous compared to depreciation allowances for structures and capitalrecovery methods for inventory leading to relatively light tax burden for machines and equipment thus firms asset choices are distorted encouraging more investment in machines and equipment and less in structures and inventory than is economically efficient 9 for thorough survey of the empirical studies that have been conducted see b douglas bernheim taxation and saving handbook of public economics vol 3 alan j auerbach and martin feldstein eds amsterdam elsevier 2002 pp 11731249 note also that while investment incentives may not result in additional domestic saving they may attract foreign capital into the domestic economy the return to foreign capital however does not accrue to domestic residents 10 for textbook presentation of this argument see andrew b abel and ben s bernanke macroeconomics 3rd ed reading ma addisonwesley 1998 p 210

burdens among assets were substantiala consequence of relatively high statutory tax rate relatively high inflation uneven depreciation rules and the availability of an investment tax credit for equipment but not other assets the 1986 act altered depreciation rules repealed the investment credit and reduced the statutory corporate tax rate thereby greatly diminishing interasset distortions in recent years however both legislation and economic developments have reintroduced differential tax burdens though not to the extent existent before 1986 legislative changes included introduction of less favorable depreciation for structures bonus depreciation for equipment and an increased statutory tax rate11 as noted above the corporate income tax distorts corporate financial policy favoring debt finance another distortion of corporate financia l policy results from individual rather than corporate income taxation and the preferential treatment of capital gains specifically since capital gains are not subject to individual income taxes until stockholder sells stock and the gains are realized taxes favor the corporate retention of earningswhich increases the value of corporate stockover payout of dividends recent legislation has reduced the statutory tax rate on dividends to the same rate applicable to realized capital gains which has reduced the difference between the effective tax rates of retentions and payouts nonetheless difference remains because capital gains are not taxed until realized while dividends are taxed on current basis

incorporation thus corporations cannot bear the burden of the corporate income tax in any real sense it ultimately is borne by individuals in the short runthat is before economic actors have had chance to adjust to the taxthe tax is thought to be borne by corporate stockholders the longrun burden of the tax is more uncertain the standard and most resilient economic model of the corporate income tax is that developed by arnold harberger in 1962 12 while number of challenges have been made to the model since its inception its results have generally proved resilient13 the model concludes that if capital investment funds and labor are free to flow from one economic sector eg the corporate sector to another and given certain other conditions then wages prices rates of return and the allocation of capital and labor adjust in the long run to the corporate income tax given the ability of economic actors to adjust the burden of the corporate income tax spreads beyond corporate shareholders sector to all owners of capital including owners of corporate debt non corporate business and owneroccupied housing this picture of the longrun burden of the corporate tax has implications for the vertical equity of the tax systemthat is its distribution across income classes because capital ownership is greater at upperincome levels the corporate income tax is itself progressive and makes the overall tax system more progressive than it would otherwise be 11 jane g gravelle the corporate tax where has it been and where is it going national tax journal vol 57 dec

taxation is to improve us competitiveness where competitiveness is usually loosely defined term generally meaning the ability of us firms to compete with foreign businesses whether by means of export sales or sales by us firms who have invested abroad yet there are few areas in which economic theory and popular beliefs diverge more widely than in international economics and notions of competitiveness given the prominence of competitiveness in the public debate it is thus useful to examine the international dimension of business taxes effects in some detail

tradethat is the imposition of federal taxes on business profits does not increase the us trade deficit by reducing us exports or increasing imports this conclusion may counter intuition at firstsurely the imposition of tax on the profits of us exporting firm will reduce its sales to foreigners and thus reduce aggregate us exports but economic theorys rebuttal is equally intuitive just as an individual cannot consume more than he earns unless he borrows country cannot use more than it producescannot import more than it exportsunless it borrows to finance the difference by importing foreign investment thus country can only increase its trade deficit if it imports some additional amount of foreign investment countrys net exports only increase if its net overseas investment also increases 14 in slightly more technical terms countrys balance of trade its balance on goods and services mirrors its balance on capital account the balance of trade changes only if the balance on capital account likewise changes this relationship is an identity that holds whether or not the international economy is in equilibrium the particular economic mechanism that enforces the identity under the current regime of flexible exchange rates is exchange rate adjustments even if change in an exogenous variable eg taxes would otherwise increase net exports exchange rates adjust to offset any change that would otherwise occur the implication of this analysis is that business taxes alter the balance of trade only if they also alter net flows of international investment the balance on capital account as an illustration the united states recently repealed tax benefit for exporting known as the extraterritorial income eti benefit while some observers feared that etis repeal would harm us competitiveness economic theory indicates its repeal will have direct impact on the balance of trade while some reduction of exports may initially occur that reduction will stimulate fall in the price of the dollar in currency markets below what would otherwise occur the dollars depreciation will mitigate the initial decline in exports and will also reduce imports there will be change in the trade balance exports minus imports 14 note however that countrys general fiscal position can alter the trade balance for example if country increases its governments budget deficit real interest rates may rise leading to an inflow of foreign capital and an expansion of its trade deficit thus to the extent business taxes contribute to total government revenue and the governments overall fiscal stance they can be said to have an impact on the trade deficit in this sense however they are indistinguishable from other taxes

affect the composition of its trade this outcome follows from one of the foundations of economic trade theorythe theory of comparative advantage according to this theory the composition of countrys exports and imports is determined not by how the costs of domestic goods compare to those of foreign goods but rather by how the costs of domestic goods compare to each other under comparative advantage country exports what it can produce at lowest cost the particular composition of its exports and imports thus depends on the particular pattern of costs across all of its products and potential products business taxes can alter this pattern of costs and thus alter the content of trade for example if taxes apply heavily to one item and fall lightly on another they encourage the import of the first product and the export of the second but if business taxes cannot increase net exports and can only change the pattern of trade this is not necessarily bad news standard economic trade theory indicates that countries gain economic welfare by exchanging exports for imports th exchange enables each trading country to specialize in producing what it produces most efficiently while not sacrificing its use of the highercost goods that it imports in short countrys economic welfare is not enhanced by the mere act of exporting it is the ability to exchange exports for imports that makes country better off that produces gains from trade in economic parlance taxes can reduce economic welfare through their impact on trade in number of ways one is reduction in economic efficiency similar to those described in preceding section but translated to the international economy if taxes apply unevenly they may distort the pattern of costs within the economy and distort the composition of trade thus encouraging country to specialize in activities at which it is relatively inefficient second way taxes can reduce countrys economic welfare is to worsen its terms of trade or the quantity in real terms of exports it must give up to obtain given quantity of imports for example if part of the benefit of an export subsidy eg eti is passed on to foreign consumers in the form of lower prices the subsidy worsens the subsidizing countrys terms of trade its exports are cheaper for foreign consumers the subsidizing countrys economic welfare is reduced because its own taxpayers are underwriting the price reduction for foreign consumers

direct impact on the extent to which us firms invest abroad and also the extent to which foreign firms invest in the united states here the crucial factor is how taxes both us and foreign on an investment in foreign location compare to taxes on an identical investment undertaken in the united states to the extent taxes in the foreign location are lower than those on the us project taxes encourage overseas investment to the extent us taxes are low relative to taxes on the overseas investment they encourage domestic over foreign investment if taxes are the same in either location they have impact are neutral towards on location choice according to traditional economic theory taxes best promote economic efficiency by not distorting the location of investment neutrality between overseas and domestic investment best promotes efficiency but the overall impact of th us system is uncertain as described above the united states in some situations taxes the overseas income of its firms on current basis while in other instances it permits an indefinite deferral of taxes on foreignsource income foreign tax credits are provided to alleviate double taxation the net result of this system for the relative tax burden on foreign and domestic investment is mixed the system produces patchwork of incentives disincentives and neutrality towards overseas investment that varies

taxationa separate tax on corporate profits imposed in addition to the individual income tax and net of interest and taxation of unincorporated business on current basis under the individual income tax the reports section on business tax data indicated that while the level of business taxes has generally declined since world war ii important divergences remain in the way different types of investment are taxed the section on economic effects indicated that these effects can impair economic efficiency although they likely do not hinder us competitiveness with these pictures in mind the report now turns to the principal options for reform that have been developed for business tax policy

legal entities and not people the question might be raised why impose separate corporate income tax at all the question is made more pointed when the detrimental efficiency effects of separate tax on corporate income are consideredeffects such as the diversion of investment away from equity investment in the corporate sector number of arguments however can be mounted in favor of separate tax on corporate income first since stock ownership in particular and ownership of capital in general is more prevalent among upperincome individuals the corporate income tax adds an element of progressivity to the tax system its repealabsent compensating changes elsewhere in the systemwould be in isolation regressive policy change second corporate managers may be able to exercise considerable independence from stockholders in their decisions about corporate investment to the extent this occurs corporations do have some existence separate from their stockholders third without corporate income tax or tax integration plan as outlined below retained corporate earnings would receive favorable tax treatment and finally even if corporations are not people and have existence separate from their stockholders many individual taxpayers nonetheless compare the taxes they pay with those paid by large corporations and draw conclusions about fairness from that comparison and even if such comparisons from an economic standpoint are not appropriate they do affect perceptions about the fairness of the tax systemperceptions that are important to the acceptance of the tax system by the public at large while the current system does tax corporations as though they were separate entities it does not do so on comprehensive basis numerous importa nt omissions from the tax base would exist if all corporate profits were taxed on the same basis thus if the validity of separate corporate income tax is accepted one hypothetical direction that tax reform might take is to move in the direction of more pure version of the classical system of taxing corporate incometo eliminate the various omissions in the tax base and nonneutralities embedded in the current system setting aside the distortions that result fro m the existence of the corporate income tax in the first place such reform would likely minimize the inefficiencies and distortions that exist within the classical system as noted at the outse t of the report such was guiding principle of the tax reform act of 1986

on corporate income one considerable departure is the omission of income from debtfinanced investment from the tax basean omission that occurs when interest payments are deducted income generated by debt financed investment is income from capital just as surely as is income from equity investment debts omission from the tax base distorts firms financing choices favoring debt over equity and enticing firms to accept higher risk of bankruptcy than is economically efficient nonetheless simple elimination of interest deductibility has rarely been proposed outside of movement away from the classical system by adoption for example of tax integration discussed below 15 another important determinant of the corporate tax base is depreciation one important element of the 1986 acts reform was its eveningout of depreciation allowances across assets the act implemented depreciation allowances that were more closely aligned with actual economic depreciation together with the acts repeal of th investment tax credit the depreciation revisions reduced prior laws general preference for equipment and relatively shortlived assets over structures since 1986 however wedge has r eemerged between equipment and structures althoughsetting aside the temporary bonus depreciation for equipmentthis has been more consequence of changed economic conditions reduced inflation and lengthening of depreciation allowances for structures than reintroduction of accelerated depreciation 16 nonetheless likely ingredient of tax reform based on comprehensive income taxation would be realignment of depreciation allowances with economic depreciation another prominent departure from comprehensive taxation is the deduction for domestic production that was enacted by the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108359 the deduction is 9 of income from domestic production activities it cannot be applied to income from overseas investment other omissions from the tax base are more narrowly targeted tax benefitsfor example the section 179 expensing allowance from equipment investment of small businesses the tax credit for research and experimentation and various provisions applicable to the oil and gas industry the joint committee on taxation jct maintains list of tax expenditures or provisions that carve out special tax treatment for particular activities income or investments relatively comprehensive list of omissions from the corporate tax base can be obtained by consulting the jct list 17 tax reform that moves in the direction of comprehensive income taxation would presumably scale back items included in the list of tax expenditures g5g152g155g153g152g155g138g157g142g561g22g138g161g561g11g151g157g142g144g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 as described above in the section on the economic effects of business taxation the current classical system of taxing corporate income results in number of distortions in the allocation of investment thus reducing economic efficiency and causing concomitant reduction in economic welfare for this reason economists have long advocated some form of tax 15 for example even the initial more theoretically pure treasury department proposals that preceded the 1986 tax reform act stopped short of straightforward taxation of the return to debt 16 for estimates of disparities in tax burdens across assets under current law see crs report

of corporate income by altering the general system of taxing corporatesource income integration proposals vary but fall into two broad categories those that apply to both retained earnings and dividends and thus all corporate profits full integration and those that change the treatment only of earnings that are distributed partial integration there are three basic approaches to full integration which differ in whether double taxation is removed at the corporate level or at the individual level the shareholder allocation method is similar to partnership taxation the corporate income tax would be repealed and corporate profitswhether retained or distributedwould be allocated among the firms owners who would pay individual income taxes on the corporate income thus corporate income would be taxed once in the hands of individuals second approach is shareholder credit integration under which the corporate income tax would be retained but corporate stockholders would receive tax credit for the corporatelevel taxes paid by the paying corporation an adjustment to the capital gains portion of the credit would be made to account for the capital gains resulting from both retained earnings that have been subject to the corporate income tax and other price appreciation under this approach while relief would be provided at the individual level taxes would be paid on the corporate income tax at individual income tax rates thus the co rporate income tax would function much like withholding tax third approach is to retain the corporate income tax but exclude corporatesource income from individual income taxesa relatively simple method to implement for distributed earnings but difficult to administer for the portion of capital gains attributable to reinvested earnings in the latter case stockholders basis in stock would have to be adjusted to reflect retained earnings so as to exclude only gains attributable to retained earnings in 1992 us treasury report outlined variant of this method termed comprehensive business income tax cbit under which corporatesource income would not be taxed at the individual level the corporate income tax would be retained and interest deductions would not be permitted partial integration by means of an exclusion for dividends received by stockholders would thus be relatively straightforward indeed the reduced individual income tax rate that the jobs and growth tax relief act of 2003 jgtrra applied to dividend income can be viewed as form of shareholderlevel partial integration akin to sh areholder exclusion that applies to only part of received dividends similarly shareholdercredit version of integration that would be restricted to dividends paid would be more straightforwar d than the fullintegration version of credit system partialintegration form of the shareholder credit method is the system used most frequently by european and other foreign countries that have adopted integration each method of integration has its particular advantages and disadvantages as suggested in the preceding discussion partial integration is simpler and easier to administer than full integration on the other hand it does not achieve all the efficiency gains under full integration since part of corporate income would still be taxed twice also the different plans differ in their revenue cost with the fullintegration methods generally losing more revenue than partial integration plans and shareholder allocation methods reducing revenue more than other methods 18 18 for more

relatively consistent concept of income in popular discussions however the term fundamental tax reform has frequently referred to different type of tax change replacing the current federal individual and corporate income taxes with system that taxes consumption but exempts saving most taxonomies list three basic types of nationallevel consumption taxes valueadded taxes national sales tax and tax on individuals consumed income in addition prominent flat tax proposal would consist of form of valueadded tax imposed at the corporate level and wage tax at the individual level the different forms of consumption taxes differ chiefly in their methods of collection and as result their ease of administration and compliance costs their general effect on business taxes however would be the same

be imposed on final sales from businesses to consumers businesses would collect the tax and remit it to the government in general businesstobusiness sales sales of intermediate goods would be exempt from the tax the levy would be applied to imports but exported goods would be exempt to the extent that business inputs are included in the base of national sales tax the product to which they contribute would be subject to multiple layers of tax such cascading would carry the potential of inefficient distortions diverting resources away from the heavily taxed products accordingly an important task under nationa l sales tax would be distinguishing between business and nonbusiness uses of purchased items so as to exempt the former and tax the latter one possible method of doing so would be to issue exemption certificates to businesses so as to remove their purchases from the tax base nonetheless making the distinction would likely present significant administrative and compliance problems particularly in the case of items that lend themselves to both business and personal use eg many services compliance might also present problem given the high tax rate that would likely be necessary to avoid revenue loss if income taxes were abolished 19 g24g138g149g158g142g556g3g141g141g142g141g561g22g138g161g561g138g151g141g561g515g8g149g138g157g516g561g22g138g161g561 as the

at on an item is the same as that of sales tax assuming each is applied uniformly there are two general methods by which v ts are administered creditinvoice and subtraction under creditinvoice method business is assessed v at on its gross receipts regardless of whether its sales are made to another business or to final consumer at the same time the firms from which it has purchased its inputs provide it with invoices showing the v at the suppliers have already paid with respect to the inputs the purchasing firm claims the v t shown on the invoice as credit against the v at on its own sales as result for each firm the v at applies only to value added under subtractionmethod v t tax is levied on firms gross receipts after subtracting purchases from other firms what is left then as the base of the tax is the return to capital profits and the return to labor wagesthe value added by the taxed firm despite the difference in administration subtractionmethod v t and creditinvoice v at produce the same tax assuming they are levied at the same rate it should also be noted that as with sales tax each is levied on imports but exports are not included in taxable gross receipts in the case of the creditinvoice method an exporting firm receives tax rebate for taxes paid with respect to its inputs variation on the subtractionmethod v at is the socalled flat taxsometimes termed the hallrabushka proposal after its designers under the flat tax subtractionmethod v at would be imposed on businessthat is firms would pay tax on gross receipts minus items purchased from other firms in contrast to pure v t however firms would also be permitted to subtract wages from gross income thus removing from the businesslevel tax base that portion of the firms valueadded contributed by labor individuals however would be assessed tax on wages received thus bringing the value added by labor back into the tax base albeit at the individual level by the final stage of production the cumulative rate of v at on an item is the same as that of sales tax assuming neither contains special allowances and benefits thus their broad economic effects are the same but since the two types of tax differ in how they are collected there are differences in compliance and ease of administration v at would impose higher compliance burden on businesses in general than retail sales tax under v t every business would be required to file tax return not just businesses in the retail sector at the same time v t avoids the administrative problem of distinguishing business use of items from personal use further some analysts have argued that small businesses would likely encounter high compliance costs under national sales tax and small businesses are relatively numerous in the retail sector thus compliance rates may be higher under v t g5g152g151g156g158g150g142g141g561g11g151g140g152g150g142g561g22g138g161g561 third type of consumption tax is tax on consumed income imposed at the individual rather than business level individual income consists of consumption plus saving thus individuals would calculate their tax by subtracting saving from their income and paying tax on the residual business investments made by individuals would be characterized as saving and thus an exempt use of income thus for example an individuals purchases of stock would be deducted from taxable income as would say the purchase of new machine by small business owner note that an individual consumption tax is defined in terms of the uses of income rather than its source thus it is business investment that is deductible rather than income generated by businesses however arithmetic dictates that deducting the cost of capital investment at the time it is made expensing the investment produces tax saving that is identical in presentvalue terms to

income that is saved which is the equivalent of exempting investment income in short under any form of pure consumption taxbe it sales tax v t or an individual consumption taxbu siness profits are ultimately exempt from tax as result if it is assumed that consumption tax would not contain its own preferences for special goods or services an assumption that is perhaps heroic the various nonneutralities existing under the current system of business taxation would be eliminated as described in the preceding section on economic efficiency these in clude current laws preference of noncorporate investment over the corporate sector of corporate debt over equity and of machines and equipment over inventory and structures if these nonneutralities were eliminated under consumption tax business investmentespecially corporate investmentcould be expected to increase under consumption tax as well as equity finance and investment in assets other than equipment economic efficiency could potentially increase it is worth underlining however that it is not the taxation of capital per that produces these nonneutralities but the particular shape of capital income taxation that has gradually come into being in the current system under consumption tax nonneutralities affecting business might be implemented in different way but the result might still be distortions in the allocation in business investment for example sales tax or v at might exempt particular type of good from taxation which would favor investment in the sector producing that type of good the transition to consumption tax would likely include significant effects in the short and medium term perhaps most importantly consumption tax would exempt the return to new investment but would still apply to income prod uced by investment in place at the time of the taxs implementation note that under none of the types of consumption taxes outlined above would firm be able to continue to recover the cost of capital in place at the time of transition either through depreciation or other deductions at the same time revenue produced by old investments would be included in the tax base producing windfall loss for owners of existing capital firms affected most heavily by the taxation of old capital would be older slowgrowing firms also if uniform consumption tax were adopted and existing business distortions were consequently eliminated as described above transition effects would include shift of resources away from previously favored investment for example business sectors where corporate production is intensive would benefit as would firms with low debttoequity ratios and production processes favoring machines and equipment over structures 20 frequently made popular argument for consumption tax relates to its purported beneficial effects on competitiveness as described above under the heading taxes and trade economic theory indicates taxes have little impact on competitiveness as it is popularly understood however specific argument relating to border tax adjustments is frequently made in support of consumption taxes so the argument is worth describing here

countries receive rebate of the v at on exports to the united states and elsewhere thus it is argued foreign firms from v at countries have cost advantage over competing us firms as described in the

the level of the corporate tax has generally fallen in the decades since world war ii the basic structure has remained the same classical system under which the corporate income tax is superimposed on the individual income tax in 1986 the farreaching tax reform act implemented reforms within the context of the existing system broadening its base and reducing rates in recent years however concern about the impact of the system on capital formation and us performance in international markets has stimulated interest in more substantial structural change either by adopting tax integration or moving towards consumption tax g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 donald j marples specialist in public finance dmarplescrslocgov
