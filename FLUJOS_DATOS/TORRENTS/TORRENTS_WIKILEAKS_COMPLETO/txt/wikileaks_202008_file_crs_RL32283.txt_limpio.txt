the first quarter of 2005 the full 600 is available the amount drops to 450 for applications received in the second quarter 300 for those received in the third quarter and 150 for those received in the fourth quarter cms has clarified that any assistance received under the transitional assistance program will not affect eligibility or amount of assistance under any other federal program4 transition assistance payments are to be applied only toward the costs of covered discount card drugs ie all drugs that could be covered under card program if there were formulary limitations this includes any drug obtained through the sponsors endorsed program the drug is covered whether or not it is on or off the formulary if any and regardless of whether or not discount has been negotiated for that drug transitional assistance individuals are required to pay coinsurance charges beneficiaries with incomes under 100 of poverty are liable for coinsurance charges of 5 of the drugs price those with incomes between 100 and 135 of poverty are liable for coinsurance charges of 10 of the price pharmacies are permitted to waive these coinsurance charges however they can not do so routinely nor can they advertise the fact any transitional assistance remaining at the end of 2004 can be rolled over into 2005 any amount remaining at the end of 2005 can be rolled over into the individuals transition period if any at the start of 2006 these rollover provisions only apply if the individual remains in the same endorsed card program changes the program during the annual coordinated election period in 2004 for 2005 or is eligible for special election period and changes card enrollment during such period see enrollment below cms will reimburse endorsed sponsors for any

pharmacy benefit management companies pbms wholesale or retail pharmacy delivery systems and insurers service area card programs are required to meet certain requirements with respect to service areas service areas must cover one or more states the sponsors program must be available to all eligible individuals residing in such states it should be noted that the statewide requirement does not apply to medicare managed care plans offering exclusive card programs see discussion below medicare endorsement cms solicited applications from entities seeking to become endorsed sponsors the law permits the agency to limit the number of endorsed sponsors in state to two however the agency noted in the preamble to the interim final rule that it intended to endorse all applicants that together with their subcontractors and other entities with which they have entered into legal arrangement meet or exceed the requirements for endorsement applicants meeting the requirements will enter into contract with cms they will be able to use medicareendorsed prescription drug card emblem card sponsors will not be able to begin enrollment activities until they have completed certain activities including finalizing pharmacy network contracts negotiating manufacturer rebates or discounts entering into all subcontracts necessary to assure full compliance with the conditions of endorsement and obtaining cms approval of information and outreach materials enrollment in an endorsed plan enrollment process enrollment in the card program is voluntary individuals must first select the card program they wish to enroll in they will then complete standard enrollment form and submit it to the selected sponsor if they crs5 are applying for transitional assistance they will need to certify under penalty of perjury that the income information they are providing is accurate an endorsed sponsor cannot enroll medicare beneficiary in its program until cms verifies the beneficiarys eligibility if beneficiary has applied for both the card program and transitional assistance and is determined eligible for the card program but not transitional assistance heshe has the option of deciding whether or not to enroll in the card program cms will verify that the applicant meets the eligibility requirements including income eligibility requirements in the case of transitional assistance every beneficiary determined ineligible for the program andor transitional assistance can request reconsideration of the decision an individual can only be enrolled in one endorsed card program at time an individual enrolling in 2004 may change the election for 2005 during the annual coordinated election period november 15 2004december 31 2004 an individual may voluntarily disenroll at any time in general an individual who disenrolls in 2004 must wait until the annual coordinated election period to enroll in another plan for 2005 in general an individual who disenrolls in 2005 will longer be eligible however under certain circumstances individuals who disenroll from program will be entitled to special enrollment period during which they can change their card enrollment the special enrollment period will apply for persons who move out of the service area of the card sponsor change residence to or from longterm care facility enroll in or disenroll from medicare managed care plan or are in plan which terminates or is terminated person eligible for transitional assistance who disenrolls other than for one of these specified reasons forfeits any remaining transitional assistance for the year cms suggests that beneficiaries planning to change residence during the year should enroll in national program it should be noted that while beneficiaries can only enroll in one endorsed program at time they may enroll in other card programs which are not medicare endorsed programs enrollment fees sponsors may charge uniform annual enrollment fee not to exceed 30 card sponsors must assure that enrollees are not charged any additional fees for products and services inside the scope of the endorsement products and services inside the scope of sponsors discount care program would include covered discount drugs as well as discounted nonprescription drugs enrollees will pay the fee directly to the card sponsor cms will pay the fee for persons receiving transitional assistance states may pay some or all of the enrollment fees for some or all persons not eligible for transitional assistance payments are to be made directly to the sponsor states may also pay some of the coinsurance amounts for transitional assistance enrollees federal matching payments would be available for these expenditures crs6 program design covered discount card drugs covered discount card drugs are defined as virtually all recognized prescription drugs however an individual plan does not have to include all drugs on its formulary see below and not all formulary drugs have to be discounted individuals will select card program based on which program will offer the discounted drugs they expect to use specifically covered discount card drugs are defined in the law as prescription drugs and biologicals covered under medicaid vaccines licensed under section 351 of the public health service act and insulin necessary supplies associated with the injection of insulin are also included syringes needles alcohol swabs and gauze meet the definition while test strips or lancets do not the definition of covered discount drugs includes drugs when they are used for medically accepted indication in general this means the use is approved under the federal food drug and cosmetic act or the use of which is supported by one or more recognized compendia specifically excluded from the definition of covered discount card drugs are drugs excluded under medicaid except for smoking cessation thus the following categories are specifically excluded 1 agents when used for anorexia weight loss or weight gain 2 agents when used to promote fertility 3 agents when used for cosmetic purposes or hair growth 4 agents when used for the symptomatic relief of coughs and colds 5 prescription vitamins and mineral products except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations 6 nonprescription drugs5 7 outpatient prescription drugs for which the manufacturer seeks to require associated tests or monitoring services be purchased exclusively from the manufacturer or its designee as condition of sale 8 barbiturates and 9 benzodiazepines central nervous system depressants additionally drugs which would otherwise be covered under the card program are not covered if they can be covered under medicare part in connection with covered inpatient services or under part b which provides coverage for limited categories of outpatient prescription drugs including drugs which cannot be self administered immunosuppressive drugs under certain circumstances and some oncology drugs formularies endorsed card programs may use formularies for purposes of the card program formulary is defined as the list of specific drugs from among covered discount card drugs for which an endorsed sponsor offers negotiated prices to medicare beneficiaries enrolled in its card program cms expects that allowing sponsors to use formularies will result in deeper discounts for card enrollees and enhanced use of generic drugs in the interim final regulation cms stated that it wanted sponsors when constructing their formularies to include at minimum the types of drugs commonly needed by beneficiaries both aged and disabled it developed list of therapeutic classes and subclasses for medications frequently used 5 however mma allows sponsors to offer discounts on nonprescription drugs through their discount card program crs7 by medicare beneficiaries at minimum card programs will be required to offer negotiated price for at least one drug in each of the 209 categories identified in the list drug can be used only once to satisfy this requirement further sponsors must provide at least one generic drug for negotiated price in at least 55 of the required categories cms indicated that there are several key issues applicants should consider in developing their formularies these are 1 evaluation of whether some drugs not widely recommended for use in the elderly but appropriate in individual cases should be included in the formulary 2 importance of assuring discounted prices are available to special populations for the specific medication combinations they require for example for those persons who are hiv positive or those with mental illness and 3 ensuring that there are appropriate selections and dosage forms within each class or subclass for example longacting versus short acting pricing negotiated prices price concessions card sponsors are required to provide beneficiaries access to negotiated prices as condition of endorsement sponsors must obtain discounts rebates subsidies or other price concessions on at least some covered discount card drugs any such price concessions obtained by endorsed sponsors are to be taken into account in determining negotiated prices the interim final regulation requires that share of such price concessions should be passed along in the form of lower prices it does not specify what should constitute share the preamble to the regulation states that cms would not set minimum quantitative requirement either for the level of price concessions endorsed sponsors must obtain or the share of such concessions that must be passed along to card enrollees rather cms states that it will allow endorsed sponsors to determine this in light of their understanding of consumer preferences and the impact of market forces on their business model cms further notes that pbms frequently obtain and pass through substantial rebates for their commercial populations cms states that establishing minimum level for price concessions could potentially undercut market competition because manufacturers might tend to set their prices around the minimum level it states that the cms price comparison website will enable beneficiaries to compare maximum negotiated prices for drugs under different endorsed programs see discussion below price variation it is expected that the level of discounts offered to card enrollees will vary across the spectrum of drugs offered cms is also allowing sponsors to vary prices and formularies by enrollee characteristics for example lower prices could be offered to transitional eligible enrollees or enrollees with particular disease updates cms will allow pricing changes to be made its fact sheet on the program states that changes can be made on weekly basis however any increase in negotiated price is not allowed to exceed an amount proportionate to the change in the drugs average wholesale price andor an amount proportionate to the changes in the endorsed sponsors cost structure including any change in price concessions crs8 received an exception is provided for the week of november 15 2004 which coincides with the beginning of the annual enrollment period for 2005 guarantees information card sponsors are required to guarantee that network and mail order pharmacies provide the lower of the customary price or the negotiated price they are also required to guarantee that network pharmacy inform an enrollee at the point of sale of any difference between the price of prescribed drug and the lowest price covered generic drug that is therapeutically equivalent and bioequivalent and available at the pharmacy mail order pharmacies are required to provide the information at the time of delivery of the drug card sponsors are to synchronize changes in the list of and negotiated prices for drugs included in the formulary with those published on the cms price comparison website pharmacy network access the sponsor must contract with sufficient number of pharmacies other than mailorder in its service area to ensure that the following access requirements are met on average 90 of beneficiaries in urban areas are within two miles of network pharmacy urban areas are defined as zip codes with population density over 3000 persons per square mile on average 90 of beneficiaries in suburban areas are within five miles of network pharmacy suburban areas are defined as zip codes with population density between 1000 and 3000 persons per square mile on average 70 of beneficiaries in rural areas are within 15 miles of

department of defense under the tricare retail pharmacy program the sponsors network may be supplemented by mail order pharmacies other requirements information and outreach activities customer service sponsors will be required to provide specified information through the internet and some other tangible medium such as mailing to medicare beneficiaries the stated purpose is to promote

prior to distribution the crs9 sponsor must also maintain tollfree customer call center open during normal business hours transitional assistance card sponsors are required to administer transitional assistance funds received from cms for transitional assistance enrollees they are required to establish accounting procedures to manage the funds for each enrollee medical errors drug interactions an endorsed sponsor must provide system to reduce the likelihood of medical errors and adverse drug interactions and to improve medication use the preamble to the regulations states that sponsors have the flexibility to design their own individual systems however published scientific and clinical literature as well as the experience if any of the sponsor should support the proposed approaches grievance procedures sponsors are required to establish and maintain grievance process to handle card enrolleess complaint or dispute regarding the manner in which he or she has received services under the endorsed program the subject of grievance may include such items as timeliness appropriateness access to andor setting of services failure to offer discounts on particular drugs and

using or disclosing any individually identifiable information for marketing purposes following termination of the sponsorss endorsement or termination of the drug discount card program special endorsements special endorsement for managed care plans medicare managed care organization ie medicare advantage organization6 may apply to become an exclusive card sponsor by limiting drug card enrollment to eligible persons enrolled in any but not necessarily all of its managed care plans although many managed care plans already offer drug coverage not all do so and most offer limited coverage the discount card would be used in situations of coverage or limited coverage under the plans plans may limit their service area to the medicare managed care plans service area if the plan uses pharmacy network for its medicare managed care plan that network may be used for its endorsed program provided it is not limited to mail order pharmacies if the managed care plan does not use pharmacy network for its managed care plan the secretary must determine that the network for the card program provides sufficient access to covered discount card drugs at negotiated prices certain requirements otherwise applicable for drug card sponsors are deemed to be met or waived for medicare advantage plans exclusive card sponsors are required to apply transitional assistance funds only to the cost to transitional enrollees of any discount card drugs obtained from network or mail order pharmacy included in the sponsors pharmacy network the plan may wrap around the managed care plans

become special endorsement sponsor to provide transitional assistance to american indiansalaskan natives aians who use indian health service indian tribe and tribal organization and urban indian organization itu pharmacies8 the secretary is to select at least two of the best qualified applicants for special endorsement for each category certain requirements otherwise applicable for drug card sponsors are deemed to be met or waived for these plans territories residents of the territories including those receiving drug coverage under medicaid or section 1115 waivers are eligible for the endorsed drug card program9 however individuals in territories are not eligible for transitional assistance under the medicare drug discount card program instead territories choosing to provide lowincome assistance are required to submit plans to the secretary detailing how they intend to use their allotment totaling 35 million across the territories for the duration of the card program to provide such assistance to some or all medicare beneficiaries with incomes below 135 of poverty an applicant for endorsement may submit an application to become special endorsement sponsor for all of the territories to provide access to negotiated prices the secretary will select at least one qualified applicant the endorsed sponsor must provide access to negotiated prices 7 continued skilled nursing facilities and nursing facilities an estimated 72 of these individuals are eligible for both medicare and medicaid and will be ineligible for the card program if they have medicaid drug coverage cms estimates that up to 200000 of the remaining population could be eligible for transitional assistance approximately 3000 pharmacies serve the facilities residents provision of drug benefits is generally coordinated through the facility and may be specially packaged 8 cms estimates that there are approximately 87000 aians over the age of 65 and 20000 disabled enrollees using the services of the indian health service ihs of the total approximately 36000 are covered by medicaid an estimated 18000 may be eligible for transitional assistance there are 201 itu pharmacies in 27 states with eight states having 11 or more and three states having 20 or more cms reports that these pharmacies generally provide access to drugs off the federal supply schedule fss to aians cms states that the special endorsement provisions will provide an opportunity to provide prescriptions at the low fss rate coverage of costs would come in part from the ihs and in part from transitional assistance 9 cms reports that there are close to 600000 medicare beneficiaries in the territories with over 95 of those in puerto rico crs12 cms cost projections when cms issued the interim final regulations on the card program in december 2003 it provided estimates of the number of persons expected to enroll in the program and the associated costs beneficiaries as noted earlier not all persons eligible for the drug card program would elect to enroll10 some of these persons already have access to drug discounts either through their health insurance or through an existing card program further transitional assistance is not available for persons who have other drug coverage in december 2003 cms estimated that 154 million beneficiaries slightly over one third of the total would be both eligible for and could benefit from the discount card program it estimated that 73 million persons would enroll in an endorsed card program in 2004 and 74 million would enroll in 2005 of these it estimated that 47 million persons each year will be eligible for transitional assistance beneficiary savings attributable to lower negotiated prices were estimated to range from 14 to 18 billion in 2004 and 20 to 27 billion in 200511 this estimate was based on two main assumptions first the program would result in average drug savings of 1015 over costs that would be incurred in the absence of the card program12 second the effects of beneficiary education would lead to greater use of generic drugs and more effective management of expenses estimated beneficiary savings attributable to transitional assistance were 24 billion in 2004 and 26 billion in 2005 the savings estimates did not reflect the annual enrollment fees which can range up to 30 per year factoring in the enrollment fees could reduce estimated beneficiary savings by up to 80 million each year medicare program costs for persons eligible for transitional assistance are funded through general revenues which are credited to separate account in the medicare part b trust fund payments are made from this account cms estimated that medicare program spending would increase by 25 billion in cy2004 27 billion in cy2005 and 01 billion in cy2006 for those costs incurred during an individuals transition period the vast majority of these costs were associated with transitional assistance 10 cms notes that because 2004 is the first year of the program it does not have the benefit of prior experience it also notes number of limitations in the assumptions used in the impact analysis for example it is difficult to determine precisely how many persons will enroll in the program further the estimate does not assume any increase in utilization stemming from the drug program 11 cms estimates the 2004 aprdec savings at 088118 of total national aggregate drug spending in that period 2005 savings are estimated at 089118 of such spending 12 the cms estimate is based on the 15 figure crs13 24 billion in 2004 26 billion in cy2005 and 01 billion in 2006 with the remaining costs attributable to payment of enrollment fees for this population group in addition cms administrative expenses would total an estimated 134 million costs for sponsors card sponsors incur number of costs in setting up their programs these include activities related to program implementation information and outreach eligibility determination and enrollment processing customer service operations claims processing and claims adjudication account maintenance and logging and responding to grievances costs vary by sponsor though all must have had experience in running large programs cms estimated that sponsors with low costs would be able to recover their costs through enrollment fees in both 2004 and 2005 and would have sufficient revenue stream to carry them through the transition period for those with the highest costs enrollment revenues would not exceed such costs until 2005 though they might be able to cover any losses through rebate revenues they would however have revenues greater than costs over the entire period current status approved card sponsors were able to begin enrolling beneficiaries in may 2004 they could begin offering enrollees access to discounts and transitional assistance on june 1 2004 card sponsors the initial list of approved card sponsors was announced on march 25 2004 additional sponsors were subsequently added to the list as of june 2004 cms had approved 39 national sponsors and 33 regional card sponsors regional card programs were offered to beneficiaries in all but nine states cms had approved an additional 84 exclusive card programs offered to enrollees of medicare advantage plans special approval was given to three programs to provide access to transitional assistance through longterm care pharmacies four to provide discounts to residents in the territories and three to serve federally recognized indian tribe and tribal organization pharmacies recent analysis by health policy alternatives inchpa found that of the 72 general national and general regional card programs 53 could be classified as pharmacy benefit managers pbms approximately 28 of the 72 sponsors were thirdparty administrators tpas or pharmacy benefit administrators commercial discount card companies various medical and information technology companies and an alliance of retail and chain pharmacies the nine managed care organizations 13 of the total that sponsored general card programs either operate their own crs14 pbm or contract with pbm or thirdparty administrator to run the card program information was available for the remaining 913 the hpa study noted that five of the approved national plans never actually marketed their plans this means that as of june 2004 34 national plans were available further it noted that the number of options was actually fewer than 34 when looked at in terms of actual variations in programs drug prices enrollment fees and pharmacy access this was attributed to the fact that many card programs are either offered by the same sponsor or work through the same pbm or tpa however the fact that sponsor uses the same pbm or tpa does not necessarily result in common card features beneficiary education beneficiaries in feeforservice medicare can select from large number of endorsed card programs beneficiaries in managed care are required to enroll with the card program provided by the plan if such card program is offered cms has taken number of steps designed to make the selection and enrollment process easier these efforts have been expanded over time as observers have stated the need for further improvements the key information source is the prescription drug assistance program pdap tool put on the medicare website at the end of april 2004 httpwwwmedicaregov seniors and their adult children or other persons assisting them are able to obtain by zip code information on plans available in the area plan prices for specific drugs specified by senior and pharmacies associated with available card programs the site also directs lowincome persons to state assistance programs if any which might be available to them cms reports that it has recently made several improvements to the website beneficiaries can now obtain listing of the top 5 that is list of the five plans offering the lowest aggregate prices for the selected drugs in addition beneficiaries will be able to enroll in card programs on the internet seniors may also call the medicare tollfree number 1800medicare if they wish information on the drug card they should have list of the drugs they take frequently after calling the phone line they should receive personalized booklet in the mail outlining their choices this information is comparable to what is available on the website since implementation of the card program and the corresponding increase in the call volume cms has added additional call takers in july cms reported that there were 3000 operators answering an average of 50000 calls day the average wait time was down to two minutes considerably less than earlier reported14 13 health policy alternatives inc medicare drug discount

crs15 cms has taken number of additional steps to assist beneficiaries in obtaining information it is making money available to help communitybased organizations to target persons who may be eligible for transitional assistance this includes working with the access to benefits coalition group of over 80 national nonprofit organizations cms has also made available funds to state health insurance assistance programs ships which provide assistance to beneficiaries through trained volunteer counselors additionally the administration on aging and the indian health service are working with their constituencies to encourage them to signup enrollees on july 29 2004 cms announced that enrollment in the card program had passed the 4 million mark on july 19 2004 of these persons nearly 1 million were receiving the 600 in transitional assistance earlier data showed that 23 million persons were automatically signed up by their managed care organizations additional individuals have been automatically enrolled by their state pharmaceutical assistance program the actual number of persons enrolling on their own is not available manufacturer assistance programs as of july 6 2004 cms reports that six drug companies are offering additional assistance toward the costs of certain specified drugs once transition assistance beneficiary has exhausted his or her 600 subsidy the companies offering this additional assistance are abbott astrazeneca eli lilly johnson and johnson merck novartis and pfizer15 issues implementation of the drug card raises number of issues some are unique to the card program itself while others have implications for the medicare drug benefit which will be put in place in 2006 beneficiary enrollment and selection of plan in general as noted beneficiaries are expected to make selection from endorsed drug card programs available in their area an exception applies for ma plan enrollees who will get their card through the ma plan if the plan offers an exclusive card program many persons have suggested that the enrollment figures are less than anticipated while others contend that the numbers are good for new 14 continued helping those who need it

not penalized if they delay enrollment however there is concern that many lowincome persons who should be taking advantage of the 600 subsidy have failed to sign up as noted above special effort is currently being made to contact and enroll this population group beneficiaries not enrolled with ma organizations can choose between large number of card programs information on these programs is available on the internet some people have suggested that beneficiaries have in fact had too many choices many particularly older and frailer beneficiaries are not comfortable using the internet reportedly both beneficiaries and persons assisting them have had trouble navigating the website and are confused by the large number of choices available to them cms has responded by making improvements to the website including the listing of the best five for an individual in an area however some observers continue to suggest that the site is not user friendly autoenrollment lowincome populations are typically hard to reach for example enrollment in medicare savings programs ie qmb slimb and qi1 has traditionally been below desired levels some persons suggest that enrollment figures for the 600 subsidy could be increased through autoenrollment of selected populations while auto enrollment of these groups could potentially increase enrollment in the transitional assistance program it would still fail to identify persons who have not established their potential eligibility through another program medicare savings programs lowincome persons enrolled in medicare savings programs are potentially eligible for transitional assistance since by definition they meet the income criteria number of persons have stated that cms should automatically enroll them in the card program cms has been reluctant to do this for several reasons it notes that some persons enrolled in medicare savings programs may in fact have health insurance for drugs which would make them ineligible for transitional assistance there are also questions about how beneficiaries could exercise choice among the card programs however the biggest concern is that the law requires beneficiaries to submit an enrollment form certifying they do not have other drug coverage many states do not have representative authority to make the certification on behalf of medicare savings programs enrollees the access to benefits coalition recently commissioned legal analysis on the autoenrollment issue by hogan and hartson16 the analysis concluded that the law gives the secretary authority to use alternatives to the standard enrollment form to enroll and certify persons for the 600 subsidy this issue is expected to be of continuing interest as persons look for additional ways to increase the enrollment of lowincome persons17 16 hogan and hartson transitional assistance for lowincome beneficiaries in the medicare drug discount card program memorandum from sheree r kanner and linda fishman to the access to benefits coalition aug 3 2004 17 cms has indicated that it does not have authority to allow auto enrollment for the medicare savings population under the new drug benefit that will be implemented in 2006 crs17 state pharmacy assistance programs spaps number of states operate statefunded pharmacy assistance programs for lowincome individuals each state establishes its own eligibility criteria it is estimated that approximately half of the enrollees would meet the eligibility criteria for transitional assistance the remaining enrollees generally have incomes above 135 of poverty which is the cutoff for transitional assistance as of june 2004 seven states provided for automatic enrollment for their spap enrollees who meet the eligibility criteria for transitional assistance these states use authorized representative authority to auto enroll six of the states massachusetts maine minnesota new jersey new york and pennsylvania automatically enrolled persons with preferred card sponsor connecticut chose to implement the program with several cards review of auto enrollment found that it proved to be an effective strategy18 formularies key factor influencing beneficiarys choice of card is presumably the drugs that are available on the plans formulary as noted each plan is required to offer discount on at least one drug in each of 209 identified therapeutic categories single drug can not be used to satisfy the requirement for more than one category cms established these groupings in order to promote timely implementation of the temporary program and to provide access to discounts on drugs used most often by beneficiaries at this point it is difficult to assess the degree of variation in formularies that are offered by different programs beneficiaries using the website can tell which card programs in their area cover the drugs they use on regular basis however available data and marketing materials do not provide useful mechanism for extensive comparisons beneficiaries who need costly drugs need to review available offerings carefully since not all plans may cover all of their drugs some observers have noted that plans are permitted to change formularies throughout the year even though beneficiaries are locked into their choice for the remainder of the calendar year however other observers have suggested that most plans are unlikely to make significant changes in part because they do not wish to antagonize their enrollees beneficiaries can elect to use drug off the formulary but they will not be able to take advantage of any negotiated price for the drug however if beneficiary is entitled to transitional assistance payment may be made for drug even if it is off the formulary 18 kimberly fox testimony for public hearing of the state pharmaceutical assistance transition commission and supplemental tables rutgers center for state health policy july 7 2004 crs18 price negotiation related issue is the price that is negotiated for the drugs some observers are concerned that while card sponsors can change both formularies and negotiated prices after beneficiary enrolls in sponsors program beneficiaries are essentially locked into their choice for the remainder of the calendar year some have suggested that plans will raise their prices however preliminary review of selected drugs and selected card programs showed that overall prices remained relatively stable over the initial weeks of the program another concern is the price information that is published when cms first posted price information on the website there were reportedly number of inaccuracies this was attributed to the short turn around time to post the information and the submission of incomplete andor incorrect information by sponsors many of the early problems have been corrected measuring negotiated discounts virtually all observers agree that the 600 subsidy provides meaningful benefit to enrollees with incomes under 135 of poverty there has been less of consensus with regard to the value of card for other enrollees several observers have suggested that beneficiaries can obtain similar savings through other card programs19 comparative analysis is made difficult by the fact that pdap price information is only accessible by plan and zip code in the early weeks of the program cms was estimating savings in the range of 1015 more recently two studies have attempted to further quantify the savings health policy alternatives hpa analysis the hpa analysis cited above was issued july 2004 the study focused on prices available to persons not eligible for the subsidy it tracked drug prices for threeday supply for set of 10 drugs commonly prescribed for medicare beneficiaries and seven discount card programs the programs picked were ones that offered discounts on all selected drugs at pharmacies in an urban and rural location in maryland the prices were compared to those reported by the maryland attorney generals ags office which tracks retail prices paid by cash customers for selected drugs 19 for example an analysis prepared by the minority staff of the house committee on government relations in apr 2004 prior to the implementation of the program found that prices expected to be available under the card program were higher than those that could be obtained in canada or through the veterans administration and were lower than prices that could be obtained without the card similarly consumers reports item in its aug 2004 issue stated that its review of posted prices for five drugs in five cities in midmay 2004 found that the prices under the card programs were higher than those available from drugstorecom and costcocom it should be noted that some early pricing information on the website was inaccurate additionally some plans lowered their initial price levels crs19 the hpa analysis showed that all seven card programs had prices that were significantly less than those reported by the maryland attorney general for the basket of 10 drugs it found that urban prices were 19 to 24 lower than the aggregate of the median ag reported prices rural prices were 1722 lower than the ag prices and mail order prices were 2732 lower than the ag prices for urban areas all six of the seven card programs offering mail order had prices for 90day supply for the basket of 10 drugs lower than costcocom drugstorecom was competitive with the card mail order programs the aggregate price on drugstorecom for the 10 drugs was 5 higher than the lowest priced card but 2 less than the highest priced card the hpa analysis also concluded that choice of card mattered with considerable differences recorded between savings achieved from cards with the lowest and highest retail prices even greater differences were recorded when mail order prices were compared lewin group analysis on august 13 2004 the lewin group issued its analysis of potential drug card savings its study commissioned by the healthcare leadership council used three different approaches to measure savings available during june and july 2004 the first approach compared discount card prices to average retail prices in each state for the 150 most commonly prescribed drugs this comparison would be most useful for persons using small number of drugs the second approach compared prices on cardbycard basis for market basket of the 25 drugs prescribed most frequently for beneficiaries this analysis would be useful for persons taking number of drugs the third approach looked at typical drug regimens used to treat selected chronic conditions in all cases comparisons were based on 30day supply of the most common form and strength of each drug only discounts available at retail pharmacies were used they were compared to retail prices which would be paid by persons without other access to discounted prices savings would be less for persons with access to other discount cards or enrolled in state pharmaceutical assistance program it should be noted that the savings estimates factor in the value of the 600 subsidy20 the following are some of the key findings form the survey when looking at the top 150 drugs the best available prices for brand name drugs represented average savings per prescription of 1268 186 the best available prices for generic drugs represented average savings per prescription of 468 675 available discounts vary by sponsor therefore the card beneficiary picks has significant effect on overall savings all of the cards in the top quartile provided savings of at least 199 on the 25 drugs included in the market basket median card savings were 172 or 848 per prescription 20 they do not however factor in the savings attributable to manufacturer assistance programs offered to lowincome beneficiaries who have exhausted their 600 subsidy during the year crs20 savings for beneficiaries using typical drug regimen for diabetes ranged from 13 to 26 while those for typical hypertension regimen average 28 the best available price offered for single drug under the card program seldom varied across markets thus while card sponsors offer uniform pricing nationwide the savings from the cards vary geographically and by pharmacy due to variations in retail prices the best available prices can generally be obtained at multiple pharmacies in an area the report also estimated national savings based on these findings the savings estimates are based on several assumptions first it assumes that enrollment will reach the cms estimate by january 1 2005 namely that 73 million will enroll and 61 of enrollees 45 million will be eligible for the subsidy second the report assumes that beneficiaries will choose discount card averaging savings of 199 the 75th percentile of the market basket test the savings for all beneficiaries over 18 months would average 1247 355 of median retail spending of 3514 this estimate includes the 600 subsidy value savings for beneficiaries eligible for the subsidy would average 1548 473 of median retail spending of 3270 for this group while those for persons above 135 of poverty would average 775 199 of median retail spending for this group of 389521 overall the report estimated that savings would total 77 billion if enrollment reaches 73 million by january 1 2005 and beneficiaries select cards in the 75th percentile with average savings of 199 of the 77 billion total savings 43 billion 56 is attributable to discounted prices and 34 billion to the subsidy 44 taking into account both discounted prices and the subsidy 59 billion of the total 77 billion are estimated to accrue to lowincome beneficiaries price changes over time both the hpa and lewin analyses compared drug prices available through the cards with retail prices available on the same date to persons not covered under an endorsed discount card or eligible for discounts through another source such as private insurance or nonendorsed discount card program one question that has not been answered by the recent analyses is to what extent prices were raised prior to the start of the card program if there were sharp increase in prices prior to the programs introduction the value of the discounts would be somewhat undercut pricing information in effect prior to implementation of the card program is proprietary so precise comparisons are not available however some reviews suggest that recent increases may be considerable an aarp report on the first quarter of 2004 showed that manufacturers increases to wholesalers for widely used brand name drugs rose faster in the 12month period ending march 2004 than in any of the previous four calendar years the average annual percentage change for the period was 72 compared to the general increase 21 these estimates assume beneficiaries with higher drug costs are more likely to enroll as are those eligible for the credit crs21 in inflation of 2022 families usa study of the top 30 drugs used by seniors found an average increase of 43 times the rate of inflation between january 2003 and january 2004 in the threeyear period from january 2001january 2004 the average increase was 36 times the rate of inflation 23 pharmacy access as noted earlier card sponsors are required to contract with sufficient number of pharmacies other than mail order to ensure that beneficiaries have sufficient access to retail pharmacies number of card sponsors have made network pharmacy information available to potential enrollees through the pdap website other sponsors will make pharmacy information available on request questions have been raised regarding the accuracy of network pharmacy information one review found that some card sponsors were using passive acceptance agreements to identify participating pharmacies unless pharmacy specifically told sponsor it would not be participating the sponsor listed it as participant in certain cases pharmacies that had intention of participating or in certain cases were longer in business at the stated address were listed as participants on the pdap24 it is not clear how widespread this problem may be transition to permanent drug benefit as noted the medicare endorsed drug card program is temporary and will be replaced by permanent drug benefit under medicare part d in 200625 eligibility there are several differences between the eligibility requirements and determination procedures applicable for transitional assistance under the drug card program and the requirements and procedures applicable for lowincome subsides under the new medicare drug benefit this could lead to potential confusion for beneficiaries cms adopted streamlined procedures for the card program both because of the short lead time for the program and the fact that it is temporary for the drug card individuals attest that their income falls below the threshold and cms verifies the eligibility under the permanent program states will make eligibility determinations using procedures currently in place for medicaid 22 david gross stephen schondelmeyer and susan raetzman trends in manufacturer price changes for most widely used brand name prescription drugs aarp public policy institute june 2004 23 families usa sticker shock rising prescription drug prices for seniors july 2004 24 henry waxman and louise mcintosh slaughter letter to hon tommy g thompson secretary of the department of health and human services july 6 2004 25 for information on the new drug benefit see crs report rl31966 overview of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 by jennifer osullivan hinda chaikind sibyl tilson jennifer boulanger and paulette morgan crs22 another difference involves assets tests there are assets tests for the 600 subsidy under the drug card while there are assets tests for lowincome subsidies under the medicare drug benefit it is therefore possible that some persons will qualify for lowincome assistance under the card program but not under the permanent drug benefit plan choices under the part d benefit each medicare beneficiary will be entitled to obtain qualified prescription drug coverage through enrollment in prescription drug plan pdp or in the case of ma enrollee through enrollment in mapdp plan cms received large number of applications from entities wishing to become drug card sponsors it unclear how many of these entities will actually submit applications to become pdp plans many may view participation in the card program as an opportunity to position themselves in the market and make themselves known to beneficiaries prior to the roll out of the new benefit in 2006 presumably the experience entities gain in administering the drug card including dealing with the medicare population will prove useful when they take on the responsibilities for the new benefit at the same time cms expects that information provided through the card program will assist it in further understanding the pharmaceutical industry however some observers have suggested that many of the card programs may not apply to become pdp plans under the 2006 benefit pdp plans are to provide drugonly benefit and unlike discount card program assume portion of the financial risk of coverage drugonly product is largely untested therefore some entities may be reluctant to assume the unknown financial risk of the new benefit this is less of an issue for mapdp plans since most of these entities have experience offering drug benefits and the drug benefit is offered as part of the overall benefits package beneficiary choices it may be difficult for some seniors to adjust to the changes between the card program and the new permanent benefit as noted there are differences between the two programs with respect to eligibility requirements and the process for determining eligibility there are also likely to be differences between the formularies and negotiated prices established under the endorsed card program and those made available by pdp plans even if offered by the same entity the consequences of individual choices between plans will become more important in 2006 as is the case with the drug card negotiated prices will only be available for drugs on the plans formulary in addition beginning in 2006 beneficiaries will receive federal subsidies for costs incurred with respect to drugs on plans formulary but will not receive such subsidies except in the case of successful appeals for drugs not on plans formulary further since beneficiaries will be paying premiums estimated at 35 month rather than maximum of 30 year for the card they will want to select program that best meets their needs these concerns highlight the necessity for beneficiary education on both the card program and the permanent drug benefit as well as the differences between them cms has begun this process for other versions of this
