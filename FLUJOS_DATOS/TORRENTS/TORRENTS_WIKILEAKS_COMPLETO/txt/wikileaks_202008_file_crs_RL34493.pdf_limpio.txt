economic and societal be nefits of nanotechnol ogy have propelled global investments by nations and companie s the united states launched the first national nanotechnology initiative in 2000 si nce then more than 60 nations have launched similar in itiatives in 2006 global public investme nt in nanotechnology was estimated to be 64 billion with an additional 60 billion provided by the private sector more than 600 nanotec hnology pr oducts are now in the market generally offering incremental improve ments over existing products however proponents maintain that nanotechnology research and development currently underway could offer revolutiona ry applications with significant implications for the us economy national and homeland secur ity and societal wellbeing these investments coupled with nanotechnologys potential implications have raised interest and concerns about the us competitive position the data used to assess competitiveness in mature technologies and industries such as revenues and market share are not available for assessing nanotechnology in fact the us government does not curre ntly collect such data for nanotechnology nor is comparable international data av ailable without this information an authoritative assessment of the us competitive position is not possible alternatively indicators of us scientific and technological strength eg public and private research investments nanot echnology papers publis hed in scientific journals patents ma provide insight into the current us position and serve as bellwethers of future competitiveness by these criteria the united states appears to be the overall global leader in nanot echnology however other nations are investing heavily and may lead in specifi c areas of nanotechnology some believe the us leadership position in nanotechnolog may not be as large as it has been in previous emerging technologies efforts to develop and commercia lize nanotechnology face variety of challenges eg technical hurdles availability of capital environmental health and safety concerns and immature manufacturing tec hnology and infrastructure some advocate more active federal government role in overcoming these challenges including funding to aid in th translation of research to commercial products general and target ed tax provisions incentives for capital formation increased support for development of ma nufacturing and testing infrastructure standards and nomenclature development and educati on and training creation of science technology and innovation parks and efforts to establish stable and predictable regulatory environmen t that keeps pace with innovation some support more limited fe deral role some who hold this view maintain that the market free from government interventions is most efficient they assert that federal efforts can create market dist ortions and result in the federal government picking winners and losers among technolog ies companies and industries others oppose federal support for industr ial research and applicati ons labeling such efforts corporate welfare still others argu for moratorium on nanotechnology rd until environmental health and safety concerns

of the most promising areas of technological development and among th most likely to deliver substantial economic and societal benefits to the united states in the 21st century with so much potentially at stake global competition has emerged among nations and companies to develop and capture the va lue of nanotechnology products competitiveness generally refers to the comparative ability of nation or company to bring products or services to markets assessments of competitive strength generally rely on indicators such as revenues market share and trade however since nanotechnology is still largel in an early stage of development the us government does not collect this ty pe of data for nanot echnology products in addition nanotechnology is not discrete industry but ra ther technology applied across wide range of products in disp arate industries for which nanotechnology products generally account for small fraction of total sa for these reasons an assessment of us industr ial competitiveness in na notechnology in the same manner that analysts would assess the comp etitiveness of mature industries is not possible at this time alternatively this report reviews national nanotechnology research and development rd investme nts scientific pa pers and patents as indicators of current us scientific and technological competitiveness and potential indicators of future industrial comp etitiveness in nanot echnology products the federal government has played central role in catalyzing us rd efforts in 2000 president clinton unched the us national nanotechnology initiative nni the worlds first integrated national effort focused on nanotechnology the nni has enjoyed str ong bipartisan support from the executive branch the house of representatives and the senate each year the president has proposed increased funding for federa l nanotechnology rd and each year congress has provided additi onal funding since the inception of the nni congress has appropriated to tal of 84 billion for nanotechnol ogy rd intended to foster continued us technological leader ship and to support the technologys development with the longterm goal s of creating highwage jobs economic growth and wealth creation addressing critical national needs renewing us manufacturing leadership and improving h ealth the environment and the overall quality of life the united states is not alone in seeking to tap the perceived potential of nanotechnology following the creation of the nni more than 60 nations have established their own nati onal nanotechnology initiatives many based on the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34493crs2 1 profiting from international nanotechnology lux research december 2006 p 2model estimated global annual public

strategic plans nanotechnologyfocused science t echnology and innovation parks venture capital funds and other polic ies and programs to accelerate the translation of nanotechnology research into products to exploit its economic potential these investments and policies c oupled with generally optimistic expectations have raised interest and concerns about the global competitive position of the united states in the development and commercia lization of nanotechnology in 2003 congress enacted the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act pl 108 153 assigning responsibilitie s

level scientific and industrial infrastructure technical capabilities and science and engineering workforces of other nations are more substantial than in the past charles vest president of the national academies of engineering and member of the pres idents council of advisors on science and technology pcast asserted early in 2008 that nanotechnology was the first emerging technology where we the ited states dont have huge lead vest added that it was also the first emer ging technology in which the federal governments efforts included commercialization as specific goal and thus was the first real test of th united states looselycoupled publicprivate partnership in the new competitive environment16 evidence of commercialization of nanot echnologybased produc ts is generally available for example the woodrow wilson international center for scholars project on emerging nanotechnologies c ounts more than 600 companyidentified nanotechnology products on the market more than half of which are produced by companies based in the united states17 some private organiza tions have attempted to estimate current nanotec hnologyderived revenues and to timate future revenues for example lux research estimates th at products incorpor ating nanotechnology produced 50 billion in global revenues in 200618 less than 01 of global manufacturing output and that by 2014 revenues will reach 26 trillion or 15 of projected global manufacturing output19 in the absence of comprehensive and authoritative economic output data eg revenues market share trade indicator s such as inputs eg public and private research investments and non financial outputs eg scientific pape rs patents are now used to gauge nations current and future competitive position in emerging technologies these indicators offer insights into nations scientific and technological strength which may serve as foundation for future product nd process innovationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34493crs7 20 science and engineering

national security decision directive 189 states that it is the policy of this administration that to the maximum extent po ssible the products of fundamental research remain unrestricted the directive allows for restriction of some results through national security classification fundamental research is defined in the directive as including both basic and applied research in science and engi neering but distinct from proprietary research and industrial development design pr oduction and product utilization for further information on us policy toward unrestricted access to federallyfunded fundamental research see crs report rl31695 balancing scientific publication and national security concerns issues for congress by dana sheahowever research and deve lopment investments scien tific papers and patents may not provide reliable indicators of the united states current or future competitive position scientific and technological l eadership may not necessarily result in commercial leadership andor in national competitiveness for the following reasons basic research in nanotechnology may not translate into viable commercial applications though formal assessment of the composition of the nni budget has been made there is general consensus that the nni investment since its inception has been focused on basic research th national science f oundation defines the objective of basic research as seeking to gain more comprehensive knowledge or understanding of the subject under st udy without applications in mind20 therefore while basic research may underpin pplied research development and commercialization that is not its primary focus or intent in general basic research can take decades21 to result in commercial applications and many advances in scientific understandi ng may not present commercial opportunities basic research is generally available to all competitors even when basic research presents the potential for co mmercial exploitation it may not deliver national advantage open publication and free exchange of research results are guiding principles of federa lly funded fundamental research22 and research conducted by us colleges and universities this approach may allow for the rapid expansion of global scientific and technical knowledge as new work is built on the scaffolding of previous work however the information is available to all competitors us and foreign alike and thus may not confer competitive advantage to the united states usbased companies may conduct production and other work outside of the united states in todays economy supply chains are global and the work required to develop design produce market sell and service products is generally conducted where it can be done most effici ently even if usbased companies successfully develop and br ing nanotechnology material s and products to market work may be conducted and the economic value capture d outside of the united states federal policies and investments may offer tools that can make the united states the most attractive place for companies to conduct greater share of value adding activities contributing to u s economic growth and job creationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34493crs8 useducated foreign students may return home to conduct research and create new businesses in the era following world war ii many of the most gifted and talented students from around the worl d were attracted to the science and engineering programs of us colleges and universities for many years many of those who graduated from these programs d ecided to stay in the united states and contributed to us global sc ientific engineering and economic leadership today many foreign students educated in the united states have economic opportunities in their home countries that did not exist for previous generations some nations are making strong appeals and offering signif icant incentives for their students to return home to conduct research and create ente rprises thus federal support for universities in general and scientific and engineering research activities in particular may contribute to the development of leading scientists and engineers who might return to their home countries to exploit the knowledge capab ilities and networks developed in the united states small businesses may lack the resources needed to bring their nanotechnology innovations to market federal programs such as the small business innovation research sbir prog ram and the small business technology transfer sttr program support leading edge nanotechnology research by small innovative firms federally funded univers ity research can produce small startup ventures these small businesses may velop commercially va luable technology and even successfully develop new nanotechno logy materials tools processes or products but lack the capital infrastructur or sales and dist ribution channels to effectively bring such advances to market us companies with leadingedge na notechnology capabilit ies andor their intellectual property m ay be acquired by foreign competitors foreign companies may acquire leadingedge nanot echnology companies or their intellectual property this can take place for example as the result of an intentional business strategy to be acquired common exit strategy for startup companies hostile takeover if the enterprise is public comp any or when business has failed or is failing in the latter case the company or its intellectual property might be acquired at fraction of its developm ent cost or potential value us policies or other factors may impede nanotechnology commercialization make it unaffordable or make it less attractive than foreign alternatives federal state and local policies eg taxes envir onmental and health regulations ethical restrictions and other factors eg availability quality and cost of labor proximity to markets customer requirements manufacturing infrastructure public attitudes may preven t or discourage commercia lization of nanotechnology innovations in the united states comp anies may be prohib ited from producing commercially viable pr oduct in the united states may be unable to do so affordably or may find comparatively favorable conditions eg lower taxes or tax holidays fewer regulatory restrictions qualified available and less costly workforce outside the united states comparisons of aggregate national data may be misleading for example small nation with limited resources may be unable to pursue leadingedge research across broad spectrum of nanotechnologyre lated

economic advisors the white house 1989 p 225limited set of disciplines and applications or even single one in such case that country may become the strongest compe titor in given area while analysis of aggregate numbers might obscure this stre ngth alternatively rapidly developing nation may invest substan tial capital in nanotechnology research but lack key elements such as strong scientific and technological infrastructure mature industry service and private capital infrast ructure experienced scientists engineers managers and entrepreneurs andor marketoriented business climate needed to fully capitalize on such an investment in addition the concept of nationa l competitive position may differ from the past as result of increased globaliza tion of research technical talent and production for example the worlds l eadingedge research in field of nanotechnology might be conducted at an am erican university by chinese students supported by research funds from german based corporation with engineering underway in russia plans to manufacture in taiwan shipping by greekflagged vessels and technical support provided online and by telephone from india in such an example the global distribution of know ledge workers investors and producers make the determination of national competitiveness more difficult just as other countries might benef it from us nanotechnology rd so too might the united states benefit from nanotechnology rd c onducted in other nations through variety of means incl uding studying published research results acquiring or licensing pate nts conducting joint business ventures and by fostering business environment that attracts production and relate d activities some economists assert that international rd collaboration can benefit the united states as well by improving the pr oductivity of the rd process23 with these caveats the following section reviews input and noneconomic output measures as indicat ors of the us competitive position in nanotechnologyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34493crs10 24 comparisons and aggregations of investme nts in rd across organizational and national boundaries are fraught with imprecision and inaccuracy one challenge with quantifying public or private investment in nanotechnology rd relates to the definition of nanotechnology used by different governments nd institutions there is significant debate in and among federal agencies with respect to what should be consid ered and thus counted as nanotechnology rd not withstanding the nni definition as well as within and between companies industries and governments in addition to substantive definitional disagreements about nanotechnology some seek to take advantage of the cachet of the term nano or nanotechnology strong interest in nanotechnology on the part of policymakers investors and consumers may induce some to characterize nonnanotechnology activities or products as nanotechnology or to characte rize an entire effort as nanotechnology rd when in fact only portion of it is devoted to nanotechnology conversely some firms may not characterize nanotechnology research effort s as nanotechnology out of concern for potential negative reactions from customer s or unwanted regulatory attention 25 roco mc international perspective on government nanotechnology funding in 2 005 journal of nanoparticle research

never realized in materials products or processes pa tent counts do not attempt to assess the relative value of each patent instead assigning equal value to each thus nation with high patent count in nanotechnology may not benefit as much as nation with fewer but more valuable patents in addition companies may choose not to patent particular idea even one with significant value for variety of reasons for example public exposure of the idea as required by the patent applica tion process may enable other companies to engineer around their patent finding way to do what the original patent accomplished but in way that is sufficiently different that it qualifies for new patent alternatively company may be able to block the original patent holder from further improvements by filing patent applications that essentially block out potential improvements or unscrupulous producers may ignore the patent and use the intellectual property without compensating the patent holder instead of filing for patent company may choose instead to hol d valuable intellectual property as trade secret in contrast to patents which provide protection for defined periods trade secrets can extend

argue that the federal role should be limited to funding basic research rd needed to meet agency mission requirements and developmen t of the us scientific and technical workforce47 some believe the

increased funding for downstream research ie applied research and devel opment closer to commercial products including production prototypes52 those who advocate this position generally assert that many promising re search breakthroughs and early technology developments fail to make it to market this failure they argue results from inadequate funding mechanisms to bring the technology to state of maturity in which private corporations and other sources of capital are willing to invest in the technology or in the company that holds the technology to bring it to market for example they assert that investor demand for shortterm returns can result in companies being unable to invest in higherrisk longerterm technology development projects needed to sustain their viability in the future

and earlystage technologies to ove rcome the valley of death53 and reach the marketplace where the nation would be able to capture their economic and societal benefits one rationale offered by some economists for federal funding of rd is that the private sector underinvests in rd becau many of the bene fits economic and societal are captured by others particularly where the results cannot be easily appropriated for production and profit54 however as research moves closer to commercialization private sector incentives to invest increase and the rationale for federal rd funding is diminished another argument for government rd funding put forth by economists and others is that the development of emergi ng and enabling technol ogies may be beyond the ability of any single company or industry to develop due to high cost high risk lack of requisite expertise and an inability to capture adequate returns while single company or industry may not be ab to achieve adequa returns across its limited line of products and services the ec onomic benefits that accrue across all industries may be sufficient even sweepin g another justification for federal funding say advocates is

anges in demand that occur in dynamic economy is to allow investors and workers to respond to such changes government allocation of investment that ignores market signals usually stunts growth by

often continued to invest in technologies such as those supported by the us synfuels program that have been proven by markets and technological developments to be economically unsound58 libertarian opposition to increased federal rd such as that put forth by the cato institute is grounded in philosophy of limited government and reliance on the free market libertarians generally ssert that markets free from government interventions are the most effective mechanism for allocating resources to the most promising opportun ities in their view government interventions represent an industrial policy in which the preferen ces of politicians and bureaucrats are substituted for market forces andor objective criteria when the federal government provides direct andor i ndirect financial support to particular technology59 assert these advocates it may not only provide direct benefit to the technology especially with respect to existing technolog or alternatives but it may also signal technology developers and investors that the technology may receive future preferential treatment by government as well this may as result skew corporate development activities and private investments toward lesspromising directions producing more costly andor less beneficial results many libertarians also see governme nt financial support for technology development as an inappropr iate involuntary

invol ve incremental improvements to existing products much of the investment has been focused on fundamental research to gain scientific understandi ng of nanoscale phenomena and pr ocesses and to learn how to manipulate matter at the nanoscale these investments are expected by many to deliver revolutionary changes in products and industries with implications for global technological econo mic and military leadership the potential implications of nanotechnology coupled with the substan tial sustained inves tments have raised concerns and interest in the us competitive position in

nations in the absence of such data assessm ents of nanotechnology depend largely on alternative indicators such as inputs g public and private investments and non economic outputs eg scientif ic papers patents by these measures the united states appears to lead all other nations in nanotechnology though the us lead in this field may not be as large as it has b een in previous emerging technology areas this is due to increased investments and capabilities of many nations based on recognition that technological leadership and commercia lization are primary paths to increased economic growth improved standards of living and job creation nevertheless these alternative indicators may not present an accurate view of technological leadership and economic co mpetitiveness for many reasons nor does national technological leadership alone guarantee that the economic value produced by nanotechnology innovations will be captured within nations borders in todays global economy companies have the opti on of locating work eg research development design engineering ma nufacturing product support where it can be done most effectively variety of federal policy issues may affect the development and commercialization of nanotec hnology in the united states including the magnitude and focus of research and development fforts the regulatory environment and science and engineering workforce devel opment some support an active federal approach others believe that more limited federal involve ment is likely to be more successful and equitable in addition to these factors us competitiveness in nanotechnology will depend not just on the fforts of the united states but also on the speed and efficacy of foreign nanotechnology development efforts congress established legi slative foundation for some of the activities of the national nanotechnology initia tive and to address key issues associated with nanotechnology thorough enactment of th 21st century nanotechnology research and development act 2003 the act provide d funding authorizations for five nni agencies through fy2008 action is being c onsidered in both the house and senate on possible amendments to and reauthor ization of the program congress may opt to address some or many of the issues identified in this paper in the course of deliberation on the reauthorization of this act or alternatively in separate legislation
