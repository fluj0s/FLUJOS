ii peak of 209 in fiscal year fy 2000 federal receipts as percentage of gross domestic product gdp fell for three consecutive years declining in 2004 to its lowest level since 1959 163 before rising again to 175 in 2005 level close to its postwar average of 183 the decline in receipts was attributed to variety of factors slower economic growth changes in the makeup of aggregate income and enacted taxcut legislation at the same time the composition of federal taxes has changed somewhat generally shifting away from corporate income taxes and excise taxes towards social security taxes but with individual income taxes remaining the largest category over the postworld war ii period this report will be updated as additional data become available the level of taxes compared to the size of the economy although tax receipts have varied over the past few years they have remained relatively stable over the longer term figure 1 shows federal receipts as percentage of gross domestic product gdp over the period 19402005 table 1 presents the corresponding data the numbers indicate that during world war ii taxes increased from prewar level of about 7 of gdp to 209 in 1944 although tax receipts declined immediately after the war they remained substantially above their prewar level for the next five decades the level of taxes remained quite stable the average for the postworld war ii period has been 183 of gdp the lowest level was in 1950 at 144 receipts reached their highest level as percentage of gdp in 2000 at 209 after reaching their peak in 2000 receipts declined for several years reaching 163 in 2004 but then rose to 175 in 2005 these high and low points are relatively small departures from the average and most years remained quite close to the norm within 30 of gdp from the longterm average the narrow range of variation has been consequence of both economic factors and conscious policy decisions for example congressional research service the library of congress crs2 inflation helped push revenues as percentage of the economy to relative peak in 1981 whereas the economic recovery tax act of 1981 subsequently reduced them similarly robust economic growth helped boost receipts to their record level in 2000 whereas the subsequent tax cut bills and decline in economic growth reduced receipts in the next four years figure 1 federal taxes as percentage of gross
