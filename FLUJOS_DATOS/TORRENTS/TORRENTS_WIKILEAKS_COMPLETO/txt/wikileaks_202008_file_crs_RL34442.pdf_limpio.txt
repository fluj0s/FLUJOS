the real estate settlement procedures act summary recent unsettling developments in th subprime home loan market have triggered concern in congress and among the public as to whether borrowers were fully informed about the terms of their mortgage loans some observers have suggested that numerous borrowers in th subprime market ma have been victims of predatory lending practices or other discriminatory activity several bills have been introduced in the 110th congress that would seek to remedy these perceived abuses senate bills s 1222 senator bar ack obama et s 1299 senator charles schumer et s 1386 senator jack reed et and hous bill h r 2061 representative stephanie tubbs jones et include both suitability and disclosure approaches for addressing these concerns this report focuses on borrower disclosure in particular with respect to making all pertinent information about loan rms and settlement costs transparent so consumers can make wellinformed fina ncial decisions when choosing mortgage products the real estate settlement procedures ac t respa of 1974 requires standardized disclosures bout the settlement or clos ing costs of residential mortgages the department of hous ing and urban development hud has proposed changes to respa designed to facilitate better unders tanding of mortgage terms as well as to enhance the ability of borrowers to shop for better

1601 et seqhud proposes administrative modifications to the real estate settlement procedures act introduction uncertainty generated by recent subpr ime mortgage repayment problems and subsequent foreclosures s generated concern in cong ress and among the public as to whether borrowers are taking on loans they can not afford1 borrowers may have obtained expensive unaffordable loans for va rious reasons perhaps the actual costs of the mortgage were hidden or simply not transparent when borrowers entered into these transactions hidden costs can act as payment shock to borrower causing financial distress whic h could possibly lead to rising foreclosure rates borrowers may have entered into high cost loans as result of discrimination recent mortgage repayment problems may reflect rise in various forms of predatory lending this report focuses on current disclo sure legislation which requires the reporting of pertinent loan information to consumers the real estate settlement procedures act respa of 1974 requires standardized disclosures about the settlement or closing costs which are costs associated with the acquisition of residential mortgages2 examples of such costs include loan origination fees or points credit report fees property apprai sal fees mortgage insurance fees title insurance fees home and flood insurance f ees recording fees attorney fees and escrow account deposits respa currently includes the following provisions 1 providers of settlement services are required to provi good faith estimate gfe of the settlement service costs borrowers should expect at the closing of their mortgage loans 2 list of the actual cl osing costs must be provided to borrowers at the time of closing which are typica lly listed on the hud1 settlement statement and

to the homebuying process but such reforms arguably could occur under tila since they pertain to gfe disclosures that cover lending costs and terms4 hud has again proposed changes to respa designed to enhance the ability of homebuyers to understand mortgage terms nd associated costs as well as enhance their ability to shop for the best deals5 more transparent in formation could enhance consumer shopping and discourage predator discriminatory and fraudulent lending practices various legislative disclosu re proposals however arguably depend upon consumers to make prudent c hoices consumers may be fully aware that particular mortgage loan and associated costs may be expensive yet decide to assume the loan disclosure reforms therefore may not ensure that consumers will choose more affordable

hudgovofficeshsgsfhres200803summarypdfpractices6 the authors found both prime and subprime borrowers did not understand important mortgage costs after viewing mortgage cost disclosures some borrowers had difficulty identifying the annual percen tage rate apr of the loan and loan amounts many borrowers did not understa nd why the interest rate and apr of loan would differ7 in addition borrowers had the most trouble understanding loan terms for the more complicated mortgage pr oducts such as those with optional credit insurance interestonly payments ba lloon payments and pr epayment penalties more borrowers were unable to deter mine whether balloon payments prepayment penalties or upfront loan char ges were part of the loan hud has proposed new standardized gfe with recommended changes that it argues will help consumer s better understand and locate relevant information about their mortgage products8 for example the proposed gfe conveys in formation about the mortgage terms whether the interest rate can rise whether the overall loan balance can rise whether the loan has prepayment penalty whether the loan has balloon payment and whether the quoted monthly payment includes monthly escrow payment for taxes all of this in formation about the loan appears on the first page of the gfe the first page also includes lumpsum total amount of all estimated settlement fees furthermore separate gfe will be required for each loan product for example borrower ma wish to compare traditional fixed rate mortgage frm loan with an adjustable rate mortgage arm loan both mortgage products must have parate gfes to ensure that the information provided is unique to each product hud argues that these changes to the gfe will lead to less confusion about loan and settlement costs help th borrower better determine product affordability and imp rove comparison shopping9 in addition to providing shopping t ool for consumers the hud proposal also seeks to provide reliable gfes in the sense that estimated costs do not change substantially by the time consumers are read to close on their loans shopping for the best deal or an affordable loan would be meaningless if the costs were to change when borrowers arrived at cl osing consequently page 3 of the proposed gfe lists charges that can not increase charges that are allowed to increase up to 10 and charges that may change at settlement for specific charges th at should not change or exceed the 10 limit borrowers would have the option to withdraw their applications and receive full refund of all loan related f ees this change would make it difficult for lenders to generate costs or fees that could not be easily justified httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34442crs4 10 see federal register vol 73 51 march 14 2008 p 14035 11 see patricia mccoy rethinking disclosure in world of riskbased pricing harvard journal on legislation vol 44 1 winter 2007these gfe disclosure requirements may ge nerate controversy after an earlier proposed ruling concerning gfe modificati ons and requirements loan originators argued the gfe would essentially become binding or final quote which would be extremely difficult to provide without unde rwriting one reason for this criticism stemmed from the fact that loan pric ing depends upon having information about borrower credit history and ability to pay loan originators need to assess borrower risk and perhaps the riskiness of the co llateral to generate binding quote in particular for highrisk borrowers process which takes time and money the hud proposal defines two stages in the overall mortgage seeking process which could be interpreted as response to the earlier criticism10 the consumer receives gfe in stage 1 which occurs prior to the proceeding with the official mortgage application in stage 2 in the first stage the lender is not expected to have performed any underwriting and the gfe n eed only consist of information obtained from the borrower without any verifica tion of borrower statements final underwriting is expected to begin in st age 2 after the borrower has expressed willingness to proceed with an official mortgage application the gfe becomes binding only if the underwriting process confirms borrower st atements and loan qualifications if the underwriting proce ss reveals that the borrower is unable to qualify for the specific loan product th the lender may reject the borrower or propose new gfe for another loan product in which the borrower is more likely to qualify if the proposed twostage process is imp lemented then the final loan rates initially stated on the gfe forms would likely become the actual ones borrowers would receive after underwriting since the majority of borrowers are considered prime or high creditquality lenders currently advertise the interest rates that prime borrowers are likely to be charged and high credit quality borrowers are arguably already able to shop for loans11 subprime or high risk borrowers however encounter difficulties shopping for loan ra tes and may continue to do so under this proposed system lenders typically charge higher rates to riskier borrowers to compensate for the additional risk and such rates are typically determined after underwriting has occurred hence low cr edit quality borrowers may be less likely to obtain estimates of loan rates prior to final underwriting that would not change afterwards assuming substa ntial shifts in the current proportion of prime relative to subprime borrowers or that the share of prime borrowers diminishes as result of further borrower risk grad ations underwriting at the gfe stage might not be necessary for the vast majority of cons umers to obtain fairly reliable pricing information of mortgage products disclosure of mortgage broker compensation hud is proposing new way to disclose to the borrower how the lending institution or mortgage broker who is an agent that works for lending institution is paid loan charges may be collected either through points upfront fees or via thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34442crs5 12 the mortgage interest rate and the ysp are not identical the ysp is defined as the difference between the total coupon interest rate nd the actual wholesale interest rate of the loan for example loan with market or wholesale rate of 6 may have total coupon rate of 65 and 05 is the compensation goin g to the mortgage broker which is the ysp some mortgage lenders may pay brokers up to 2 in ysp 13 the gfe never discusses loan details using th term annual percentage rate apr which expresses the total interest and settlement costs as percentageinterest rate mechanism which is referred to as the yield spread premium ysp or some combination of these two pricing mechanisms12 on page two of the proposed gse form the total origination costs are di sclosed in item 1 the division of these costs into points and ysp is disclosed in item 2 credit that represents the dollar value of loan origination costs not paid at settlement would appear in item 2 in this context credit does not mean the borro wer would receive refund from the loan originator instead credit refers to the loan origination costs that the borrower still pays not upfront at settlement but in the form of higher interest rate or the ysp conversely the dollar value of fees paid upfront at settlement would appear as charge in item 2 for given interest ra both credit and charge amounts in item 2 should add up to the total loan origina tion costs which appears in item 1 the adjusted origination costs which appear in box are the difference between the total loan origination costs and the ysp the adjusted origination costs refers to the amount of total upfront fees that will be paid at settlement if borrowers realize that mortgage loan origination costs may be collected by some combination of upfront fees and ysp then they may also realize that it is possible to choose between paying higher up front fees for lower interest rate or lower upfront fees for higher interest ra in order to f acilitate the understanding of the tradeoff between interest rates and points hud has also proposed including comparison table on page three of the new gfe form for any given loan arrangement the proposed gfe discloses how loan with the same principal face value and lower interest rate results in higher upfront settlement costs it discloses how the same loan with higher interest rate results in lower upfront settlement costs13 disclosures occurring at the closing table revisions to hud1 settlement statement as stated earlier the use of standardized hud1 settlement statement is required at all ttlements or closings involving mortgage loans the hud1 lists all settlement charge s paid at closing the sellers net proceeds and the buyers net payment hud proposes modifying the hud1 to link gfe and hud1 charges the itemized charges listed on the hud1 would include references to the same ch arges originally listed on the proposed gfe with these references it may become more apparent to borrowers what charges remained the same or changed from the estimation stage to the closing stage closing script hud has proposed closing script that settlement agents must read to borrowers at closing the closing script which like the gfe is prepared for each loan type restates the loan terms and highlights any changes inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34442crs6 14 see federal register vol 73 51 march 14 2008 p 14033 15 in press release the mortgage bankers association alludes to the amount paperwork

arthur b continuedcharges or fees that occurred from preparation of the initial gfe to settlement the borrower must sign and be given copy of the closing script after it has been read average cost pricing and volume discounts in another element of the respa re visions package hud proposes permitting average cost pricing and volume discounts on settlement service fees while still making it unlawful for lenders or settlement agents to benefit from kickbacks that increase borrower fees the proposal would allow pricing arrangements that may financially benefit borro wers average cost pricing refers to dividing the total costs associated with specific service eg appraisal service by the total number of services appraisals provided and charging borrowers for the average cost of the services average cost pricing may apply to all services under this system some borrowers will pay less for services that may actually cost more but the proposed rule prevents some borrowers with actual f ees below the average cost to be charged more than average cost the average cost of various service fees which will be computed over specified periods will be based upon methods established by hud settlement service agents will also be permitted to provide volume discounts that may be passed on to borrowers proposed legislative actions hud also seeks legislative changes that will give the agency greater statutory authority to enforce specific sections of respa in particular sections dealing with key disclosure provisions14 the department of hud requests that the hud secretary be granted the authority to impose penalties for respa violations legislation may also be necessary to aut horize procedures requiring that borrowers receive the hud1 closing stat ement three days before settlement and establishing uniform statute of limitations for respa violations examination of mortgage loan price differentials and shopping behavior among consumers assuming implementation issues such as costs associated with reforming respa are addressed consumer s still need to shop actively for the best loan terms to obtain more affordable mortgage products15 in this section the federal

pertaining to mortgage pricing differentials and shopping be havior will be presented17 all scf respondents were asked if th ey were more likely to shop around for the best credit terms mortgages originating between 1996 through 2004 were retained for this analysis the responses to the survey question make it possible to identify whether homeowners exhibited be havior consistent with obtaining an affordable mortgage loan rate the results in table 1 suggest that less than third of the homeowners in the sample admit to shopping aggressively for the best credit terms there is little behavioral difference between borrowers with fixed rate or adjustable rate mortgages arms homeowners obtaining arms may not aggressively shop if they had planned either not to stay in their residences for long period of time or to refinance in the near future fixed rate borrowers however would be expected to have significantly higher shopping rates than borrowers with arms since they would be locking in

scf federal reserve board were the differences in rates large nough for shopping to matter answering this question requires placing some controls on the data sample and variables the data set has been limited to include only fixedrate conforming mortgages18 mortgage holders with traditional 30year fixedrate conforming mortgages werechosen for this part of the analysis to avoid mixing of terms

rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34442crs8 19 the scf does not have information on closing costs so it is not possible to use aprs 20 there was very little monthtomonth volatility in 1996 through 2002 but volatility increased from 2002 through 2004 as interest rates declined 21 the median interest rates were 08162 for the bottom quartile and 11168 for the top quartile change borrower cash outlays remain unchang ed if they have traditional fixed rate mortgages hence the ri skpreference characteristics of the borrower are held constant in this analysis it is possible to control for some of the interest rate volatility over the time since the scf asks respondents for the year they obtained their mortgage19 the mortgage loan rates were normalized by the average rate for the year in which they were obtained so borrowers with mortgage s in different years could be compared for example borrower might report obtaini ng 30year fixed loan in 2002 with an interest rate of 6 given that the aver age conventional 30year fixed mortgage rate in 2002 was 654 according to interest rate data provided by freddie mac the normalized loan rate is 6654 or valu of 09174 this indicates the borrower received loan price below average during th at year all loan rates reported by 2004 survey respondents have been normalized by the average mortgage rate by origination year then loan price distribution was produced to compare rate pricing differentials20 table 2 shows the mean normalized rates fo r the bottom and top portions of the mortgage interest rate distribution for all homeowners in the sample homeowners in the bottom 25 of the loan distribution paid lower interest rates for their loans relative to homeowners in the top 25 of th distribution the average rate in the bottom quartile was 47 lower than the mean rate in the top quartile and the mean mortgage rates in the top and bottom quar tiles were statistica lly different from each other at the 99 level of significance21 these results indicate that an incentive to shop for the best credit terms would have ex isted given the wide range of available interest rates table 2 do interest rate differentials

share of high credit quality borrowers would be expected to pay rates in the bottom quartile doeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34442crs9 aggressive shopping help high credit quality borrowers receive more favorable pricing answers to these questions require first identifying high credit quality mortgage holders the scf does not have credit score information so proxy for borrower creditworthiness was constructed high credit quality borrower therefore is defined as one who has re ported not being behind 2 months or more making loan repayments in the last year not being turned down completely for credit in the last 5 years and n ever having filed for bankruptcy after controlling for year of loan origination degree of creditworthiness and borrower risk preferences the results in table 3 indicate pricing di fferences did exist among high credit quality borrowers the results also show that less than onethird of high credit quality borrowers reported ggressively shopping for the best credit terms according to table 3 76 of all borrowers paying rates in the lower 25 percentile of the normalized mortgage loan rate distribution were high credit quality borrowers and 633 of all borrowers payi ng rates in the uppe r percentile were of high credit quality although the share of high quality borrowers in the top quartile is smaller than the share in the bottom quartile there is still large share of borrowers paying relatively higher loan rates given their seemingly low levels of credit risk table 3 rates paid by high credit quality borrowers on fixedrate mortgages actual

borrowers have loan rates in the upper quartile of the distribution one ex planation may be an increase in lending practices resulting in borrowers only able to obtain high priced loans another explanation may be that consumers did not aggressively shop for the best credit terms the results in table 3 reflect low degree of aggressive shopping by consumers less than onethird of high credit quality borrowers report aggressive shopping for the best credit terms and the difference between the percentages of high credit quality shoppers in th quartiles is still relativel small shopping may arguably not matter for high credit quality borrowers in the bottom quartile since more than twothirds managed to get better pricing without being aggressive shoppers the results in table 2 however suggest strong incentive to shop did exist given that the interest rates in the quartiles were significantly different hence it may be surprising that fewer high cred it quality households especially those in the top quartile of the distribu tion reported being aggressive when shopping for the besthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34442crs10 22 discrimination cannot be prov using scf data federal agencies follow interagency fair lending examination procedures provided by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec to evaluate unl awful discrimination the department of justice which investigates fair lending cases establishes pattern of discrimination before charging lenders with violation of federal discrimination laws the information necessary to establish any patterns of discrimination is not available from scf data see httpwwwdallasfedorgcapubsfairhtml and http wwwffiecgovpdf fairlendpdfterms of course responde nts may have app lied various subjec tive interpretations of aggressive when answering the survey question which could affect the results to what extent might discrimination explain the pricing differential the weighted percentages for black and hispan ic borrowers have also been reported in table 3 approximately 17 of the high credit quality borrowers in the bottom quartile were black or hispanic only 279 of the minority borrowers reported shopping aggressively for lower terms which was not much different from the percentage of the entire sample almost 25 of the high credit quality borrowers in the top quartile were black or hispanic and 416 reported s hopping aggressively for the best credit terms greater info rmation on the credit shopping experiences of minority borrowers would therefore be us eful component to further investigation of this question minorities ma have established fewer rela tionships with traditional financial institutions and therefore be more likely to feel intimidated when dealing with them as result these borrowers mig ht be more prone to shopping within the universe of subprime lenders rather than seeking prime lenders in addition disparate impact which occurs when practice or procedure has less favorable consequences on particular groups may be factor if minorities disp roportionately earn less income and accumulate less wealth then loantovalue and qualifying ratios for these groups would be affected which w ould likely affect loan pricing hence it is possible for minority borrowers who aggr essively shop to pay higher loan rates if their shopping experiences are vastly different from the majority population22 the data from the 2004 scf suggests that less than third of all homebuyers shop aggressively for the best credit term s which raises questions about consumer judgment would disclosure reform have led to reduction of subprime mortgage troubles on the one hand if the mortga ge shopping experience is frustrating under current disclosures enhanced disclosure may help motivate more consumers to become more active shoppers on the ot her hand consumers who shop in casual manner for credit terms may not pay much attention to mortgage loan details regardless how they are presented as result it is difficult to determine whether enhanced or expanded disclosure woul d help more people obtain affordable mortgages since consumers are not requi red to shop aggressively when making financial decisions
