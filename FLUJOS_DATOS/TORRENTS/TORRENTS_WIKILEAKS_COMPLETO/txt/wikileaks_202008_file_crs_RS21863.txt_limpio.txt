provided marriage tax penalty relief increased the child tax credit and increased the alternative minimum tax amt exemption these changes were scheduled to phase in over period of several years congressional research service the library of congress crs2 all of the changes in egtrra including the tax rate changes will expire sunset after 2010 congress included the sunset in egtrra to avoid byrd rule section 313 of the 1974 congressional budget act as amended violation in the senate the byrd rule prohibits extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation1 under the rule extraneous matter includes among other things language that would cause an increase in the budget deficit or reduce budget surpluses in fiscal year beyond those covered by the reconciliation legislation as result of the byrd rule egtrra contained language providing for the expiration of all of its provisions at the end of calendar year 2010 since the years after 2010 were outside the reconciliation budget window in 2003 in response to economic conditions congress passed the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act jgtrra pl10827 jgtrra among other changes accelerated the implementation of certain tax reductions that were originally enacted as part of egtrra these included marriage tax penalty relief expansion of the 10 tax bracket an increase in the child tax credit and an increase in the amt exemption these changes were temporary and were scheduled to be in effect for two years 2003 and 2004 during this session congress faces the issue of whether to extend andor make httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21863 permanent these expiring tax provisions if the jgtrra reductions are not extended then in 2005 many taxpayers will see an increase in their federal income tax liabilities relative to their 2004 levels if the egtrra tax reductions are not made permanent then in 2011 almost all taxpayers will experience an increase in their federal income tax liabilities relative to their levels in 2010 counterbalancing congressional desire to provide continued tax reductions is congressional concern over the current and projected size of the federal budget deficit the revenue effects of extending and making permanent the 2001 and 2003 tax reductions are substantial the four tax bills extending and making permanent the 2001 and 2003 tax reductions that the house has passed to date have been estimated to reduce federal revenues by over 1 trillion between fy2005 and fy20142 the remainder of this report provides brief summary of the four tax bills extending the 2001and 2003 acts that have to date passed the house marriage tax penalty relief hr 4181 in 2001 egtrra increased the standard deduction and the width of the 15 tax bracket for joint returns to twice

estimate of the amt exemption increase tends to understate the actual longrun revenue effects of hr 4227 for two reasons first although the increase in the exemption is only in effect for 2005 congress may decide to extend the increase in the amt exemption over the entire forecast period without congressional action the number of taxpayers subject to the amt will jump from around 3 million in 2004 to over 36 million in 2014 assuming the other three tax cuts are extended4 second the jct estimate shows the revenue loss of extending the amt exemption relative to current law which assumes that the jgtrra marriage tax penalty tax relief provisions and the jgtrra increase in the 10 tax bracket will have expired in 2005 if these provisions were extended then the revenue cost of enacting hr 4227 would be higher although the jct does not provide revenue estimate of extending hr 4227 revenue estimate by the brookingsurban tax policy center indicates that if extended hr 4227 would reduce revenues by approximately 475 billion over the fy2005 through fy2014 period this estimate assumes that the other three tax bills hr 4181 hr 4275 and hr 4359 are eventually enacted table 5 shows the brookingsurban tax policy center revenue estimate of extending hr 4227 4 for more information see crs report rl30149 the alternative minimum tax for individuals and crs report rs21817 the alternative
