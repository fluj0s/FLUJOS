london 1064 f tremontpmat email april 16 classified by dcm richard lebaron for reasons 14 bd 1 snf summary and recommendation fco contacts explained may 14 that hmgs may 1 approval ref c for cedar sweep flights had been widely considered at mod and fco with some departments flagging concerns about the information provided by the usg hmg is concerned that the request for reconnaissance flights may have been made by the lebanese mod rather than the entire gol embassy will be receiving new letter from hmg setting out that hmg approval for cedar sweep was based on the understanding that the flights are approved by the entire gol secondly fco is concerned that human rights reports including the state departments own do not reflect the sterling reputation of the laf as conveyed in our april 14 request for use of akrotiri airbase hmg expects the united states to monitor use of the cedar sweep intel and ensure the laf lives up to its commitment to maintain high human rights standards embassy london is concerned by hmgs piling on of concerns and conditions which portend burdensome process for getting the rest of our intel flights approved per ref b we recommend high level approaches to mod and fco counterparts to register concern about these new conditions embassy beirut may also want to consider having the gol engage the british directly end summary concerns andor implied conditions 2 snf john hillman of fcos whitehall liaison department informed polmiloff may 14 of several hmg concernsconditions about cedar sweep that could jeopardize future use of british territory first hillman said that the fco regional bureau responsible for lebanon had questioned usg assurances that the reconnaissance missions were requested by the government of lebanon the regional bureau was concerned that the request for reconnaissance assistance may have only been made by the lebanese ministry of defense rather the entire lebanese cabinet which apparently requires consensus on controversial issues hmg believed the gol could disavow assertions that it requested reconnaissance assistance if the flights were made public hillman said that hmg was entitled to accept the usg understanding that mod was authorized to make the request on behalf of the entire gol hmg has sent embassy london followup letter not yet received emphasizing that hmgs may 1 approval was contingent on the understanding that the request was made by the gol hillman said that should the gol disavow the request and it become clear that the entire gol was not supportive of the flights hmg would have difficulty approving the involvement of british territory in cedar sweep 3 snf second hillman said the fco human rights department noted that despite the lebanese mods assurances that it would not use the shared intel unlawfully human rights watch and even the state departments own human rights report had documented cases of torture and arbitrary arrest by the laf hillman underscored that if there were any risk that detainees captured with the help of cedar sweep intel could be tortured hmg would expect the usg to impress upon the laf that assurances of lawful treatment must be upheld in practice furthermore hillman said to the extent that the usg becomes aware of arrests made as result of cedar sweep intel hmg expects the usg to ensure the detainees are treated lawfully if the us became aware of reasons to doubt laf assurances hmg would expect to be notified immediately hillman noted that these human rights considerations would undoubtedly be reviewed in the next cedar sweep approval cycle comment and recommendation 4 snf hillman emphasized that the decision to approve cedar sweep had been widely discussed in mod and fco with the decision made by minister kim howells but even foreign secretary had been informed he noted that the highly cautious approach is reflection of parliamentary public and media attention to issues involving uk complicity in human rights violations 5 snf embassy london finds these additional conditions for hmg approval and assumptions about our ability to monitor every cedar sweeprelated apprehension to be not only burdensome but unrealistic we recommend that dod and state officials raise with uk counterparts the concern that excessive conditions such as described above will hinder if not obstruct our cooperative counterterrorism efforts while we share hmgs concerns that human rights not be sacrificed for the sake of ct we cannot take riskavoidance approach to ct in which the fear of potentially violating human rights allows terrorism to proliferate in lebanon we also recommend that embassy beirut consider whether it would help to have the urge the gol engage the british directly hmg is supportive of the siniora government and may be less rigid if asked to assist by the siniora government itself visit londons classified website httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalunit ed_kingdom tuttle
