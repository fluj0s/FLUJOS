agents the introduction of claim states allows claims data to be reported progressively as the claim evolves through its lifecycle ensuring agents report accurate and complete data in timely ma nner the workcover provisional liability and claims guidelines introduced in january 2002 detail workcovers criteria for obtaining information relevant to the claim based upon these guidelines claim states have been constructed and agents are require d to obtain and report data in timely and progressive manner data item validations are affected by the concept of claim states the validation of data according to the above criteria will coincide with the introduction of the new reporting standard cl aim submission files defined by the claims system release number c14 04 or greater will be validated against the new validation rules for claims data all claims regardless of the value of the date claim entered agent system c 218 will be repo rted to workcover according to the new reporting standard where necessary agents will need to recode the liability status code c 229 to reflect the new reporting standard in preparing claims reporting submission to workcover agents must report on that submission all new claims incurred during the reporting period defined on the header record and all changes to claims data that has been previously reported to workcover workcover requires only changed data records to be reported ie basic claim record that has not changed since last reporting period will not be reported in this reporting period regardless of other information that may need to be reported to workcover eg payment claims data should not be reported without corresponding polic having been reported to workcover it will be necessary to ensure that relevant policy data has been reported to workcover in advance of related claims data where policy submission is provided on the same day as claim submission workcover will sche dule the processing of the policy submission as priority where an abort error prevents the loading of all policy data on submission including new policies or fatal error means the prevention of new policy being loaded to the workcover database r elated claims information for the new policypolicies on subsequent claims submission will not be accepted document name claims technical manual version 44 january 2008 released december 2007 trim

control record for subsequent submissions claim must only be reported when there has been change in the data only records that have data different to that previously supplied for claim shoul d be reported where claim is reported control record is mandatory submission for any particular claim can have any of record type 2 record identifier 1 through 9 for example if the only change to data is to do with non weekly payments only record identifier 5 contains the compensation payments record identifier 6 as estimates must always be reported for an open claim where liability status is not 01

ission start date c 15 and submission end date c16 that will define the reporting period if there is activity in week null submission ie header and trailer record only must be submitted workcover will negotiate lodgement schedules wi th individual agentsinsurers should an agent be unable to lodge submission according to the agreed schedule it will be necessary to notify workcover to make

critical errors such as missing record or record out of sequence processing stops at the point the error is identified and the remainder of the file is not p rocessed data from the submission is written to the database the submission processing produces report to identify abort errors the report will be emailed to the agents data exchan ge email address after each submission has been validated agents must correct errors in their computer system and resubmit the amended submission file to workcover there is one report produ ced from the abort error process titled clm401 claims

rrors that the agent must correct in subsequent submissions the submission is processed to workcovers database irrespective of the number of errors generated from the process workcover reserves the right to reject submissions which pass the abort error check but generate large number of fatal or suspect errors or contain other problems the agent will be required to correct and resubmit such submissions validation rules are divided into categories based on the severity of the error the validation rule categories are fatal and suspect fatal error processing fatal errors are major data errors such as incorrect format in an expected field claim stateevent individual claims in the submission file will be rejected the process checks the whole fi for errors suspect error processing suspect errors formerly known as non fatal errors identify suspect or potentially incorrect data these errors are less severe than fatal errors the agent must correct these errors in subsequent submissions 44 validation layer 1 file abort this validation layer will identify if the file is formatted correctly and acceptable for further validation criteria any file abnormalities will be identified during this layer of validation with the result being the return of the file to the agent for correction this validation layer targets the accuracy of the file structure format and will reject and report only on the first encountered inaccuracy if an abort error is identified further validation layers will not be ru n on the file 45 validation layer 2 data completeness fatal this validation layer will review the claims records identify triggered claim states and events rejecting claims records that have incomplete data reported for that stateevent this layer of validation will be targeting the completeness of data submitted it will focus on the expected data for claim state and event to ensure adequate information is at hand given the current state and decisions made on the
