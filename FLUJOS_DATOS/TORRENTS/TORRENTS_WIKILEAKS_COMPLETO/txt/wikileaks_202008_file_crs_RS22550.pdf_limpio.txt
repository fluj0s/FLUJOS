government and finance division november 8 2007 abstract the federal budget moved from surplus of 128 billion in 2001 to deﬁcit of 413 billion in 2004 in 2007 the deﬁcit equaled 163 billion this report compares the actual budget balance from 2001 to 2007 to the projection made by the congressional budget oﬃce cbo in january 2001 to determine what factors caused the budget to move from surplus to deﬁcit actual results diﬀered from cbos projection for three reasons legislative policy changes economic changes and technical changes over the past seven years as whole legislative changes accounted for about twothirds of the cumulative shift from projected surplus to deﬁcit the largest legislative changes that increased the deﬁcit were tax cuts and the increase in military spending in iraq and afghanistanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22550g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

federal budget moved from surplus of 128 billion in 2001 to deficit of 413 billion in 2004 in 2007 the deficit equaled 163 billion this report compares the actual budget balance from 2001 to 2007 to the projection made by the congressional budget office cbo in january 2001 to determine what factors caused the budget to move from surplus to deficit actual results differed from cbos projection for three reasons legislative policy changes economic changes and technical changes over the past seven years as whole legislative changes accounted for about twothirds of the cumulative shift from proj ected surplus to deficit the largest legislative changes that increased the deficit were tax cuts nd the increase in military spending in iraq and afghanistan the economic slowdown increased the size of the deficit from 2001 to 2003 since then the economy has had almost effect on the deficit actual economic growth in recent years has been nearly identical to what cbo projected before the tax cuts were passed this casts doubt on the claim that the tax cuts partly paid for themselves by boosting economic growth overall economic changes accounted for 7 of the cumulative shift to deficit over the past seven years technical changes to the projections occur when actual results turn out to be different from the noneconomic assumptions that are the basis of the projections for mandatory spending and revenues technical changes accounted for about onefourth of the cumulative shift to deficit over the past seven years large technical changes point to the great uncertainty behind budget projections even over short periods of time legislative reductions in revenue and increases in spending since 2001 have been large enough that even if economic and technical changes had been zero that is even if cbos projection had been perfectly accurate the budget would still have been in deficit from 2003 to 2007 nor has the decline in the deficit since 2004 been attributable to legislative changes which have continued to rise in cost over this period cumulatively legislative changes accounted for 98 of the shift to deficit in 2007 this report will be updated annually

year the budget moved into deficit and has remained there since the deficit peaked at 413 billion in 2004 and has since fallen to 163 billion in 2007 why did the budget move from surplus to deficit the simple answer is because congress chose an overall level of spending that exceeded their chosen revenue levels the budget is the sum of its parts so particular spending or tax decision can be taken in isolation and be said to have caused the deficit in an absolute sense furthermore some determinants of spending and revenues are not directly controlled by congress when economic conditions change spending and revenues automatically change without any change in law for example when economic growth slows the growth of taxable income slows so that less revenue is collected at given tax rate than previously likewise if slowdown in economic growth causes unempl oyment to rise spending on unemployment insurance and other meanstested mandatory spending programs will also rise without any change in law economists refer to these changes as automatic stabilizers because they automatically cause the deficit to rise when the economy slow s thereby helping to offset the slowdown in growth because of the deficits expansionary effects on aggregate spending1 for more detailed answer to the question of wh the budget moved from surplus to deficit it is necessary to have some benchmark to which the actual deficit can be compared one benchmark would be to compare the 2006 deficit to the 2001 surplus but this approach would be fraught with several difficulties for one thing spending and revenues are expected to rise over time because of inflation economic growth and so on so that 1 spent in 2006 is not comparable to 1 spent in 2001 for another the economy in 2006 is not at the same level of production or in the same position in the business cycle as the economy in 2001 so the economys effect on the budget is not the same either finally the same law yields different levels of spending or revenue over time for example entitlement spending can increase automatically if the number of beneficiaries increases therefore comparing spending or revenue levels from one year to the next could give the false impression that policy had changed when it had not this report uses different benchmark it compares the actual budget balance in the past six years to the january 2001 congressional budget offices cbo baseline projection of the surplus for each of those years cbo produces an updated 10year budget baseline projection twice every year 2 the baseline is projection of the future path of government spending and revenues under current policy assuming changes in the law as can be seen in table 1 cbo projected at that time that if policy had not changed the surplus would have grown each year3 any year could have been chosen as the benchmark this report uses their 2001 baseline as the benchmark because their 10year surpluses peaked in this projection in subsequent reports the surplus projections would be continually adjusted downward as cbo became progressively more pessimistic about the future path of revenues until the fall 2004 report since then cbo has become more optimistic about future revenues although revenues are still far lower today than they were projected to be in 2001 thus the results that follow are partly function of the benchmark chosen 1 see crs report rl31235 the economics of the federal budget deficit by brian w cashell 2 for the most recent cbo baseline see congressional budget office the budget and economic

balance and the actual budget balance in each of the past six years can be attributed to three broad causes legislative economic and technical changes first revenues have fallen and spending has risen due to legislative changes because as expected policy has changed since cbo made its projection in 2001 overall legislative changes account for about twothirds of the cumulative shif t from surplus to deficit over the past seven years the legislative changes that increased the deficit the most were the tax cuts the largest of which were pl 10716 and pl 10827 and the increase in military spending in iraq and afghanistan4 for the cumulative total increase in the deficit between 2001 and 2007 tax cuts accounted for about half of all legislative changes and military spending accounted for about one quarter with the other quarter being caused by higher mandatory and nonmilitary discretionary 4 the cost of revenue changes has declined since 2004 because of the expiration of certain tax provisions most notably accelerated depreciation for corporate investment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22550g22g145g142g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g4g158g141 g144g142g157g497g561g21g152

projection made in 2001 demonstrates that even if there had been ec onomic downturn or any other projection error legislative changes alone would still have caused budget deficit in each year from 2003 to 2007 the comparison also demonstrates that the decline in the deficit since 2004 is unrelated to policy changes legislative causes of the deficit have grown each year since 2001 it is only because economic changes and technical changes have become smaller that the deficit has declined since 2004 in 2007 the cumulative effects of legislative changes were responsible for 98 of the shift to deficit these legislative changes helped move federal revenues as share of gross domestic product gdp from 50year high in 2000 to 45year low in 2004 the subsequent rise in revenues brought revenues slightly above the 50year average share of gdp in 2007 meanwhile federal spending as share of gdp rose from its lowest level in 35 years in 2000 to level about equal to the 50year average in 2004 where it remained in 2007 of course an estimate of how much higher spendi ng contributed to the shift to deficit depends on ones baseline definition of spending under current policy because discretionary spending is largely determined on an annual basis and not bound by previous year law there is obvious definition of current policy for discretionary spending cbos mandated definition of current policy is that discretionary spending grows at the same rate as inflation many analysts have criticized this definition as being too low because it would have consistently underpredicted spending historically if higher rate of spending growth ie rate equal to gdp growth was assumed to represent current policy then cbos original estimates of future surpluses in 2001 would have been smaller and higher spending would have subsequently accounted for smaller proportion of the shift to deficit second actual economic conditions have differed from cbos 2001 projection as result revenues and spending are different than projected because of automatic stabilizers higher than expected inflation and lower than expected interest rates these are shown as economic changes in the table the economic recession of 2001 was an important cause of the deficit in 2002 and 2003 but after 2003 economic conditions made barely any contribution to the shift to deficit for the seven years as whole economic changes accounted for about 7 of the shift to deficit the effect of the economy on the budget balance actually turned out to be slightly better in 2005 2006 and 2007 than was projected in 2001 third after legislative changes and the estimated effect of the economy are accounted for the remaining difference between the original projection and actual results is classified as technical changes these changes occur because cbos projections of revenues and mandatory spending are also based on other technical assumptions unrelated to the state of the economy and actual results will differ from these assumptions as well for example mandatory spending levels will depend on program participation rates that will differ from projected participation rates similarly tax revenues will depend not only on the growth in income but how quickly tax liability rises as income rises and how income growth is distribu ted across taxpayers most technical changes tend to be on the revenue side rather than the spending side of the budget technical changes peaked as cause of the shift to deficit at 259 billion in 2003 and have declined somewhat since then for 5 debt service is excluded from this calculation since the debt service shown in the table is the direct result of other legislative changes that increased government borrowing debt service also increased because of ec onomic and technical changes but that is not broken out separately in the table httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22550g22g145g142g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g4g158g141 g144g142g157g497g561g21g152

onequarter of the shift from surplus to deficit large economic and technical changes point to the significant uncertainty behind budget projections even over short periods of time for example holding policy constant the 2001 surplus was 72 billion smaller 37 billion due to economic changes 35 billion due to technical changes than cbos projection made only nine months earlier some technical changes are the result of legislative changes the cost of the legislative changes listed in table 1 are ex projections of their cost as scored by cbo and the joint committee on taxation made at the time the policy was enacted if policies turned out to be more less expensive than the official score this would appear in the table as negative positive technical change there has been recent discussion that the 2007 deficit was smaller than anticipated because the tax cuts partly paid for themselves through higher economic growth an effect that was not included in their original score table 1 suggests otherwisealthough the 2007 deficit was smaller than anticipated in projections made in 2004 and 2005 when cbo was extremely pessimistic about future revenues the deficit was much larger than anticipated in projections made before 2004 the 2001 projection of the state of the economy in 2007made before the tax cuts were enactedturned out to be extremely close to the actual state of the economy in 2007 in other words the actual performance of the economy after the tax cuts was almost identical to how cbo expected the economy to perform had there been tax cuts for example cbo projected in 2001 that economic growth without tax cuts would average 31 between 2003 and 2007 on fiscal year basis actual growth in those years equaled 30 furthermore there were extremely large technical revisions from 2002 to 2006 mostly because tax revenue turned out to be lower than expected after taking the tax cuts into account each year if anything this would suggest that tax cuts cost more in reality than the original score had anticipated rather than less 6 g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 marc labonte
