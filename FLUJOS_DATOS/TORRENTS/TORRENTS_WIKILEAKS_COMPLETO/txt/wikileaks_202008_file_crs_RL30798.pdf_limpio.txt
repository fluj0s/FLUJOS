the programs of the environmental protection agency epa ma ny of these have been amended several times the current provisions of each are briefly summarized in this report the pollution prevention act ppa seeks to prevent pollution through reduced generation of pollutant s at their point of origin the clean air act caa requires epa to set mobile source limits ambient air quality standards hazar dous air pollutant emission st andards standards for new pollution sources and significant deterior ation requirements and to focus on areas that do not attain standards the clean water act cwa establishes sewage treatment construction grants program and regulatory and enfo rcement program for discharges of wastes into us waters focusing on the regulation of the intentional disposal of materials into ocean waters and authorizing related research is the ocean dumping act the safe drinking water act sdwa establishes primary dr inking water standards regulates underground injection disposal practices and establishes groundwater control program the solid waste disposal act and resource conservation and recovery act rcra provide regulation of solid nd hazardous waste while the comprehensive environmental response compensa tion and liability act cercla or superfund provides authority for the federa l government to respond to releases of hazardous substances and established feemaintained fund to clean up abandoned hazardous waste sites the authority to collect fees has expired and funding is now provided from ge neral revenues the emergency planning and community righttoknow act requires industrial reporting of toxic releases and courages planning to respond to chemical emergencies the toxic substances control act tsca regulates the testing of chemicals and their use and the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra governs pesticide products and their use parts of some statutes preexisted the epas formation in 1970 but most of contemporary

september 30 1991 september 30 1983 september 30 1982 permanent note house rules require enactment of an authorization before an appropriation bill can be considered but this requirement can be waived and frequently has been thus while appropriation authorizations in environmental statutes have expired from time to time programs have continued and have been funded through appropriations legislation these dates do not indicate termination of program authority pollution prevention act of 19901 the pollution prevention act of 1990 re quires the environmental protection agency to establish an office of pollu tion prevention devel op and coordinate pollution prevention strategy and develop source reduction models the act requires owners and operators of manufacturing facilities to report annually on source reduction and recycling activities and authorizes epa to collect data collection on pollution prevention background enactment of the pollution prevention ac t of 1990 marked turning point in the direction of us environmental protec tion policy from an earlier focus on the need to reduce or repair environmental damage by controlling pollutants at the point where they are released to the environment ie at the end of the pipe or smokestack at the boundary of polluters private property in transit over public highways and waterways or after disposal congress enacted this law withe goal of achieving pollution prevention through reduced generation of pollutants at their point of origin broad support for this po licy change was based on the notion thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs3 traditional approaches to pollution contro l had achieved progress but may in the future be supplemented with new approach that might better address crossmedia pollution transfers the need for cost effective alternativ and methods of controlling pollution from dispersed or nonpoint sources of pollution pollution prevention also referred to as source reduction is viewed by its advocates as the first in hierarchy of options to reduce risks to human health and the environment where prevention is not possible or may not be costeffective other options would include recycling followed next by waste treatment according to environmental standards and as last resort safe disposal of waste residues source reduction is the preferred strategy for environmental protection because it often is costeffective offers industry s ubstantial savings in reduced consumption of raw materials pollution control costs and liability costs reduces risks to workers and reduces risk to the envi ronment and public health in 1990 opportunities for source reduction ppeared to be plentiful but often were unrealized or rejected by industrie s without adequate consideration the act was meant to increase interest in source reduction and encourage adoption of cost effective source reduction practices the law was enacted as title vi of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 and is codified as 42 usc 1310113109 provisions section 6602b of the pollution prevention ac t states that it is the policy of the united states that pollution should be pr evented or reduced at the source whenever feasible pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally sa fe manner whenever feasible and disposal or other release into the environment should be employed only as last resort and should be conducted in an nvironmentally safe manner section 66035 define s source reduction as any practice which i reduces the amount of any hazardous substance pollutant or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment including fugitive emissions prior to recycling treatment or disposal and ii reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substanc pollutants or contaminants section 6604 of the act required epa to establish an office of pollution prevention the office must be independent of the singlemedium program offices but was given authority to re view and advise those offices to promote an integrated multimedia ie air land and water pproach to source reduction epa was directed to develop and implement deta iled and coordinated st rategy to promote source reduction to consider the effect on source reduction of all epa programs and regulations and to identify and make recommendations to congress to eliminate barriers to source reduction epa also must conduct workshops and produce andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs4 disseminate guidance documents as part of training program on source reduction opportun ities for state and federal enforcement officers of environmental regulations epas strategy issued in 1991 identifies goals tasks target dates resources required organizational res ponsibilities and criteria to evaluate program progress in addition the act requires epa to prom ote source reduction practices in other federal agencies and to identify opportunities to use federal procurement to encourage source reduction to facilitate source reduc tion by industry epa is required under section 6604 to develop test and disse minate model source reducti on auditing procedures to highlight opportunities promote research and development of source reduction techniques and processes with broad applicability establish an nnual award program to recognize innovative programs estab lish program under section 6605 of state matching grants for programs to provide technical assistance to business and disseminate information about source reduc tion techniques through clearinghouse established in section 6606 the act also includes provisions to improve data collection and public access to environmental data section 6604b directs epa to develop improved methods of coordinating streamlinin g and assuring access to data collected under all federal environmental statutes an advisory pane l of technical experts is established to advise the administrator on ways to impr ove collection and di ssemination of data with respect to data collected under fe deral environmental statutes section 6608 directs epa to evaluate data gaps nd data duplication as well as methods of coordinating streamlining and improving public access section 6607 requires owners and opera tors of many i ndustrial facilities to report annually on their releases of toxic chemicals to the environment under the emergency planning and community righ ttoknow act of 1986 section 313 the pollution prevention act requires these repor ts to include information about the facilitys efforts in source reduction and recycling specifically reports must include the quantity of the toxic chemical entering any waste stream or released to the environment prior to recycling treatment or disposal the quantity of toxic substance recycled on or offsite the source reduction practices used quantities of toxic chemical expected to enter waste streams and to be recycled in the two years following the year for which the report is prepared ratio

science and industry divisionthe clean air act2 the clean air act codified as 42 u sc 7401 et seq seeks to protect human health and the environment from emissions th at pollute ambient or outdoor air it requires the environmental protection agency to establish minimum national standards for air quality and assigns primary responsibility to the states to assure compliance with the standards areas not meeting the standards referred to as nonattainment areas are required to implement specified air pollution control measures the act establishes federal sta ndards for mobile sources of air pollution for sources of 188 hazardous air pollutants and for the emissions that cause acid rain it establishes comprehensive permit system for all major sources of air pollution it also addresses the prevention of polluti on in areas with clean air and protection of the stratospheric ozone layer background like many other programs administe red by the environmental protection agency federal efforts to control air po llution have gone th rough several phases beginning with information collection research and technical assistance before being strengthened to establish federa l standards and enforcement federal legislation addressing air pollution was first passed in 1955 prior to which air pollution was the exclusive responsibility of state and local levels of government table 3

subsequent amendments notably the clean air act amendments of 1970 1977 and 1990 the 1970 amendments established procedures under which epa sets nationa l standards for air quality required 90 reduction in emissions from new autom obiles by 1975 established program to require the best available control technology at major new sources of air pollution established program to regulate air to xics and greatly strengthened federal enforcement authority the 1977 amendmen ts extended deadlines and added the prevention of significant dete rioration program to protect air cleaner than national standards changes to the act in 1990 included pr ovisions to 1 classify most non attainment areas according to the extent to which they exceed the standard tailoring deadlines planning and controls to each areas status 2 tighten auto and other mobile source emission standards 3 requi re reformulated and alternative fuels in the most polluted areas 4 revise the air toxics section establishing new

update the enforcement provisions so that they pa rallel those in other pollution control acts including authority for epa to assess administrative penalties the remainder of this sec tion describes major programs required by the act with an emphasis on the changes established by the 1990 amendments national ambient air quality standards in section 109 the act requires epa to establish national ambient air quality standards naaqs for air pollutants that enda nger public health or welfare in the administrators judgment and whose pres ence in ambient air results from numerous or diverse sources the naaqs must be designed to protect public health and welfare with an adequate margin of safety using this authority epa has promulgated naaqs for six air po llutants sulfur dioxide so2 particulate matterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs8 3 unlike the other naaqs pollu tants ozone is not directly emitted but rather is formed in the atmosphere by the interaction of volatile organic compounds vocs and nitrogen oxides nox in the presence of sunlight the control of ozone is thus based on regulating emissions of vocs and noxpm25 and pm10 nitrogen dioxide no2 carbon monoxide co ozone3 and lead the act requires epa to review the scientific data upon which the standards are based and revise the st andards if necessary every five years more often than not however epa has taken more than five years in reviewing and revising the standards originally the act required that the naaqs be attained by 1977 at the latest but the states experienced widespread diffi culty in complying with these deadlines as result the deadlines have been extended several times under the 1990 amendments most areas not in atta inment with naaqs must meet special compliance schedules staggered according to the severity of an areas air pollution problem the amendments also established specific requirements for each nonattainment category as described below state implementation plans while the act authorizes the epa to t naaqs the states are responsible for establishing procedures to attain and maintain the sta ndards under section 110 of the act the states adopt plans known as state implementation plans sips and submit them to epa to ensure that they are adequate to meet statutory requirements sips are based on emission inventories and computer models to determine whether air quality violations will occur if these data show that standards would be exceeded the state must impose additional c ontrols on existing sources to ensure that emissions do not cause exceed ances of the standards proposed new and modified sources must obtain state construction permits in which the applicant shows how the anticipated emissions will not exceed allowable limits in ozone nonattainment areas emissions from new or m odified sources must also be offset by reductions in emissions from existing sources the 1990 amendments require epa to im pose sanctions in areas which fail to submit sip fail to submit an adequate sip or fail to implement sip unless the state corrects such failures 2to1 emi ssions offset for the construction of new polluting sources is imposed 18 months afte r notification to the state and ban on most new federal highway grants is imposed six months later an additional ban on air quality grants is discretionary ultimately federal implementation plan may be imposed if the state fails to submit or implement an adequate sip the amendments also require that in nonattainment areas federal permits or financial assistance may be granted for activities that do not conform to state implementation plan this requirement can cause temporary suspension in funding for most new highway and transit projects unless an area demonstrates that the emissions caused by such projects are consistent with attainment and maintenancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs9 4 epa has modified the ozone standard specif ied in the statute as 012 parts per million averaged over 1hour period to 008 parts per million averaged over an 8hour period through regulations promulgated in july 1997 in april 2004 the agency promulgated an implementation rule for this new 8hour standar d under this rule the 1hour standard was revoked as of june 15 2005 and areas that had not yet attained it were converted to new classifications depending on their 8hour centration of ozone as result of court challenges the ramifications of this conver sion to the 8hour standard are still unfolding but in general the former 1hour nonattainment ar eas remain subject to the controls specified for their 1hour category new nonattainment ar eas that did not exceed the 1hour standard but do violate the 8hour standard in general are subject to more flexible controls under subpart 1 sections 171179b of the actof ambient air quality standards demons trating conformity of transportation plans and sips is required in nonattainment areas whenever new plans are submitted nonattainment requirements in major departure from the prior law the 1990 clean air act amendments grouped most nonattainment areas into classifications base d on the extent to which the naaqs was exceeded and established sp ecific pollution controls and attainment dates for each classification these requirements are desc ribed here as spelled out in sections 181193 of the act4 nonattainment areas are classified on the basis of design value which is derived from the pollutant concentration in parts per million or micrograms per cubic meter recorded by air quality monitoring devices the design value for the onehour ozone standard was the fourth highest hourly reading measured during the most recent threeyear period using these sign values the act created five classes of ozone nonattainment as shown in table 4 only angeles fell into the extreme class but 97 other areas were cl assified in one of the other four ozone categories simpler classification sy stem established m oderate and serious nonattainment areas for carbon monox ide and particulate matter with correspondingly more stringent control re quirements for the more polluted class as shown in the table the deadlines for attainment fo r ozone nonattainment areas stretched from 1993 to 2010 depending on the severity of the problem under the 8hour rule these deadlines are changed to 2007 to 2021 for carbon

on april 14 2005 states will have three years subsequent to designation to submit state implementation plans additional regulations pr omulgated in october 2006 will strengthen the pm25 standard emission standards for mobile sources title ii of the clean air act has required emission standards for automobiles since 1968 the 1990 amendments significantly tightened these standards for cars the hydrocarbon standard was reduced by 40 and the nitrogen oxides nox standard by 50 the standa rds referred to as tier 1 standards were phased in over the 19941996 model years the amendments envisioned further set of reductions tier 2 standards but not before model year 2004 for tier 2 sta ndards to be promulgated the agency was first required to report to congress cerning the need for further emission reductions the availability of technology to achieve such reductions and the cost effectiveness of such controls compared to other means of attaining air quality standards epa submitted this report to congress in august 1998 concluding that further emission reductions were needed and that technology to achieve such reductions was available and costeffective tier 2 standards requiring emission reductions of 77 to 95 from cars and light trucks were prom ulgated in february 2000 and are being phased in over the 20042009 model years to facilitate the use of more effective emission controls the standards also required more than 90 reduction in the sulfur content of gasoline beginning in 2004 the 1990 amendments also stipulated th at oxygenated gasoline designed to reduce emissions of carbon monoxide be so ld in the worst co nonattainment areas and that reformulated gasoline rfg designed to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds and toxic air pollutant s be sold in the nine worst ozone nonattainment areas angeles sa n diego houston baltimore philadelphia new york hartford chicago and milw aukee metropolitan washington dc and four areas in california were added to the mandatory list later other ozone nonattainment areas can opt in to the rf g program as of 2006 additional areas in 11 states had done so the fuels provisions were modified by the energy policy act of 2005 removing the requirement that rf g contain oxygenates instead the 2005 law required the use of increasing amounts of renewable fuel most likely to be ethanol in motor fuels beginning in 2006 use of alternative fuels and development of cleaner engines was also to be stimulated by the cleanfuel fleet program in all of the most seriously polluted ozone and co nonattainment ar eas centrally fueled fleets of 10 or more passenger cars and lightduty trucks must purchase at least 30 cleanfuel vehicles when they add new vehicles to existing fleets startin g in 1999 the act originally required thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs14 program to begin in 1998 but the start was layed by year the percentage rose to 50 in 2000 and 70 in 2001 heavyduty fleets are required to purchase at least 50 cleanfuel vehicles annually clean fuel vehicle is one which meets low emission vehicle lev standards nd operates on reformulated gasoline reformulated diesel meth anol ethanol natural gas liquefied petroleum gas hydrogen or electricity in addition to the bove program californias ze ro emission vehicle zev program also is intended to promote th development of alternative fuels and vehicles section 209b of the clean ai r act grants california the authority to develop its own vehicle emissions standards if those standards are at least as stringent as the federal standards in addition to setting more stringent standards for all vehicles california used this authority to establish program requiring auto manufacturers to sell zevs electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the state beginning in 2003 this program has been substantially modified since it was enacted and now allows credit for hybrid nd partial zev vehicles in addition to true zevs but it has served as an incubato r for lower emission technologies since its adoption section 177 of the act allows ot her states to adopt californias stricter standards 10 states connecticut maine massachusetts new jersey new york oregon pennsylvania rhode island verm ont and washington have already adopted them or are in the process of doing so the 1990 amendments also imposed tight er requirements on certification an autos useful life is defined as 100000 miles instead of the earlier 50000 miles on emissions allowed during refueling on low temperature co emissions on inuse performance over time and on warranties for the most expensive emission control components 8 years80000 miles for the cat alytic converter electronic emissions control unit and onboard emissions diagnosti c unit regulations were also extended to include nonroad fuels and engines standards for trucks and buses using diesel engines were also strengthened the 1990 amendments required new urban bus to reduce emissions of diesel particulates 92 by 1996 and all other heav yduty diesel engines to achieve an 83 reduction by the same year nox emissions must also be reduced 33 by 1998 authority to further strengthen these st andards led to promulgation in january 2001 of new emission standards requiring further 9095 reduction in emissions phased in over the 20072010 model years nd reduction of 97 in the allowable amount of sulfur in highway diesel fuel these regulations were followed in may 2004 by similar requirements for nonroad dies equipment whic h will be phased in between 2007 and 2015 hazardous air pollutants completely rewritten by the clean ai r act amendments of 1990 section 112 of the act establishes programs for protec ting public health and the environment from exposure to toxic air pollutants as re vised by the 1990 amendments the section contains four major provisions maximu m achievable control technology mact requirements healthbased standards st andards for stationary area sources small but numerous sources such as gas stations or dry cleaners that collectively emithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs15 5 the 1990 amendments specified 189 polluta nts but pl 102187 enacted on december 4 1991 deleted hydrogen sulfide from the list of toxic pollutants leaving 188 significant quantities of hazardous polluta nts and requirements for the prevention of catastrophic releases first epa is to establish technolog ybased emission sta ndards called mact standards for sources of 188 pollutants listed in the legislation and to specify categories of sources subject to the emission standards5 epa is to revise the standards periodically at least every eight years epa can on its initiative or in response to petition add or delete substances or sour ce categories from the lists section 112 establishes presumption in favor of regulation for the designated pollutants it requires regulation of the pollutants unless epa or petitioner is able to show that there is adequate data on th health and environm ental effects of the substance to determine that emissions ambient concentrations bioaccumulation or deposition of the substance may not reasonabl be anticipated to cause any adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects epa is required to set standards for sources of the listed pollutants that achieve the maximum degree of reduc tion in emissions taking into account cost and other nonairqua lity factors the standards for new sources shall not be less stringent than the most stringent emissions level that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source the standards for existing sources may be less stringent than those for new sources but must be less stringent than the emission limitations achieved by either the best performing 12 of existing sources if there are more than 30 such sources in the category or subcategory or the best performing five similar sources if there are fewer than 30 existing sources are given three years following promulgation of standards to achieve compliance with possible oneyear extension additional extensions may be available for special circumstances or for certain categories of sources ex isting sources that achieve voluntary early emissions reductions will receive sixy ear extension for compliance with mact the second major provision of section 112 directs epa to set healthbased standards to address situations in which significant residual risk of adverse health effects or threat of adverse environmental effects remains after installation of mact this provision requires that epa after consultation with the surgeon general of the united states submit report to congress on the public health significance of residual risks and recomme nd legislation regarding such risks if congress does not legislate in response to epas recommendations then epa is required to issue standards for categories of sources of hazardous air pollutants as necessary to protect the public health with an ample margin of safety or to prevent an adverse environmental eff ect residual risk standard is required for any source emitting cancercausing pollutant that poses an added risk to the most exposed person of more than one in million resi dual risk standards are due eight years after promulgation of mact for the affect ed source category existing sources have 90 days to comply with residual risk st andard with possible twoyear extension in general residual risk standa rds do not apply to area sourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs16 the law directed epa to contract with the national academy of sciences nas for study of risk assessment thodology and created risk assessment and management commission to investigat and report on policy implications and appropriate uses of risk assessment and risk manage ment in 1994 nas published its report science and judgment in risk assessment the commission study framework for environmental health risk management was released in 1997 third in addition to the technologybase d and healthbased programs for major sources of hazardous air pollution epa is to establish standards for stationary area sources determined to present threat of adverse effects to human health or the environment the provision requires epa to regulate the stationary area sources responsible for 90 of the emissions of th 30 hazardous air pollutants that present the greatest risk to public health in the largest number of urban areas in setting the standard epa can impose less stringent g enerally available control technologies rather than mact finally section 112 addresse s prevention of sudden catas trophic releases of air toxics by establishing an independent ch emical safety and hazard investigation board the board is responsible for inve stigating accidents involving releases of hazardous substances conducting studies and preparing reports on the handling of toxic materials and measures to reduce the risk of accidents epa is also directed to issue prevention detection and correction requirements for catastrophic releases of air toxics by major sources section 112r requires owners and operators to prepare risk management plans including hazard assessments measures to prevent re leases and response program new source performance standards section 111 of the act requires epa to establish nationally uniform technology based standards called new source performance standards or nsps for categories of new industrial f acilities these standards accomplish two goals first they establish consistent baseline for pollution control that competing firms must meet and thereby remove any incentive for states or communities to weaken air pollution standards in order to attract polluting indus try and second they preserve clean air to accommodate future growth as well as for its own benefits nsps establish maximum emission levels for new major stationary sources powerplants steel mills and smelters for example with the emission levels determined by the best adequately monstrated continuous control technology available taking costs in to account epa must regula rly revise and update nsps applicable to designated sources as new technology becomes available since the goal is to prevent new pollution problems from veloping and to force the installation of new control technology the standards also apply to modifications of existing facilities through process called new source review nsr the laws ambiguity regarding what constitutes modification subj ect to nsr as opposed to routine maintenance of facility has led to litigation with epa proposing in recent years to modify its interpretation of the requi rements of this section httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs17 solid waste incinerators prior to 1990 solid waste incinerators which emit wide range of pollutants were subject to varying degrees of stat and federal regulation depending on their size age and the type of waste burne d in new section 129 the 1990 amendments established more consistent federal requirements specify ing that emissions of 10 categories of pollutants be regulated at new and existing incinerators burning municipal solid waste medical waste nd commercial and indus trial waste the amendments also established emissi ons monitoring and operator training requirements prevention of significant deteriorationregional haze sections 160169 of the act establis h requirements for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality psd the psd program reflects the principle that areas where air quality is better than that required by naaqs should be protected from significant new air polluti on even if naaqs would not be violated the act divides clean air areas into three classes and specifies the increments of so2 and particulate pollution allowed in eac h class i areas include international and national parks wilderne ss and other pristine areas allowable increments of new pollution in these areas are very small class ii areas include all attainment and not classifiable areas not designated as class i allowable increments of new pollution in these areas are modest class iii represents selected areas that states may designate for development allowable increments of new pollution are large but not exceeding naaqs through an elaborate hearing and review process state can have regions redesignated from class ii to class iii alt hough none have yet been so redesignated while the 1977 amendments only stipulat ed psd standards for two pollutants so2 and particulates epa is supposed to establish standards for other criteria pollutants thus far only one of the ot her four has been addressed the agency promulgated standards for no2 in 1988 newly constructed polluting sources in psd areas must install best available control technology bact that may be more strict than that required by nsps the justifications of the policy are that it protects air quality provides an added margin of health protection preserves clean air fo r future development and prevents firms from gaining competitive edge by shopping for clean air to pollute in sections 169a and b the act also sets national goal of preventing and remedying impairment of visibility in national parks and wilderness areas and requires epa to promulgate regulations to assure reasonable progress toward that goal in the 1990 amendments congress st rengthened these provisions which had not been implemented the amendments required epa to establish grand canyon visibility transport commission composed of governors from each state in the affected region an epa designee and representative of each of th national parks or wilderness areas in the region other visibility transport co mmissions can be established upon epashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs18 discretion or upon petition from at least two states within 18 months of receiving report from one of these commissions epa is required to prom ulgate regulations to assure reasonable progress toward the visibility goal including requirements that states update their state implementation plans to contain emission limits schedules of compliance and other measures n ecessary to make reasonable progress specifically mentioned is requirement that states impose best available retrofit technology on existing sources of emissions impairing visibility the grand canyon commission delivered set of recommendations to epa in june 1996 and the agency subsequently promulgated regional haze program applicable to all 50 states under this authority acid deposition control the clean air act amendments of 1990 added an acid deposition control program title iv to the act it set go als for the year 2000 of reducing annual so2 emissions by 10 million tons from 1980 levels and re ducing annual nox emissions by 2 million tons also from 1980 levels the so2 reductions were imposed in two steps under phase 1 ownersoperators of 111 electric generating facilities listed in the law that are larger than 100 megawatts had to meet tonna ge emission limitations by january 1 1995 this would reduce so2 emission by about 35 million tons phase 2 included facilities larger than 75 gawatts with deadline of january 1 2000 compliance has been 100 to introduce some flexibility in the distribution and timing of reductions the act creates comprehensive permit and emissions allowancetrading system an allowance is limited authorization to emit ton of so2 issued by epa the allowances would be allocated to phase 1 and phase 2 units in accordance with baseline emissions estimates powerplants which commence operation after november 15 1990 would not receive any llowances these new units would have to obtain allowances offsets from holders of existing allowances allowances may be traded nationally during ither phase the law also pe rmits industrial sources and powerplants to sell allowances to utility systems under regulations to be developed by epa allowances may be banked by utility for future use or sale the act provided for two types of sales to improve the liquidity of the allowance system and to ensure the availability of allowances for utilities and independent power producers who need them first special reserve fund consisting of 28 of phase 1 and phase 2 allowance allocations has been set aside for sale allowances from this fund 25000 annually from 1993 to 1999 and 50000 thereafter are sold at fixed price of 1500 an allowan ce independent power producers have guaranteed rights to thes allowances under certain c onditions second an annual open auction sells allowances 150000 from 1993 to 1995 and 250000 from 1996 to 1999 with minimum price utilities with excess allowances may have them auctioned off at this auction nd any person may buy allowances the act essentially caps so2 emissions at individual existing sources through tonnage limitation and at future plants through the allowance system firsthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs19 emissions from most existing sources are capped at specified emission rate multiplied by an historic ba seline level second for plants commencing operation after november 15 1990 emissions must be completely offset with add itional reductions at existing facilities beginning after phase 2 compliance however as noted above the law provides some allowances to future powerplants which meet certain criteria the utility so2 emission cap is set at 89 million tons with some exceptions the act provides that if an affected unit does not have sufficient allowances to cover its emissions it is subject to an excess emission penalty of 2000 per ton of so2 and required to reduce an additional ton of so2 the next year for each ton of excess pollutant emitted the act also requires epa to inve ntory industrial emissions of so2 and to report every five years beginning in 1995 if th inventory shows that industrial emissions may reach levels above 560 milli on tons per year then epa is to take action under the act to ensure that the 560 million ton cap is not exceeded the act requires epa to set specific nox emission rate limitations 045 lb per million btu for tangentiallyfired boile rs and 050 lb per million btu for wall fired boilers unless those rate s can not be achieved by lownox burner technology tangentially and wallfired boilers affected by phase 1 so2 controls must also meet nox requirements epa was to set emission limitations for other types of boilers by 1997 based on lownox burner costs which epa did in addition epa was to propose and promulgate revised new source performance standard for nox from fossil fuel steam generating units which epa also did in 1998 permits the clean air act amendments of 1 990 added title v to the act which requires states to administer comprehensive permit program for the operation of sources emitting air pollutants these requirements are modeled after similar provisions in the clean water act previously the clean air act contained limited provision for permits requiring only new or modified major stationary sources to obtain construction permits unde r section 165 of the act sources subject to the permit requirements generally include major sources that emit or have the potential to emit 100 tons per year of any regulated pollutant plus stationary and area sources that emit or have potential to emit lesser specified amounts of hazardous air pollutants ho wever in nonattainme nt areas the permit requirements also include sources which emit as little as 50 25 or 10 tons per year of vocs depending on the verity of the regions nonatta inment status serious severe or extreme states were required to develop permit programs and to submit those programs for epa approval by november 15 1993 epa had one year to approve or disapprove states submission in whole or in part after the effective date of state plan sources had 12 months to submit an actual permit applicationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs20 states are to collect annual fees from s ources sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of administering the permit program with revenues to be used to support the agencys air pollution control program the fee must be at least 25 per ton of regulated pollutants excluding carbon monoxide permitting authorities have discretion not to collect fees on emissions in excess of 4000 tons per year and may collect other fee amounts if appropriate the permit states how much of which air pollutants source is allowed to emit as part of the permit process source must prepare compliance plan and certify compliance the term of permits is limited to more than five years sources are required to renew permits at that time state permit authorities must notify contiguous states of permit pplications that may affect them the application and any comments of contiguous states must be fo rwarded to epa for review epa can veto permit however this authority is essentially limited to major permit changes epa review need not include permits which simply codify elements of states overall clean air plan and epa has discretion to not review permits for small sources holding permit to some extent shields source from enforcement actions the act provides that source cannot be held in violation if it is complying with explicit requirements addressed in permit or if the state finds that certain provisions do not apply to that source enforcement section 113 of the act which was also strengthened by the 1990 amendments covers enforcement the section establishe s federal authority to issue agency and court orders requiring compliance and to impose penalties for violations of act requirements section 114 aut horizes epa to require s ources to submit reports to monitor emissions and to certify compliance with the acts requirements and authorizes epa personnel to conduct inspections like most federal environmental statutes the clean air act is enforced primarily by states or local governments they issue most permits monitor compliance and conduct the majority of inspections the federal government functions as backstop with authority to review state actions the agency may act independently or may file its own enforcement action in cases where it concludes that states response was inadequate the act also provides for citizen suits both against persons including corporations or government agencies alle ged to have violated emissions standards or permit requirements and against epa in cases where the administrator has failed to perform an action that is not discretiona ry under the act citizen groups have often used the latter provision to compel the administrator to promulgate regulations required by the statute the 1990 amendments elevated penaltie s for some knowing violations from misdemeanors to felonies removed the ability of source to avoid an enforcement order or civil penalty by ceasing violation within 60 days of notice gave authority to epa to assess administr ative penalties and author ized 10000 awards to persons supplying information leading to convictions under the act httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs21 stratospheric ozone protection title vi of the 1990 clean air act ame ndments represents the united states primary response on the domestic front to the ozone depletion issue it also implements the us intern ational responsibilities under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer and its amendments indeed section 606a3 provides that the environmental protection agency shall adjust phaseout schedules for ozonedepleting substances in accordance with any future changes in montreal protocol schedules as result the phaseout schedules contained in title vi for various ozonedepleting compounds ve now been superseded by subsequent amendments to the montreal protocol since passage of title vi ozonedepleting substances such as cfcs methyl chloroform carbon tetrachloride and halons referred to as class 1 substances have been phased out by industrial countries in cluding the united states new uses of hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfcs called class 2 substances under title vi are banned beginning january 1 2015 unless the hcfcs are recycled used as feedstock or used as refri gerant for appliances manufactured prior to january 1 2020 production of hcfcs is to be frozen january 1 2015 and phased out by january 1 2030 exemptions consistent w ith the montreal protocol are allowed the epa is required to add any substa nce with an ozone depletion potential odp of 02 or greater to the list of cla ss 1 substances and t phaseout schedule of more than seven years for example methyl bromide odp estimated by epa at 07 was added to the list in decembe r 1993 requiring its phaseout by january 1 2001 this decision was altered by congress in 1998 to harmonize the us methyl bromide phaseout schedule with the 2005 dead line set by the parties to the montreal protocol in 1997 also epa is required to add any substance that is known or may be reasonably anticipated to harm the stratosphere to the list of class 2 substances and set phaseout schedule of more than ten years title vi contains several implementing strategies to avoid releases of ozone chemicals to the atmosphere including 1 fo r class 1 substances used as refrigerants lowest achievable level of use and emissions maximum recycling and safe disposal required by july 1 1992 2 fo r servicing or disposing refrigeration equipment containing class 1 and 2 substa nces venting banned as of july 1 1992 3 for motor vehicle air cond itioners containing class 1 or 2 substances recycling required by january 1

act6 the principal law governing pollution of the nations surface waters is the federal water pollution control act or clean water act originally enacted in 1948 it was totally revised by amendments in 1972 that gave the act its current shape the 1972 legislation spelled out ambitious programs for water quality improvement that have since been expanded and are still being implemented by industries and municipalities congress made certain finetuning amendments in 1977 revised portions of the law in 1981 nd enacted further amendments in 1987 table 6 lists the original law and major

oversight and implementation by claudia copeland background the federal water pollution control ac t of 1948 was the first comprehensive statement of federal interest in clean water programs and it specifically provided state and local governments with techni cal assistance funds to address water pollution problems including research wa ter pollution was viewed as primarily state and local problem hence there were federally required goals objectives limits or even guidelines when it came to enforcement federal involvement was strictly limited to matters invol ving interstate waters and only with the consent of the state in which the pollution originatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs29 during the latter half of the 1950s and well into the 1960s water pollution control programs were shaped by four laws which amended the 1948 statute they dealt largely with federal assistance to municipal dischargers and with federal enforcement programs for all dischargers during this period the federal role and federal jurisdiction were gradually extended to include navigable intrastate as well as interstate waters water quality standards became feature of the law in 1965 requiring states to set standards for interstate waters that would be used to determine actual pollution levels by the late 1960s there was widespread perception that existing enforcement procedures were too timeconsuming and that the water quality standards approach was flawed because of difficulties in linking particular discharg er to violations of stream quality standards additionally there was mounting frustration over the slow pace of pollution cleanup efforts and suspic ion that control tec hnologies were being developed but not applied to the problems these per ceptions and frustrations along with increased public interest in envir onmental protection set the stage for the 1972 amendments the 1972 statute did not continue the ba sic components of previous laws as much as it set up new ones it set optimistic and ambitious goals required all municipal and industrial wastewater to be treated before being discharged into waterways increased federal assistance fo r municipal treatment plant construction strengthened and streamlined enforcement and expanded the federal role while retaining the responsibility of states fo r daytoday implementation of the law the 1972 legislation declared as its obj ective the restorati on and maintenance of the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nations waters two goals also were established zero discharge of pollutants by 1985 and as an interim goal and where possible water quality that is both fishable and swimmable by mid1983 while those dates ve passed the goals remain and efforts to attain the goals continue the clean water act cwa today consists of two major parts one being the title ii and title vi provisions which authorize federal financial assistance for municipal sewage treatment pl ant construction the other is regulatory requirements found throughout the act that apply to industrial and muni cipal dischargers the act has been termed technologyfo rcing statute because of the rigorous demands placed on those who are regulated by it to achieve higher and higher levels of pollution abatement industries were given until july 1 1977 to install best practicable control technology bpt to clean up waste disc harges municipal wastewater treatment plants were require d to meet an equivalent goal termed secondary treatment by that date municipalitie s unable to achieve secondary treatment by that date were allowed to apply for casebycase extensions up to july 1 1988 according to epa 86 of all c ities met the 1988 deadline the remainder were put under judicial or administrative schedules requiring compliance as soon as possible however many cities esp ecially smaller ones continue to make investments in building or upgrading facilities needed to achieve secondary treatment cities that discharge wastes into marine waters were eligible for casebycase waivers of the secondary treatment requirement where sufficienthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs30 showing could be made that natural factors provide significant elimination of traditional forms of pollution and that both balanced populations of fish shellfish and wildlife and water quality standards would be protected the act required greater po llutant cleanup than bpt by later than march 31 1989 generally demanding that industry use the best available technology bat that is economically achievable compliance extensions of as long as two years are available for industrial sources utilizing i nnovative or alternative technology failure to meet statutory deadlines could lead to enforcement action control of toxic pollutant discharges has been key focus of water quality programs in addition to the bpt and bat national standards st ates are required to implement control strategies for waters expected to remain polluted by toxic chemicals even after industria l dischargers have installe d the best available cleanup technologies required under th law development of management programs for these postbat pollutant problems was prominent element in the 1987 amendments and is key continui ng aspect of cwa implementation prior to the 1987 amendments programs in the clean water act were primarily directed at pointsource pollu tion wastes discharged fro m discrete and identifiable sources such as pipes and other outfalls in contrast except for general planning activities little atte ntion had been given to nonpointsource pollution stormwater runoff from agricultural lands forests cons truction sites and urban areas despite estimates that it represents more than 50 of the nations remaining water pollution problems as it travels across land surface towards rivers and streams rainfall and snowmelt runoff picks up pollutants includi ng sediments toxic materials and conventional wastes eg nutrients that can degrade water quality the 1987 amendments authorized meas ures to address such pollution by directing states to deve lop and implement nonpoint po llution management programs section 319 of the act st ates were encouraged to pursue groundwater protection activities as part of their ove rall nonpoint pollution control fforts federal financial assistance was authorized to support monstration projects and actual control activities these grants may cover up to 60 of program implementation costs while the act imposes great technological demands it also recognizes the need for comprehensive research on water quality problems this is provided throughout the statute on topics including polluti on in the great lakes and chesapeake bay inplace toxic pollutants in harbors and navigable waterways and water pollution resulting from mine drainage the act also provides support to train personnel who operate and maintain wastewater treatment facilities federal and state responsibilities under this act federal jurisdiction is broad particularly rega rding establishment of nati onal standards or effluent limitations the environmental protection agency epa issues regulations containing the bpt and bat effluent standa rds applicable to categories of industrial sources such as iron and steel manufact uring organic chemical manufacturing petroleum refining and others certain responsibilities are delegated to the states and this act like other environmental laws embodies philosophy of federalstate partnership in which the fe deral government sets the agenda and standards forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs31 pollution abatement while states carry out daytoday activities of implementation and enforcement delegated responsib ilities under the act include authority for qualified states to issue discharge per mits to industries nd municipalities and to enforce permits as of december 2006 45 st ates had been delegated the permit program epa issues discharge permits in the remaining states in addition states are responsible for tablishing water quality standards which consist of designated use recreation wate r supply industrial or other plus numerical or narrative statement identifying maximum concentrations of various pollutants which would not interfere with th designated use these standards serve as the backup to federally set technolog ybased requirements by indicating where additional pollutant controls are needed to achieve the overall goals of the act titles ii and vi m unicipal wastewater treatment construction federal law has authorized grants fo r planning design and construction of municipal sewage treatment facilities since 1956 act of july 9 1956 or pl 84660 congress greatly expanded this gr ant is program in 1972 since that time congress has authorized 65 billion and ppropriated more than 76 billion in clean water act funds to aid wastewater infrast ructure plant construction not including congressionally earmarked appropriations for specific projects grants are allocated among the states according to complex statutory formula that combines two factors state population and an estimate of muni cipal sewage treatme nt funding needs derived from biennial survey conducted by epa and the states the most recent epastate estimate co mpleted in 2000 indicated that nearly 181 billion is needed to build and upgrade needed municipal wastewater treatment plants in the united states and for other types of water quality improvement projects that are eligible for funding under the act in 2002 epa released new report called the gap analysis which estimated that ove r the next two decades the united states needs to spend nearly 390 billion to re place existing wastewat er infrastructure systems and to build new ones estimate s of future funding needs and questions about federal support tinue to be prominent under the title ii construction grants program establis hed in 1972 federal grants were made for severa l types of projects such as secondary or more stringent treatment and associated sewers based on priority list established by the states grants were generally available for as much as 55 of total project costs for projects using innovative or alternative chnology such as reuse or recycling of water as much as 75 federal funding was allowed recipien ts were responsible for nonfederal costs but were not required to repay federal grants policymakers have debate d the tension between assisting municipal funding needs which remain large and the impact of grant programs such as the clean water acts on federal spending nd budget deficits in the 1987 amendments to the act congress attempted to deal with that appa rent conflict by exte nding federal aid for wastewater treatment c onstruction through fy1994 yet providing transition towards full state and local government re sponsibility for financing after that datehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs32 grants under the traditional title ii pr ogram were authorized through fy1990 under title vi of the act grants to capitalize state water pollution control revolving funds or loan programs were authorized beginning in fy1989 to replace the title ii grants states contribute matching f unds and under the revolving loan fund concept monies used for wastewater treatment constructi on will be repaid to state to be available for future construction in other communities all states now have functioning loan programs but the shift from federal grants to loans since fy1991 has been easier for some than othe rs the new financ ing requirements have been problem for cities especially small towns that have difficulty repaying project loans statutory authorization fo r grants to capitalize state loan programs expired in 1994 however congress has tinued to provide nnual appropriations permits regulations and enforcement to achieve its objectives the act embodies the concept that all discharges into the nations waters are unlawful unless specifically authorized by permit thus more than 65000 industrial and municipal dischargers must obtain permits from epa or qualified states under the acts national pollutant di scharge elimination system npdes program authorized in s ection 402 of the act an npdes permit requires the discharger sour ce to attain technologyba sed effluent limits bpt or bat for industry secondary treatment for m unicipalities or more stringent for water quality protection permits specify the control tec hnology applicable to each pollutant the effluent limitations discharger must meet and the deadline for compliance sources are required to maintain records and to carry out effluent monitoring activities permits are issued for fiveyear periods and must be renewed thereafter to allow continued discharge the npdes permit incorporates numerical effluent limitations issued by epa the initial bpt limitations focused on regu lating discharges of conventional pollutants such as bacteria and oxygenconsuming materials the more stringent bat limitations emphasize controlling toxic pollutants heavy metals pesticides and other organic chemicals in addition to these limitations applicable to categories of industry epa has issued water quality criteria for more than 115 pollutants including 65 named classes or categories of toxic chemicals or priority pollutants these criteria recommend ambient or overall concentration levels for the pollutants and provide guidance to states for establishing water quality standards that will achieve the goals of the act separate type of permit is required to dispose of dredge or fill material in the nations waters including wetlands aut horized by section 404 of the act this permit program is administered by the us army corps of engineers subject to and using epas environmental guidance so types of activities are exempt from these permit requirements including certain farming ranching and forestry practices which do not alter the use or character of the land some construction and maintenance and activities ready regulated by states under other provisions of the act epa may delegate cer tain section 404 permitting responsibility to qualified states and has done so twice michigan nd new jersey for some time the acts wetlands permit program has been one of the most controversial parts of the law some who wish to develop wetlands maintain that federal regulation intrudes on andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs33 impedes private landuse decisions while nvironmentalists seek more protection for remaining wetlands and limits on activities that ta ke place in wetlands nonpoint sources of pollution which epa nd states believe are responsible for the majority of water quality impairments in the nation are not subject to cwa permits or other regulatory requirements under federal law they are covered by state programs for the management of runoff under section 319 of the act other epa regulations under the cwa include guidelines on using and disposing of sewage sludge and guidelines for discharging pollutants from landbased sources into the ocean related statute the ocean dumping act regulates the intentional disposal of wastes into ocean waters epa also provides guidance on technologies that will achieve bpt bat and other effluent limitations the npdes permit containing effluent limitations on what may be discharged by source is the acts principal enforcement tool epa may issue compliance order or bring civil suit in us district court against persons who violate the terms of permit the penalty for such vi olation can be as much as 25000 per day stiffer penalties are authorized for criminal violations of the act for negligent or knowing violations of as much as 50000 per day three years imprisonment or both fine of as much as 250000 15 years in prison or both is authorized for knowing endangerment violations that knowingly place another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury finally epa is authorized to assess civil penalties administratively for certain welldocumented violations of the law these civil and criminal enforcement provisions are contained in section 309 of the act epa working with the army corps of engineers also has responsibility for enforcing against entities who engage in activities that destroy or alter wetlands while the cwa addresses federal enforcement the majority of actions taken to enforce the law are undertaken by states both because states issue the majority of permits to dischargers and because the federal government lacks the resources for daytoday monitoring and enforcement like most other fe deral environmental laws cwa enforcement is shared by epa and states with states having primary responsibility however epa has oversight of state enforcement and retains the right to bring direct action where it believes that state has failed to take timely and appropriate action or where state or local agency request s epa involvement finally the federal government acts to enforce against criminal violations of the federal law in addition individuals may bring citizen suit in us district court against persons who violate prescr ibed effluent standard or limitation individuals also may bring citizen suits against the administr ator of epa or equivalent state official where program responsibility s been delegated to the state for failure to carry out nondiscretionary duty under the

enters marine waters it knows boundary thus series of regional treaties and c onventions pertaining to local marine pollution problems and more comprehensive intern ational conventions providi ng uniform standards to control worldwide marine pollution has evolved over the last 35 years at the same time that ke international protocols were being adopted and ratified by large number of countries wo rldwide early 1970s the united states enacted the mprsa to regulate disposal of wastes in marine waters that are within us jurisdiction it utilizes comprehe nsive and uniform waste management system to regulate disposal or dum ping of all materials into ocean waters prior to 1972 us marine waters had been used extens ively as convenient alternative to land based sites for the disposal of various wa stes such as sewage sludge industrial wastes and pipeline discharges and runoff the basic provisions of the act have remained virtually unchanged since 1972 but many new authorities have been added these newer parts include 1 research responsibilities for epa 2 specific direc tion that epa phase out the disposal of harmful sewage sludges and industrial wa stes 3 ban on the ocean

for longrange research on the effects of humaninduced changes to the marine environment while epa is authorized to carry out research and demonstration activities related to phasing out sewage sludge and industria l waste dumping the coast guard is charged with maintaining surveillance of ocean dumping regulating ocean dumping title i of the mprsa prohibits all ocean dumping except that allowed by permits in any ocean waters under us juri sdiction by any us vessel or by any vessel sailing from us port the act bans any dumping of radiological chemical and biological warfare agents and any highlevel radioactive waste and medical wastes permits for dumping of other materials except dredge spoils can be issued by the epa after notice and opportunity fo r public hearings where the administrator determines that such dumping will not unreasonably degrade or endanger human health welfare the marine environment ecological systems or economic potentialities epa designates sites for cean dumping and specifies in each permit where the material is to be disposed in 1977 congress amended the act to requi re that dumping of municipal sewage sludge or industrial wastes which unreas onably degrade the environment cease by december 1981 in 1986 amendments congress di rected that ocean disposal of all wastes cease at the traditional 12mile site off the new yorknew jersey coast that is barred issuance of permits at the 12mile site and be moved to new site 106 miles offshore in 1988 congress enacted several laws amending the ocean dumping act with particul ar emphasis on phasing out wage sludge and industrial waste disposal in the ocean which tinued despite earlier legislative efforts in 1992 congress amended the act to permit states to adopt ocean dumping standards more stringent than federal standards and to require that permits conform with longterm management plans for designated marine dumpsites to ensure that permitted activities are consistent with expected uses of the site virtually all ocean dumping that occurs today is dredged material sediments removed from the bottom of water bodies in order to maintain navigation channels and berthing areas the corps of engin eers issues permits for ocean dumping of dredged material the bulk of which results from maintenance dredging by the corps itself or its contractors according to data compiled by the corps each year an average of 70 million cubic yards of dredged sediment material is disposed of in the ocean at designated sites before sediments can be permitted to be dumped in the ocean they are evaluated to ensure that the dumping will not cause significanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs40 harmful effects to human health or the mari ne environment epa is responsible for developing criteria to ensure that the ocean disposal of dredge spoils does not cause environmental harm permits for ocean dispos of dredged material are to be based on the same criteria utilized by epa under other provisions of the act and to the extent possible eparecommended dumping sites are used where the only feasible disposition of dredged material would vi olate the dumping criteria the corps can request an epa waiver amendments enacted in 1992 expanded epas role in permitting of dredged material by author izing epa to impose permit conditions or even deny permit if necessary to prevent environmental problems permits issued under the ocean dumping ac t specify the type of material to be disposed the amount to be transported fo r dumping the location of the dumpsite the length of time the permit is valid and special provisions for surveillance the epa administrator can require permit applicant to provide information necessary for the review and evaluation of the application enforcement the act authorizes epa to assess civ il penalties of not more than 50000 for each violation of permit or permit requirement taking into account such factors as gravity of the violation prior violations and demonstrations of good faith however penalty can be assessed til after notice and opportunity for hearing criminal penalties including izure and forfeiture of vessels for knowing violations of the act also are authorized in addition th act authorizes penalties for ocean dumping of medical wastes civ il penalties up to 125000 for each violation and criminal penalties up to 250000 five year s in prison or both the coast guard is directed to conduct surveillance and other appropr iate enforcement activities to prevent unlawful transportation of material for dum ping or unlawful dumping like many other federal environmental laws the ocean dumping act allows individuals to bring citizen suit in us district court against any pers on including the united states for violation of permit or other prohibition limitation or criterion issued under title i of the act in conjunction with the ocean dumping act the clean water act cwa regulates all discharges into navigable waters including th territorial seas although these two laws overlap in their covera ge of dumping from vessels within the territorial seas any question of conflict is essentially moot because epa has promulgated uniform set of standa rds 40 cfr parts 220229 the ocean dumping act preempts the cwa in coastal waters or open oceans and the cwa controls in estuaries stat are permitted to regulate cean dumping in waters within their jurisdiction under certain circumstances the act also requires the epa administrator to the extent possible to apply the standards and criteria binding upon the unite d states that are stated in the 1972 convention on the prevention of marine po llution by dumping of wastes and other matters known as the london dumping conve ntion this convention signed by more than 85 countries includes annexes that prohibit the dumping of mercury cadmium and other substances such as ddt and pcbs solid wastes and persistent plastics oil highlevel radioactive wastes and chemical and biological warfarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs41 agents and requires special permits for other heavy metals cyanides and fluorides and medium and lowleve l radioactive wastes research and coastal wa ter quality monitoring title ii of the mprsa authorizes two types of research general research on ocean resources under the jurisdiction of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and epa research related to phasing out ocean disposal activities noaa is directed to carry out comprehe nsive longterm research program on the effects not only of ocean dumping but also of pollution overfishing and other humaninduced changes on the marine ecosystem additionally noaa assesses damages from spills of petrol eum and petroleum products epas research role includes research investigations expe riments training demonstrations surveys and studies to minimize or end the dumping of sewage sludge and industrial wastes along with res earch on alternatives to ocean disposal amendments in 1980 required epa to stud technological options for removing heavy metals and certain organic materials from new york citys sewage sludge title iv of the mprsa established nine regional marine research boards for the purpose of developing comprehensive mari ne research plans considering water quality and ecosystem conditions and re search and monitoring priorities and objectives in each region the plans afte r approval by noaa and epa are to guide noaa in awarding research grant funds under this title of the act title v of the mprsa established national coastal water quality monitoring program it directs epa and noaa jointly to implement longterm program to collect and analyze scientific data on the environmental quality of coastal ecosystems including ambient water quality health and quality of living resources sources of environmental degr adation and data on trends results of these activities including intensive monitoring of ke coastal waters are intended to

standards and treatment requirements for public water supplies control underground injection of wastes finance infrastructure projects and protect sources of drinking water the 1974 law established the current federalstate arrangement in which states may be delegated primary implementation and enforcement authority for the drinking water program the stateadministered public water suppl supervision pwss program remainshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs44 the basic program for regulating the nation s public water systems and 49 states have assumed this authority sd wa appropriations

107188 background as indicated by table 10 the safe drinking wate r act has been amended several times since enactment of the safe drinking wa ter act of 1974 pl 93523 congress enacted pl 93523 after nationwid studies of community water systems revealed widespread water quality probl ems and health risks resulting from poor operating procedures inade quate facilities nd poor management of public water supplies in communities of all sizes the 1974 law gave epa substantial discretionary authority to re gulate drinking water conta minants and gave states the lead role in implementation and enforcement the first major amendments pl 99 339 enacted in 1986 were largely intended to increase the pace at which ep regulated contaminants from 1974 until 1986 epa had regulated just one additional contaminan t beyond the 22 standards previously developed by the public hea lth service the 1986 amendments required epa to 1 issue regulations for 83 specifi ed contaminants by june 1989 and for 25 more contaminants every three years thereafter 2 promulgate requirements for disinfection and filtra tion of public water supplies 3 ban the use of lead pipes and lead solder in new drinking water systems 4 establish an elective wellhead protection program around public wells 5 tablish demonstration grant program for state and local authorities having designated solesource aquifers to develop groundwater protection programs and 6 i ssue rules for monitoring injection wells that inject wastes below drinking water source the amendments also increased epas enforcement authority the lead contamination control act of 1988 pl 100572 added new part f to the sdwa these provisions were intended to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water by requiring the recall of l eadlined water coolers and requiring epahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs45 to issue guidance document and testing prot ocol for states to help schools and day care centers identify and correct lead c ontamination in school drinking water after the regulatory schedule mandate d in the 1986 amendments proved to be unworkable for epa states nd public water systems the 104th congress made sweeping changes to the act with the sdwa amendments of 1996 pl 104182 as overarching themes these amendments aimed to target resources to address the greatest health risks add some regulato ry flexibility provide funding for federal drinking water mandates and improve water systems compliance capacity the amendments revoked the requirement that epa regulate 25 new contaminants every three years and provided riskbased approach for selecting contaminants for regulation among other changes congress added some flexibility to the standard setting process required epa to conduct health risk reduction and cost analyses for most new standards authorized state revolving loan fund srf program to help public water systems finance projects need ed to meet sdwa requirements added programs to improve small system compliance expanded consumer information requirements increased the acts focus on pollution prevention through voluntary source water protection program and streamlined the acts enforcement provisions pl 104182 extended authorizations fo r appropriations under the act through fy2003 in june 2002 drinking water security provisions were added to the sdwa through the public heath security and bi oterrorism prepare dness and response act of 2002 pl 107188 key provisions of the act include requirements for community water systems serving mo re than 3300 individuals to conduct vulnerability assessments and prepare em ergency preparedness and response plans and requirements for epa to conduct resear ch on preventing and responding to terrorist or other attacks national drinking water regulations key component of the sdwa is th requirement that epa promulgate national primary drinking wa ter regulations for contaminants that may pose health risks and that are likely to be present in public water supplies section 1412 instructs epa on how to select contaminants fo r regulation and specifies how epa must establish regulations once contaminant s been selected the regulations apply to the roughly 168000 privately and publicly ow ned water systems that provide piped water for human consumption to at least 15 service connections or that regularly serve at least 25 people epa has issued regulations for roughly 90 contaminants contaminant selection and regulatory schedules section 1412 as amended in 1996 directs epa to select cont aminants for regulatory consideration based on occurrence health effects nd meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction starting in 1998 and every five years thereafter epa must publish list of contaminants that may warrant regulation starting in 2001 and every five years thereafter epa must determine whether or not to regulate at least five of the listed contaminants the act requires epa to evaluate contaminants that present the greatest health concern and to regulate contaminants that occur at concentration levels and frequencies of public health concern the amendments also includedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs46 schedules for epa to complete regulati ons for specific contaminants ie radon arsenic disinfectants and disinfection byproducts and cryptosproridium standard setting for each contaminant that epa determines requires regulation epa must set nonenforceab maximum contaminant level goal mclg at level at which known or antic ipated adverse health effects occur and which allows an adequate margin of safety epa must then set an enforceable standard maximum contaminant level mcl as close to the mclg as is feasible using best technology treatment techniques or other means available taking costs into consideration epa ge nerally sets standard s based on technologies that are affordable for large commun ities however under pl 104182 epa is now required when issuing regulation for contaminant to list any technologies or other means that comply with the mcl and that are affordable for three categories of small public water systems serving populations of 10000 or fewer if epa does not identify technologies that are afford able for small systems then epa must identify small system variance technolog ies or other means that may not achieve the mcl but are protective of public health another provision added in 1996 require s epa when proposing regulation to publish determination as to whether or not the benefits of the standard justify the costs if epa determines that the benefits do not justify the costs epa may with certain exceptions promulgate standard that maximizes health risk reduction benefits at cost that is justified by the benefits new sdwa regulations generally become effective three years after promulgation up to two additional years ma be allowed if epa or state in the case of an individual system determines the time is needed for capital improvements section 1448 outlines procedures for judicial review of epa actions involving the establishment of sdwa regulations and other final epa actions risk assessment the 1996 amendments also added risk assessment and risk communication provisions to sdwa when developing regulations epa is required to 1 use the best available peerreviewed science and supporting studies and data and 2 make public ly available risk assessment document that discusses estimated risks uncertainties and studies used in the assessment when proposing drinking water regulations epa must publish health risk reduction and cost analysis hrrca epa may promulgate an interim standard without first preparing this benefitcost analysis or making dete rmination as to whether the benefits of regulation would justify the costs if epa determines that contaminant presents an urgent threat to public health variances and exemptions in anticipation that some systems particularly smaller ones could have difficulty co mplying with every regulation congress included in the sdwa provisions for variances and exem ptions section 1415 authorizes state to grant public water system variance from standard if raw water quality prevents the standard from being met despite application of best technology and the variance does not result in an unreasonable risk to health 1996 provision subsection 1415e authoriz variances speci fically for small systems based on application of best affordable technology httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs47 when developing regulation if epa cannot identify technology that meets the standard and is affordable for small systems epa must identify variance technologies that are affordable but do not necessarily meet the standard in cases where epa has identified variance technol ogies states may grant small system variances to systems serving 3300 or fewer persons if the system cannot afford to comply with standard through trea tment an alternative water source or restructuring and the variance ensures ad equate protection of public health states also may grant these variances to sy stems serving between 3301 and 10000 persons with epa approval to receive small system variance the system must install variance technology section 1416 authorizes states to gr ant public water systems temporary exemption s from standards or treatment techni ques if system cannot comply for other compelling reasons including costs an exemption is intended to give water system more time to comply with regulation and can be issued only if it will not result in an unreasonable health risk qualified system may receive an exemption for up to three years beyond the complian ce deadline systems serving 3300 or fewer persons may receive maximum of three dditional twoyear extensions for total exemption duration of nine years state primacy section 1413 authorizes states to assu primary oversight and enforcement responsibility primacy for public water sy stems to assume primacy states must adopt regulations at least as stringent as national requirement s develop adequate procedures for enforcement adopt authority for adminis trative penaltie s maintain records and develop plan for providing emergency water supplies currently 55 of 57 states and territories have primacy authority the act authorizes 100 million annually for epa to make grants to stat to administer the public water system supervision program states may also use part of their srf grant for this purpose enforcement consumer information and citizen suits the safe drinking water act requires public water systems to monitor their water supplies to ensure compliance with drinking water standards and to report monitoring results to the states states review monitoring data submitted by public water systems or conduct their own mon itoring to determine system compliance with drinking water regulations epa monitors public water system compliance primarily by reviewing the violation data submitted by the states section 1414 requires that wh enever epa finds that public water system in state with primary enforcement authority does not comply with regulations the agency must notify the state and the system and provide assistance to bring the system into compliance if the state fails to commence enforcement action within 30 days after the notification epa is authorized to issue an administrative order or commence civil action in nonprimacy state epa must tify an elected local official if any has jurisdiction over the water system before commencing an enforcement action against the system httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs48 the 1996 amendments strengthened enfor cement authorities streamlined the process for issuing federal administrative orders increased administrative penalty amounts made more sections of the act clearly subject to ep enforcement and required states as condition of primacy to have administrative penalty authority the amendments also provided that forcement action may be taken against public water system that has plan to consolidate with another system consumer information and reports enforcement provisions also require public water systems to notify customers of violations of drinki ng water standards or other requirements such as monitori ng and reporting systems must notify customers within 24 hours of any violations that have the potential to cause serious health effects as result of shortterm exposure eg violations of microbial standards the amendments also require community water systems to mail to all customers an annual consumer confidence re port on contaminants detected in their drinking water states must prepare annua l reports on the compliance of public water systems and make summaries available to epa and the public and epa must prepare annual national co mpliance reports citizen suits section 1449 provides for citizen s civil actions citizen suits may be brought against any person or agency allegedly in violation of provisions of the act or against the administrator for alleged failure to perform any action or duty that is not discretionary compliance improvement programs the 1996 amendments added two stat eadministered programs aimed at improving public water system compliance with drinking water regulations the operator certification program and the capac ity development program section 1419 required states to adopt programs for trai ning and certifying operators of community and nontransient noncommunity systems g schools and workplaces that have their own wells in 1999 epa issued guidelines specifying minimum certification standards epa is required to withhold 20 of states revolving fund srf annual grant unless the state has adopted and is implementing an ope rator certification program section 1420 required states to establish capacity development programs also based on epa guidance these programs must include 1 legal authority to ensure that new systems have the technical financial and managerial capacity to meet sdwa requirements and 2 strategy to assist existing systems that are experiencing difficulties to come into co mpliance epa is required to withhold portion of srf grants from states that do not have capacity deve lopment strategies ground water protection programs most small water systems rely on ground water as source of drinking water and part c of the act focuses on ground wa ter protection section 1421 authorized the establishment of state underground injec tion control uic programs to protect underground sources of drinking water in 1977 epa issued mandated regulations containing minimum requirements for the unde rground injection of wastes into five classes of disposal wells and requiring states to prohibit any underground injection not authorized by state permit the law specified that the regulations could nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs49 interfere with the underground injection of brine from oil and gas production or recovery of oil unless underground sources of drinking water would be affected section 1422 authorized affect ed states to submit plans to epa for implementing uic programs and if appr oved to assume primary forcement responsibility epa is required to implement the program if states plan has not been approved or the state has chosen not to assume program responsibility section 1423 for oil and gas injection operations only states with uic programs are delegated primary enforcement authority without mee ting epa regulations section 1425 section 1424e authorizes epa to make determina tions on epas initiative or upon petition that an aquifer is the sole or principal drinking water source for an area in areas that overlie designated solesource aquifer federal funding may be committed for projects that epa determines may contaminate such an aquifer any person may petition for sole source aquifer designation the act contains three additional state programs aimed specifically at protecting ground water added in 1986 s ection 1427 established proce dures for demonstration programs to develop impleme nt and assess critical aquife r protection areas already designated by the administrator as sole source aquifers section 1428 also added in 1986 established an elective state pr ogram for protecting wellhead areas around public water system wells if state tablished wellhead protection program by 1989 and epa approved the stat program then epa may award grants covering between 50 and 90 of the costs of implementing the program section 1429 added in 1996 authorizes epa to make 50 gr ants to states to develop programs to ensure coordinated and comp rehensive protection of ground water within the states appropriations for these th ree programs and for uic state program grants were authorized through fy2003 source water assessment nd protecti on programs in 1996 congress broadened the acts pollution prevention focus to embrace surface water in addition to ground wate r protection section 1453 required epa to publish guidance for states to implement source water assessment programs that delineate boundaries of areas from which sy stems receive their water and identify the origins of contaminants in delineated areas to determine systems susceptibility to contamination states with approved assessm ent programs may adopt alternative monitoring requirements to provide syst ems with monitoring relief provided under section 1418 section 1454 authorized source wate r petition program based on voluntary partnerships between state nd local governments states may establish program under which community water system or local government may submit petition to the state requesting assistance in developing voluntary source water quality protection partnership to 1 reduce the presence of contaminants in drinking water 2 receive financial or technical assistan ce and 3 develop longterm source water protection strategy this section au thorized through fy2003 5 million each year for grants to states to support petition prog rams states also may use 10 of their annual srf grant to support various source water protection activ ities including the petition programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs50 state revolving funds in 1996 congress authorized drinking water state revolving loan fund dwsrf program to help systems finance improvements needed to comply with sdwa regulations section 1452 epa is au thorized to make grants to states to capitalize dwsrfs which states then may use to make loans to public water systems states must match 20 of the federal grant and grants are allotted among the states based on the results of the latest quadrennial needs survey each state and the district of columbia must receive at least 1 of the appropr iated funds state may transfer up to 33 of the grant to the clean water act cwa srf or an equivalent amount from the cwa srf to the dwsrf through fy2002 this authority has been extended in s ubsequent appropriations acts dwsrfs may be used to provide loan s for expenditures epa has determined will facilitate compliance or significantly further the acts health protection objectives states must make availabl 15 of their annual allotment for loan assistance to systems that serve 10000 or fe wer persons to the extent that funds can be obligated for eligible projects stat may use up to 30 of their dwsrf grant to provide loan subsidies including forg iveness of principal to help economically disadvantaged communities also states may use portion of funds for technical assistance source water protection and capacity development programs and for operator certification the law authoriz ed appropriations of 599 million for fy1994 and 1 billion per year for fy1995 through fy2003 for the dwsrf program drinking water security the 107th congress passed the public hea lth security and bioterrorism preparedness and response ac t of 2002 pl 107188 title iv of the bioterrorism act amended the sdwa to address threats to drinki ng water security key provisions are summarized below vulnerability assessments section 1433 was added to sdwa requiring each community water system serving mo re than 3300 individuals to conduct an assessment of the systems vulnerability to terrorist attacks or other intentional acts to disrupt the provision of safe and reliable drinking water supply this provision established deadlines based on system size for community water systems to certify to epa that they had conducted vulnera bility assessment and to submit to epa copy of the assessment the law required all these systems to complete vulnerability assessments by june 30 2004 or earlier section 1433 exempts the contents of the vulnerability assessments from disclosure under the freedom of information act except for information contained in the certification identifying the system and the date of the certification and provides for civil and criminal penalties for inappropriate disclosure of information by government officials in addition section 1433 required each co mmunity water system serving more than 3300 individuals to prepare or revise an emergency response plan incorporating the results of the vulnerability assessment epa was required to provide guidance to smaller systems on how to conduct vulnera bility assessments prepare emergency response plans and address threats httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs51 the act authorized 160 million for fy2002 nd such sums as may be necessary for fy2003 through fy2005 to provi financial assistance to community water systems to conduct vulne rability assessments to prepare response plans and to address basic security enhancements and significant threats the bioterrorism act also added ne w sdwa sections 1434 and 1435 directing the epa administrator to review methods by which terrorists or others could disrupt the provision of safe water supplies ep was required to review methods for preventing detecting and responding to such disruptions and methods for providing alternative drinking water supplies if wa ter system was destroyed or impaired the act authorized 15 million for fy2002 and such sums as may be necessary for fy2003 through fy2005 to carry out these sections emergency powers under section 1431 the ad ministrator has emergency powers to issue orders and commence civil action if 1 contaminant likely to enter public water supply system poses substan tial threat to public health and 2 state or local officials have not taken adequate action the bi oterrorism act amended this section to specify that epas emergency powers include the authority to act when there is threatened or potential terrorist attack or other intentional act to disrupt the provision of safe drinking water or to impact the safety of communitys water supply tampering with public water systems section 1432 provides for civil and criminal penalties against any person who tampers attempts to tamper or makes threat to tamper with public water system amendments made by the bioterrorism act increased criminal and civil penalties for tampering attempting to tamper or making threats to tamper with public water supplies the maximum prison sentence for tampering was increased from 5 to 20 years the maximum prison sentence for attempting to tamper or making threats to tamper was increased from 3 to 10 years the maximum fine that may be imposed for tampering was increased from 50000 to 1 million the maximum fine for attemptin g to tamper or threatening to tamper was increased from 20000 to 100000 emergency assistance sdwa subsection 1442b authorizes epa to provide technical assistance and to make gr ants to states and public water systems to assist in responding to and alleviating emergenc situations the bioterrorism act amended subsection 1442d to authoriz appropriations for such emergency assistance of not more than 35 million for fy2002 and such sums as may be necessary for each fiscal year thereafter other selected provisions section 1417 prohibits the use of pipe sold er or flux that is not lead free as defined by the sdwa in the installati on or repair of public water systems or plumbing in residential or other facilities providing drinking water it prohibits the sale of pipes and plumbing fixtures that ar not lead free and the sale of solder or flux that is not lead free unless it is pr operly labeled with the exception of pipeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs52 9 for purposes of section 1417 the term lead fre refers to solders and flux containing not more than 02 lead and refers to pipes and pipe fittings containing not more than 80 leadused in manufacturing or industrial processing9 the 1996 amendments also required limits to be set on the amount of lead that may leach from new plumbing fixtures section 1442 authorizes epa to conduct research on the causes treatment control and prevention of diseases resulting from contaminants in water section 1442b authorizes epa to make grants and provide technical assi stance to states or public water systems to assist them in responding to emergency situations 35 million are authorized to be appropriated each year for this purpose section 1442e authorized 15 million for each year thr ough fy2003 for epa to provide technical assistance to small public water systems and indian tribes to help them comply with sdwa regulations section 1458 direct ed epa to conduct studies regarding subpopulations at greater ri sk biological mechanisms and waterborne disease occurrences section 1447 provides that any federal agency having jurisdiction over federally owned and maintained public water systems must comply with all federal state and local drinking water requirements as well as any underground injection control programs the president may exempt facility from compliance with requirement if he determines it to be in the mount interest of the country to do so exemptions last one year but add itional exemptions may be granted under section 1457 epa may use the estr ogenic substances screening program created in the food qua lity protection act of 1996 pl 104170 to provide for testing of substances that may be found in drinking water if the administrator determines that substa ntial population may be exposed to such substanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs53

luther analyst in environmental policy in the resources science and industry divisionsolid waste disposal act resource conservation and recovery act10 the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 rcra established the federal program regulating solid and hazardous waste management rcra actually amends earlier legislation the solid waste disposal act of 1965 but the amendments were so comprehensive that the act is commonly called rcra rather than its official title the act defines solid and hazardous waste authorizes epa to set standards for facilities that generate or manage hazardous waste and establishes permit program for hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities rcra was last reauthorized by the hazardous and solid waste amendments of 1984 the amendments set deadlines for permit issuance prohibited the land disposal of many types of hazardous waste without prior treatment required the use of specific technologies at land disposal facilities and established new program regulating underground storage tanks the authoriz ation for appropriations under this act expired september 30 1988 but funding for the epas pr ograms in this area has

applicable to each generator category see epas hazardous waste generators we bpage at h ttp wwwepagovepaoswer oswgen_transgeneratehtmbackground federal solid waste law has gone through four major phases the solid waste disposal act passed in 1965 as title ii of the clean air act of 1965 focused on research demonstrations and training it provided for sharing with the states the costs of making surveys of waste disposal practices and problem s and of developing waste management plans the resource recovery act of 1970 changed the whole tone of the legislation from efficiency of disposal to concern with the reclamation of energy and materials from solid waste it authorized grants for demonstrating new resource recovery technology and requi red annual reports from epa on means of promoting recycling and reducing the genera tion of waste in third phase the federal government embarked on more ac tive regulatory role embodied in the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 rcra instituted the first federal permit program for zardous waste management pr ograms and prohibited open dumps in fourth phase embodied in the hazardous and solid waste amendments of 1984 the federal governme nt attempted to prevent future cleanup problems by prohibiting land disposal of untreated zardous wastes setting liner and leachate collection requirements for land disposal facilities setting deadlines for closure of facilities not meeting standards and establishing corrective action program regulation of hazardous waste subtitle c of rcra created hazardous waste management program11 waste is considered hazardous if it is solid wa ste that is ignitable corrosive reactive or toxic or appears on list of about 100 industrial process wa ste streams and more than 500 discarded commercial products and chemicals some wastes are specifically excluded however including i rrigation return flows industrial point source discharges regulated under the cl ean water act and nuclear material covered by the atomic energy act under rcra hazardous waste generators must comply with regulations concerning record keeping and reporting waste accumulation time limits and storage requirements12 rcra regulations also require hazardous generators transporters and treatment storage and disposal facilities tsdfs to use manifest system to track waste from its point of origin to its u ltimate point of treatment or disposal ie cradle to gravehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs57 13 if the new epa standard is less stringent than states existing standard the state may choose not to adopt it 14 for information on the status of individua l state programs and authorities see epas rcra state authorization page available online at httpwwwepagov epaoswerhazwastestate 15 see epas hazardous waste rcra sub title d webpage at http wwwepagov region02wastedsummaryhtmtransporters of hazardous waste must also meet certain standards these regulations were coor dinated by epa with existing regulations of the department of transportation hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities tsdfs are required to have permits to comply with operating standards specified in that permit to meet financial requirements in cas of accidents and to clos their facilitie s in accordance with epa regulations the 1984 ame ndments imposed number of new requirements on tsdfs with the intent of minimizing land disposal bulk or noncontainerized hazardous liquid wastes are prohibited from disposal in any landfill and severe re strictions are placed on the dis posal of containerized hazardous liquids as well as on the disposal of nonhazardous liquids in hazardous waste landfills the land disposal of specified highly hazardous wastes was phased out over the period from 1986 to 1990 epa was direct ed to review all wastes that it has defined as hazardous and to make determination as to the appropria teness of land disposal for them minimum technological standards were set for new landfills and surface impoundments requiring in genera l double liners leachate collection system and groundwater monitoring states are encouraged and financially assisted to assume epas hazardous waste program which went into effect nove mber 19 1980 all 50 states and territories have been granted authority to impleme nt the base rcra pr ogram state rcra programs must be at least as st ringent as the federal program as epa develops new regulations st ates program must be reviewed to determine whether the state has authority to enforce comparable requirements13 as result many states are also authorized to implement individual rcra program elements that epa promulgated after 1984 eg corrective action landfill disposal restrictions and recycled used oil management standards14 solid waste provisions subtitle d of rcra establishes state and local governments as the primary planning regulating and implementing entities for the management of nonhazardous solid waste such as house hold garbage and nonhazardous industrial solid waste15 significant solid waste provision in rcra is the prohibition of open dumps this prohibition is implemented by the states using epa criteria to determine which facilities qualify as sanitary landfills and may remain open epas criteria were originally promulgated in 1979 open dumps were to close or be upgraded by september 13 1984httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs58 in the 1984 amendments to rcra epa was required to revise the sanitary landfill criteria for fac ilities that receive hazardous wa ste from small businesses ie conditionally exempt small quantity genera tors cesqg or households using this authority the agency promulgated revised regulations applicable to municipal solid waste landfills in october 1991 with an ffective date of october 9 1993 for most provisions in general the new criteria require liners leachate collection groundwater monitoring and correc tive action at municipal landfills other solid waste provisions authorized in rcra include financial and technical assistance for states and local governments most such assistance ended in fy1981 due to overall budget cutbacks res earch development and demonstration authority most of which also fell vic tim to budget cutbacks and procurement program the goal of which is to stimulate markets for recycled products by requiring federal departments and agen cies to buy recycled while epa is the lead agency under rcra the department of commerce is given several respons ibilities for encouraging greater commercializati on of resource recovery technology the department has not played an active role however underground storage tanks to address nationwide problem of l eaking underground storage tanks usts congress established leak prevention tection and cleanup program through the 1984 rcra amendments and the 1986 superfund amendments and reauthorization act sara the 1984 rcra amendments created federal program to regulate usts containing petroleum and hazardous chemicals to limit corrosion and structural defects and thus minimize future tank leaks the law directed epa to set operating requirements and technical st andards for tank design and installation leak detection spill and overfill control co rrective action and tank clos ure the ust program rcra subtitle i is administered primarily by states it requires registration of most underground tanks bans the in stallation of unprotected ta nks sets federal technical standards for all tanks coordi nates federal and st ate regulatory efforts and provides for federal inspection and enforcement in 1986 congress created petroleum ust response program by amending subtitle i of rcra through sara pl 99 499 prior to sara epa lacked explicit authority to clean up contamin ation from leaking underground petroleum tanks as congress had specifically ex cluded petroleum products although not petrochemicals from the supe rfund law the 1986 provisions authorized the federal government to respond to petroleum sp ills and leaks and created leaking underground storage tank lust trus t fund to fund cleanup of leaks from petroleum usts in cases where the ust ow ner or operator does not clean up site the lust trust fund provides money for epa to administer the program and for states to oversee cleanups take enfo rcement actions nd undertak cleanups themselves when necessary the money in the fund is derived primarily from 01 centpergallon federal tax on motor fuel s and several other petroleum productshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs59 the 1986 amendments also directed ep to establish financial responsibility requirements for ust owners nd operators to cover costs of taking corrective action and to compensate third parties for inju ry and property damage caused by leaking tanks the law required epa to issue regulations requiring tank owners and operators selling petrol eum products to demons trate minimum financial responsibility the regulations require insurance coverage of 1 million or alternatively owners and ope rators may rely on state assu rance funds to demonstrate financial responsibility the energy policy act of 2005 pl 109 58 included in title xv subtitle b the underground storage tank complian ce act ustca this act amended swda subtitle i to add new leak prevention and enforcement provisions to the ust regulatory program and impose new require ments on states epa and tank owners the ustca requires epa and states th at receive funding under subtitle i to conduct compliance inspections of all usts at least once every three years it also requires states to comply with epa guidance prohibiting fuel delivery to ineligible tanks develop training requi rements for ust operators and individuals responsible for tank maintenance and spill response pr epare compliance reports on government owned tanks in the state and implement groundwater protecti on measures for ust manufacturers and installers the act also directed epa to develop and implement strategy to address ust releases on tribal lands the ustca authorized the appropriation of 155 million annually for fy2006 through fy2011 from the lust trust fund for states to use to implement the new ust leak prevention requirements and to administer state programs congress also authorized trust fund appropriations of 200 million annually for fy2006 through fy2011 for epa and states to administer th lust corrective action program and another 200 million annually for fy2006 through fy2011 specifically for addressing releases involving methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and other oxygenated fuels eg ethanol enforcement rcra contains stringent enforcement provisions criminal violations of subtitle c hazardous waste requirements are punishable by fines of as much as 50000 for each day of violation andor impri sonment for as long as five years knowingly endangering human life brings fines of as much as 250000 1 million for company or organization and as long as 15 years imprisonment in cases not involving criminal conduc t the act authorizes civil and administrative penalties of as much as 25000 per day of violation epa is authorized both to issue administrative compliance orders and to seek injunctive relief through the courts similar civil and administrative penalties but not criminal penalties apply to viola tions of the underground st orage tank requirements in subtitle i failure to close or upgrade open dumps can also be enforced by epa in limited circumstances like most environmental programs rcra in practice is largely enforced by state agencies exercising state authority equivalent to the federal epa retains the power to undertake enforcement in such authorized states however the acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs60 requires only that the administrator give tice to the state in which violation has occurred prior to issuing an or der or commencing civil action rcra also provides for citizen suits both against persons and entities alleged to have violated standards or permit requirements and against epa in cases where the administrator has failed to perform an action that is nondiscretionary under the act amendments to rcra rcra has been amended nine times some of which were noncontroversial additions clarifying portions of the law or correcting clerical errors in the text the most significant sets of ame ndments occurred in 1980 1984 and 1992 1980 amendments the solid waste disposal act amendments of 1980 provided epa tougher enforcement powers to deal with illegal dumpers of hazardous waste the agencys authority to regulate certain highvolume lowhazard wastes known as special wastes was restricted funds were authorized to conduct an inventory of hazardous waste sites and rcra authorizations for appropriations were extended through fy1982 amending nguage contained in superfund pl 96510 established an assistant administr ator for solid waste and emergency response at epa hazardous and solid waste amendments of 1984 the most significant set of amendments to rcra was the hazardous and solid waste amendments of 1984 hswa complex law with many detailed technical requirements in addition to restrictions on land disposal and the inclusion of small quantity generators sqgs in the hazardous waste regulatory scheme that was summarized above hswa created the new regulato ry program for underground storage tanks also described above epa was directed to issue regu lations governing those who produce distribute and use fuels produced from hazardous waste including used oil under hswa hazardous waste facilities owned or ope rated by federal state or local government agencies must be inspected annually and privately owned facilities must be inspected at least every two years each federal agency was required to submit to epa an inventory of hazardous waste facilities it ever owned the 1984 law also imposed on epa timeta ble for issuing or denying permits for tsdfs required permits to be for fi xed terms not exceeding 10 years terminated in 1985 the interim status of land disposal facilities that existed prior to rcras enactment unless they met certain requirements required permit applications to be accompanied by information regarding the potential for public exposure to hazardous substances in connection with the facility and authorized epa to issue experimental permits for facilities demons trating new technologies epas enforcement powers were increased the list of prohibited actions constituting crimes was expanded penalties were increased and the citizen suit provisions were expanded other provisions prohibited the export of hazardous waste unless the government of the receiving country formally consented to accept it created an ombudsmans office in epa to deal with rcraassociated complaints grievances and requests for information and reauthorized rcra through fy88 at level of about 250 million per yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs61 hswa also specified that owners or operators of tsdfs are responsible for investigating and as necessary cleaning up releases at or from their facilities regardless of when the releases occurred epa refers to this cleanup of tsdfs under these statutory authorities as rcra corrective action finally hswa called for national ground water commission to assess and report to congress in two years on groundw ater issues and contamination from hazardous wastes the commission was never funded and never established however federal facility compliance act the third major set of amendments was the federal facility compliance act of 1992 this act resolves the legal question of whether federal facilities are subject to enforcement actions under rcra by unequivocally waiving the governments sovereign immunity from prosecution as result states epa and the department of justice can enforce the provisions of rcra against federal facilities and federal departments and agencies can be subjected to injunctions administrative orders andor pena lties for noncompliance furthermore federal employees may be subject to criminal sanctions including both fines and imprisonment under any federal or state solid or hazardous waste law the act also contains special provisions applicable to mixtures of radioactive and hazardous waste at departme nt of energy facilities and to munitions military ships and military sewage trea tment facilities handlin g hazardous wastes 1996 amendments the 104th congress passed an additional set of amendments to rcra the land disposal program flexibility act pl 104119 this act exempts hazardous waste from rcra regulation if it is treated to point where it longer exhibits the charact eristic that made it hazardous and is subsequently disposed in facility regula ted under the clean water act or in class i deep injection well regulated under the safe drinking water act second provision of the bill exempted small landfills located in arid or remote areas from ground water monitoring requirements provided there is evidence of ground water contamination other recent laws affecting solid waste management although not technically amending rcra the 101st 103rd and 104th congresses enacted five other solid hazardous wasterelated measures sanitary food tran sportation act the sanitary food transportation act of 1990 pl 101500 required th regulation of trucks nd rail cars that haul both food and solid waste problem commonly re ferred to as backhauling of garbage the act directed the departments of agriculture health and human services and transportation to promulga regulations specifying 1 record keeping and identification requirements 2 decontamination procedur for refrigerated trucks and rail cars and 3 materials for cons truction of tank truc ks cargo tanks and ancillary equipment clean air act the clean air act amendments of 1990 pl 101549 contained provision mandating stronger federal standards for solid waste incinerators the law requires epa to issue new source performance standards

of the time they are issued and existing units must comply within five years of issuance pollution prevention act the pollution prevention act of 1990 sections 66016610 of pl 101508 was passed as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 th measure declared pollution prevention to be the national policy and directed epa to undertake series of activities aimed at preventing the generation of pollutants rather than controlling pollutants after they are created matching grants were authorized for states to establish technical assistance programs for businesses and epa was directed to establish source reduction clearinghouse to disseminate info rmation the act also imposed new reporting requirements on industry firms that were required to f ile an annual toxic chemical release form unde r the emergency planning and community rightto know act of 1986 must also file re port detailing their source reduction and recycling efforts over the previous year more complete description of the act which addresses air and wate r pollution as well as waste is provided in the first section of this report indian lands open dump cleanup act the indian lands open dump cleanup act of 1994 pl 103 399 required the indian health service ihs to provide technical and financ ial support to inventory nd close open dumps on indian lands and to maintain the sites after closure according to ihs only two of more than 600 waste dumps on indian lands met cu rrent epa regulations prior to the laws enactment mercurycontaining and recharg eable battery management act the 104th congress passed legislation pl 104142 exempting battery collection and recycling programs from certain zardous waste manage ment requirements prohibiting the use of mercury in batteries and requiring

for the 19801985 period revenues were raised primarily by taxes on crude oil and on 42 chemicals oneeighth of th total was authorized from the general fund of the treasury17 the taxation authority expired on september 30 1985 and to keep the program running during 1986 while sara was debated in the conference committee congress authorized two repayable advances later repaid to the fund 150

of taxation sara allowed ll those who previously paid the tax on xylene to apply for refund with interest to compensate for the lost revenues the tax on xylene was increased from 487 to 1013 per ton certain chemicals listed in the tax table are exempt from payment of the tax when used for specified purposes or when produced in certain ways thus methane and butane are excused from the tax when used as fuel as are substances used in the production of fertilizer also exempted are sulfuric acid when produced as byproduct of air pollution control nd any chemicals derived from coal two new taxes were imposed by the 1986 law imported chemical derivatives are taxed at rate equal to the amount which would have been imposed on the feedstocks used in the manufacture of the derivative if the feedstocks had been sold in the united states for that purpose if the importer does not furnish sufficient information to compute the tax in that manner the tax is 5 of the customs value of the import fifty chemical derivatives are listed in the law the secretary of the treasury is to add to this list any derivative made from taxable feedstocks if the feedstocks make up more than 50 by weight of the raw materials used to produce the substance the secretary may also add other substances to the list if taxable feedstocks comprise more than 50 of the value of the raw materials used to make them for the same reasons the secretary may remove substances from the list as well the other tax added by sara in 1986 is the corporate environmental income tax which is based on the alternative minimum income tax system of the tax reform act of 1986 the tax is 012 12 per 10000 of taxable income in excess of 2 million and is imposed on corporations in addition to taxes and appropriations the fund r

governmental res ponse 1 shortterm removals where emergency action is required fo r example to avert fire or explosion or to prevent the imminent contamination of water body and 2 longterm remedial actions taken at sites on the national priorities list removals are limited to oneyear effort and the expenditure of not more than 2 million remedial actions are of longer term are more expensive and freque ntly involve extensive engineering at the sites to ensure that the most serious sites are addressed the law calls for national priorities list npl to be assembled epa developed hazard ranking system hrs to construct the npl which scores such factors as the quantity and nature of hazardous wastes present the likelihood of contamination of ground water surface water and air and the proximity of th site to population and sensitive natural environments as of december 28 2006 the npl contained 1301 proposed and final sites the total listed since the beginning of the program is 1618 of which construction has been completed at 1008 62 317 sites have been removed from the npl before remedial action is undertaken at sites where superfund money is used the state must assure 1 that it will provide future maintenance of the site in cases of ground or surface water cleanup the 100 state maintenance requirement is delayed for 10 years 2 that offsite dispos capacity is available if necessary and 3 that it will pay 10 of the costs of remedial action or if the site was owned or operated by the state or local government at the time of disposal that it will pay at least 50 of the

fiduciarys liability is limited to the value of the assets held in trust provided the fiduciary did not cause or contribute to the haza rdous substance release protection from cercla liability was also extended to recyclers of paper plastic glass textiles rubbe r metal and batteries by the superfund recycling equity act of 199919 this law enacted by the 106th congress absolves recyclers from

cleanup schedules because of slow cleanup progress sara set deadlines for commencing specified numbers of site inspections rankings for the national priorities list remedial investigations and feasibility studies rifss and physical onsite work through november 1990 those targets were all surpassed cleanup standards in general cleanups must assure pr otection of health and the environment and be costeffective in both the longter m and the shortterm sara requires that cleanups meet the standards of federal nd state environmental laws but epa may waive requirement when the action is part of larger remedial action that will meet the standards compliance would result in greater risk than alternative options httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs74 compliance is impractical from an engineering perspective an equivalent standard of performance is attained in the case of state standard the state has not consistently applied the standard elsewhere or meeting the standard does not pr ovide balance between the need for protection of health and the environment at the facility and the availability of amounts in the fund to respond to other sites that also present threat the law specifically requires cleanups to meet the safe drinking water acts recommended maximum contaminant levels rmcls and the clean water acts water quality criteria the agency is di rected to choose perm anent remedies when possible as opposed to burying wastes in landfills if nonpermanent treatment is employed epa must review the site every five years to see if it presents threat states are given the opportunity for an active role in choosing the cleanup method federal facilities cercla made federal agencies subject to the law in the same way as any nongovernmental entity and required them to clean up any hazardous waste sites they owned or operated th superfund trust fund is not available to them and the cost of cleanup is to be funded from the agencies appropriations the one exception to this rule is that the fund may be used to provide alternative water supplies in cases where there is ground water contamination outside the boundaries of federally owned facility and there are other potentially responsible parties beside s the federal agency two provisions of sara attempted to accelerate the cleanup and to resolve questions of jurisdiction th at have arisen section 120 sets out

2007 energy independence and security act of 2007 subtitle healthy highperformance schoolspl 110140 background federal legislation to control toxic s ubstances was originally proposed in 1971 by the presidents council on environmental quality its report toxic substances defined need for comprehensive legislati on to identify and control chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution use andor disposal was potentially dangerous and not adequately regulate d under other environmental statutes the house and senate each passed bills in both the 92nd and 93rd congresses i n 1972 nd 1973 respectively but controve rsies over the scope of chemical screening prior to commercial production and distri bution level of costs and the relationship to other regulatory laws stalled final action ep isodes of environmen tal contamination including the hudson river and other waterway s by pcbs the threat of stratospheric ozone depletion from chlorofluorocarbon cfc emissions and contamination of agricultural produce by polybrominated biphenyls pbbs in the state of michigan together with more exact estimates of the costs of imposing toxic substances controls opened the way for fi nal passage of the legisla tion president ford signed the tsca into law on october 11 1976 title i tsca title i directs epa to require manufacturers and processors to conduct tests for existing chemicals if 1 their manufacture distribution processing use or disposal may present an unreasonable ri sk of injury to health or the environment or they are to be produced in substantial quantities and the potential for environmental release or human exposure is substantial or significant 2 existing data are insufficient to predict the effects of human exposure and environmental releases and 3 testing is necessary to deve lop such data section 4 prevent future risks through premanufacture screening and regulatory tracking of new ch emical products section 5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs88 control unreasonable risks already known or as they are discovered for existing chemicals section 6 and gather and disseminate informati on about chemical production use and possible adverse effects to hum an health and the environment section 8 authorization for appropriations for these activities and state grant program for control of toxic substances in the environment expired on september 30 1983 although appropriations for thes programs have continued testing of chemicals many chemicals even some in widespread use are not well characterized in terms of their potential health and environmental effects one of the major goals of tsca was to induce the development of test data by producers ie manufacturers importers and processors of chemicals in commerce section 4 of tsca directs ep to require the developmen t of test data on existing chemicals when certain conditions prevail 1 the manufacture processing distribution use or disposal of the chemical may pres ent an unreasonable risk or 2 the chemical is produced in very large volume and there is potential for substantial quantity to be released into the environment or for substantial or significant human exposure under either condition epa must issue rule requiring tests if existing data are insufficient to resolve the question of safety and b testing is necessary to develop the data because there were more than 55000 ch emicals in us commerce at the time epa was to begin developing test rules congress established special interagency committee to help epa determine which che micals should be considered first and to coordinate testing needs and efforts among government agencies at least every six months the interagency testing committee itc must consider candidate chemicals for inclusion on list of substances that the itc recommends to epa for development and promulgation of test rules tsca directs the itc to designate subset of chemicals on the list for epa action within 12 months the list can contain more than 50 designated chemicals at any time when chemical is designated epa has one year to respond by issuing proposed test rule or notice explaining why testing is needed tsca requires the itc to consider the following factors when it makes listing decisions 1 quantity of the substance to be manufactured 2 quantity of the chemical in environmental releases 3 number of people who will be exposed occupationally and the dura tion of exposure 4 extent of nonoccupational human exposure 5 similarity of the chemical to any other chemical known to present an unreasonable risk 6 existence of data cerning environmental or health effects of the chemical 7 the quantity of information to be gained by testing and 8 the availability of fac ilities and personnel for performing testing chemicals known or suspected to cause or contribute to cancer gene mutations or birth defects are to be assigned higher priority in response to information that i ndicates there may be reasonable basis to conclude that chemi cal presents or will present significant risk of serious or widespread harm to human beings from cancer gene mutations or birth defects tsca requi res epa action to prevent or reduce that risk or publication of finding that the risk is not unreasonablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs89 premanufacture notification for new chemicals or uses tsca section 5 requires manufactur ers importers and processo rs to notify epa at least 90 days prior to producing or otherwise in troducing new chemical product into the united states any information or test data that is known to reasonably ascertainable by or in possession of the notifier and that might be useful to epa in evaluating the chemicals potential adverse effects on human health or the environment must be submitted to epa at the same time tsca also requires epa to be notified when there are plans to produce process or use an existing chemical in way that differs from previously permitted uses if the adminis trator has determined by rule that new uses of the chemical may produce significant changes in human and environmental exposures and therefore require notifica tion the 90day notice provides epa with the opportunity to evaluate the chemical use and if necessary to prohibit or limit such activity before it occurs to prevent unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment epa has 45 days after notification or up to 90 days if it extends the period for good cause to evaluate the potential risk pos ed by the chemical if epa determines that there is reasonable basis to conclude that the substance presents or will present an unreasonable risk the administrator mu st promulgate requirements to protect adequately against such risk alterna tively epa may determine that the proposed activity related to chemical does not present an unreasonable risk this decision may be based on the available da ta or when data exist to document the effects of exposure on what is known about the effect s of chemicals in commerce with similar chemical structures and used in similar ways the purpose of epas screening procedure is to identify potential hazards and control them before use of chemical b ecomes widespread if data are inadequate to make an informed judgment and 1 manufacture processing distribution in commerce use or disposal may present an unreasonable risk or 2 chemical is to be produced in substantial quantities and the potential for environmental release or human exposure is substantial or signif icant epa may issue proposed order to prohibit or limit such activities until sufficient data are submitted although the legislative history of tsca includes presumption that testing of new products would take place before they we re widely used either as the chemical was developed or as its markets grew ts ca also forbids promulgation of blanket testing requirements for all new chemicals this reflects concern that uniform testing requirements might stifle innovation in the chemical industry thus epa must decide which chemicals or which categories of chemicals warrant the costs of premarket testing epa reviews more than 1000 new chemical manufacturing notices annually regulatory controls fo r hazardous chemicals tsca requires epa to regulate manufacturing pr ocessing distribution in comme rce use or disposal of chemical if it will present an unreasonabl risk of injury to health or the environment and the risk cannot be re duced to sufficient degree under another federal law administered by epa the alternative means available to epa for controlling chemical hazards that present unreasonable risks are specified in section 6 of tsca epa has the authority tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs90 prohibit or limit the amount of production or distribution of substance in commerce prohibit or limit the production or di stribution of substance for particular use limit the volume or concentration of the chemical produced prohibit or regulate the manne r or method of commercial use require warning labels andor instructions on containers or products require notification of the risk of injury to distributors and to the extent possible consumers require recordkeeping by producers specify disposal methods and require replacement or repurchase of products already distributed epa also may impose any of these require ments in combination or for specific geographical region however epa is requi red by tsca to regulate only to the extent necessary to protect adequately against risk and to use the least burdensome regulatory approach even in controlling unreasonable risks information gathering section 8 of tsca re quires epa to develop and maintain an inventory of all chemicals or categories of chemicals manufactured or processed in the united states the first version of this inventory identified approximately 55000 chemicals in commerce in 1979 all chemicals not on the inventory are by definition new and subject to the notification provisions of section 5 these chemicals must be adde d to the inventory if they enter us commerce chemicals need not be listed if they are only produced in very small quantities for purposes of experimentation or research to aid epa in its duties under tsca the agency was granted considerable authority to collect information from indus tries epa may require maintenance of records and reporting of chemical identities names and molecular structures categories of use amounts manufactured and processed for each category of use descriptions of byproducts resulting from manufacture processing use and disposal environmental and health effects num ber of individuals exposed number of employees exposed and the duration of ex posure and manner or method of chemical disposal manufacturers processors and distri butors of chemicals are required to maintain records of significant adverse reac tions to health or the environment alleged to have

and safety studies studieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs91 showing adverse effects previously unknow n must be submitted to epa as soon as they are completed or discovered imminent hazards section 7 provides epa au thority to take emergency action through the district courts to control chemical substance or mixture which presents an imminent and unreasonable risk of serious widespread injury to health or the environment relation to other laws section 9 allows epa to refer cases of chemical risk to other federal agencies with the authority to prevent or reduce the risk for statutes under epas jurisdiction tsca give s the administrator discretion to decide if risk can best be handled under the authority of tsca enforcement and judicial review section 11 authorizes epa to inspect any facilities subject to tsca require ments and to issu subpoenas requiring attendance and testimony of witnesses production of reports and documents answers to questions and other necessary in formation section 13 mandates tsca enforcement at the national borde rs by the treasury department section 15 identifies acts prohibited unde r tsca while section 16 describes penalties for acts violating these prohibitions as well as recourse available to anyone accused of such violations section 16 au thorizes civil penalties not to exceed 25000 per violation per day and affords th defendant an opportunity to request hearing before an order is issued and to petition for judicial review of an order after it is issued criminal penalties also are authorized for willful violations section 17 provides jurisdiction to us district courts in civil actions to enforce tsca section 15 by restraining or compelling actions that violate or comply with it respectively chemicals may be seized and condemned if their ma nufacture processing or distribution violated the act section 19 authorizes any person to file petition for judicial review of specified rules within 60 days of issuance under tsca the court is directed to set aside specified rules if they are not supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record taken as whole section 20 authorizes civil suits by an person against any person in violation of the act it also authorizes suits against epa to compel performance of nondiscretionary actions under tsca section 21 provides the public with the right to petition for the issuance

30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs93 title ii asbestos in buildings growing public concern about the pres ence of potentially hazardous asbestos in buildings especially in schools led to congressional effo rts to address this problem title ii of tsca the asbe stos hazard emergency response act ahera was enacted in 1986 pl 99519 and amended in july 1988 pl 100368 it required epa to set standards by octobe r 1987 for responding to the presence of asbestos in schools the standards set at levels adequate to protect public health and the environment identif appropriate response actions that depend on the physical condition of asbestos schools in turn were required to inspect for asbestoscontaining material and to develop and implement plan for managing any such material plans for managing asbest were to be sub mitted by schools before may 1989 and implementation was to begin by july 1989 the law contains deadlines for schools to complete implementation title ii requires asbestos contractors and analytical laboratories to be certified and schools to use certified persons for ab atement work training and accreditation requirements also apply to inspectors c ontractors and workers performing asbestos abatement work in all public and commercial buildings epa may award training grants to nonprofit organizations for asbestos health and safety programs however authorization of appropria tions for this grant program expired september 30 1995 other title ii requirements such as mandates that buildings be inspected for asbestos have not been ex tended to nonschool buildings to enforce requirements tsca authorizes epa to take emergency action with respect to schools if school officials do not act to protect children the act also authorizes citizen action with respect to asbestoscontaini ng material in school and to compel action by epa either through administrative petition or judicial action civil penalties not to exceed 5000 are author ized for violations such as failing to conduct an inspection or to deve lop school management plan concern about how schools would pay fo r required actions was addressed in separate legislation the asbestos school hazard abatement act of 1984 or ashaa pl 98377 it established pr ogram offering grants and interestfree loans to schools with serious asbestos pr oblems and demonstrat ed financial need although epa for several years did not reque st funding for this program congress appropriated funds author ization of appropriations for this program expired september 30 1995 and congress has not ppropriated funds since fy1993 total of 382 million in grant and loan funds were appropriated from fy1984 through fy1993 repaid ashaa loans are returned to an asbestos trust fund established in tsca title ii to become dedicated source of revenues for future asbestos control projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs94 title iii radon programs in october 1988 congress amende d tsca by adding title iii i ndoor radon abatement 15 usc 2661 et seq pl 100551 the basic purpose of title iii is to provide financial and tec hnical assistance to the states that choose to support radon monitoring and control neither monitoring nor abatement of radon is required by the act title iii required epa to update its pamphlet citiz ens guide to radon to develop model constr uction standards and techniques for controlling radon levels within new buildings and to provide technical assistance to states epa is to provide technical assistance by establishing an information clearinghouse publishing public information materials establishing na tional database of ra don levels detected organized by state providing information to professional organi zations representing private firms involved in building design and construction submitting to congress plan for providing financia l and technical assistance to states operating cooperative projects with states conducting research to develop test and evaluate radon measurement methods and protocols veloping and demons trating ne w methods of radon measurement and mitigation including methods that are suitable for use in nonresidential child care f acilities operating voluntar program to rate radon measurement and mitigation vices and methods and the effectiveness of private firms and individuals offering radon related services and designing and implementing training seminars the proficiency rating program and certification for training programs collect fees for service and therefore are meant to be self supporting but congress authorized 1500000 to be appropriated to establish these programs congress authorized 3000000 to be appropriated for each of three years beginning in 1989 for the other pr ovisions of sections 303 304 and 305 matching grant program was establishe d for the purpose of assisting states in developing and implementin g programs for radon asse ssment and mitigation for this program 30 million was authorized to be appropriated ove r three years with funds targeted to states or projects that made efforts to ensu re adoption of epas model construction standard s and techniques for new bu ildings gave preference to lowincome persons or ddressed serious and exte nsive radon contamination problems or had the potential to reduce ri sk or to develop innovative assessment techniques mitigation measures or management approaches other sections of title iii require epa to c onduct study to determine the extent of ra don conta mination in schools identify and list areas of the us with high probability of having high levels of indoor radon make gr ants or cooperative agreements to establish and operate at l east three regional radon training centers and provide guidance to federal agencies on radon measurement risk assessment and remedial measures all authorizations for appropriations specific to this title expired september 30 1991 although appropriati ons have continuedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs95 title iv lead exposure reduction the 102nd congress added title iv to tsca when it enacted the residential leadbased paint hazard reduction act of 1992 as title x in the housing and community development act of 1992 pl 102550 title iv aims to accelerate federal efforts to reduce risks to young ch ildren who daily are exposed to leadbased paint in their homes in addition it is expected to s timulate development of lead inspection and hazard abatement services in the private sector while ensuring that the services provided and any products employed are reliable and effective in reducing risk to these ends title iv directs epa to promulgate definitions of leadcontaminated dust lead contaminated soil and leadbased paint hazards to ensure that people engaged in detection and control of lead hazards are properly trained and that contractors are certified to publish requirements for the accreditation of training programs for workers to develop criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of commercial products used to detect or reduce risks associated with leadbased paint to establish protocols criteria and minimum performance standards for laboratory analysis of lead in paint films soil and dust to establish program to certify laboratories as qualified to test substances for lead content and to publish and distribute to the public list of certified or accredited environmental sampling laboratories title iv explicitly applies these requirements to federal facilities and activities that may create lead hazard in addition congress directed epa to conduct study of lead hazards due to renovation and remodelin g activities that may incidenta lly disturb leadbased paint epa is required to promulgate guide lines for the renovation and remodeling of buildings or other structures when these activities might create hazard title iv directs epa to establish clearing house and hotline to distribute information about the hazards of leadbased paint how to avoid exposure and reduce risk and new technologies for removing or immobilizing leadbased paint in addition congress mandated velopment of lead haza rd information pamphlet public education and outreach activities for health profe ssionals the general public homeowners landlords tenants consum ers of home improvement products the residential real estate i ndustry and the home renovation industry and information to be distributed by retailers of home improvement products to provide consumershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs96 with practical information related to the hazards of renovation where leadbased paint may be present title iv authorizes states to propose pr ograms to train and certify inspectors and contractors engaged in the detection or cont rol of leadbased paint hazards states also may develop the required informa tional pamphlets tsca requires epa to promulgate model state program that may be adopted by any state congress gave epa the authority to approve or disapprove authorization for state proposals and to provide grants for states to develop and implement authorized programs federal program must be established administered and enforced by epa in each state without an authorized program the department of health and human services so has responsibilities under title iv of tsca it mandates study by the centers for disease prevention and control cdc and the national institute for environmental health sciences to determine the sources of lead exposure to children who have elevated lead levels in their bodies the national institute for ccupational safety and health is directed to study ways of reducing occupational exposure to lead during abatement activities the act established rulemaking docket to ensure the availability to the general public of all documents submitted to agencies that are relevant to regulatory decisions pursuant to this legislation the docket is required to include the drafts of all proposed rules submitted by epa to th presidents office of management and budget omb written comments on the dr afts and written responses to comments in addition the agency must provide an explanation for any major change to proposed rule that appears in the final rule and such changes ma not be made based on information not filed in the docket dockets are required to be established in each epa regional office congress authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for tsca title iv in addition to amending tsca title x of the housing and community development act of 1992 authorized grants to states for risk assessments and lead based paint removal nd immobilization in private housing for lowincome residents establishing state training certification or accreditation programs for inspectors and abatement contractors and research at the department of housing and urban development hud authorization for ppropriations for these grants expired september 30 1994 but appropriations have continued title x directed hud to establish guidelines for federally suppor ted work involving risk assessments inspections interim controls and abatement of leadbased paint hazards in addition the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh was provided 10 million for training people who remove or immobilize paint title v

environmental problems and recommended solutions environmental problems specifically mentioned in the law include contaminan ts hazardous substances and pollutant emissions epas authority to provide gran ts expires five years after the date of enactment title v requires the epa administrator in consultation with the secretary of education and the secretary of health and human services to issue voluntary guidelines within 18 months of title v enactment for selecting sites for schools presumably new schools the guide lines are to account for the special vulnerability of children to hazardous substances or pollution exposures in any case in which the potential for contamination at potential school site exists modes of transportation available to st udents and staff efficient use of energy and potential use of school at the site as an emergency shelter title v also requires the epa administrator in consultation with the secretary of education and the secretary of health and human services to issue voluntary guidelines within two years of enactment for developing and implementing state environmental health programs for schools these guidelines must take into account the findings of federal initia tives established under relev ant federal law with respect to school facilities including initiatives re lated to water and energy conservation authorized by sections 431 through 441 nd work related to highperformance green buildings authorized by section 492 of p l 110140 in particular the guidelines must take into account environmenta l problems contaminants hazardous substances and pollutant emissions natural day lighting ventilation heating and cooling moisture control and mold maintenance cleaning and pest control acoustics and other issues relating to

pesticide polic ies under two statutes the federa l insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra33 governing the sale and use of pesticide products within the united states and the federal food dr ug and cosmetic ac t ffdca which limits pesticide residues on food in inte rstate commerce including imports pesticides are broadly define d in fifra section 2u as chemicals and other products used to kill repel or control pests familiar examples include pesticides used to kill insects and weeds that can reduce the yield and sometimes harm the quality of agricultural crops ornamental plants forest s wooden structures and also pastures but the broad definition of pesticide in fifra also applies to products with less familiar pesticidal uses for example substances used to control mold mildew algae and other nuisance growths on equipment in surface water or on stored grains are pesticides the term also applies to disinfectants and sterilizing agents animal repellents rat poison and ma ny other substances epa estimates that there are about 18000 pesticide products currently in use34 these all are regulated under fifra but approximately 5800 pes ticide products used in food production also are regulated under the ffdca as discussed below fifra directs epa to restrict the use of pesticides as necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on people and th environment taking into account the costs and benefits of various pesticide uses fifra requires epa to regulate the sale and use of pesticides in the united st ates through registration and labeling35 the act prohibits sale of any pesticide in the united states unless it is registered and labeled to indicate approved uses and restrictions it is violation of the law to use pesticide in manner that is inconsistent with the label instructions epa registers each pesticide product for each approved use for example product may be registered for use on green beans to contro l mites as seed treatment for cotton and as treatment for structural cracks in addition fifra requires epa to reregister older pesticides based on ne w data that meet current regulatory and scientific standards establishments that manufactur or sell pesticide pr oducts must register with epa facility managers are required to keep certain records and to allow inspections by federal or state regulatory officials for the approximately 600 or more pesticides ie activ ingredients registered for use in food production the ffdca sec tion 408 authorizes epa to establish maximum allowable residue levels called tolerances that ensure that humanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs102 36 ingredients in pesticide products are categorized as active or inert active ingredients are those that are intended to control the pest wh ile inert ingredients are used to deliver the active ingredients effectively to the pest iner t ingredients often are solvents or surfactants and often comprise the bulk of the pesticide produc t some inerts are known to be toxic and some are known to be harmless but epa lists most in the category inerts of unknown toxicity exposure to the pesticide ingredients in food and animal feed will be safe36 safe tolerance is defined as level at which there is reasonable certainty of harm from the exposure under ffdca foods with residue of pesticide ingredient for which there is toleranc established or w ith residue level exceeding an established tolerance limit are declared unsafe and adulterated such foods cannot be sold in interstate commerce or im ported to the united states pesticides may not be regi stered under fifra for use on food unless tolerances or exemptions have been established under the ffdca history of federal pesticide law tables 20 and 21 summarize the history of fifra and ffdca respectively fifra federal pesticide legislation wa s first enacted in 1910 it aimed to reduce economic exploitation of farmer s by manufacturers and distributors of adulterated or ineffective pesticides c ongress did not address the potential risks to human health posed by pesticide products until it enacted fifra in 1947 the us department of agriculture usda was re sponsible for administering the pesticide statutes during this period however res ponsibility was shifted to the epa when that agency was created in 1970 broader cong ressional concerns bout long and short term toxic effects of pesticide ex posure on people who applied pesticides applicators wildlife nontarget ins ects and birds and on food consumers subsequently led to comp lete revision of fifra in 1972 the 1972 law completely replaced the original 1947 law and is the basi s of current federal policy substantial changes were made in 1988 pl 100532 1996 pl 104170 and 2004 pl 108199 the 1988 amendments focused on accelerating the reregistration process the 1996 amendments facilitate d registration of pesticid for special socalled minor uses reauthorized collection of fees to support reregi stration

appropriations for fifra expired on september 31 1991 although appropriations b ills have continued to provide f unding to implement the law authority provided by fifra to epa to issue and enforce regulations is for the most part permanent and is not ffected by the lack of authorization ffdca the original federal food drug and cosmetic act of 1938 ffdca established the structure of the current law with respect to food safety it required the food and drug administration then part of the us department of agriculture to set maximum residue vels tolerances fo r unavoidable poisonous substances in food congress acted to protect consumers from pesticide residues on food in 1954 by adding new section 408 to the ffdca it directed fda to set residue tolerances for all pesticides in raw agricultural commodities congress expanded the requirement for tolerances in the food additives amendment of 1958 which added section 409 directing fda to set tolerances for food additives including pesticide residues in processed foods secti on 409 also forbade the add itionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs104 to food of any additive including pesticid residue if it was found to be potential cancercausing agent this provision is referred to as the delaney clause in 1970 authority to establish tolerances for pesticide resi dues was transferred to the newly formed epa fda now in the department of health and human services retained responsib ility for enforcement of tolerances in food that is imported or sold across state boundaries in 1996 congress substantially revise d requirements for pesticide residue tolerance setting in the food quality prot ection act fqpa the fqpa redefined terms so that pesticide residues in proce ssed foods were long er regulated as food

require data from any combina tion of more than 100 different tests depending on the potential toxicity of active and inert ingredients and degree of exposure to register pesticide us on food epa also requires applicants to identify analytical methods that can be used to test food for residues of active ingredients certain inert ingredients nd their breakdown products and to determine the amount of residue that could remain on crops as well as on or in food products assuming that the pesticide product is applied according to the manufacturers recommended rate s and methods based on the data

feed crops or food products directly eg grains fruits or vegetables after harvesthealth or the environment if the pes ticide is proposed for use on food crop epa also determines whether safe level of pesticide residue called tolerance can be established under the fede ral food drug and cosmetic act tolerance must be established before pestic ide registration may be granted for use on food crops if registration is granted the agency specifies the approved uses and conditions of use including safe methods of pe sticide storage and disposal which the registrant must explain on the product label fifra requires that federal regula tions for pesticide labels preempt state local and tribal regulations us of pesticide product in manner inconsistent with its label is prohibited epa may classify and register pestic ide product for general or for restricted use products known as restricteduse pe sticides are those judged to be more dangerous to the applicator or to the envi ronment such pesticides can be applied only by people who have been trained nd certified individual states and indian tribes generally are responsible for trai ning and certifying pe sticide applicators fifra section 3 also allows conditional temporary registrations if 1 the proposed pesticide ingredients and uses are substantially similar to currently registered products and will not create additional significan t environmental risks 2 an amendment is proposed for additional uses of registered pesticide and sufficient data are submitted indicating that there is significant additional risk or 3 data requirements for new active ingredient require more time to generate than normally allowed and use of the pesticide during the period will not cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment nd will be in the public interest fifraffdca coordination epa has long coordinated pesticide registrations for food uses under fifra with tolerance setting under the ffdca the food quality protection act of 1996 fqpa pl 104170 codified this policy thus if epa revokes residue tolerance under ffdca it cancels the fifra pesticide registration for that food use similarly if pesticide registration fo r use on food crop is canceled epa also cancels the residue tolerance for food howeve r just as fifra allows continued use of remaining pesticide stocks after registration is canceled ffdca allows continued commerce in commodities legally treated with pesticide thus epa does not immediately revoke the tolerance fo r the pesticide residue when it cancels the corresponding registration tolerance setting any person who has registered pesticide may petition epa proposing establishment of tolerance or an exemption for that pesticide to permit its use on foodrelated crops37 tolerance petitions must incl ude information about pesticide application rates measured concentrations of pesticide residues on the food after the pesticide has been applied according to direc tions on its label and safety of pesticide use on food crops the ffdca requires epa to respond to each petition byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs106 38 us house committee on commerce food quality protection act of 1996

epa will register the pesticide for use on that food product and set the tolerance level by issuing regulation epa tolerances for pesticide re sidues preempt state nd local restrictions on food if the state and local restrictions are based on lower resi due levels states may petition for an exception if the epase t residue level thr eatens public health the ffdca section 408 as amended requi res epa to assess safety in terms of total exposure to the pesticide that is to the concentration of pesticide allowed by the tolerance together with all other di etary and nonfood exposures for which there is reliable information as well as to other pesticides that have the same toxic effects on people quantitative standard of safety is established by law but the committee on commerce now the committee on energy and commerce noted in its report on the bill that became the fq pa that epa should continue setting standards to ensure safety as it had in the past the committee expects that tolerance will provide reasonable certainty of harm if the administrator determines that the aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue will be lower by an ample margin of safety than the level at which the pesticide chemical residue will not cause or contribute to any known or anticipated harm to human health the committee further expects based on discussions with the envir onmental protection agency that the administrator will interpret an ample marg in of safety to be 100fold safety factor applied to the scientifically termined observable effect level when data are extrapolated from animal studies38 in determining safe leve l the ffdca directs epa to take into account many factors including available informati on on dietary exposure to pesticides among infants and children fqpa strictly limited the nature and influence of benefits considered in tolerance setting under s ection 408 of the ffdca as amended section 408 allows epa to maintain or modify existing tolerances but not to establish new tolerances at higher than safe residue levels only if the pesticide use avoids other greater risks to consumers or is necessary to avoid significant disruption in domestic production of an adequate wholesome and economical food supply such higher tolerance levels may be set only for pesticides that are potential carcinogens or have some other health ffect for which there is known level of exposure at which harm is anticipat ed known as nonthreshold effect the higher tolerance level allowed for such pesticide residues must be safe for infants and children as well as with respect to health effects for which there is known threshold that is level below which exposure is known to be harmless the higher cancer or other nonthreshold risk posed by the tolerance on an annual basis may not be more than 10 times the risk at safe level of exposure and not more than twice the risk of safe level over lifetime for nonthreshold effects the hous commerce committee pr ovided additional guidance for establishing level of resi due that should be considered safehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs107 39 ibidin the case of nonthreshold effect which can be assessed through quantitative risk assessment such as cancer effect the committee expects based on its understanding of current epa practice that tolerance will be considered to provide reasonable certainty of harm if any increase in lifetime risk based on quantitative risk assessment using conservative assumptions will be greater than negligible it is the committees understanding that under current epa practice epa interprets negligib risk to be oneinamillion lifetime risk the committee expects the admini strator to conti nue to follow this interpretation39 the safe standard applies to both raw and processed foods and requires epa to consider cumulative and aggregate exposure to pesticides in food drinking water air and consumer products congre ss directed epa to reevalua all existing tolerances against this standard before august 2006 ffdca directs the fda in the department of health and human services and usda to monitor pesticide residue levels in food in inters tate commerce and to enforce tolerances through their food insp ection programs usda is responsible for inspecting meat and poultry fda inspects ll other foods states also may monitor pesticide residues in food sold within their jurisdictions public disclosure exclusiv use and trade secrets fifra section 3 directs epa to make the data submitted by the applicant for pesticide registration publicly available within 30 days after registration is granted however applicants may claim certain da ta are protected as trade secrets under fifra section 10 if epa agrees that the data are protected the agency must withhold those data from the public unless th data pertain to the health effects or environmental fate or effects of the pe sticide ingredients information may be protected if it qualifies as trade secret and reveals 1 manufacturing processes 2 details of methods for testin g detecting or measuring amounts of inert ingredients or 3 the identity or percentage quantity of inert ingredients companies sometimes seek to register product based upon the registration of similar products relying upon the data provided by the origin registrant that are publicly released this is allowed howe ver section 3 of fifra provides for 10 year period of exclusive us by the registrant of da ta submitted in support of an original registration or new use in addition an applicant who submits any new data in support of regist ration is entitled to compensation for the cost of data development by any subsequent applicant w ho supports an application with that data within 15 years of its submission if compensation is not jointly agreed upon by the registrant and applicant bindi ng arbitration can be invoked reregistration most pesticides currently registered in the united states are older pesticides and were

been streamlined by reviewing grouping s of products having the same active ingredients on generic instead of indivi dual product basis fo r fooduse pesticides epa evaluated pesticides eligibility for reregistration at the same time the agency reassessed the tolerance for that pestic ide under the ffdca the fqpa required epa to reassess pesticides posing the gr eatest risks first many of the 35000 pesticide products were not reviewed and their registra tions were canceled because registrants did not request reregistration at least 14000 products are longer in use nevertheless the task for registrants and epa was immense and costly to accelerate the process of reregist ration congress in 1988 amendments to fifra imposed 10year reregistration sc hedule to help pay for the additional costs of the accelerated process congress di rected epa to require registrants to pay reregistration and annual re gistration maintenance fees on pesticide ingredients and products the 1996 amendments

registrants congress exte nded authority for fees nnually through appropriations legislation after fy2001 until the omnibus ppropriations legislation signed january 23 2004 pl 108199 modified the types and amounts of fees that epa could collect potentially through fy2008 the 2004 fifra amendments pria r eauthorized collection of annual maintenance fees to support registration designated tion

with food usestole rances by august 3 2006 and to complete reds for all remaining nonfood use pesticides by october 3 2008 the reregistration process will continue for several years after that date as explained on the epa reregistration website after epa has issued red and declared pesticide eligible for reregistration individual enduse products that contain the pesticide active ingredient still must be reregistered through this concluding part of the process known as product reregistration the agency makes sure that the risk reduction measures called for in reds are reflected on individual pesticide product labels in some cases the agency uses memoranda of agreement or other measures to include risk reduction measures on pesticide labels sooner before pr oduct reregistration is completed epa plans to complete the last product reregistration decisions several years after the last reds are signed40 special review epa continues to evaluate the safety of pesticides after they are registered as new information becomes available fifr requires registrant s to report promptly any new evidence of adverse effects from pe sticide exposure if evidence indicates that registered pesticide may pose an unreasonable risk epa may initiate specialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs109 41 registrations also may be canceled under ot her conditions for example if data are not submitted in response to epas request for add itional information to maintain registration or if registrant fails to pay the maintenance fee review of available information to reevaluate the risks and benefits of each registered use fifra also authorizes epa to require registrants to conduc t new studies to fill gaps in scientific understanding to assist risk asse ssments as result of special review epa may conclude that registration is adequate needs amendment or should be canceled canceling or suspending registration if special review or reregistration evaluation finds that registered use may cause unreasonable adverse effects epa may amend or cancel the registration41 fifra also allows registrants to request cancellation or amendment of registration to terminate selected pesticide uses requesting voluntary cancellation sometimes reflects registrants conclusion that the co st of additional studies is not worth the expected benefit that is pr ofit from sales if the registration would be maintained if registration is canceled for one or more uses of pesticide fifra does not permit it to be sold or distributed for thos uses in the united states although for specified period of time us farmers may use remaining stocks and commerce may continue for commodities that were legally treated with the pesticide fifra allows registrants to appeal an ep decision to cancel registra tion an appeal initiates lengthy review process during which the product may continue to be marketed however if there is threat of an imminent hazard during the time required to cancel registration fifra authorizes ep to suspend registration suspension orders which also may be app ealed stop sales and use of the pesticide in the event of suspension and cancellation fifra s ection 15 directs epa to request an appropriation from congress to compensate anyone who ow ned any of the pesticide and suffered any loss due to the suspension or cancellation the registrant of the suspended and canceled product is responsible however for all of the transportation and disposal costs and most storage costs use of unregistered pesticides fifra also allows for unregistered use of pesticide products in special circumstances section 5 allows experimental use permits for purposes of research and to collect data needed to register pesticide section 18 allows emergency exemptions from the provisions of fifra to be granted to federal or state agencies for example if there is virulent outbreak of diseas that cannot be controlled by registered products in addition section 24 c permits states to allow additional uses of federally registered product to meet special local needshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs110 enforcement generally epa has the authority to force fifra requirements however fifra

by section 27 to rescind states primary enforcement responsibility if it is not being carried out fifra section 11 authorizes epa to form cooperative agreements with states giving them the responsibility for training nd certifying applicators of restricted use pesticides states also may initially review and give preliminary approval to applications for emergency exemptions and special local needs registrations although under some conditions fifra allo ws epa later to deny stateapproved applications section 9 authorizes inspections by epa and authorized state officials of pesticide products where they are stored for distribution or sale section 13 authorizes epa to issue orders to stop sales and to seize supplies of pesticide products civil and criminal pena lties for violations of fifra are established in section 14 while section 15 provides indemnity payments for end users distributors and dealers of pesticides when regi strations are suspended and canceled federal district courts are authorized in section 16 to review epa final actions and omissions when action is not discretiona ry people adversely affected by an epa order may file for judicial review of the order following hearing but fifra does not authorize citizen suits against violators export of unregistered pesticides fifra does not give epa the authority to regulate domestic production for export of unregistered pesticides even if us registration has been canceled for health or environmental reas ons however fifra does re quire exporters to prepare or pack pesticides as specified by the purchaser and in accord with some of the fifra labeling provisions for example exporters must translate warning information into the language of the des tination fifra also requires exporters of unregistered pesticides to obtain the purchasers signature on statement acknowledging that the pesticide is unregis tered and cannot be sold in the united states epa is required to notify governme nts of other

into law by president nixon on january 1 1970 pl 91 190 nepa was the first of several major environmenta l laws enacted in the 1970s under title i of the act congress declared national policy that stated in part that it is the continuing policy of the federa l governmentto use all practicable means and measuresto create and maintain c onditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony and fulfill the social economic and other requirements of present and future generations of amer icans nepa also created the council on environmental quality ceq in the executive office of the president among other duties ceq was required to develop and recommend to the president nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs114 43 42 usc 43322cpolicies to foster and promote the improvement of environmental quality in the 1970s ceq played key role in shaping regulations for imple mentation of nepa one of the bestknown elements of nepa is its directive to federal agencies to incorporate environmental c onsiderations in their pl anning and decisionmaking through systematic interdisciplinary approach specifically nepa requires all federal agencies to prepare detailed statement of the environmental impact of and alternatives to major federal actions significantly affecting the environment the detailed statement was subsequently referred to as an environmental impact statement eis43 judicial interpretation of nepa ultimately determined that the act did not require agencies to elevate environmental concerns over other considerations rather the courts determined nepa requires only that the agency take hard look at projects environmental consequences before taking action if the adverse environmental effects of the proposed acti on are adequately iden tified and evaluated the agency is not constrained by nepa fro m deciding that other benefits outweigh the environmental costs in 1978 ceq formally promulgated regula tions binding on all federal agencies implementing nepas provisions in add ition to ceq congress authorized epa to perform certain duties to ensure the proper implementation of nepas eis requirements discussed below table 24 national environmental policy

nepa process nepa applies to all major federal ac tions including projects and programs entirely or partly funded assisted conducted regulated or appr oved by federal agencies to ensure that environmental impacts of those actions are considered before final decisions are made nepa requi res the preparation of an environmental impact statement eis for any major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment an eis is full disclosure document that provides description of the proposed action and the existing environment as well as analysishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs115 44 for more information see crs report rl33152 the national environmental policy act background and implementation by linda luther 45 40 cfr 15089 46 for

alternatives44 as required under ceqs regulations some level of analysis is also required when environmental impacts are uncertain or not significant projects for which it is not initially clear whether impacts will be significant require the preparation of an environmental assessment ea an ea is concise public document that analyzes the environmental impacts of proposed federal action and provides sufficient evidence to determine the level of significance of the impacts45 it is followed by either finding of significant impact fonsi or decision to prepare an eis categorical exclusions are actions that do not individually or cumulatively have significant social economic or environm ental effect and which the applicable agency has determined from past experience have significant impact such actions are excluded from the requirement to prepare an eis or ea prior to completing the appropriate nepa documentation the responsible federal official the lead agency is required to consult with and obtain the comments of any federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise cooperating agency with respect to any environmental impact involved for any given federal action compliance with wide variety of legislative and regulatory requirements enforceable by multip agencies may be required nepa documentation may be requi red to document compliance with all applicable environmental laws executive orders and ot her related requirements most agencies use the nepa process as means of coor dinating or demonstrating compliance with all applicable environmental requirements in this capacity nepa may function as an umbrella statute meaning any study review or consultation required by law that is related to the environment may be conducted within the framework of the nepa process complex federal projects such as highway construction projects forest thinning or oil and gas development projects may trigger compliance with literally dozens of federal state tribal and local environmental statutory and regulatory requirements these in turn require the participation or input of possibly dozens of agencies some members of congress have expressed concerns that the interagency coordination required of such projects is often inefficient leading to unnecessary delays in needed projects improved inte ragency cooperation s been identified by some members of congress as critical element to the success of streamlining the nepa process46 the ceqs regulations implementing nepa currently include variety of provisions intende d to expedite the compliance process in particular ceqs regulations specify procedures to reduce paperwork and delay the regulations also direct agencies to effici ently facilitate the process of complying with multiple statutory and regulatory requirements to do so the regulations direct agencies among other requirements tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs116 47 40 cfr 15002 and 1500415005 48 in ceqs

planning and prepare the eis early in the process emphasize interagency cooperation before the eis is prepared rather than submission of adversary comments on completed document insure the swift and fair resolu tion of lead agency disputes47 environmental protection agency functions under nepa nepa is broad with requirements potentially affecting all federal agencies also epa is not authorized to enfor ce nepas requirement s instead federal agencies are required to implement its requirements themselves48 however epa does have two distinct roles in the nepa process the first regards its duty under section 309 of the clean air act to review and comment publicly on the environmental impacts of pr oposed federal activities including those for which an eis is prepared after c onducting its review epa rates two elements of the action the adequacy of the eis and the environmental impact of the action49 the eis may be rated adequate needs more informa tion or inadequate the lead agency would be required to respond appropria tely depending upon epas rating with regard to rating the environmental impacts of an action epa would rate project in one of the following four ways lack of objections environmental concerns environmental objections environmentally unsatisfactory if epa determines that the action is environmentally unsatisfactory it is required to refer the matter to ceq to resolve any interagency dispute epas second duty is an administrative one in which it carries out the operational duties associated with the eis filing process in 1978 these duties were transferred to epa by ceq in accordance with memorandum of agreement moa entered into by epa and ceq u nder the terms of the moa epas office of federal activities is designated the official recipient of all eiss prepared by federal agencies epa maintains national eis filing system by maintaining the system epa facilitates public access to eiss by publishing weekly notices in the federal register of eiss available for pub lic review along with summaries of epas commentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30798crs117 50 such permits are more likely to be issued by states authorized to implement provisions of the clean water act and hence would not be considered federal actions subject to nepa compliance section 511c of the clean water act exempts other epa actions under the law from the requirements of nepaapart from these duties like any other federal agency epa may participate in the nepa process as lead agency when it is sponsoring its own federal actions currently nepa documentati on is required

system npdes permits for new sources 50 and for certain projects funded through epa annual appropriations acts legislation has specifically limited epas requirement to comply with nepa for certain actions for example section 7c of the energy supply and environmenta l coordination act of 1974 15 usc 793c1 exempts actions taken under the clean air act from the requirements of nepa epa is also exempted from the pr ocedural requirements of environmental laws including nepa for response actions pursuant to requirements under the comprehensive environmental respon compensation and liability act cercla courts also have consistently recognized that epa procedures or environmental reviews under enabling legisla tion are functionally equivalent to the nepa process and thus exempt from th
