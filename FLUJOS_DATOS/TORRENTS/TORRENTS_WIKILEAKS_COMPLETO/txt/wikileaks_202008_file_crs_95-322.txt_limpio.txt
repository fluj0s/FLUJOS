in science and technology science policy research division summary as part of its effort to reduce the costs of its military systems and gain greater access to stateoftheart technologies the department of defense dod is pursuing what it calls dualuse strategy this strategy seeks to make greater use of the commercial sector in developing and manufacturing military goods the strategy has two principal elements acquisition reform to remove the regulatory and administrative barriers that inhibit greater use of commercial technology and dualuse technology programs that actively seek to develop new dualuse technology in cooperation with the commercial sector b insert or spinon existing commercial technology into military systems and c spinoff existing military technology into the commercial sector acquisition reform has proceeded apace with bipartisan support dualuse technology programs however have generated much debate while critics have been supportive of the dualuse strategy in principle they felt the specific program initiatives with their explicit concern with commercial markets strayed too far from dods traditional programs the 104th congress eliminated the most visible of these programs the technology reinvestment project but supported two new programs proposed by dod how best to pursue dods dualuse strategy will remain an issue in the 105th congress what is dods dualuse strategy the term dualuse refers to the character of technology andor product that has both military and commercial application dods dualuse strategy is an attempt by dod to integrate the military technology and industrial base with that of the commercial sector by using more commercially available components in its systems or using commercial production lines to manufacture unique military components over the years dod has come to rely the extent to which is matter of some debate on dedicated technology and industrial base for the design development and production of systems and many of the components that go into those systems for some systems the reason for this is clear there is parallel demand in the commercial sector eg tanks submarines nuclear warheads however for other systems eg communications there is parallel congressional research service the library of congress crs2 commercial demand furthermore even in unique military systems there are components that are dualuse in nature what are the goals of dods dualuse strategy the primary goals of dods dualuse strategy are to reduce the cost of military systems and to gain better access to commerciallydriven technology there is evidence that certain products designed developed and manufactured specifically for dod cost more than comparable commercial products1 proponents of integration often blame more expensive overhead associated with government acquisition regulations unique military specifications and production standards lack of incentives to employ costsaving production techniques and in some cases lower economies of scale associated with militarydedicated production proponents believe that by relying more on the commercial sector and standard commercial business practices dod can piggyback on the commercial sectors economies of scale and the markets incentives for productivity besides saving money by taking greater advantage of commercial production proponents of integration believe dod could also save money by relying more on the commercial sector to develop or codevelop new technologies and products of interest to both sectors whereas military needs drove development in certain technologies and products in the past especially in electronics and aerospace commercial demands have now become the driving force in some of these areas for dod to field the latest technology in these areas it must try to develop similar technology itself or have access to the commercial technology while dod could and often has sought to pursue its own parallel development it does not always keep pace with commercial developments nor does the investment always represent socially efficient expenditure of resources2 while dod is primarily interested in lowering costs and gaining access to technology dualuse proponents also believe that better integration can contribute to better national economic growth even though dod accounts for an increasingly smaller share of the total us investment in research and development it still is the single largest investor 1 some estimates range as high as 15 times more expensive for particular items and up to 25 higher for total systems costs csis steering committee on security and technology integrating commercial and military technologies for national strength an agenda for change center for strategic and international studies washington 1991 101 p study by coopers and lybrand estimated average cost premiums of 18 for the examples it studied some analysts however caution about making direct comparisons between military and commercial products 2 an oftencited example of this is integrated circuits although integrated circuits ic were initially developed with private capital military applications drove further development and provided critical early market in the early 1960s military and space procurement accounted for 90 of ic production however by the late 1960s the commercial market began expanding much more rapidly by the end of the 1970s military procurement accounted for less than 10 during this time the ics going into commercial products were faster and more reliable than those going into military systems report entitled barriers to the use of commercial integrated circuit technology in defense systems provides dods latest set of recommendations on how to increase the use of commercial ics in its systems crs3 according to some dod should do what it can to maximize the social benefits of that investment while dod may acknowledge economic growth as an additional benefit of dualuse strategy its primary goals remain cost reduction and technology access the clinton white house however does view the dualuse strategy as an integral part of its overall economic growth policies this linkage to general economic policy raised suspicion among some that the dualuse efforts were addressing broader policy issues at the expense of national security principal elements of dods dualuse strategy there are two principal elements to dods effort to integrate the military and commercial technology and production base acquisition reform and technology programs that emphasize dualuse acquisition reform seeks to remove those regulatory barriers and internal dod practices that inhibit program managers and contract officers from acquiring commercially available products or from producing military unique products on commercial production lines3 dualuse technology programs actively seek to develop new dualuse technology in cooperation with the commercial sector in such way that commercial and military application can be pursued in parallel b insert or spinon commercial technology into military systems and c spinoff military technology to the commercial sector reform efforts to reform acquisition rules and regulations to encourage greater use of commercial technology in military systems have been around for at least 20 years congress has shown great deal of interest in this issue enacting legislation to make changes andor instruct the secretary of defense to review establish and eliminate regulations inhibiting the use of commercial items proponents of reform suggest that these past efforts have been largely unsuccessful due to lack of highlevel support or attention these regulations have evolved over time to meet various other policy goals eg assuring standardization and quality of military products protecting the government and the taxpayer from fraudulent and excessive costs and assuring fair access to government procurement and each has developed constituency both inside and outside dod the clinton administration raised acquisition reform to the top of its agenda and created deputy secretary for acquisition reformposition within the office of the secretary of defense to oversee dods efforts reform is proceeding on two fronts those associated with statutory requirements and those that are essentially internal to dod statutory reform was passed in the federal acquisition streamlining act of 1994 pl 103355 and again in the federal acquisition reform act of 1996 pl 104106 among other things these acts have expanded the definition of commercial items relaxed cost and pricing data requirements on commercial items and made more flexible contractual requirements for commercial items internal reforms have focused mainly on military specifications and standards process has been put in place that is designed to support continual review and integration of military and commercial specifications and standards the defense standardization 3 those barriers are generally grouped into four categories unique military specifications and standards costprice data requirements and unique accounting methods technical data rights and unique contract requirements crs4 program two major policy directives have been handed down by the secretary of defense that have pushed the process forward the first directed that all solicitations should use performancebased requirements and that program managers must justify in writing why military specification is being required the second directive allows firms to adopt single management system and uniform manufacturing practices for an entire manufacturing facility the single process initiative technology programs much of the technology in which dod invests could be considered dualuse however in more traditional approach dod would be concerned primarily with the military application of technology leaving subsequent or parallel commercial application strictly to the private sector the dualuse approach that dod is emphasizing seeks to develop dualuse technologies in way that actively promotes its development and use simultaneously in both sectors this involves cooperative cost shared development of dualuse technologies with the commercial sector through industry led consortia4 it also involves an explicit effort to insert where possible commercial items into existing systems and in new designs and to move production of unique military items to commercial lines the flagship program for carrying out the technology element of dods strategy became the technology reinvestment project trp the trp evolved out of the defense conversion reinvestment and economic transition act of 1992 and originally was collection of seven programs that supported range of activities including dualuse technology development technology diffusion via extension programs and the development of manufacturing education programs at universities the technology development programs were an expansion of an earlier authority that allowed dods advanced research projects agency arpa to enter into cooperative agreements and other transactions with industryled consortia to conduct precompetitive dualuse technology development on costshared basis the model for these costshared industryled consortia was the semiconductor manufacturing technology consortium sematech established in fy 1988 to develop next generation semiconductor processing technology another example was dods proposed flat panel display initiative this initiative sought to expand dods investment in new flatpaneldisplay technologies to include investments aimed at helping to create viable us commercial flatpanel industry from which dod could buy its displays5 while arpa received the most attention and money for implementing dualuse technology development programs the services too were given the authority to enter into cooperative research and development agreements cradas and other transactions which would allow them to cooperatively develop technology on cost 4 for discussion of the distinction between dualuse technology and dualuse technology programs see the difference

1994 science and technology st strategy mentions that the services were to develop their own formal dualuse programs including specific programs aimed at inserting commercial technology into weapon systems the services have been slow to initiate such programs issues there is little disagreement about the need for acquisition reform at least in the context of commercial items the acquisition streamlining act of 1994 and the federal acquisition reform act of 1996 passed with bipartisan support the clinton administration has acted expeditiously on implementing the changes called for in the act the biggest question now is whether sufficient incentives have been given to encourage innovative behavior at the program manager and contract officer level who must implement the policy daytoday another question is once these reforms are implemented how much money can dod really save much of the motivation behind reform is based on the assumption that the military industrial base is significantly segregated from the commercial base examples are many but the extent to which the base is segregated is unknown closer examination shows that segregation can occur at three different levels research administration production and in many cases firm that segregates one part of its operation may be relatively integrated in the other parts of its operations nor is the cost premium associated with segregation well established again some cost estimates have been made but to what extent these examples are indicative of the industry as whole is unknown7 although any savings may be sufficient to justify the efforts being undertaken dod is counting on significant savings to fund planned increases in force modernization in the near future and it is unclear if those levels of savings can be realized while admitting that it is not possible to estimate total savings to date or to project future savings dod has estimated that it has saved to date as result of milspec reform alone at least 2 billion based on limited number of acquisition programs that it has studied8 dods dualuse technology programs have generated much more debate for some critics the approach with its explicit concern on commercializing technology has strayed too far afield from dods primary mission which is to organize equip deploy and sustain military forces given the inability of projected defense budgets to meet all of the national 6 for discussion on cradas see technology transfer use of federally funded research and development by wendy h schacht crs issue brief ib85031 updated regularly cradas and other transactions are different cradas allow technology to be transferred and information exchanged and data rightslicenses to be negotiated but does not involve federal funding of nonfederal participation other transactions do allow federal dollars to be used to support nonfederal participation 7 the office of technology assessment discusses the difficulty in estimating how much dod could save from better integration noting however that conservative estimate of 5 would still result in few billion dollars per year office of technology assessment assessing the potential

acquisition and technology june 1996 20p crs6 security needs identified in the nations national security strategy many members of congress feel that dod should concentrate its resources on more traditional development programs there are also those who are skeptical either philosophically or as practical matter of the federal governments ability let alone dods to plan for and execute programs to accelerate the commercialization of new technologies and products in economically efficient manner9 they would say that this is better left to the private sector dualuse proponents however suggest that the laizze faire spinoff model used to explain the diffusion of military technology into commercial markets in the past does not capture the complexity of the interaction between the two sectors and is not competitive approach in the new international marketplace10 while expressing its support for the goals of dods dualuse strategy to save money and gain quicker access to stateoftheart technology the 104th congress did not support the approach taken by the trp the project was eliminated in fy199611 for fy1997 the administration proposed two new programs the dualuse application program and the commercial technology insertion program both are tied much more to specific military needs both were funded by congress at reduced levels the administration however plans to discontinue providing separate account for dualuse projects there has evolved consensus between the administration and congress that dualuse projects should be integrated into regular research programs as just another tool for program managers to accomplish their objectives the issue for the 105th congress is to figure out how to encourage reluctant program managers to use their authority to initiate such projects 9 for example see claude barfield flat panel displays second look issues in science and technology winter 19941995 p 2125 in that article barfield suggests that the flat panel display initiative hinges on the governments ability to secondguess the market ibid p 22 10 closer examination shows that in those areas of successful spinoff dod provided critical early markets with procurement accounts lowered dod may longer be able to provide those early markets see alic john et beyond spinoff military and commercial technologies in changing world harvard business school
