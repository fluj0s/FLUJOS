program in engine manufacturers assn v south coast air quality mgmt dist the issue is the preemptive scope of the caa program regulating mobile sources of air pollution why the cour t has taken these cases is unclear given that they present constitutional issues but only narrow questions of statutory construction nor is there direct split in th circuit courts perhaps the current courts demonstrated interest in federalis m issues is part of the reason it is noteworthy enough when the supreme court agrees to hear case involving particular statute agreeing to take two in short span of time is even more so on february 24 2003 the court granted certiorari in alaska dept of environmental conservation v epa 1 case dealing with epas enforcement and oversight authority over state determinations unde r the clean air act caa2 on june 9 2003 the court granted certiorari in engine manufacturers assn v sout h coast air quality mgmt dist 3 case addressing the preemptive scope of the caa program regulating mobile sources of air pollution not only do both cases involve the same statute they also both involve the same broad theme the allocation of authority between the federal and state governments under the caa4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21580crs2 4 continued pumping of water by state water management agency that adds nothing to the water being pumped constitutes an addition of pollutant from point source so as to trigger the requirement of npdes permit under the clean water act though the case involves the application of federal statute to state ag ency the clean water act issue could have been raised by any waterpumping entity not merely governmental ones 5 caa title i part c 6 caa 165a 42 usc 7475a 7 caa 165a4 42 usc 7475a4 8 under caa section 307b petition for review of any final action of the epa administrator that is locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in the united state court of appeals for the appropriate circuit rather than th district court 42 usc 7607balaska dept of environmen tal conservation v epa in this case the issue before the supreme court is may epa issue caa noncompliance orders to company where such orders effectively overrule state permit issued to the same company for th same activity under th states epaapproved clean air program some background may be useful in areas of the united states where the air is cleaner than the caas national standards require the act limits the extent to which air quality will be allowed to deteriorate down to those standards this caa program is called prevention of significant deterioration psd5 the psd program is implemented in each state having psd ar ea by among other things permit program for major new and modified sour ces of emissions in that area6 this psd permit program is run by epa unless the state opts to incl ude an epaapproved psd program in its state implementation plan sip whoever runs the program federal government or state persons seeking to construct major new and modified sources of emissions in psd area must commit to using best available control technology bact7 alaska is psd area with respect to nitrogen dioxide under the states epa approved sip the state rather than epa is the psd permit issuer as the caa requires the states sip demands bact in alaska dec that state determined that mining companys application for psd permit needed for new electric generators it wished to install satisfied bact epa disagreed however and issued noncompliance order stating that alaskas authorization of the companys new generators violated the caa and alaskas sip alaska issued the psd permit anyway prompting two further orders from epa preventing the mining company from installing the new generators until it demonstrated to epa compliance with bact requirements in the caa and alaska si p alaska and the mining company sought judicial review of these epa orders in the ninth circuit8 they argued that epas noncompliance orders exceeded its caa aut hority because the orders effectively invalidated state permit issu ed under an epaapproved sip the ninth circuit held for epa it ruled that the caa compels the conclusion that the administrative orders fall w ithin the epas enforcement and oversighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21580crs3 9 42 usc 7413a5authority the court saw the acts language and legislative history as straightforwardly supporting this conclusion as to the acts language caa section 113 a5 says that when ever epa finds that state is not acting in compliance with any requirement of the act relating to new sources it may issue an order prohibiting the construction or modification of any major stationary source 9 targetting only psd caa section 167 commands epa to take measures including the issuance of an order to prevent the construction or modification of major emitting facility which does not conform to the requirements of the caa portion establishing the psd prog ram the bact requirement fits both sections it is both caa requirement relating to ne w sources under section 113a5 and requirement of the psd portion of the caa under section 167 thus the court found epas orders to be authorized by both sections as to the acts legislative history the court perceived steady progression since or iginal enactment of the caa in 1963 toward greater federal oversight of state activity the counterarguments of alaska and the mining company were rejected they argued that because section 1693 gives th state discretion to determine bact epa lacks authority to veto that judgment base d on mere difference of opinion the court responded that neither section 113a5 nor section 167 contain any exemption for requirements that involve the st ates exercise of discretion nor were the state and mining company successful in arguing that epa can only review whether the state complied with objective as opposed to discretionary requi rements of the caa whatever objective requirements means said the court it must include the states provision of reasoned justification for its bact termination this conclude d epa the state and mining company did not provide moving past epas authority to revisit the states ba ct determination the court addressed the validity of its conclusion that the deter mination was an abuse of discretion epas determination it he ld was not arbitrary and capricious in particular the states apparent motivation for rejecting selective catalytic reduction appreciation of the mining companys contribution to the local economy is not an accepted justification under the approach it used to determine bact hence epas orders were sustained engine manufacturers assn v south coast air quality management district in this case the issue before the supreme court is whether the caa preempts rules of states air quality management district saying that when local operators of vehicle fleets purchase or replace their fleet vehicles they may acquire only those vehicles that the district has designated here we are dealing not with stati onary sources of air pollution as in alaska dec but rather with mobile sources ie vehi cles key difference between how the caa treats these two basic source categories is the degree to which state standards are preempted the caa disavow s any preemption of state stationarysource emission standards that are stricter than federally required in sharp contrast the act generallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21580crs4 10 42 usc 7543a 11 42 usc 7543b 12 42 usc 7507 13 158 f supp 1107 cd cal 2001 14 id at 1117 15 american automobile mfrs assn v cahill 152 f3d 196 2d cir 1998 new york assn of international automobile mfrs inc v commissioner 208 f3d 1 1st cir 2000 massachusettsprohibits state mobilesource emission standards entirely caa section 209a says that states may not adopt any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles nor require any approval relating to the cont rol of emissions from any new motor vehicle as condition preceden t to the initial retail sale 10 there are exceptions however caa sec tion 209b offers preemption waiver applicable solely to california where that state determines that its standards will be at least as protective as the federal ones and epa on application for the waiver makes adverse findings11 in addition caa section 177 llows states with epaapproved nonattainment plans to piggyback ont the california emission standards12 that is they may adopt emission standard s for new vehicles that are st ricter than the federal ones as long as their standards are identical to californias for the model year in question turning to the facts the california legislature authorized the south coast air quality management district scaqmd to adopt fleet rules to reduce auto pollution in this highly polluted area including angele s in 2000 scaqmd adopted six rules each of which mandates that when certain local operators of fleets purchase or replace their fleet vehicles they may acquire only those specific vehicles that scaqmd has designated as meeting its requirements for example fleet rule 1192 requires public transit fleet operators with 15 or more vehi cles to acquire alternativefuel heavyduty vehicles when procuring or leasin g vehicles with some exemptions plaintiffs two trade associations with an inte rest in diesel fuel use argued that the fleet rules violate caa section 209a in two ways 1 they constitute preempted standards relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles and 2 they establish preempted conditions precedent to the sale of new motor vehicles the federal district cour t rejected both arguments13 first it said the fleet rules do not set standard relating to the control of emissions asserted the court rather than imposing any numerical control on new vehi cles the rules regulate the purchase of previouslycertified vehicles14 to be sure there is cas law finding caa preemption of new york and massachuse tts laws requiring that certain volume of vehicle sales in those states be ze roemission vehicles15 it does not follow however said the court that rule regulating the purchase of vehicles is such standard the fleet rules are not standards plaintiffs may continue to sell any vehicle that is otherwise certified in california furthermore caa section 246 ex pressly recognizes in the courts view thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21580crs5 16 42 usc 7586 17 309 f3d 551 9th cir 2002 18 the most recent statutory environmental fede ralism decision of the supreme court is solid waste agency of northern cook county swancc v us army corps of engineers 531 us 159 2001 swancc involved the scope of the united states wetlands permitting authority under the clean water act specifically whether that authority extended to certain isolated waters the court held that it did not fleet rules must be established in areas with very high pollution and authorizes restrictions on the purch ase of fleet vehicles16 second californias fleet rules said the district court do not establish prohibited conditions precedent to the sale of new motor vehicles the rules it noted regulate the purchasing and leasing not the sale of vehicl by fleet operators they merely require such operators to choose from among the l east polluting of statecertified vehicles importantly the court pointed out that th rules impose new emission requirements and thus do not run afoul of congress concern underlying motorvehicle emission standard preemption namely that auto manufacturers not have to build engines to comply with multiplicity of state standards finally the court rejected plaintiffs argument that the fleet rules violate caa section 177 section 177 it held applies only to noncalifornia optin states not to california itself on appeal to the ninth circuit the di strict courts nonpreemption ruling as to section 209 was affirmed but with discussion17 the holding of section 177 non applicability was not appealed comments in both alaska dec and engine mfrs assn the only issue that is before the supreme court is the federalstate one the epa override authority in alaska dec and the preemption issue in engine mfrs assn other issues in the two cases have fallen by the wayside the cases fall squarely into the long line of decisions dating to the early 1990s in which the current court or at leas t the five justices regarded as generally conservative has shown intense interest in federalism issues while most of these supreme court decisions ddress federalism in cons titutional context under the commerce clause tenth amendment or eleventh amendment few like alaska dec and engine mfrs assn are solely statutory construction cases18 alaska dec and engine mfrs assn also tap into the rich body of debate and case law as to how the federalstate partnership envisioned by congress in the caa and other similar federal environmental programs should pl ay out in specific situations that said from federalism perspective the lowercourt decisions in alaska dec and engine mfrs assn point in opposite directions the former taking the federal side the latter the states rights position looking at the decisions fro m another perspective however they are in harmony in the sense that both decisions take the environmental side of the argument httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21580crs6 it is anyones guess of course why the supreme court takes case as mentioned alaska dec and engine mfrs assn present constitutional issues nor is there in either instance direct split in the circuit courts perhaps the courts interest was piqued by the shared federalism theme and intensified by the environmental context perhaps it is the forum below the ninth circuit wh ich has suffered high supreme court reversal rate in the past oral argument in both cases is schedul ed early in the courts upcoming term beginning october 2003
