passed the social security benefit enhancements for women act of 2002 hr 4069 as amended by vote of 4180 hr 4069 includes benefit enhancements targeted to certain divorced spouses and disabled and elderly widowers specifically the measure would 1 eliminate the requirement that widowers seeking disability benefits must have become disabled within 7 years of the workers death 2 eliminate the 2year waiting period for divorced spouses benefits when the worker has remarried and 3 disregard months after the workers death in the application of early retirement rules for purposes of determining the limit on widowers benefits payable on the workers record preliminary estimates by the congressional budget office show that hr 4069 would affect over 120000 persons and cost 33 billion over 10 years the social security administrations office of the chief actuary estimates that the measure would have only negligible effect on the longrange actuarial balance of the social security trust funds this report will be updated as legislative action occurs background the social security program provides benefits to retired and disabled workers to their dependents and to the survivors of deceased workers in 2000 there were 45 million social security recipients of those 53 were women compared to 39 men 8 children and 81 of the total recipient population was age 62 or older benefit amounts varied by gender the average benefit was 928 for men and 696 for women for retired workers the average benefit was 951 for men 730 for women for the spouses of retired workers 243 for men 431 for women for disabled workers 883 for men 661 for women for nondisabled widowers 607 for men 812 for women and for disabled widowers 362 for men 524 for women social security is the primary source of income for the elderly persons age 65 and older in 2000 90 of the elderly population had income from social security compared to 29 with private pensions and 14 with government employee pensions for 64 of elderly recipients social security represented at least half of total income congressional research service the library of congress crs2 for 20 of elderly recipients it was the only source of income social security was the only source of income for 11 of married couples and 26 of nonmarried persons1 social security prevents many of the elderly from falling into poverty for example in 2000 85 of elderly social security recipients were poor without social security 481 would have been poor although the poverty rate for elderly social security recipients is lower than that for the elderly population overall 85 compared to 102 poverty rates for elderly social security recipients vary by gender and marital status in 2000 the poverty rate for married social security recipients was 28 compared to 138 for nonmarried men and 162 for nonmarried women for widowed recipients the rate was 123 for men 150 for women for never married recipients the rate was 259 for men 195 for women for divorced recipients the rate was 97 for men 185 for women2 these statistics illustrate the importance of social security for the elderly in general and for women in particular on average women earn lower benefits than men because they earn less and spend more time outside the labor force in addition women tend to live longer than men are less likely to have other sources of retirement income and are httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21228 more likely to be poor on march 20 2002 representative shaw introduced hr 4069 bill designed to enhance benefits for certain divorced spouses and disabled and elderly widowers3 although the benefit changes in hr 4069 would be gender neutral the measure targets benefits most often paid to women4 on may 14 2002 managers amendment to hr 4069 was considered by the house of representatives under suspension of the rules ie the measure did not go through the house ways and means social security subcommittee or the full committee5 the house passed hr 4069 as amended by vote of 4180 preliminary estimates by the congressional budget office cbo show that the measure would affect over 120000 persons and cost 33 billion from fiscal years 200320126 ssas office of the chief actuary estimates that the effect on the longrange actuarial balance of the social security trust funds would be negligible ie less than 005 percent of taxable payroll based on the intermediate assumptions of the 2001 social security 1 nonmarried includes persons who are separated or married but living apart from their spouse 2 poverty rates for the elderly are based on family income for more information see social security administration ssa income of the population 55 or older 2000 annual statistical supplement 2001 and fast facts figures june 2001 3 hr 4069 is bipartisan measure sponsored by representative shaw chairman of the house ways and means social security subcommittee and cosponsored by representative matsui ranking democrat on the social security subcommittee along with 38 other members 4 in december 2000 4661540 women and 37120 men received nondisabled widowers benefits similarly of the 200130 persons who received disabled widowers benefits 168590 were widows 26750 were surviving divorced wives and 4790 were widowers 5 under suspension of the rules floor amendments were not allowed and twothirds majority vote was required for passage 6 the estimated cost of hr 4069 amended as passed by the house ie including the tax provisions incorporated in the managers amendment to hr 4069 is 33 billion over 10 years the estimated 10year cost of hr 4069 as introduced ie benefit changes only is 4 billion crs3 trustees report the major provisions of hr 4069 amended as passed by the house on may 14 2002 are described below7 major provisions of hr 4069 repeal of 7year restriction on eligibility for widowers insurance benefits based on disability under current law surviving spouses including divorced spouses may be entitled to widowers benefits beginning at age 60 however surviving spouses may be entitled to benefits as early as age 50 if they are disabled and the qualifying disability occurred 1 before or within 7 years of the workers death 2 within 7 years of having been previously entitled to benefits on the workers record as surviving spouse with child in care or 3 within 7 years of having been previously entitled to benefits as disabled surviving spouse that ended because the qualifying disability ended whichever is later benefits for disabled widowers beginning at age 50 were enacted in 1967 when workers aged 5059 needed to work for up to 7 years in order to qualify for disability benefits on their own record the 7year requirement was httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21228 designed to protect disabled widowers by allowing them to qualify for benefits if they lacked the work history needed to qualify for disability benefits on their own record hr 4069 would eliminate the requirement that surviving spouses must become disabled within 7 years of the workers death in order to qualify for widowers benefits from ages 5059 ie it would allow disabled surviving spouses to qualify for widowers benefits from ages 5059 regardless of when the disability occurred this provision would apply to benefits payable for months after november 2002 cbo estimates that this provision would affect 26000 persons exemption from 2year waiting period for divorced spouses benefits upon other spouses remarriage under current law spouses benefits are payable provided that the worker is receiving benefits however if the worker is eligible to receive benefits but is not receiving them divorced spouse may be eligible for benefits on the workers record but only if the divorce has been final for at least 2 years this 2year waiting period in cases of divorce was established to discourage individuals from seeking divorce as way to gain independent entitlement on the workers record hr 4069 would deem the 2year requirement met if the worker marries someone other than the former spouse during the 2year period following the divorce this would allow the divorced spouse to claim benefits on the workers record immediately assuming other eligibility requirements are met8 under conforming amendment divorced spouses who qualify for benefits under the 2year exemption would not be affected by the earnings test as it applies to the worker ie the divorced spouses benefit would not be affected if the worker has earnings that cause benefits payable on his or her record to be 7 on may 17 2002 senator gordon smith introduced s 2533 the social security benefit enhancements for women act of 2002 s 2533 contains the same provisions as hr 4069 as introduced on march 20 2002 8 to qualify for oldage benefits on workers record the divorced spouse must have been married to the worker for at least 10 years before the divorce became final must be at least age 62 and must be currently unmarried crs4 withheld see the explanatory notes section for description of the earnings test this provision would apply to benefits payable for months after november 2002 cbo estimates that this provision would affect fewer than 500 persons months after deceased individuals death disregarded in applying early retirement rules with respect to deceased individual for purposes of limitation on widowers benefits under current law surviving spouses including divorced spouses may be eligible for widowers benefits beginning at age 60 or age 50 if disabled the widowers basic benefit is equal to 100 of the workers primary insurance amount9 if the widower files for benefits before the nra his or her benefits are then permanently reduced to take into account early retirement however if the worker filed for benefits before the nra and the widowers benefit payable on the workers record exceeds the benefit the worker was receiving before his or her death the widowers benefit is subject to limit under special provision of the law called the widowers limit provision under the widowers limit provision the widowers benefit is limited to the higher of 1 the benefit the worker would be receiving if he or she were still alive and 2 825 of the workers pia10 if the worker died before reaching the nra and he or she had benefits withheld due to the earnings test the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21228 workers benefit is recomputed to take into account months for which benefits were not paid for purposes of determining the limit on the widowers benefit11 hr 4069 would treat months of nonpayment between the workers retirement and attainment of the nra due to the workers death in the same manner as months of nonpayment due to the earnings test that is if worker elects early retirement and dies before reaching the nra the workers benefit would be recomputed at the time the worker would have reached the nra to exclude the month of death and all subsequent months leading up to the workers attainment of the nra from the actuarial reduction for early retirement basing the early retirement reduction in the workers benefit only on the number of months the worker collected benefits between his or her retirement and the nra rather than the total number of months during that period would raise the limit on the widowers benefit payable on the workers record this provision would apply 9 the primary insurance amount pia is the basic benefit amount before any adjustments for early or delayed retirement if an individual files for benefits before the normal retirement age nra the age at which unreduced benefits are first payable his or her benefits are permanently reduced to take into account the longer period of benefit receipt similarly if an individual files for benefits after the nra his or her benefits are permanently increased to take into account the shorter period of benefit receipt 10 for more information see ssa office of policy office of research evaluation and statistics the widowers limit provision of social security by david weaver ores working paper series number 92 june 2001 11 if recipients benefits are withheld due to the earnings test see the explanatory notes section for description of the earnings test his or her benefit is recomputed at the nra to take into account months for which benefits were not paid ie the actuarial reduction for early retirement does not apply to months of nonpayment due to the earnings test resulting in higher monthly benefit if the recipient dies before reaching the nra the deceased workers benefit is recomputed in the same manner at the time of the workers death to determine the limit on the widowers benefit crs5 to benefits payable for months after november 2002 cbo estimates that this provision would affect 96000 persons offsetting tax provisions hr 4069 amended as passed by the house contains three offsetting tax provisions12 one provision would allow individual taxpayers to exclude from gross income any interest payments received from the government on tax overpayments ie the interest payments would not be subject to federal income taxes in addition the interest payments would not be treated as tax exempt interest for the purpose of determining the portion of social security benefits subject to federal income taxes13 the exclusion from gross income would apply only in cases where tax overpayments were made in error ie it would not apply in cases where the secretary of the treasury determines that tax overpayment was made deliberately to take advantage of the exclusion this provision would apply to interest payments received after december 31 2006 second provision would allow taxpayers to make cash deposit to the treasury which may be treated as payment for income estate gift and certain excise taxes not assessed at the time of the deposit to stop the accumulation of interest charges on httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21228 potential tax underpayment for example in cases where proposed tax deficiency is being disputed by the taxpayer the portion of the deposit attributable to disputed tax item would earn interest taxpayers would be allowed to withdraw deposits not used for the payment of tax at any time upon written request unless the secretary determines that collection of the tax is in jeopardy interest earned on withdrawn amounts would not be eligible for the exclusion from gross income provided for under the first provision if the taxpayers position is ultimately upheld in tax dispute the taxpayer would be refunded the deposit plus interest the refund would be treated as an overpayment of tax alternatively if the taxpayer loses the tax would be treated as having been paid and the accrual of interest charges on the underpayment stopped at the time the deposit was made this provision would apply to deposits made after the date of enactment third provision would authorize the secretary of the treasury to enter into written agreements with taxpayers for partial payment of tax liabilities in installments rather than only full payment as authorized under current law if the secretary determines that the agreement will facilitate collection of the tax liability it would require the secretary to review partial payment installment agreements at least once every 2 years this provision would apply to agreements entered into on or after the date of enactment 12 similar provisions were included in hr 3991 the taxpayer protection and irs accountability act of 2002 h rept 107394 as amended which was defeated in the house by vote of 205219 on april 10 2002 13 under current law up to 50 of social security benefits are subject to federal income taxes if modified adjusted gross income agi agi plus taxexempt interest plus onehalf of social security benefits exceeds 25000 for single person or 32000 for married couple filing jointly up to 85 of social security benefits are taxable if modified agi plus onehalf of social security benefits exceeds 34000 for single person or 44000 for married couple filing jointly revenue from the first tier of benefit taxation is credited to the social security trust funds revenue from the second tier is credited to the medicare hospital insurance trust fund crs6 the joint committee on taxation estimates that the tax provisions would result in net revenue increase of 694 million over 10 years fiscal years 20032012 the provisions would result in revenue gains during the first part of the projection period and revenue losses during the latter part all revenue effects are assumed to be onbudget ie social security revenues would not be affected14 explanatory notes social security earnings test under the earnings test benefits are withheld if the recipient is below the nra and has earnings from work above specified amount 11280 in 2002 benefits are withheld by 1 for every 2 of earnings above that amount the earnings test longer applies beginning with the month the recipient reaches the nra during the year in which recipient reaches the nra higher annual exempt amount applies 30000 in 2002 and benefits are withheld by 1 for every 3 of earnings above that amount the annual exempt amounts are indexed to average wage growth the earnings test applies to the workers retirement benefit and to dependents httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21228 and survivors benefits payable on the workers record however benefits for divorced spouses are not withheld if the divorce has been final for at least 2 years retirement age increase under the social security amendments of 1983 the normal retirement age nra is being increased gradually from 65 to 67 in january 2000 the nra began increasing in 2month increments for persons born in 1938 ie persons age 62 in 2000 through 1943 the nra will remain 66 for persons born in 1944 through 1954 it will increase again in 2month increments until it reaches 67 for persons born in 1960 and later the earliest eligibility age remains 62 adjustments for early retirement if worker files for benefits before the nra his or her benefits are permanently reduced to take into account the longer expected period of benefit receipt the adjustments made for early retirement are actuarial in that assuming the individual survives to life expectancy he or she will receive the same total lifetime benefit as if he or she had filed for benefits at the nra the majority of workers elect early retirement 14 the first tax provision would have only secondary effect with regard to federal income taxes paid on social security benefits over 10 years the estimated net cost of hr 4069 as amended is 3307 billion 850 million in net onbudget costs and 2456 billion in offbudget costs
