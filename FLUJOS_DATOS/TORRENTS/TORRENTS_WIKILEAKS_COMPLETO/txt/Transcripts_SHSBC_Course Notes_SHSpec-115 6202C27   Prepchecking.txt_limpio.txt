6202c27 shspec115 prepchecking dont take withholds you the auditor have and assume the pc has them this does tend to happen if you ask an auditor to list the withholds he thinks the pc has he will list his own especially if he doesnt know the pc very well you could take that list and check it against the auditors list of withholds and come out pretty close sometimes the auditor doesnt even realize what chain he is running he may recognize it afterwards this happens especially if the auditor doesnt take some time at the beginning of session to sort out the area for instance once lrh started from ptp then after 5 12 hours he realized that the subject of the chain was women once the auditor knows the basics of metering and repetitive questions trs etc and the mechanics of prepchecking he just needs to practice doing it until one day he finds it quite natural nobody can lay down what the pc will give you as withholds so you cant make it into totally rote procedure dont try to impose your moral code on the pc and dont let yourself get talked out of pulling withhold because it doesnt offend your mores when it does bother the pc 3dxx item that gives the pc pain is the pcs terminal an item that gives sensations and misemotion is the pcs oppterm to prepcheck terminal take whatever the terminals doingness is and get what the ow in the area is even if it is totally backwards eg the item could be moral man the zero question for this would be have you ever been moral you can get into the whole area of laudable withholds if the terminal was withheld all the terminals actions were also withheld there is also lot of withholding just in the laudable withhold area which could add up to withholding oneself from living more details on running routine 3dxx an item isnt winner it is only an apparent suppressor of other things and items there are two kinds of withholds for each terminal the withholds of dramatizing it and the withholds of not dramatizing it so if you dramatize the item you are obviously wrong and if you dont dramatize it you are wrong so you get withholds off both doing it and not doing it the easiest time to start to clear the pc is when the pc is clear of course now you have all the data you need to do it you know all about it but you have to apply the mechanics of scientology to case at time when you dont have all the data what you do have is all the rules axioms parts of the mind be do have etc you also have procedural systems like the withhold system to get what is keeping the pc from communicating but what are the withholds how are they formed up it is up to you to find that out you will find that if you give the pc good controlled session going right down the groove of something the pc can talk about because it is on the chain of withholds the pc can talk to you about that are real to the pc as withholds and if you can keep the pcs attention directed and if you make the pc go on and look you will find that the pc makes his goal and gets gains test of whether you are doing well with the pc is whether you know more every few hours about what makes this case tick whether you have higher understanding of the pc and of the human mind that is what you would expect of prepcheck activity as well as the pc making his goals and gains if your prepchecking is bad it could be because your auditing is bad or it could be that you can audit but you cant prepcheck you may have been expecting the pc to grow wings during prepchecking if prepchecking seems very arduous to you you are probably not doing it right it is really easy when you are doing it well like riding bicycle it is easier than other auditing and gives more gains per unit of time than any other auditing
