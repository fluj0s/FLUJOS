program is amended to add indian tribes as eligible borrowers the authority to provide loan guarantees for indian housing to those who could not otherwise acquire financing because of the unique legal

used for housing under the jurisdiction of an indian tribe for which an indian housing plan has been submitted and approved the program is amended to provide that if borrower defaults and the lender opts not to seek foreclosure hud may accept assignment of the loan and pay the guarantee to the lender if that is found to be in the best interest of the government the government national mortgage association ginnie mae is authorized to guarantee section 184 loans subject to the approval of the affected indian tribe and the secretary of the interior 50year leases of trust or restricted indian

the program was funded for the first time in fy1998 the program was funded at 600 million for fy1998 620 million for fy1999 and fy2000 650 million for fy2001 and 649 million for fy2002 the

tribes crs5 in fy1999 364 recipients servicing 528 tribes in fy2000 and 307 recipients serving 531 indian tribes in fy2001 according to hud in fy2002 there are total of 583 potential tribal grantees eligible for total of about 641 million in grants under prior law hud had provided assistance to approximately 200 indian housing authorities program prospects and problems it has been argued that nahasda has started series of discussions that had not taken place before with nahasda allowing tribes more control over their operations tribes are creating housing partnerships with lenders tribes are educating tribal members about credit saving homebuying and banking practices technical assistance and mentoring programs are being put in place to help native americans establish their own programs and institutions several local and regional lenders have developed the expertise to work with native american tribes in addition the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac sponsor programs for lending to native americans while all parties generally agree that nahasda has been successful the program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21241 is not without its problems in august 2001 the hud inspector general ig issued report on the implementation of nahasda its nine findings are that 1 hud has not accurately allocated nahasda funds since inception of the program 2 when projects are assisted by multiple programs there are conflicting admission requirements 3 when tdhes contain number of tribes the member tribes do not always benefit equally from their nahasda grants 4 some tdhes struggle because of their unfamiliarity with nahasda requirements 5 some tdhes lack management systems to effectively administer nahasda 6 some tdhes have not developed or complied with all policies and procedures 7 some tdhes have not successfully carried out their affordable housing activities 8 there is inadequate accounting for program income and increases in uncollected rents and 9 tdhes need to submit timely audit reports and they need to use uniform accounting standards nahasda bars federal grants for housing unless the property in question is exempt from taxation this requirement effectively limits the options of small and urban tribes that do not have large amounts of undeveloped taxexempt trust lands such groups would like to see nahasda amended to relax the taxexempt requirements many tribes have expressed concern that hud has not adequately consulted tribes when making regulatory changes to nahasda hud appears to have taken the position that the nahasda requirement for negotiated rulemaking only applies to the initial promulgation of regulations while tribes believe that negotiated rulemaking process should also apply to subsequent additions or amendments to the regulations in the new hud consultation policy set in place last year provision was made to create negotiated rulemaking advisory committee made up of tribal members to advise hud on when negotiated rulemaking procedures ought to be used in addition hud is currently seeking to form negotiated rulemaking committee to address issues with the nahasda grant formula while tribes view these as steps in the right direction they do not view these steps as sufficient hud remains the ultimate decision maker and they contend that there is guarantee that hud would follow the recommendations of an advisory committee the crs6 preference of tribes is that the statutory language of nahasda be amended to clearly state that negotiated rulemaking should be used for all regulations and rulemaking made under nahasda several tribes argue that they would be able to provide more affordable housing to members if they were able to access taxexempt financing through title vi of nahasda to do so section 7871 of the internal revenue code would have to be amended to accommodate nahasda reauthorization of nahasda as noted above nahasda contains three authorizations 1 the authorization of appropriations for block grants for indian tribes to carry out affordable housing activities 2 the authorization of appropriations for the subsidy costs of loan guarantees and 3 the authorization of appropriations for providing training and technical assistance for indian housing authorities and tdhes these authorizations expired at the end of fy2001 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21241 under hr 1873 and s 1210 as introduced in the 107th congress nahasda would be amended to extend these authorization through fy2006 and other amendments are proposed in either bill title vii of hr 3995 would extend the authorizations through fy2007 and amend nahasda to permit recipients to use percentage of their grant amounts for comprehensive housing and community development planning activities the subcommittee on housing and community opportunity of the house committee on financial services has held hearings on hr 3995 but to date action has been taken on the other bills
