is promised and how the federal income tax applies fourteen of the 18 ssia proposals woul d use the new accounts to replace part in one case all of social security benefits carveout plans the other four proposals would use ssias as means for workers to supplement social security addon plans five of the 14 carveout plans would mandate participation the other nine propose voluntary carveouts two of the four addon plans would mandate participa tion however three of the ven mandatory plans would limit the mandate to workers under certain age proposed contributions to ssias range fro m 1 of wages subject to the social security payroll tax up to the full 124 employeeemployer payroll tax the carveout plans would divert some part in one case all of social security taxes for contribution to ssias however eight of the 18 proposals would draw on general federal revenue for some or all of the contributions ten of the 18 ssia proposals would limit i nvestment options for account assets to few funds approved expressly for that purpose by board of trustees the eight exceptions would allow individuals to invest their ssia assets with broader range of existing financial institutions five of the 14 carveout proposals would guarantee participants some minimum ssia benefit to protect against adverse i nvestment outcomes the guarantees being based in most cases on an individuals social security benefit entitlement of the nine carveout proposals offering guaran tee five do not ma ndate participation two addon proposals incl ude benefit floor treatment of ssias under the federal

roth iras in 1997 and increased contribution limits and more flexible portability rules in 2001 beginning with the 106th congress serious atten tion was given to making individual retirement saving an integral part of the mandatory social security system numerous social security reform proposals have been offered in light of actuarial projections that indicate the social security trust funds may exhaust their financial reserves during the first half of the 21st century concern about this possibility of system insolvency is amplified by the demographic context namely the approaching swell in the retirement age population as the large baby boom age cohorts begin to reach age 65 in 2011 some of these refo rm proposals would make social security individual accounts ssias an integral part of reformed soci security system other proposals would establish ssias for the purpose of supplementing the retirement benefits paid by social secu rity in 2001 the presidents commission to strengthen social security recommended that any reform of the system include individual accounts as an element the features of ssia proposals vary widely this report summarizes 18 proposals that would establish ssias nine of them were introduced as bills in the 106th congress and nine have been introduced in the 107th congress several bills in the latter group are revisions of bills introduced by the same
