raw meat troubleshooting cases lecture given on 28 june 1961 this is the 28th of june 1961 ad 11 and you are in the throes of having now established that you know everything there is to know im very glad of that and so on but i want you to think for moment i want you to think for moment of aloysius q schnook of lower ambovia and hes going to ask you hes going to say well now youve been to saint hill so you know all the answers now why is it that you stand the pc on their head before starting routine 5 i want you to be thinking of what you will tell him or what you will do with him because youll be embarrassed you will now be in the horrible situation of people knowing that you know the question is do you do you all right im looking at one person whos going back to part of the world as the first pioneer to practice scientology in that part of the world riverside and another one where scientology is going to be tried its been attempted angeles and another one where they had every opportunity but forgot to read the subsequent bulletins johannesburg there are quite few like this i wouldnt call you all by rote but one of these questions came through from as near away as london which is almost on our backs although sitting down here in the beautiful calm of sussex you would never really suspect london existed if you didnt have to go back there and it came burningly and screamingly through the wire bunch of questions about the cchs that apparently had nothing much to do with the cchs that i could figure out so my answer to it was as follows that i was writing whole bulletin rather than answer the telex now the reason i cant tell you what this said is i myself couldnt figure out what it said but fortunately we have someone amongst us who will be going back to london very soon in the organization will be able to answer all these questions sharply glibly and with enormous permeation isnt that right female voice yes now you may be in the throes of absorbing knowledge but lets not forget the fact that somebody is going to want to know about it from you and there you are on cloud nine being very proud of having actually gotten through and endured the saint hill briefing course and so forth lets make sure you dont get yanked off that pinnacle and look at them you know as they ask this question your jaw drops slightly and sort of blank look comes in your eyes and you say the cch 1 now lets see what is that or lets see uhuhthe needle i think the needle of the emeter yeah yeah the emeter has needle lets not do that lets not do that lets be able to speak up quickly loudly and authoritatively and above everything else correctly the time to find out about that sort of thing is here and now and if you dont ask questions about that sort of thing of course you wont find out and youll be in bad state now i didnt mean any slurs on riverside or johannesburg or something its because were friends of these areas that we want to help them out the number of questions ive been asked lately on these lectures are very few so maybe you have one now yes bob male voice ron if someone comes in who is raw meat from the street and you want to decide what routine to run on him how would you make that decision all right thats very good question raw meat walks in off the street what do you decidehow do you decide what routine to run on him all right there he is you have several criteria your first and foremost criteria is to give him battery of tests and if youre not able to give and correct tests you will find yourself denied this particular rule they can sometimes look very reasonable and yet their profiles come out all wrong now in view of the fact that the profile is much more reliablemuch much more reliablethan any other single means of determining whats to be run itll be very good thing if you knew how to administer one and grade one all right they come in make them do test im assuming now field auditor in operation well make them do test actually this is fairly professional thing to do all right they do this test now you take the test and you evaluate it in this fashion if it is riding all the way along the bottom or if several points of it are at the bottom of the graph it is inevitably cchs so therefore its routine 1 all right thats inevitably routine 1inevitably dont let anybody fool you that is the only thing thatll get this case on the road with great certainty now there are many things that might get the case on the road and we know lots of things that might do it and weve wasted more time being hopeful than any other thing because we bring hope to people we are apt to dramatize it ourselves little bit you see and were very hopeful that this or that will occur and the thing we know will make something occur is properly run routine 1 now what was missing and why the old cchs didnt move this one by the way this lowgraph casethe reason for thatwas that nobody was pulling the overts off and they could run in the overts faster than you could pull them off so cchs work on that very positively if properly run run 1 2 3 4just the way youre running them now all right if the case is riding very high on the graph extremely high on the graph and when you get them on an emeter particularly the needle appears to be little sticky thats routine 1 now as you look at graph with the graph facing you youll notice that over on the lefthand side of the graph you have your b c d columns those are the important columns that part of the graph which goes from the left to the middle that is to say reading horizontally b c dwhatever the letter that occurs in the middle of the graph that whole section is the vital part of the graph to pay attention to the rest of the graph mainly hinges on current havingness even though it might be pretty well pinned down and it might be kind of unchangeably so you by simply neglecting to find the pcs havingness process can actually depress that side of the graph without actually messing up the case at all so you might say that the left half of one of these profiles or graphs is the important diagnostic area and if columns b or c are either very low or very high you can then expect the pc to have great deal of difficulty following an auditing command so therefore routine 2 is really not possible they alteris the commands obsessively theres another way to get around that and that is to take the prehav scale you can get around all these things but you have to be clever and tricky and so forth you can take the prehav scale and assess the change scale the secondary change scale and keep running the pc out in that area and youll take off this obsessive alteris it could be done there are lots of things that could be done but your safest bet your easiest bet and your fastest bet is routine 1 now the person who is at the very very top of the lefthand side of the graph can be expected to come on at the very bottom of the graph that person is actually worse off more overwhelmed than the person who is low on the graph so dont be fooled dont be fooled that is not necessarily derogatory that means simply this there is connotation to this its simply this when you first find this persons terminal on sop goals you see assuming you ran sop goals on person you would find that the terminal assessed way way way up at the top63 62 level 63 62 64 see way up that means the terminal that has overwhelmed them is in terrific state of high serenity and that terminal deteriorates as the pc is audited and will deteriorate and you very often dont register that terminal anymore on your next profile but get the pc who is now coming on at the bottom and thats the pcs graph that comes on at the bottom now because youre not giving them one every few minutes or every few hours or even every few days you actually fail to note the gradient scale of progress of the pc as measured by the graph and that of course would be off the top and on the bottom and up but remember something else is going to happen here at the same time the left side of the graph is going to deteriorate as this valence is discharged and dismissed it actually is going to deteriorate and itll look offhand as though something bad is going on in auditing now the way we determine if something bad is going on in auditing is to look at the right side of the graph if the right side of the graph depresses that is from the middle letter on up to the end letter of the graphif the right side of the graph depresses you know that arc breaks are present the rudiments are out you see because the persons havingness is deteriorating so if that right side of the graph drops this is an index of deterioration of havingness and it only has one source in auditing and that is arc breaks with the auditor remember that now it only has one source in auditing arc breaks with the auditor thats terribly important you look over on that side you see that in one week the pc had it at about twenty plus on the right side of the graph and the next week we audit the pc and then we get another graph and it is now fifteen minus on the right side of the graph im talking about these column figures now up around h i that sort of thing see that area ahhh if we were to take the pc at that moment and put him on the emeter and say have you got an arc break with your auditor clang clang little flags wave and the needle plays yankee doodle yes hes got an arc break with the auditor if you wanted pc to wipe out all liabilities to havingness doing auditing you would clear up arc breaks with roughoff pc about every ten minutes thats how fast they occur usually the auditing itself wipes it out and you dont notice it but you should sometime just for the fun of it clean up an arc break with pc just insist he has one and find it every time you know what is it now what is your arc break its mirrored in the deterioration of havingness and so you get drop of that side of the graph all right now supposing the right side of the graph remains constant and you get change on the right side of the graph at all it is neither up and its not down hohooooo that pc was being audited with present time problem there was present time problem another rudiment was out all the time he was being audited only that will also reflect on the left side of the graph over in the lower letters b c d and so forth present time problem will blow straight across the graph in other words youre getting progress at all now that the left side of the graph deteriorates is meaningless see thats meaningless but that the right side of the graph deteriorates thats very meaningful that the left side of the graph remains unchanged is very meaningfulpresent time problem that the right side of the graph remains unchangedpresent time problem got it that the left side of the graph deteriorates under auditing simply means the decline of valence it does not mean criticism of the auditor im talking about left and right sides now as you have the graph in your lap looking at it now these are the determinations as far as graph is concerned and that is the best way to measure up what is going on with this case but lets suppose this case was running at about minus seventy on the left side of the graph now lets get to routine 2 it was running about minus seventy or bit above and was middle grounded or high or low on the righthand sidewe dont care what now lets supposing it was somewhere between minus seventy and the center line the zero line of the graph through the lefthand side of the graph you can run routine 2 on this pc usually with the greatest of ease this is what youve known as mean graph its not an average graph its just graph that person isnt in too bad shape i mean theyre just sort of loused up but they kind of know it you got the idea you can run routine 2 on this pc by the way you can also run routine 2 on low graph very very low graph routine 2 does not work hardly at all on theetieweetie high graph it doesnt work at all on it you can just beat your brains out sop goals works on it but with what complications do you have to execute sop goals when youre running it below the case level itll run all the way to the bottom any case could be run on sop goals but now we get tricky now we get complicated assessments now weve got complicated situations now weve got large numbers of goals not necessarily that large numbers of goals means the case is rough but weits one of the things that happens as liability when we try to run sop goals on it now routine 2 in other words would be the most effective process to run on somebody who was minus seventy up points lower than minus seventy and maybe some points up to plus twenty on the left side of the graph in routine 2 this case would take off like startled gazelle as you see diagnostically if you want to use that word you are paying attention at all over here to the right side of the graph all right now supposing the person was riding up at the center line or above that is on the left side of the graph the fastest thing to do would be sop goals now were not talking about what we can do to this raw meat off the street we can do any of these things we can do any of these things were not talking about what we can do were talking exclusively about what is the most effective thing to do this is the fastest thing to do got it and that actually answers in full the question which you just gave what are you going to do how do you measure up and what to run on this person diagnosis on an emeter ishas the liability of the cans being improperly squeezed so your sensitivity is improperly set furthermore it requires lot of judgment and adjudication this judgment and adjudication is all done by the graph why worry about it there are other symptoms however which are quite interesting and one is that you can have somebody at misread on the tone arm dial or at exactly clear read on the tone arm dial but with sticky or misbehaving needlea very jerky or hectic needle or very still needle or something like this youre looking at somebody there who doesnt register hardly at all and youre actually not going to get anyplace really running thought process on this case you can do it its going to take you long time itll be successful at the bitter end running routine 2 or routine 3 but my advice is dont do it now as far as the routines are concerned you can run routine 1which is remarkable about the routinesyou can run them 1 2 or 3 on any case that is still breathing if you can get into communication verbal communication of any kind whatsoever you can run routine 2 or 3 of course if the case is unconscious completely youve only got the cchs but that isthats going little bit below our level of adjudication so you could run 1 2 or 3 on practically any pc that walked in the door if he could walk in the door he could be made to have gain on routine 1 routine 2 and routine 3 and the sole criteria that youre reaching for is which one the fastest thats what youre reaching for now were out then of total lose proposition providing these things are run right and that is the other thing that enters into the thing and that is to say if you have couple of auditors and one of them just cant run cchsyou know the fellow just cant put an intention into things or something like this they had hard time with the cchs you see dont get much of gain theres this vagary amongst auditors they practically dont do them when they dont run but there is this that some auditors do it better than others supposing you had two pcs and two auditors and one of these auditors ran very fine cchs and the other one could use an emeter then youd better set up both pcs to be cchd by the same auditor and swap the periods of the day or swap the consecutive periods around in such way that both auditors would keep working but one would be doing security checks and the other one would be doing the cchs dont you see something on that order or supposing you were running bunch of routine 2 and one of your people there wasnt too hot at running routine 2 well lets run routine 2the same auditor runs both pcs on routine 2 see and the other auditor runs them both on security checks you can split it up like this in other words you could take an hgc you could take somebody who just comes in off the academy and you could set him up doing the bit and piece work got the idea and this brings up what is it safe to do you said how do you determine what to do well if you wanted to carry the question out to its reductio ad absurdum youd have to include what can you do you know and that is part of being effective so supposing we had this other kind of condition whereby some of our auditors werent very well trained we were running an hgc you see and some of them werent very well trained and we were conscience stricken about you know putting them on the public and that sort of thing well there are several things that its very safe to do oddly enough one of them is sop goals assessment providing its done even moderately correctly not running it that isnt safe not letting him say that is the final goal that isnt safe but just digging up the goal and then digging up the terminal under some sort of supervisionyeah thats safe action and very therapeutic and very good all right thats safe security checking is safe you can let anybody security check you can show them what the meter looks like and so forth even though theyre kind of goofy and theythey dont quiteand they let the rudiments get out and lot of thingsweird things happen nothing is going to happen but benefit on security checking got the idea so there are two actions that can be undertaken independent of all of the other actions so you could set up people to have these things done you see by auditors that werent particularly well skilled and have them sort of get familiar with it all and that sort of thing doing these two actions so therefore what could you do has to do with who are you going to do it with and there are certain elements in routine 1 2 and 3 which are safe to do by almost anybody thats pretty good one of them is security checking and the other is actually assessing for goals and terminal not running them thats different all right now there are several things that are unsafe to do and that is let somebody who just knows from nowhere attempt the cchssomebody thats liable actually to blow up in the session or leave the pc high and dry or skit out from under or something like this thats dangerous thats dangerous so youd pick auditors that youwere reliable to do that with routine 2 requires fairly accurate assessment fairly accurate but its only the accuracy of what of significance and therefore person could be poorly run on routine 2 without too much happening providing the processes got flat that is dangerous to leave the processes of routine 2general runs prehav scaleunflat if you leave one unflat and go on to the next one and then leave that unflat and go on to the next one and leave that unflat and go on to the next oneby that time if your pc doesnt feel like he or she is spinning why ill eat the emeter the pc will feel spinny now this condition actually can turn about in sop goals the same way you leave level unflat and then you go to the next level and if that level were very unflat and the person is very queasy about it you see at the time its left and then the next level the person starts in on this level they will feel like theyre spinning they just feel spinny thats all theyve got two levels going at once here and theyre counterpoised and theyre all messed up with each other and so forth so general prehav runs and sop goals terminals runs are limited by this factor that pc can be loused up now sop goals has further limitation you can choose the wrong terminal you can choose the wrong goal and then choose the wrong terminal you can make the pc run the goal or terminal which ought to be run on the auditor or something stupid like this can occur really ive seen it occur so choosing or deciding whether or not that is the right goal and deciding whether or not that is the right terminal for the goal is job for an expert that is really an expert job you get that thing wrong and all hell is going to break loose theres test on whether or not youve got the right terminal on the second assessment when you go over the prehav scale have you got about dozen levels live if there are dozen levels falling on that scale the probability is you havent got the right terminal because the more you run the wrong terminal the more you are avoiding the case and the more the actual terminal starts kicking levels live and every level that you run or touch kicks over into the main level which is then without relief and the correct terminal is getting stronger and stronger and tougher and tougher and meaner and meaner and the pc cant tell which way hes going so that it is very very dangerousi couldnt impress this upon you enoughto choose the wrong goal and the wrong terminal and then run it choose itnobodys going to be harmed but after chosen run itoh wow if its the wrong one the pc has had it there is only one right one so of course where does this put the actual running of sop goals when you say raw meat off the street all right assess him you could assess him almost anybody could assess him showing him the ropes but running him ahhh were not so sure now the other thing is how well can an auditor keep in rudiment how well can they keep in rudiments and you can get around this by getting the rudiments crosschecked by supervision and one auditing team checking the rudiments of another auditing team and sosuch mechanisms as thisand you also keep the case running now all of these things apply to what do you run on pc well what do you run on raw meat it applies to whether its raw meat it applies to anything else there is this addition we have run into this trouble fellow comes in and he says well ive heard of this scientology and i would like to get some auditing and you start running cchs on him you dont ask him anything ah hes never heard of this he doesnt know what youre doing he doesnt know why he hasnt got clue hes wrapped up and going nowhere you got the idea all right he will go nowhere faster and faster and faster and the present time problem in this case is what the hell are you doing so he gets change so therefore it requires this factor to give some attention to you have to sort of run tiny little bit of sop goals assessment on this person when he walks in off the street and this sop goals assessment simply consists of this what difficulties are you trying to overcome its the answer to the question what would have to happen for you to know that scientology works and hell say well its my memory its my memory thats what it is i realize my memory is going and it worries and so forth well franklythis is an exact casewe had pc in johannesburg walked in and he was immediately run on technique zed q and alpha you see and he was going nowhere in hurry and mary sue called this to my attention and i said well for heavens sakes i said whats his goal well he just wants to improve his memory thats what he wants to improve thats all he wants to do improve his memory i said well all right run something you wouldnt mind forgetting on him for twentyfive hours they did his memory improved he was tremendously satisfied he was very happy about the whole thing we used slow process dont you see now hed attained that goal so now he had reality on what was going forward and the next time we had anything to do with him we couldve put him at once on routine 2 or even the cchs you got the idea but to take case who knows nothing about it whatsoever and just run routine 1 routine 2 or routine 3 with further introduction explanation and without any reality on what is going on is very very hard on the case now the one process that gets around this is an assessment for sop goals which is very therapeutic that would be very good thing to do with this case see you dont have to think up the extraordinary solution like i had to you see just assess him for goals just like youre doing you see you just go on oh youd be surprised i mean the littlest child or the oldest man or the dumbest medico one of whom was just trying to kid about scientology he said his leg got well because i had sent him cable after he had gotten it broken you see and i kept telling him to be careful with it i got even with him kept telling him to be careful with his leg there and so forth he was outside parading around and giving the all and so on and sure enough when he came back he was limping i did get him didnt i i told him i wasnt really worried about his leg i was worried about the psychic trauma driving him around the bend mary sue came up at that moment or somebody did and he said yes hed been worried about it for some timegoing around the bend and he was off the subject and so forth but goals goalstheyll all respond to goals now you could do something like this with him you could get somebody running sop goals on him you know and then at the same time run him on cch you see mix the routines hed wonder what you were doing but it was all right he was perfectly satisfied with auditing so hed go along with this and all of sudden hed go whir clank and suddenly realize these cchs were doing something and he wouldnt quite decide what and then youd say well if youre feeling bad because of that its because you havent had your processing check and youd give him security check and hed realize that was confessing which he realizes he should have done back there in 1492 instead of burning the church down and hell go along with this in other words you could use sop goals assessment not run but assessment as break in on this particular case who was ignorant and from nowhere okay i have spoken on the answer to that question male voice thank you youre welcome all right yes male voice on troubleshooting cases what factors do you look at before other factors oh all right troubleshooting cases what factors do you look at before other factors of course ken would be very interested in this because he probably haslets see how many people are there in angeles now anyway theres that many impossible or stalled cases out in that particular area and you dont ever audit in the angeles area you trouble shoot basically somebody comes in and hes kind of going bleahpglup bleah bup bleahblup and you say whats the matter whats the matter well ive been bloop audited lately and bloo boop and so forth and youve been audited lately youve been audited well whatwho audited you lately and they say oh ah somebody or other and you say oh yeah audited well now what did they run well we were doing music processing and you say what is music processing and they say well music processing is you take several narcotic pills you see and you put bach running at high volume in the bedroom you see and when you wake up youre bachy and something like this youd be amazed so that question is well asked it isnt that i have low opinion of the auditors in california its just that i feel for them and they qanda with the public that demands unusual answers and its very difficult to operate either in an hgc where everybody is demanding unusual answers or in an hco office where everybody wants something new and unusual or in angeles where nothing else is salable and youre liable to qanda with it i catch myself doing it once in blue moon catch mary sue doing it once twice but less often than others somebody sails in and they say you know that process you gave to run on the pc well that didnt work so this is your first point of troubleshooting this is the first and most interesting point of trouble shooting i see you already know it and that is the process that you gave to run on that pc didnt work and then you say not gee it didnt well ill have to think of something else thats the wrong answer the right answer is what process did i give you and you usually find they dont know that is unfortunately the usual response and then the first thing you do in troubleshootingwell what i told you to run the first time you go and run thats your first point in troubleshooting find out if what was supposed to have been run was run thats number one and it stands up something like san gorgonio above the desert compared to all other points in troubleshooting see theres this tremendous point what was done now the way you establish what was done is this way you put the pc on an emeter and you say what was run on you maybe he doesnt remember he will if you joggle him after few times and youre liable to find something fantastic has been going on thats the first and foremost source of difficulty in scientology it is way up there its interesting that it is much greater than you would ordinarily suspect until you start looking for it and when you start looking for it your eyes will pop man what is done in the name of technique zed believe is fantastic so troubleshooting find out what was really run what was really run get the pc on an emeter and discover it and dont let him sit there and malign the auditor either just find the facts man thats all youre interested inlike sergeant friday of the angeles police force i understand he was relegated to the suburbs recently yeah he actually solved crime they couldnt have that thats the first thing you find out thats piece of police work what was done what was really done because its based on this fact the auditing flubs today are of magnitude before they begin to upset case they are of magnitude its something on the order of the auditor never reported for the sessions you get the idea its something of this weird nature and theyre so offbeat and varied but of such magnitude that you very often wont look for them you right away have made the assumption that the auditor sat in the auditing chair that the pc sat in the pcs chair and that something was run on the pc youve made this assumption youve made the assumption you see that model session was utilized or that the cchs were properly run or that they were run at all or that something was going on here you see youve assumed all these things and you actually dont have the right to assume any one of those things when youre troubleshooting on case that is bogged from some kind of d of p or d of t level you have right to assume those things so that your line of questioning sounds rather idiotic to somebody who isnt in the know its well did you have session get the idea was the auditor there were you there and they sometimes think you are being very sarcastic or sometimes very good for laugh but it prepares them to answer some more searching questions so that your troubleshooting is not relegated only to finding out what bug has this pc got that these processes arent affecting that is the standard bug we had assumed existed the actual bug that exists is what has been administered to this pc that i dont know about what has happened with this pc i havent clue on see thats your first and foremost action now you all have to do troubleshooting you think im talking from an executive standpoint you all have to do troubleshooting what do i mean by that you get pcs who have been audited before and if you dont troubleshoot this pc youre going to be in trouble you should have been troubleshooting soand you didnt so now all of sudden youre in trouble and youre going to assume that everything that has been run on this pc is flat ill give you an example theres very noteworthy character in scientology down in australia who had this interesting thing wrong with her case and she was in very important position and her case was making gains whatsoever and i wasnt troubleshooting it i was actually running an extraordinary solution i was running new process on her of one character or another and in running it i all of sudden elicited this interesting interesting interesting response well when i was down in new zealand few years ago they ran cch 3 on and i got tremendous gains and ive never had any gain since you know its almost case of my sighing deeply and saying why the hell didnt you tell anybody this auditors have been beating their brains out over your case i could have said to her and you had process on which you were making gains and youve never made any gain since youve just complained about it and you never told soul this was obvious you see that the troubleshooting then consisted of finding out what was run long time ago what is the history of the auditing and this is all part of it now you get that as an executive or technical expert in an organization you see you get that consistently but working in the field you almost never ask this question whats been run on you what is the history of your auditing and then you take up an hour or twotake up more than that with this pcand youre going to find some interesting things well we got pc right here in class right this minute namely you and what happened the pc had profile of some type or another and then was audited and then had another profile which was entirely different but the second profile hadnt changed got the idea here was period of auditing on which profile deteriorated we just assumedwhether right or wrong didnt even ask the pc we just looked at the profiles and found out what had been run knew something about the auditor and already and simply ran the auditor off the case its interesting that it took so many hours to run the auditor off the case fascinating that it took this many hours to run the auditor off the case that should be blink for you at once we didnt even ask what was being run by this auditor we simply knew here was profile that sat one way the pc got audited here is this new profile wow see and the profile has deteriorated in the wrong places all right well audit the auditor off the case all of sudden the pcs profilei dont know whether this pc took profile immediately after that or not did you male voice yes all right what did it look like female voice we havent graded it yet you havent graded it yet well when we see that im sure you will see that the profile snapped back to what it was before the auditor audited the case you got the idea the person must have been audited with arc breaks in full bloom or audited with ptps in full bloom you see audited with the rudiments way out with very powerful processes and something went wrong here we dont ask what went wrong we just see that this was the case so therefore we audit off one auditor the first time this was ever done was in an academy student suddenly came down with measles only the doctor couldnt find anything wrong with the student and i got very clever about this time and asked the burning question what had this student been doing just before these measles broke out and i found out that the quote auditor in that particular case had blown the session blown the session the auditor had blown the session get somebody halfway through measles engram and then blow the session pretty good huh so i just got somebody to run ow on that auditor or the equivalent at that time and it didnt take half an hour and there werethe measles were gone got the idea we took the auditing off the case so you can always do that you can always remove the auditing oddly enough if the case made any gains during that auditing the gains are preserved if the case had any loses during the auditing the loses are vanished thats fantastic thing so in troubleshooting you can always do that and thats one of the primary things to look for and every one of you i repeat should be troubleshooting you should be looking over the auditing this case has had now failure to look over this auditing will sometimes leave undisclosed oh five years in psychoanalysisonly i can spot those from way off all i have to do is get the responses of the pc to the auditor well the pc says well i think umi think actually my mother had lot to do with this its very fixated on mother ive been very fixated for some time probably had complex probably had complex and uh i felt inferior you see and i keep saving these fetishes and uh along about that time if i hear anything like this i get very brilliant and assume the person has been psychoanalyzed and i say to the person have you ever been psychoanalyzed oh yes well have you ever told anybody around here oh well why should i do that nothing except the person has been ground down to nub and actually now is in the frame of mind of believing that therapy cant do much for them because theyve had one whopping big failed help well there sits the case now you could probably overcome this with the cchs you can run out psychiatric treatment with the cchs so obviously you could run out psychoanalysis and things like this with the cchs you see thats easy but nevertheless its something you sure ought to know you got the idea so find out first and foremost what has been going on what is the auditing history of this case or the treatment history of this case and thats the big one after that they all dwindle off onto more interesting lesser statured things all of which by the way are very important but they have great stature compared to that one all right lets take up the next lower echelon of things okay the next lower echelon is simply this rudiments rudiments rudiments when in doubt check the rudiments when troubleshooting case check the rudiments look for the rudiments after youve found out whats been run whats being run whats the general history of the case rudiments rudiments rudiments all the rudiments not just the beginning rudiments but the end rudiments even though theyre both the same check rudiments now because you get mutual withhold and mutual arc break with the world and so forth in long duration auditing teams the phenomenon occurs that when an outsider checks the rudiments on an auditing team invariably finds them out and this makes the auditor look very silly but actually they werent falling for him he could have made them fall for him we know that now by asking the question what are we withholding you see something on the order of how do we feel about the auditing room you know that kind of rudiment well we feel about the auditing room sort of badly because you dont like to audit in here got the idea so therefore the room is really out the rooms all right with well i know its not all right with you so therefore the rudiment is out isnt it now an outsider comes in and he picks up the emeter on this particular thing and he said now all right is your auditing room all right clang you know the wrong thing to do is to turn around to the auditorwe know now you knowand look at him sneeringly you know and say you knucklehead why didnt you find this you know it wasnt there thats why he didnt find it because something is wrong with the auditing room for him hes complained couple of times about it being drafty or something of the sort you see and thats enough to put the auditing room out with the pc you know pcs sometimes wind up protecting their auditors and all kinds of wild things occur actually auditors doing very badly but just make something that is even vaguely slurring about the auditor you run into this both ways you sometimes get obsessive agreement you know on the part of the pc but as commonly you get the pc right in there fighting with brass knuckles to protect the auditor you know hes doing all right hes doing his best or shes just doing fine or i really never had better auditor i never made any gains until this auditor came along and all you inferred was that the auditor would do better after they were trained bit or something like this you see and blaaaaaah youve stuck your foot in it so you have to handle this kind of diplomatically but anyway check rudiments check them from the beginning to the end and back again and around and round and round and keep them checked because do you realize that the rudiments out in one session is one wasted session if the rudiments are out for one session that session is wasted the optimum checking of the rudiments then is every session now next to the fact that does anything get run properly the next question of are the rudiments in is your main grind isare they in and youll very often find the rudiments out now auditing can occur with the rudiments out furthermore you dont have to keep the rudiments in so strongly that youve got the sensitivity over at 16 checking for the pcs withholds that isnt enough to throw session out youre now running process known as the joburg got the idea youre running tr 10 because you turn the sensitivity knob over to 16 and say how do you feel about auditing in the room you get flinch the thing goes bang ohh you say the tr 10 is out well oooh well all right well well just have to run that and we run it you see and then we say well do you have an arc break plang well who do you have an arc break with well ii didnt know i had an arc lets see i think with my dog yeah my dog yes i had an arc break with my dog he woke up about five oclock this morning and wanted to go out andyeah yeah yeah yeah i had an arc break with my dog well all right good now do you have an arc break clank well who do you have an arc break with well i have an arc breai dont know did it say something they try to look at the meter yeah it said something all right now whod you have this other arc break with oh lets see oh i know who thatd be yeah yeah over at lunch i almost got shortchanged in the restaurant yeah yeah as matter of fact i did oh well what do you know man yeah all right you say good well you got any other arc breaks clank who is that with wrong way to ask the question see who is that with oh i dont know did it fall you got the idea wrong way to run rudiments because things that are falling with sensitivity 16 on the average pcwell of course you can always get fall at sensitivity 16 on any one of these questions youre running the whole case by rudiments how much does rudiment have to be out in order to interrupt the case it is enough to show on the needle at thirdofadial drop and thats something you better put down because youll have to tell everybody under the sun moon and stars this when you start saying keep the rudiments in and immediately theyll get very conscientious and theyll turn that sensitivity knob over to 16 and after that you get nothing audited but rudiments look if rudiments could have made somebody well why we would run nothing else but because theyve existed since 1956 but there have been lot of failed cases since 56 test enough all right how much does the rudiment have to be in its enough to show change of characteristic reaction on the needle with the sensitivity knob set for thirdofadial drop on the can squeeze and that is the exact technical response you cant see rudiment at third ofadial drop ignore it you got it of course you can always then play good trick as an executive as d of p or something and then turn your sensitivity up to 16 after youthe auditor has been running at thirdofadial drop why you turn your sensitivity up to 16 when you check his pc you know and youll find all the rudiments out of course now how thoroughly does it have to be in well ive answered that question it has to be in to that degree because if rudiment will react at thirdofadial drop it is enough to interrupt the session all the rudiments are for is getting the pc into session and any rudiment that is going to louse up the pc is going to be flagrantly out flagrantly out youre going to see that reaction and dont let catch you with the sensitivity knob sitting for thirdofadial dropdont let catch you finding pt problem falling couple of divisions or four or five divisions on that thing and passing it by because the pc says its merely mention of the idea of present time problems thats got him and thats falling on this or that and he explains it all away dont do it because youre going to have pc exploding going into apathy or going out of session within an hour to an hour and half youve just predicted it right there not only is he going to get gain but hes going to blow up one way or the other on pt problem dont pass them by you understand but you turn the sensitivity up to 16 and you ask the pc do you have present time problem you will almost always get needle reaction almost always since high sensitivity knob readings are used for the joburg and there you pick the bones clean you got the idea or where youre looking for something or trying to trace something down or date something if youre trying to find something you can always put the sensitivity knob up high but the liability is that when you do it on the rudiments you have immediately set up the rudiments to be the session and that isnt what youre supposed to be doing if they dont fall at all at thirdofa dial drop theyre in and thats all you can say about it now the next thing that will happen in troubleshooting case is that somebody will have been run on level that isnt flat or run on the cchs and that one wasnt flat before they went on to the next one and you have to check this flatness that is the next most important thing are these things flat you go back and go over whats been run and find out if theyre flat look over the auditors reports say these things to the pc on the emeter and see if you get needle reaction on them find out if these things were flat because the next most fruitful source of case stall is failure to flatten the process and immediately following that is thein orderthe next most fruitful case and almost as frequent is this horrible one its been flat for days and its still being run its just been flat for days thats all its been flat for session or two or something like that youll find these real goofs you know now the only disastrous thing that can happen under that circumstance is that the needle will stick so that you cant reassess and the remedy for that particular thing is one of several but amongst them is not running the incident that the overrun has stuck them in thats not remedy the most fruitful remedy is is run the auditor off and youll all of sudden find itll come back to battery and you can assess it again where pc consistently has the rudiments out now lets get down to trickiness now were down to being tricky auditors and so forth and were not really fooling with the case you know and were not looking for these gross errors were just trying to set up case better the pc is running all right but they just always have an enormous number of present time problems and arc breaks and it just seems to be continuous and we take twothirds of the session to clean up the rudiments and then we take one sixth of the session to run the process and then the remainder of the session is spent on running the end rudiments first check to find out if the rudiments are being established properlythirdofadialdrop testor are we trying to run all of the reaction of needle out of all of the rudiments forever and if that is not the case the next thing you do immediately after thatclang bang sockis you assume this person is running continuous overts against the present time environment and everybody in it the person is going pocketapocketapocketapocketa you know unkindthought overts unkind thought unkind thought unkind thought unkind thought unkind thought they look at you unkind thought unkind thought unkind thought they lookif theres another person around unkind thought unkind thought unkind thought you got the idea pocketapocketapocketapocketa automaticity unkind thought which leads to arc breaks present time problems they have hell of time in life and underlying these various things is pocketapocketapocketa automaticity unkind thought you got the idea and youre trying to run somebody thats stacking his case up with overts faster than you can unstack it with processing and this is very common common common source of difficulty and weve got an answer to that in prehav 13 you just take everybody the pc knows do an assessment and so forth and ive given you the details on how you do this prehav 13 before but you run prehav 13 on the case just skip whatever youre doing on the case and just flatten prehav 13 just devote four or five sessions to getting prehav 13 out of the road and all of sudden this person feels wonderful and actually if you do it right theyll make all their goals for auditing right there apparently of course they arent any where but its very temporary situation because that valencewhich has already got to be licked you seein few months at the absolute outside will be going again pocketapocketapocketa pocketa so you actually just clean them up so they can be audited thats the value of prehav 13 all right now youre not running into this one as often now because in the routines it is provided for cross and center but it used to be that majormuch earlier in value than this list ive been giving yousource of auditorpc difficulty and troubleshooting and so forth was the withhold the case had the withhold and therefore was not in twoway communication with the auditor but youre using joburgs and thats taking care of this in the auditing so it is less in this if you suspect this now you order joburg you say well thats all right lay aside what youre doing and go on joburg you get reaction on withhold dont try to dig it up particularly just order joburg okay all right and if you do those things with these various routines youll find more cases straighten out than all of the tricky solutions you ever could dream of because in opposition to all of these practical solutions of how to troubleshoot case is the continual insistence by the pc by the public even by auditors under your supervision that you think of something new strange and wonderful that solves this case because it is so different and youre liable to succumb to it once in blue moon you have to succumb to it but thats when all else fails man thats really when all else fails and then youll find out it comes under the first category theres something weird wild and wonderful going on that nobody has communicated to you whatsoever such as the fact that the girls living with three men simultaneously and none of the three men know about it or the fact the pc selfaudits all night or something else is going on here you see which you just didnt happen to find out about but that comes under the first heading now the troubleshooting of the case is very important because by doing that you actually also keep scientology on the track and if they think theres somebody going to be around in the establishment or in the town or something like that that can troubleshoot case and will remorselessly do so everybody starts to be better they all of sudden think well you know month or so this person might wander over and ken might look at her and then all of my sins will out as matter of fact its very good thing to foster that particular piece of propaganda well go ahead and waste the next two hundred hours of auditing if you want to sooner or later why ill have this case sitting here on an meter and ill find out what the devil youve been doing in those two hundred hours of auditing you know i can hear now the certain names that i could mention out in angeles all go ulpurp you realize that by the code of scientologist if you werent administering scientology to the pc he doesnt have to pay you my god what horribly fiendish thing well i wont put ideas in your mind there are ways of getting it done right the job of the d of p is troubleshooting the job of the d of t is quite different d of ts often turn their academies into clinics and they start making sure that all the cases of the students get progress and thats not what theyre supposed to be doing and fellows come out of there out of academies in pretty good shape casewise but you say cch to them and they say cchnow he didwe did hear something about cch lets see what was that oh yes yes yes thats one of the levels of the prehav scale but their cases are in good shape you get the idea so in troubleshooting in an academy you dont you just dont thats it some instructor comes to you or somebody whos teaching scientology or something like this you know and hes teaching courses of some kind or another and he comes up to you and he says having the awfulest trouble with this case you see oh you are isnt that interesting do you have trouble with bulletins too i imagine you have lots of trouble with bulletins and the fellow says what do you mean well havent you read anything about what youre supposed to be doing in the academy youre supposed to be training people in the academy if you think theres something wrong with this fellows case sign him up for some processing over in the hgc and thisll be new wild strange one i have seen an academy with full clinic full clinical setup from one end to the other nobody learning thing and the instructors just frantic about everybodys cases these cases well now look how shortsighted this is they may be frantic about those cases that are in the academy but let point out to you that they are neglecting all of the cases these auditors will audit and the only thing you can really do wrong with scientologyyou can use it backwards and upside down and run it wrong and everything else and you actually wont commit much of crime but improper or incorrect or failure to disseminate scientology adds up to one awful overt ask yourself for moment why well if scientology is abroad in workable state even though this fellow kicks the bucket hell be picked out of it someday but if it isnt properly disseminated hell never be fished out you got the idea he could be improperly audited and fished out in this lifetime or his next five you see but to be improperly instructed or dissemination to be improperly donethats an overt it obviously is because youve barriered the track against his being fished out you see youve said the very best thing that you could possibly run is musical processing and musical processing thats the thing and the way you do musical processing is you take this book on subaoobaooba and you stand in the middle of the floor and you go round and round and round and round and round you see then you stand very still you see and then the gods communicate with you when you fall down in dead faint why then youre clear all right so this character gets loused up by processing and next life next life next life he has run on him you take this book on suba oobaooba and you stand in the middle of the room and you go around in circles and then when you fall down youre clear its road out and thats happened to buddhism lamaism the original taoism happened to any development theyve had here on earth started out freeby bad disseminationbooby trap see i imagine christianity was all right sometime or another i imagine it didnt have some of the intentions which it eventually expressed such as inquisition and burning people in east grinstead and few other things oh you didnt know there were people burned in east grinstead theyre lying right up here in the courtyard you want to drop into the church cemetery there someday youll see them theyre buried right up on the high street i mean they were burned on the high street and buried eventually in consecrated ground it was interesting but whats most interesting about it is that it didnt sour people on it it only soured people on branch of it okay enough of this propaganda okay well ive kept you overtime again thank you very much audience thank you
