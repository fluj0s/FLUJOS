thunder from the tory party conference ref london 2496 1 summary and comment c the conservative partys fall conference which closed the uk political party conference season on october 1 ended with whimper rather than the expected bang turmoil in the worlds financial markets overshadowed tory leader david camerons attempts to portray his party as the government in waiting following the initial vote in the house of representatives against the bush administrations financial recovery plan on september 27 conservative party leader david cameron adroitly moderated his tone and the conferences agenda in an attempt to avoid charges of partisanship cameron departed from the conference organizers planned program to deliver an emergency statement on september 30 in which he promised to cooperate fully with the governments attempts to shore up the uks financial markets offering his partys full support to help the brown government address the crisis in deliberate contrast to what the uk media described as political partisanship in the us in the event the tory party high commands initial fears at the start of conference that with double digit opinion poll lead over tired looking labour government the conservatives might end up looking hubristic and overconfident proved unfounded as cameron battled to keep his conference in the headlines and his party looking relevant as the eyes of the public and media turned to pm brown at time of financial turmoil 2 c comment cont conservatives were pleased that their unified front contrasted starkly with labours conference the preceding week which had been punctuated by infighting and an obsession with the faltering leadership of gordon brown but cameron had to leave birmingham troubled that pm browns jibe at the labour party conference now is time for novice has gained traction with the voters and given labour bump in the polls cameron attempted to rebut the charge in his keynote address ref but it is clear the inexperience charge is winner for labour and that voters though tired of labour are not yet sold on cameron although both parties got what they needed from their annual conventions gordon brown will be the more relieved of the two men that media coverage of the financial crisis has taken the spotlight off his continuing leadership difficulties and off the conservative partys attempts to position themselves as the next government end summary and comment conservatives worry about over confidenceat first 3 c the conservatives gathered for their annual fall conference in birmingham with high hopes under the banner slogan plan for change this was to be the partys chance to lay out its plans to govern providing the uk media and public with the meat of its policies and an opportunity to present itself as credible alternative to labour polls before the conference found that although voters were definitely tired of labour and wanted change there were still lingering doubts about tory policies and ability to govern conservative politicians were under strict instructions from the tory high command not to turn off voters by appearing too cocky or overconfident but with sustained double digit opinion poll lead over labour that was always going to be difficult camerons fears of appearing to take victory for granted soon disappeared however as financial markets continued to implode the uk media turned its attention back to prime minister brown as the only man in position to actually influence events and the conference slogan was quickly dubbed change of plan by wags in the media as cameron was forced into radical and nimble rewrite in order to keep the press interested in events at birmingham 4 c it all had started off so differently on the first day of the conference speeches to conference delegates as well as succession of meetings with mps revealed that although conservative troops might be sticking to their strict instructions not to appear too cocky in front of watchful press this would not stop them from sticking the boot to the government shadow chancellor george osbornes tax proposals were the main topic of conversation on the first day he hoped to repeat his success of the previous year when his unexpected and highly popular announcement that inheritance taxes would be radically increased had shaken the labour government so much that gordon brown canceled his plans to call an early election this time round osborne pleased the party faithful with his announcement that any future conservative government would freeze council tax levels local taxation for its first two years both the london 00002556 002 of 003 partys vicechairman oliver letwin mp and the editor of the popular website conservative home tim montgomerie told us that osbornes tax announcement was very popular with party members and would be good plank for the next campaign 5 c by the second day of the conference the mood had changed dramatically following events in washington david cameron clearly needed to change the narrative to keep the media focus on his conference and to nimbly avoid charges of partisanship in one swipe osbornes tax announcement was wiped off the front pages although on closer inspection of the small print much of the media dismissed osbornes plans as unworkable anyway and even at the conference itself the main topic of conversation became events in the us julie kirkbride conservative mp and spouse of former shadow northern ireland secretary andrew mackay summed up the conferences real focus by the second day when she told poloffs were all looking at what youll do changing the narrative and the narrator 6 c in an adroit reaction to world events cameron succeeded in keeping the spotlight trained on his conference by giving an unplanned emergency statement on the economy on september 30 in which he pledged full support to the government in stark contrast he added to the partisanship of politicians in dc later in private meeting cameron insider told poloffs that the decision had been taken that it should be cameron who delivered the speech rather than shadow chancellor george osborne as private party polling indicated that the public feel osborne lacks the necessary gravitas somewhat unfairly party officials thought polling indicated that osborne was seen as lightweight and inexperienced in part due to his highpitched vocal delivery this party insider also revealed that browns charge that cameron was novice at time of crisis had gained significant traction with voters internal tory spot polling had found worryingly for the conservatives that contrary to the general consensus if an election were held the next day gordon brown would be reelected albeit with vastly reduced labour majority tories still oppose 42 day detention bill 7 c outside the conference hall shadow home secretary dominic grieve was outspoken in his criticisms of the government and scornful of government plans to continue to push through legislation increasing the time suspects can be held without charge to 42 days the legislation has already passed through the commons after very close vote and will be voted upon in the lords this month where it is certain to be amended requiring another vote in the commons grieve expressed doubt that the legislation would pass second time in the commons tories on foreign policy 8 c in further meetings on the margins of the conference hall david lidington shadow foreign affairs minister for the middle east briefed poloffs on his recent visit to iran which he summed up as great people terrible government keith simpson another member of hagues foreign affairs team who referred to his shadow portfolio as covering the rest of the world and strong supporter of the atlantic relationship said that camerons reaction to world events and his attempts to moderate the partisan tone of conference were spot on as did shailesh vara the conservative partys deputy leader vara was equally frank about the party hierarchys instructions not to appear cocky and the ban on champagne at receptions in order to avoid charges of hubris instructions which had proved unnecessary as the financial news darkened throughout the week camerons closing speech 9 c the conference wound up with keynote speech by cameron that in subsequent press reporting was viewed as welljudged and providing sufficient if undetailed policy discussion to allow the tories to challenge the labour claim cameron is flash in the pan he addressed early and head on gordon browns central criticism that with the world in economic chaos now is time for novice by arguing that what matters more than experience is character and judgment ref if camerons aim was to convince the public that he has serious policies and will bring changes then he london 00002556 003 of 003 succeeded in the eyes of much of the press cameron may have faced criticism that his speech failed to lay out in specifics the partys plans for government but doubt he is trying to avoid the fate of previous leaders who having set out detailed platform far in advance of any general election later had their best ideas taken by the labour government visit londons classified website httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalunit ed_kingdom lebaron
