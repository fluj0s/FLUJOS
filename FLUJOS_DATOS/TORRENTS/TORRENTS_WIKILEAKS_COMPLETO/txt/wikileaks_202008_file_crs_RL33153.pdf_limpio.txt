capabilities background and issues for congress summary concern has grown in congress and sewhere since the 1990s about chinas military modernization seve ral of the us navys most expensive acquisition programs as well as navy initiatives for homeporting ships and for training sailors are for developing or maintaining capabilities that could be useful or critical in countering improved chines maritime military capabilities in coming years the issue for congress addressed in this report is how should chinas military modernization be factored into d ecisions about us navy programs several elements of chinas military modernization have potential implications for future required us navy capabilitie s these include theaterrange ballistic missiles tbms landattack cruise missiles lacms antiship cruise missiles ascms surfacetoair missiles sams landbased aircraft naval mines submarines surface combatan ts amphibious ships nuclear weapons and possibly highpower microwave hpm

surveillance and reconnaissance longrang surveillance and targetin g systems antiair warfare aaw antisubmarine warfare asw mine countermeasures mcm and shipbuilding dependence on foreign suppliers observers believe nearterm focus of chinas military modernization is to field force that can succeed in shortduration conflict with taiwan and act as an anti access force to deter us intervention or delay the arrival of us forces particularly naval and air forces in such conflict some analysts speculate that china may attain or believe that it has attained capable maritime antiaccess force or elements of it by about 2010 other obs ervers believe this will happen later potential broader or long erterm goals of chinas naval modernization include asserting chinas regional military leadership and protecting chinas maritime territorial economic and energy interests chinas naval modernizati on has potential implications for required us navy capabilities in terms of preparing for conflict in the taiwan strait area maintaining us navy presence and military influence in the western paci fic and countering chinese ballistic missile submarines preparing for conflict in the taiwan strait area could place premium on the following onstation or earlyarriving navy forces capab ilities for defeating chin as maritime antiaccess forces and capabilities for operating in an environment that coul d

navy capabilities background and issues for congress introduction issue for congress concern has grown in congress and sewhere since the 1990s about chinas military modernization and its potential implications for required us military capabilities chinas military modernization is an increasing element in discussionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs2 1 for some examples since 2005 of expressions of concern bout chinas military modernization and of its potential implications for us navy requirements see appendix 2 this crs report does not discuss 1 elements of chinas military modernization that may be less relevant to future required us na vy capabilities 2 the potential implications of chinas military modernization for parts of the department of fense dod other than the navy such as the air force and the missile defense agency federal agencies other than dod such as the department of state and countries other than the united states 3 chinas espionage or other intelligencegathering activities including those aimed at obtaining information about us naval wea pons and technology and 4 chinas foreign or economic policy us defense policy toward taiwan or the political likelihood of military conflict involving china and the united states over taiwan or some other issueof future us navy requirements1 several of the us navys most expensive acquisition programs as well as navy initiatives for homeporting ships and for training sailors are for developing or maintaining capabilities that could be useful or critical in countering improved chin maritime military capabilities in coming years the issue for congress addressed in th is report is how should chinas military modernization be factored into decisions about us navy programs congresss decisions on this issue could significantly affect future us navy capabilities us navy funding requirements and the us defense industrial base including the shipbuilding industry scope sources and terminology this report focuses on the implications that certain elements of chinas military modernization may have for future required us navy capabilities2 other crs reports address separate issues relating to china and chinas military this report is base d on unclassified opensource information for convenience this report uses the term chinas naval modernization even though some chinese military modernization efforts that could affect required us navy capabilities are occurring in other parts of chinas military such as the air force or the missile force chinas military is formally called the peoples liberation army or pla its navy is called the pla navy or plan and its air force is called the pla air force or plaaf the pla navy includes an air component that is called the pla naval air force or planaf china refers to its ballistic missile force as the second artillery force backgroundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs3 3 unless otherwise indicated shipbuilding progra m information in this section is taken from janes fighting ships 20082009 and previous editions othe r sources of information on these shipbuilding programs may disagree re garding projected ship commissioning dates or other details but sources present similar over all pictures regarding pla navy shipbuilding 4 depending on their ranges tbms can be divided into short medium and intermediate range ballistic missiles srbms mrbms and irbms respectively 5 dod states by november 2007 the pla had deployed between 990 and 1070 css6 and css7 shortrange ballistic missiles srbm to garrisons opposite taiwan it is increasing the size of this force at rate of more than 100 missiles per year including variants of these missiles with improved ranges accuracies and payloads us department of defense annual report to congress on military power of the peoples republic of china 2008 washington 2008 p 2 hereafter 2008 dod cmp editions for other years cited similarly 6 2008 dod cmp p 2chinas naval modernization3 this section summarizes certain elements of chinas military modernization that may have implications for required us navy capabilities see appendix b for additional details and commentary on several of these modernization activities in addition to the modernization fforts discussed here and in appendix b chinas antisatellite and cyberwarfare capabilities may have implications for required us navy capabilities antiship ballistic missiles asbms china is deploying large numbers of theaterrange ballistic missiles tbms4 capable of attacking targets in taiwan or other regional locations5 although ballistic missiles in the past have traditionally been used to attack fixed targets on nd dod and other observe rs believe china is developing antiship ballistic missiles asbms which are tbms equipped with maneuverable reentry vehicles marvs capable of hitting moving ships at sea observers have expressed strong concer n about this development because such missiles in combination with broad area maritime surveillance and targeting systems would permit china to attack moving us navy ships in the western pacific for discussion of chinas broadarea maritime surveillance and targeting capabilities see the section below on c4isr systems the us navy has not previously faced threat from highly accu rate ballistic missile s capable of hitting moving ships at sea due to their ability to change course marvs would be more difficult to intercept than nonmaneuveri ng ballistic missile reentry vehicles dod states that china is developing an antiship ballistic missile asbm based on variant of the css5 mediumrange ballistic missile mrbm as component of its antiaccess strategy the missile has range in excess of 1500 km 810 nautical miles and when incorporated into sophisticated command and control system is key component of chinas antiaccess strategy to provide the pla the capability to attack ships at sea including aircraft carriers from great distances6 one observer stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs4 7 james lyons chinas one world washington times august 24 2008 b1 8 bill gertz inside the ring washington times july 10 2008 b1 item entitled china targets carrier july 2007 press report stated that one observer believed that marvequipped version of the css6 may be close to initial operational status bill gertz inside the ring washington times july 20 2007 6 item entitled new chinese missiles the article stated that it was reporting information from forthcoming report onthe plas space networks and ground surveillance systems will help target the plas new revolutionary longrange antiship ballistic missiles today the 2500kilometerrange df21c medium range ballistic missiles and the 700 kilometerrange df15a tactical missiles are being deployed along the taiwan straits while those missiles were influenced by the old us pershing 2 radar guided ballistic missile chinas system is far more capable and effectively keeps us carrier battle groups out of their range until the us navy can put enough truly effective antimissile defenses to sea7 july 2008 press report states china is close to deploying new conventionally armed strategic missile capable of hitting us aircraft carriers and other warships at sea defense intelligence official said test of the new weapon is expected but the timing is not known second offi cial also said the chinese anticarrier ballistic missile effort including an antic ipated test firing is being watched closely defense officials said the new missile precision guided css5 mediumrange missile is as great or greater concern for some military planners as chinas new antisatellite weapon which was first tested successfully against an orbiting chinese weather satellite in january 2007 carrierkilling missiles are viewed as one of the most important strategic weapons in the beijing arsenal because they will be able to block the rapid deployment of us forces to the region considered vital to any taiwan defense or defense of other allies in the region richard fisher specialist on the chin military with the international assessment and strategy center said the upcoming test of mediumrange antiship ballistic missile asbm would not be chinas first it would appear that the peoples liberation army may now be developing three types of asbms he said two of the missiles are based on the css5 also known as the df21 and chinese internet photos reveal what looks like maneuvering warhead on the missile similar in design to warheads deployed on the us pershing2 mediumrange missile the pershing2 dismantled in the 1980s used radardigital map guidance system and mr fisher thinks the new chinese antiship missile could use combination of active radar and optical or infrared guidance third antiship ballistic missile is xpected to be longerrange variant of the css5 first seen in 2006 that may have multiple warheads8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs5 chinas military from the

ascms whic h can be launched from land based strike fighters and bombers surface combatants submarines and possibly shorebased launchers among the most cap able of the new ascms that have been or are being acquired by the pla navy are the russianmade ssn22 sunburn carried by chinas four russianmade sovremennyclass destroyers and the ssn 27 sizzler carried by 8 of chinas 12 russianmade kiloclass submarines landattack cruise missiles lacms china is developing landattack cruise missiles lacms that can be fire d from land bases ndbased aircraft or navy platforms such as submarines to att ack targets including air and naval bases in taiwan or other regiona l locations such as japan or guam dod stated in 2007 that first and secondgeneration lacms may be deployed in the near future10 surfacetoair missiles sams china is deploying modern surfacetoair missile sam systems across from taiwan including longrange and highaltitude systems that have an advertised range sufficient to cover the entire taiwan strait which is roughly 100 nautical miles 185 kilometers wide advanced sams may have some effectiveness against stealthy aircraft longer and shorter range sam systems deployed along chinas coast oppos ite taiwan would in combination give china multilayer defense against enemy aircraft seeking to operate over the strait or approach that portion of chinas coast11 mines china is believed to have an inve ntory of tens of thousands of naval mines of various types including mode rn designs chinese naval publications demonstrate strong interest in the use of naval mines in c onflicts or blockade situations and partic ularly for countering us submar ines as some observers have noted12 detailed opensource discussions of chinas naval mining capabilities are few in number

nuclear weapons14 china as longstanding nuclear weapon state could put nuclear warheads on weapons such as tbms including asbms lacms ascms torpedoes and naval mines ch ina could use nuclea rarmed versions of these weapons except the lacms to attack us navy ships at sea china might do so in the belief that it could subsequen tly confuse the issue in the public arena of whose nuclear warhead had detonated15 or that the united states in any event would not escalate the conflict by retaliating with nuclear attack on land target in china during the cold war analysts debated wh ether the use of s oviet nuclear weapon against us navy ships during conflict would lead to us nuclear response one set of observers states in chinese discussions of russian asw systems there is pointed recognition that the soviets leaned heavily toward the use of tactical nuclear weapons eg nuclear depth charges and torpedoes in asw operations tactical nuclear weapons are also mentioned in the context of mine warfare an article in the july 2006 issue of the chinese military journal modern navy in discussing possible pla navy use of sea mines suggests the potential combat value of nucleararmed versions it will be important to watch closely for any sign of chinese efforts in this direction16 china could also use nucleararmed ballistic missile to detonate nuclear warhead in the atmosphere to create highaltitude electromagnetic pulse emp intended to temporarily or perm anently disable the electronic circuits of us or other civilian and military electronic systems some observers have expressed

and interference at range of hundreds of miles statement of william r graham phd before the military research and development subcommittee of the house armed servi ces committee october 7 1999 19 one source states that an electromagnetic warhead detonated within lethal radius of surface combatant will render its air defence system inoperable as well as damaging other electronic equipment such as electronic counterme asures electronic support measures and communications this leaves the vessel undefended until these systems can be restored which may or may not be possible on the high seas therefore launching an electromagnetic glidebomb on to surface combatant and then reducin g it with laser or television guided weapons is an alternate strategy for dea ling with such targets section 104 of carlo kopp the electromagnetic bomb weapon of electrical mass destruction oprecent years over the potential vulnerab ility of us military systems to emp effects17 highpower microwave hpm weapons some observers are concerned that china might develop or already possess highpower microwave hpm weapons also called radio frequency weapons r fws or ebombs which are nonnuclear devices that can be used to generate damaging emp effects over relatively short distances to disable the electronic circuits of nearby enemy civilian and military systems in theory an hpm weapon coul d be placed on tbm or ascm and fired at us navy ship although the effectiv emp radius of such devices might be on the order of only few hundred yards18 such devices could be used to attack individual us navy

submarines while simultaneously undertaking the purchase of submarines from russia on an unprecedented scale indeed china commissioned thirtyone new submarines between 1995 and 2005 given th is rapid evolution appraisals of chinas capability to field competent and thal diesel submarines in the littorals have slowly changed from ridicule to gr udging respect of late chinas potential for complex technological development is finally being taken seriously abroad38 another observer stated in 2007 looking ahead further modern conventional boats are expected to be constructed as the 27 older and less capable units romeo and ming classes are paid off ie retired and while predictions are hazardous an overall force level of about 4050 boats is expected39 another observer stated in 2007 chinas submarine fleet is now considered the plans most potent strength since 1995 the plan has co mmissioned about 31 new submarines including two nuclearpowered subm arines based on advanced russian technology eight submarines were commissioned in 2005 and seven were commissioned in 2006 including new songclass boats and yuanclass boat heavily inspired by russias amurclass sub with its anechoic tile coatings and quiet sevenbladed skewed propeller the reported incorporation of airindependent propulsion systems that permit submarines to operate underwater for up to 30 days would make the song and yuan submarines virtually undetectable to existing us surveillance networks in addition china has three new nuclearpowered submarine design and construction programs the type093 shangclass nuclear attack boat and the type094 jinclass nuclear ballistic missile submarine programs are underway two shang submarines are deployed nd three are under construction and five jinclass ballistic missile submarines are reportedly under construction five type095 submarines larger version of the shangjin hull are also under development together with its proc urement program for improved russian made kiloclass submarines china has at least six new submarine programs under way simultaneously submarine development campaign that is unprecedented in peacetime china will have at least 34 advanced

been in steady decline from nearly 120 boats to roughly 55 operational submarines today the us navy expects the force will level out around 40 boats in the next decade the decline of the submarine fleet is part of transition where large older classes are being phased out and replaced with newer but less numerous submarine classes41 another observer stated in 2007 we were seeing 3 to 4 type 039s launched per year when it was finally in mass production we have seen either the 2nd or the 3rd unit of 039a aka type 041 yuan class under construction recently it looks like plan has finally sorted out enough issues in the yuan class design to mass produce it im guessing we will see 36 type 039as coming out year for the next couple of years and after that we will see the successor to the 039 class42 this observer also stated in 2007 the mass production of yuan type 039a class boats has recently started its hard to see that this will continue more than the mass production run of 3rd variants of the song class design so we might see 10 yuan at most although i think china w ill soon be developing class of conventional submarine to match the german u214 the french scorpene and the russian amur designs im guessing the japanese oyashio and the australian collins class designs are still in league of their own either way this new class will most likely endure long initial production process like the song class did before mass production although judging from songs production of 4 per year at its height it shouldnt be long before the yuan class or this new diesel class replaces all the mings plus earlier the song class submarines43 although china is modernizing its subm arine force through the construction of new boats one report citing us navy data see table 2

american scientists fas which published the figures shown in table 2 states chinas entire fleet of approxima tely 55 generalpurpose submarines conducted total of six patrols during 2007 slightly better than the two patrols conducted in 2006 and zero in 2005 the 2007 performance matches chinas alltime high of six patrols conducted in 2000 the only two years since 1981 that chinese submarines conducted more than five patrols in single year the new information obtained by fede ration of american scientists from the us navy under the freedom of info rmation act also shows that none of chinas ballistic missile submarines have ever conducted deterrent patrol in perspective just what constitutes chinese patro l is secret according to the us navy but it probably refers to an extended voyage away from the homeport area see here for further definitions the seven chinese patrols conducted in 2007 is but fraction of the number of patrol s conducted by the us submarine force which musters well over 100 patrols per year but comparison of us and chinese submarine patrol levels is not possible because the two navies have very different missions china has overseas military commitments and uses its submarine fleet almost exclusively as coastal defense force whereas the us submarine force is constantly engaged in forward operations alone or with allies the chinese patrol rate compares be tter with that of the russian navy which has largely ceased forward submarine operations compared with those of the soviet union during the cold war russian general purpose submarines conducted seven patrols in 2007 in historic perspective the six chinese submarine patrols conducted in 2007 continues trend that china in this decade has sent slightly more submarines on patrol than during the 1990s

it launched its first ballistic missiles submarine xia type 092 china has yet to conduct its first deterrent patrol the new information confirms that neither the xia nor the two new jinclass type 094 ballistic missile submarines the first of which was launched in 2004 have ever conducted deterrent patrol implications despite the rebound in general purpose submarine patrols dramatic reports from recent years about chinese submarines operating inside japanese territorial waters or surfacing close to us aircraft carriers have been largely absent in 2007 the meaning of the patrol rebound is yet unclear after all it follows complete absence of submarine patrol s in 2005 the fourth year since 1981 that chinas submarine fleet did not conduc t any patrols despite introduction of several new classes of more advanced submarines for greater reach that modernization has not yet manifested itself in the form of clear increase in submarine patrols the patrol number does not say anythi ng about what the submarines did during the six patrols they might have been basic attempts to sail far from shore to test navigational equipment or communication with the homebase or they might have included more advanced tactical operations they might have been conducted by six different s ubmarines or only couple yet for the chinese submarine force ov erall six patrols do not provide very much operational experience for more than 50 submarines and their crews if china did plan more extended reach for its submarine force one might expect the patrol rate to continue to increase in the next couple of years only the future will tell but the operational experience from the 55 patrols conducted by the entire submarine force between 1981 and the end of 2007 suggests that chinas submarine force at least for now remains coastal defense force44 another observer expressing different view on the issue of the frequency of chinese submarine patrols stated in 2007 that chinese submarines slip out into open seas from underwater t unnels and are virtually undetectable regarding an october 2006 incident involving songclass ss that surfaced near the us aircraft carrier kitty hawk while it was operating near okinawa this observer stated that after the submarine was detected on the surface the submarine submerged and disappeared defeating all u s antisubmarine warfare sw efforts to detect it the observer stated that the ease with which the submarine maneuvered undetected into japanese waters and evaded us and japan self defens force submarine sensors suggests that chinas large submarine fleet engages in far more sea patrols than the us has any hope of tracking45httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs18 46 fighting ships 20072008 p 31 executive overview 47 see for example mure dickie and

ss was in contrast to claims that the chines submarine fleet conducted only two patrols in 2006 according to information declassified by the us navy and obtained by the federation of american scientists under the freedom of information act such relative inactivity seems at first ex traordinary but can at least partly be explained by probable ambiguity about wh at constitutes patrol however more obvious reason is that half of ch inas 26 modern yuan song kilo class submarines have entered service since 2004 and it would be surprising if it was not proving difficult to build up the necessa ry levels of training and experience before more frequent outofarea deployments can be undertaken46 aircraft carriers the issue of whether and when china might deploy one or more aircraft carriers and what the design and capabilities of chinese aircraft carriers might be has been topic of discussion am ong observers for the last several years chinese officials in recent years have be gun to speak more openly about building one or more aircraft carriers47 developments since mid2005 have suggested to some observers that china now intends to complete the unfinished exrussian carrier varyag which china purchased from ru ssia several years ago and place it into service in the near future possibly as an aviation training ship some observers also believe that china in the next few years will begin construction of one or more indigenously designed aircraft carriers the varyag has an estimated full load displ acement of about 58500 tons compared to about 100000 tons for us navy nimitz cvn68 class aircraft carrier about 42000 tons for the french airc raft carrier charles gaulle which was commissioned in 2001 and about 65000 tons to 70000 tons for aircraft carriers that the united kingdom and france plan to commission into service between 2014 and 2016 it is estimated that the varyag can embark an air wing of 18 su33 flanker fighters plus additional helicopters compared to 70 or more aircraft on nimitz class carrier 36 aircraft on the charles gaulle and 40 to 45 aircraft on the future uk and french carriers one observer stated in 2008 that procurement of an aircraft carrier capa bility has been high priority for the chinese navy since the 1990s the varyag arrived at dalian in march 2002 since then there have been conflicting reports about chinese plans for the ship but following its emergence from dock in mid2005 painted in military colours it islikely that it is intended to bring the ship into operational service work in 2006 included the apparent application of nonskid surface to the flight deck reports in november 2006 that china was negotiating to procure up to 50 sukhoi su33 carriercapable fighters was further indicator of chinese intentions further major

somewhat alternate view in 2007 stating that the new ship that is probably most anticipated for 2008 is the aircraft carrier most people suspect that we will see this in jiangnan shipyard i do believe that many of the suppliers have already delivered the necessary components for this ship i also believe that the ship will start construction in 2008 but we might not see anything usef ul for another 2 years what about varyag weve been waiting for progress ever since the second half of 2005 when the ship was first painted in plan colour since then weve seen some progress but this past year ie 2007 hasnt brought about that much change the conventional wisdom is th at china bought varyag for study and for trainingpreparing future naval air wing as time goes by i have more and more doubts toward latter i almost feel like varyag is being displayed as decoy of some sort it is there to grab people s attention on this old ship and away from works on chinas first indigenous carri er obviously im not expecting much progress in varyag in 200854 this observer also stated in 2007 that there are some rumours recently that th indigenous carrier projects will start in both dalian and shanghai

asbms one observer stated in november 2008 that according to 2001 report in janes defence weekly 79 china has been developing an othb overthehorizon backscatter radar system since 2001 the prototype system is described by the chinese national electronics import export corporation cneiec as ving range of between 800 and 3000 kilometers with azimuth coverage of 60 degrees the system is bistatic with separate transmitter and receiver stations separated by distance of 100 kilometers publicly available satellite photo dated 7 september 2005 seems to indicate that the prototype rray has been dismantled with vegetation having taken over much of the former arrays position the prototype transmitter has not yet been identified in available imagery an operational version of this system has likely been fielded in the intervening years since the janes repor t first came to light much larger receiver has been identified in opensource imagery located roughly 50 kilometers southwest of xiangfan while the corresponding transmitter has yet to be identified in available imagery the presence of the receiver array is indicative of chinas intent to pro ceed with an operational othb systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs29 80 sean oconnor oth rada r and the asbm threat imint analysis november 11 2008 accessed online at httpgeimintblogspotcom200811ot hradarandasbmthreathtmlperformance data of the new chinese othb system is not currently available but very basic overview of the capability of the system can be considered by using the data from the prototype system considering mimimum range of 800 kilometers and maximum range of 3000 kilometers coupled with azimuth coverage of approximately 60 degrees an operational othb system would be able to scan much of the ocean from japan to the philippine islands china has also developed an othsw overthehorizon surface wave radar system situated along the coast 8 kilometers east of shencheng chinas othsw system is bistatic radar employing separate transmitter and receiver elements separated by distance of 265 kilometers very little is known about chinas othsw development so performance data is speculative at best it is not even known whether the othsw system is prototype or an operational version oper ational status seems likely given the placement along the strait of taiwan in which case the prototype system has yet to be identified by examining the tr ansmitter array it appears that azimuth coverage of up to 90 degrees is possible russian input may have been sought in developing the othsw system given the receivers similarity to that of the russian nakhodka othsw system the russian system is likely the more capable of the two systems however give n that the transmitter is not located in close proximity to the receiver suggestin g system of greater power output and therefore greater range the russian ir ida othsw system has quoted range of 300 kilometers it should be noted that both the ot hb and othsw range estimates are likely very conservative the operational systems are likely more powerful than either the prototype othb or the russian transportable irida othsw system and therefore are likely to have greater range capability than is depicted both operational chinese systems should not however have range capabilities lesser than those which are depicted80 another observer stated in august 2008 that china has an initial electrooptical and radar satellite constellation that will this year be joined by russiandesigned surveillance satellites it should be noted that china has broken with europes galileo navigation satellite program and will loft its own 30 satellite constellation to compete with the united states russian and european navsat systems in apr il 2008 china launched its first tracking data relay satellite to lessen its dependency on ground satellite control and relay stations the emerging systems will in th near future enable global

officials said china has deployed new widearea ocean surveillance system that includes an underwater sonar network of sensors and ground and seabased longrange radar that will make it more difficult for us submarines to protect the fleet and to track chinas growing force of new attack and missile submarines former us government defense specialist on china said on the condition of anonymity that there are indicati ons china is operating rudimentary underwater sound surveillance system or sosus the sonar network includes fixed sensors that can pinpoi nt us submarines operating in some areas of the western pacific the us navy operates similar system at strategic underwater choke points around the world the chinese sosus has been detected underwater in the bohai sea off the northern chinese coast north of the yellow sea major chinese navy operating area additionally china also has set up at least five long and mediumrange radar sites along its coast that have overthehorizon capability the former official said the sonar and radar are part of chinas key strategic wartime goal of knocking out the five or more aircraft carrier strike groups that would be rushed to the region near taiwan in any future conflict those carrier battle groups are defended by submarines if they are after carriers we protect carriers with subs and if they know where they are they can find the carriers said the former defense official who confirmed that the chinese are developi ng various ground sea and space sensors designed to target the american fleet the chinese sonar and radar also complicates the navys mission of tracking chinas submarine fleet which includes large numbers of newer and quieter attack and ballistic missile boats with jl2 nuclear missiles capable of hitting the united states if the chinese can do sosus that w ould be tremendous leg up for their submarines the defense official said because the best way to hunt sub is with sub chinas sosus array will make it mo re difficult

coverage of the we stern pacific for the first time so they can keep 247 trail on american naval assets for the first time82 regarding plan c4isr capabilities in general one set of observers states that for many years the entire pla including the plan faced major shortcomings in its c4isr capabilities but beijing has embarked on massive effort to modernize upgrade and expand its communications infrastructure one of the key results of this communicati ons upgrade which has been bolstered by the rapid development of chinas civilian information technology and telecommunications industries was the construction of national fiberoptic communications network that prov ides the pla with much greater communications capacity reliability and curity according to one source in the coastal military commands gigan tic opticcable communication network has been set up which guarantees the opticcable communication among the headquarters of each military command meanwhile sate llite communication has been applied more widely which ensures smooth communication between the top commanding organ and the headquarters at different levels of the military commands chinese research institutes have also developed vsat very small aperture terminal communication system consisting of mobile vehicleborne components as well as new microwave and troposcatter communication systems additionally china is upgrading some of its traditional hv vhf and uhf communication systems improving military computer networks and making them available to more and more units also has been priority for the pla as it expands its communications networks another key informatization development that has major implications for the plan indeed recent reports indicate that all plan units at the division level and above are now connected to military computer networks and that current plans focus on extending coverage to lowerlevel units beijing has likewise intensified its efforts to improve its spacebased c4isr capabilities which are particularly crucia l for naval informatization navigation and positioning has been another major ar ea of emphasis with implications for military modernization and the informatiza tion of the plan in addition to using gps and glonass and working with the eu on the galileo navigation satellite system china has deployed the indigenous built beidou navigation system1 comprised of four satellites and plans to develop larger system called compass or beidou2 comprised of thirtyfive satellites chinese developments in small satellites and maritime observation satellites are also of particular interest from the perspective of naval informatizati on in addition the plan is improving the capabilities of its ocean survey and reconnaissance ships which are responsible for number of tasks including surveying gathering meteorological and hydrographic information laying and repairing undersea cables and intelligence collection one major area of emphasis appears to be the development of c4isr capabilities required to implement an access denial strategy chinese researchers also emphasize the importance of linking platforms together into an integrated

areas and pla military capability consequently was considered not as great as its inventory of weapons alone might suggest chinas 2004 defense white paper84 stated an intention to improve in these areas and observers believe the pla is acting on these intentions the pla in recent years has developed doctrine fo r joint operations involving multiple military services improved its military education and training and conducted more realistic exercises and reformed its logistics system the partment of defense dod stated in 2005 that china has stated its intentions and allocated resources to pursue forcewide professionalization impr ove training conduct more robus t realistic joint exercises and accelerate acquisition of modern weapons85 dod states that the plas ongoing military reforms emphasize building qualified officer and nco corps many of the plas inve stments in human capital are described in the 2004 defense white paper as elements of the strategic project for talented people which focuses on personnel management education and training reforms the 2006 defense white paper reiterated the importance of training and educational reforms in addition to improving morale and welfare in the military improvements in the quality of personnel will continue to parallel broader force structure doctrine and tr aining reforms across the pla as it seeks to build force able to fight and win local wars under cond itions of informatization86httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs33 87 2008 dod cmp p 5 88 2008 dod cmp p 47 89 2008 dod cmp p 48dod also states that the pla is

will emphasize realistic training conditions training in electromagnetic and joint operations environments and integrating new and high technologies into the force structure87 dod states that in addition to improving the education level of people brought into the military an equally important aspect of the plas modernization is enhancing the realism and quality of military training during the armywide military training conference in 2006 the cmc announced tr aining would be more robust and informationintensive to better prepare the pla to face technologically advanced adversaries the pla general staff department gsd 2007 training guidelines indicate the pla expects training scenario s to resemble actual combat conditions as closely as possible the pla is atte mpting to enhance the level of realism by incorporating opposing forces into its exer cises and in some cases by designing training that compels officers to deviat from the scripted exercise plan the pla is also conducting more joint servic exercises although these efforts tend to be based more on deconfliction than truly joint operations they do signify that the pla is attempting to prepare its officers and soldiers for the demands of the future battlefield in addition the pl is utilizing simulators to increase training time and conducting more command post exercises to improve its officers planning and decisionmaking skills88 improvements in these areas might be c onsidered as important as the weapon modernization activities discussed below some of these improvements may require several years to fully implement dod states that the pla is likely to continue to face several problems as reforms are implemented for example the pla itself acknowledges that military training continues to suffer from units going thr ough the motions heavy scripting and lack of realism the pla will need to address these deficiencies if the human capital reforms are to achieve any long term improvements across the military89 another set of observers states that the plans focus on technological developments notwithstanding chinese planners realize that rapid improvements in hardware will not be fully effective without corresponding increases in the ability of military personnel to operate them under realistic combat conditions in keeping with recent plawide guidance from the general staff

of force projection including longrange bombers aircraft carriers large airborne units and the logistics capability to support and sustain combat forces beyond its borders none of these obstacles can be overcome swiftly and none can be overcome merely by throwing more money at the problem91 dod states that the pla has only limited capacity to communicate with submarines at sea and the pla navy has experience in managing an ssbn fleet that performs strategic patrols92 sustained operations in distant waters regarding sustained operations in more distant waters dod states china s ability to sustain military power at distance remains limited93 dod also states that china will not be able to project and sustain small military units far bey ond china before 2015 and will not be able to

estimated to be one infantry division of approximately 10000 troops and equipment at one time likewise if all the large transport aircraft in the plaaf were operational and rigged for parachute drop only approximately 5000 parachutists could be delivered in single lift much less if equipment is carried at the same time pla inflight refueling capability is limited and can only support small numbers of fighter aircraft the pla navy has gained some proficiency with unde rway replenishment and sustainment of long distance deployments but this capability remains limited by the small numbers of support shipshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs36 95 2008 dod cmp p 36 96 wendell minick chinese air power focuses on taiwan us scenarios defense daily july 14 2008 97 2008 dod cmp p 22 98 wendell

and maritime vessels and adjusts operational doctrine to encompass new capabilities these changes will require tailored logistics equipment and training which will take time and money to develop proficiency although foreign produced equipment and maintenance parts as well as the civil sector may help to fill nearterm gaps continued reliance on nonorganic assets will hinder pla capabilities to sustain largescale operations over time95 july 2008 press article on the plaaf states the chinese have released photos of chengdu j10 fighter refueling in flight so it certainly wants the world to believe that it is equipping its air force to project power said thomas kane author of chinese grand strategy and maritime power i keep hearing people talk about the plaaf beyond taiwan but it is all fluff former us defense official said the argument goes something like this the plaaf is building up its aerial refueling tanker fleet so it can now fly farther he said so what give one example of how the plaaf would use that fleet and give one good target and the circumstances where they would attack that target given much larger diplomatic environment and the chance of going to war in the region96 joint operations regarding joint operations dod states the pla hopes eventually to fuse servicelevel capabilities with an integrated network for c4isr new command structure and joint logistics system however it continues to face deficienci in interservice cooperation and actual experience in joint exercises and combat operations97 july 2008 press article stated the following regarding plaaf training the real question is what is the pl aaf doing in terms of its own training and joint training at the tactical level former us defense official said china wants to build joint

component of chinas military transformation as reflected by recent leadership statements and the development of several new classes of surface ships and submarines moreover informatization is clearly central aspect of plan modernization and naval c4isr modernization will have important implications in areas such as joint operations and command and control chinese c4isr modernization has become top priority and plan informatization appears to have made some impressive progress in recent years it remains unclear however how close the chinese actually are to achieving the socalled informatized force the prcs 2006 defense white paper established goal of being able to fight and win informatized wars by the mid21st century this reflects perceived gap between the chinese armed forces and the worlds most advanced militaries which chinese writers often suggest will take decades to overcome at the same time however it also raises the issue of distinguishing between the ideal capability the chinese navy seeks to establish in the long term and that which might simply prove good enough in the short term indeed even relatively simple system of deconfliction100 by time or geographic area might be sufficient in taiwan scenario this suggests that the plan might achieve an employable capability with surprising rapidity especially if it pursues one that falls short of the standards set by us proponents of network centric warfare but that is nonetheless capable of contributing to th achievement of chinas operational and strategic objectives101 with regard to chinas uavs including their potential for conducting surveillance operations july 2008 pr ess article on the plaaf states we did not see much in their writings that specifically mentioned uavs although they are clearly interested in th em as evidenced by the amount of effort being spent developing new types in recen t years roger cliff china military specialist at the rand corpsaid china has been showing off small

dods nnual report on chinas military power 2003 dod cmp p 252006 designed by the shenyang aircraft design institute dark sword is not believed to be technically possible give n chinas current aviation manufacturing aptitude during the 2006 zhuhai airshow 10 uav models and mockups were displayed including the tianyi s ky wing uav and soar dragon high naltitude unmanned scout however beyond the uav models on display there was virtually company literature on chinas uavs except for the pw uav built by the china national precision machinery corp models and mockups are little evidence to support strong inte rest by plaaf in uavs and the plaaf has shown little interest in uav surveillance operations surveillance or command information is definitely not seen as the primary mission of the air force cliff said i dont recall anything about the air force providing surveillance or commandandcontrol information to the other services this is consistent with previous observations that joint thinking and practice are still underdeveloped in china china is attempting to expand its airborne early warning aircraft inventory but research and development on several programs has been ongoing for more than 10 year s and there are few signs the indigenous kj200 airborne early warning and control aircraft will be operational any time soon numerous sources indicate the trial test flights of the kj 200 have been disappointing with numerous flight stability problems with the socalled balance beam phasedarray radar102 antiair warfare aaw regarding aaw one observer stated in 2004 that chinas decision to shed its strictly coastal defense force structure in favor of acquiring larger and more modern fighting vessels capable of bl uewater operations has exposed significant vulnerability the plans inability to provide sophisticated layered air defense for these new forces fleet air defense is the achilles heel of the 21stcentury chinese navy as the plans ships increased in size capability and endurance and with operational deployments taking them well beyond the navys traditional mainlandbased air defenses challenge not faced previously became apparent having to defend these units from air attack in the event of hostilities response to this concern has been slow and inade quate at best and serious consideration to providing the surface navy with the kind of air defense systems one normally associates with modern naval fleets has only begun not until the late 1990s was an effort made to outfit plan destroyers and frigates with an antiair point defense system giving them some measure of selfdefense the plan surface fleet however still lacks modern air surveillance systems and data links required for area air defense missions the combination of shortrange weapons and lack of modern surveillance systems limits the plan to selfdefense and pointdefense aaw only as resu lt except in unusual circumstances plan ship is capable of conducting air defense of another ship103httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs39 104 dominic descisciolo red aegis us naval institute proceedings july 2004 pp 56 58 105 gabriel collins andrew erickson lyle goldstein and william murray chinese evaluations of the us navy submarine force naval college war review winter 2008 7879in similar vein todays plan naval aviation forces alone cannot provide fighter coverage for the entire chinese co ast or the fleet so interceptor duties have ben distributed by region between naval aviation units and the pla air force this increases the number of assets available for the task but questions remain about joint patrolling separate chains of comma nd and air force over water proficiency when faced with trai ning scenarios that incorporated factors likely found in modern air combat environment such as electronic countermeasures or even inclement weather neither service was up to the task in light of these facts the potential ffectiveness of the cooperation between the two services is doubtful significant gaps exist in the present plan fleet air defense posture given the forces available today china cannot adequately defend its fleet from air attack in the modern air threat environment104 antisubmarine warfare asw regarding asw one set of observers based on review of chinese military literature states that when considering chinese views of the american submarine force it is certainly relevant to consider how china appraises its own antisubmarine warfare forces generally china considers its asw forces to be weak one chinese naval analyst observes chinese pe ople are focused on chinas submarine force both conventional and nuclear deve lopment but often neglect the threat we face from us navy submarines it is moreover suggested that there is still relatively large gap between chinas asw technology level and that of the worlds advanced level in appraising the asw capabilities of its own surface forces another naval analyst notes across the world most naval ships are now equipped with towed array sonars which has increased their asw capabilities but most of our ships only have hull mounted sonars finally there is concern that these antisubmarine assets are themselves highly vulnerable submarines can carry out ferocious missile attacks from tens or even 100 200km ranges causing the submarine hunting vessels to become the hunted targets chinese aerial asw is also highlighted as particular weakness105 mine countermeasures mcm regarding mcm one observer stated in 2004 that serious pla navy operational deficien cy involves the mine countermeasures vessels mcmv though china has an intense shipping activity along its coasts the plan has virtually minesweeping or minehunting capabilities this was due perhaps to the considera tion that the us navy is usually more concerned to keep the sea lanes open instead of laying mines but nevertheless the lack of mcm is simply stunning any hostile organisation including

chinas warship design and construction programs in certain respects particularly since chinas warships are built in shipyards that also build commercial ships improvements in chinese commercial shipbuilding notwithstanding observers believe that chinas ability to design build and maintain complex warships is limited in certain respects by dependen ce on foreign suppliers for certain key warship components particularly propulsion systems and combat system equipment107 dod states that while shipyard mode rnization and expansion has increased chinas overall shipbuildin g capacity and capabilities generating corresponding benefits for all types of naval projects including submarines surface combatants naval aviation including initiatives for aircra ft carriers and amphibioussealiftairlift assets chinas na val industry continues to rely on foreign suppliers for some propulsion units and to lesser degree fire control systems cruise missiles shiptoair missiles torpedo systems nsors and other advanced electronics108 one set of observers states that viewed holistically the cumulative effects of chinas improved commercial shipbuilding abilities have undoubtedly benefited sic chinas naval development to some degree military shipbuilding may benefit from advances in hull construction modular shipbuilding subcomponent i ndustry improvement increased yard capacity and other areas chinas major shipbuilding facilities have or are in the process of adopting the latest hull block construction and advanced outfitting ship production methods these modern techniques use an assembly line approach to shipbuilding allowing for greater overall throughput capacity and pr oductivity in general these more efficient production methods have the potential to yield similar beneficial effects on milita ry shipbuilding reduced build times increased shipyard output and lower individual unit cost yet perhaps not surprisingly the most modern tier of shipyards in the prc thus far has been dedicated to producing commercial ships for the world markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs41 as result under current geopolitical cond itions the efficiency gains achieved through advanced production methods and shipyard facilities are more likely to help china achieve larger sh are of the global commercial shipbuilding market than play dominant role in plan modernization efforts yet if the global strategic situation changed into something more akin to cold war environment the prc leadership c ould always forego the commercial advantages of these new facilities for the sake of national security needs advanced shipyards and production pr ocess alone do not guarantee the ability to build complex ship types efficiently integrating numerous mechanical electrical cargo and habitability systems w ithin the confined space of ship has always been principal challenge for naval architects and shipbuilders and is often the greatest challenge in the construction of complex warships the dry bulk carriers and oil tankers that have thus far dominated chinese commercial shipbuilding are relatively w in complexity and offer littletono potential for carryover affect on impr oving systems integration capabilities in military shipbuilding the same cannot be said of the considerably more complex 150000deadweighttonne floating oil production offloading and storage fpso vessel recently built by shanghai waigaoqiao shipbuilding or the liquefied natural gas lng tankers currently under construction at hudongzhonghua shi pbuilding in shanghai the sophisticated cargo processing and storage equipment on these vessels are at the highend of the complexity spectrum for commercial ships and exceed s that of most naval auxiliaries the progress in systems integration proficiency shown by chinese shipbuilders on these projects is somewhat tempered when considering the level of foreign technical assistance required in the naval sector the outward complexity of the luyang ii airdefense destroyer and other recent plan additions seem to indicate growing trend of improving systems integration capabilities the luyang iiclass is equipped with the plans first phased array radar the cornerstone of combat system that also includes indigenous hq9 surfacetoair missiles and 48cell vertical launch system vls the integration of these three subsystems into comprehensive longrange area airdefense system is notable achievement and may indicate move towards improved plan blue wa ter capability while this may be the case little is currently known as to the actual capab ilities or operational effectiveness of the luyang iis systems and one might plausibly interpret the purchase of advanced sovremennyclass destroyers and kiloclass submarines from russia as indicators of continued limitations in indigenous capabilities for integrating the most complex sets of warship systems the present state of the commercial marine equipment industry is one of notable concern for chinese offici als overall only 40 percent of subcomponents on chinesebuilt commercial ships are from indigenous suppliers there is little doubt that the problems in chinas marine equipment industry have affected plan modernization effort s in ways similar to the commercial shipbuilding sector china has long relied on foreignmade licensed or reverse engineered technology for major weapon systems and despite notable advanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs42 in indigenous combat systems in its latest classes s till uses high degree of imported combat systems equipment in most plan vessels this reliance on foreign subcomponents whether in combat systems or lessglamorous commercial dualuse items extends beyond national selfreliance concerns foreign outsourcing drives up acquisition and lifecycle maintenance costs increases system integration challenges and places additional demands on crew training chinese literature includes accounts of sailors physically tracing out systems handoverhand on new kiloclass s ubmarines due to lack of technical documentation as well as accounts of flying in german technicians to repair imported mtu diesel engines on the ty pe 052class destroyer qingdao during the plans first roundtheworld cruise in 2002 these examples illustrate the detrimental effect imported technology can have on operational readiness and likewise highlight how chinas ability to meet its goals of improving its domestic marine equipment industry stands to significantly affect both commercial nd military shipbuilding development overwhelmingly prc shipbuilders ve relied on imported technology for diesel propulsion western shipowners in terviewed by the authors indicate that chinesemade engines are acceptable but are still inferior to japanese and koreanmade marine diesels the vast majority of chinesebuilt commercial diesel engines remain licensed copies of foreign principally european designs chinese engine builders reportedly still experience difficulties manufacturing and mating engine blocks and crankshafts on large marine diesels and foreign licensing companies frequently provide close technical assistance and quality control oversight to chinese factories building their most advanced engine models the proportion of chinese indigenous chnology is similarly low in naval propulsion there is hi gh proportion of diesel pr opulsion in chinese ships and submarines built since 1999 and the small percentage of indigenous chinese engines german mtu diesel designs ar used on songclass submarines luhai and luyang iiiclass destroyers and may also be included in chinas latest type 071 yuzhaoclass amphibious ships likewise frenchdesigned semtpielstick diesels provide the main propulsion for jiangkai jiangnan and jianghuclass frigates houjianclass patrol craft ptg s and eight additional classes of plan landing and auxiliary ships marine gas turbines as with diesel design have not been bright spot in chinese industry their development has been severely hindered by the slow pace of indigenous jet engine development which is symptomatic of larger issues within the chinese aerospace industry as whole progress in turbofan vice older turbojet technology has been pa rticularly slow thus affecting the highperformance aircraft and marine ga s turbine applications that use these more modern and efficient engines consequently indigenous marine gas turbine has been fielded to date nd the few plan units using gas turbine propulsion relied on imported us engines prior to 1989 tiananmen square trade sanctions and ukrainian engines ever since the short term prospects for chinese ma rine gas turbines directly affecting plan modernization are low but there are indicators of possible improvements in the longer term jet engine development is high priority within the pla and the recently introduced j10 and j11 fighters are expected to be powered by

page 153 the report similarly states that chinas sbi shipbuilding industry exhibits number of limitations and weaknesses that will constrain naval modernization although the design and construction of vessels have improved the sbi has experienced numerous problems producing quality subsystems for both merchant and naval vessels chinese shipbuilders have had to rely heavily on foreign imports for the power plants navigation and sensor suites and key weapon systems for its newest naval platforms for example chinese marineengine factories have had difficulties producing gas turbine engines powerful nough for large destroyers and related combatants the last two classes of chinese destroyers have relied on imported gas turbine engines for example this high degree of reliance on foreign goods creates major challenges for systems integration and given the inconsistent availability of certain weapon systems complicates serial production of some platformsindigenous w10a turbofan engine the original w10 and other earlier chinese turbofans were less than successful but the w10a reportedly benefits technologically from lykulkasaturn al31f turbofans imported from russia to power the su27 su30 and earlier j10 aircraft furthermore the shenyang engine research institute developed chinas first indigenous aeroderivative gas turbine in 2002 the qd128 derived from the kunlun jet engine and chinese companies are actively pursuing development of larger aeroderivative gas turbines for electrical power generation and other industrial applications success with the w10a turbofan and these aeroderivative initiatives could provide significant boost to chinese marine gas turbine development and help fill the persistent void in indigenous propulsion technology that has thus far hampered naval modernization109 separate set of observe rs stated in 2005 that although china is designing and buildin g increasingly sophisticated warships chinese naval shipbuilders still need to import key components or modules such as propulsion systems navigation and nsor suites and major weapon systems to outfit these vessels such reliance on imported subsystems creates systemsintegration challenges as well as security concerns stemming from dependence on foreign suppliers china appears to be improving its ability to absorb imported equipment and technologies but it will take time before these and other problems are overcome110 these observers also stated in 2005 that the capabilities of most of chinas current naval sam and ssm systems and much of its naval electronics are limited and not equivalent to us capabilities or those of other asian militaries the limited range and accuracy of chinese ssms and sams create serious problems for airdefense and antisubmarinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs44 111 2005 rand report p 139140 on pages 153154 the report similarly states that chinese combatants lack longrange airdefense systems modern anti submarine warfare asw weapons and advanced electronic warfare capab ilities needed to outfit its new ships chinas other defense sectors have been slow to produce modern versions of these crucial technologies beyond copies or modifications of soviet or western syst ems for example chinese firms have experienced several delays in the indigenous production of medium and longrange sam system for naval area defense which has complicated the completion of some naval projects this situation is changing as chinas defenseindustrial complex modernizes but some past weaknesses persist and over the medium term they will continue to constrain chinas ability to project and sustain naval power for extended periods in the coming decadewarfare many of these systems also do not operate with overthehorizon targeting further degrading their alreadylimited capabilities furthermore few if any advances were made in the development and production of naval propulsion or naviga tion equipment in the 1980s or 1990s this lack continues to be major weakness in chinas domestic naval production efforts and one that the plans heavy reliance on foreign subsystems for its secondgeneration vessels testifies to111 regarding the combat system equipment on chinas new destroyers one observer stated in 2004 the ships new sensors missiles and combat systems are mainly of russian and western origin however china now is faced with the challenge of operating and maintaining these advanced systems to create credible threat to foreign navies in far eastern waters every piece of equipment on chinas sovremennyclass destroyers from hull mechanical and electrical hme technol ogies to guns sonar communications electronic countermeasures ecm and ssiles are totally new to the plan for these ships china is dependent on russian advisers for training operations and maintenance these ships largely remain in the russian support cocoon in dinghai rather than at fleet base isolation from other ships and crews hur ts fleet integration and coordinated operations it is coincidence that the sovremnyi and kilo submarine home bases are in an enclave of russian suppor t in an isolated area near the eastern fleet headquarters at ningbo it is unlikely that russian advisers would be onboard during actual combat operations against taiwan and us navy air surface and subsurface threats plan officers and crew are not expected to be able to handle operations when under fire sustaining hits and suffering sy stem degradation or loss this could include problems in night or rough weat her environment as well because all of the combat systems except for three noted are modern russian equipments china has minimal capability even to repair peacetime losses in port comparison of the aaw system on the

integrated maritime operations and nuclear counterattacks the navy and air force have cut some ship groups and aviation divisions regiments and stations and set up some hightech surface ship aviation and groundtoair missile units the navy is working to build itself into modern maritime force of operation consisting of combined arms with both nuclear and conventional means of operations taking informationization as the goal and strategic focus in its modernization drive the navy gives high priority to the development of maritime information systems and newgeneration weaponry and equipment efforts are being made to improve maritime battlefield capabilities with emphasis on the construction of relevant facilities for new equipment and the development of combat support capabilities the navy is endeavoring to build mobile maritime troops capable of conducting operations under cond itions of informationization and strengthen its overall capabilities of operations in coastal waters

office of naval intelligence stated in september 2004 the commander of the plan admiral zhang dingfa became the first plan commander ever to rve concurrently as member of the ccp central committees

general equi pment department ged the plan as an organization is not equal to the four general departments and is still at the same grade as the seven military regions117 another set of observers states in recent years senior chinese communist party ccp leaders and highranking military officers have repeatedly emphasized the importance of naval modernization most prominently ccp general secretary president and central military commission cmc chairman hu jintao in december 2006 speech to peoples liberation army navy plan officers underscored the need to build powerful peoples navy that ca n adapt to its historical mission during new century and new period international herald tribune december 26 2006 similarly plan commander wu shengli and political commissar hu yanlin promoted the importance of na val modernization in an article that appeared in the authoritative ccp journal seeking truth this growing sense of urgency about naval modernization appears to be function of increasing concern about maritime security issues particularly taiwan the protection of maritime resources and energy security118 another observer stated in 2007 if there had been any doubts about chinas plans to develop into major naval power they were dispelled by president hu jintao on 27 december 2006 in his speech to representatives of the navys 10th national communist party congress in beijing he said in the pr ocess of protecting the nations authority and security and maintaining our maritime rights the navys role is very important he called on military commanders to build powerful peoples navy that can adapt to its historical mission during new century and new period while adding that the navy s hould be ready to protect the countrys interests at any time two years after the promotion of the commanderin chief admiral zhang dingfa to full seat on the central military commission the navys evolution from being coastal force to one that is at the centre of chinese strategy is now assured119 nearterm focus taiwan situation dod and other observers believe that the nearterm focus of chinas military modernization is to develop military options for addressing the situation w

force or war options in which china might use variety of lethal punitive or disruptive military actions in limited campaign against taiwan likely in conjunction with overt and clandestine economic and political activities such campaign could include cna computer ne twork attack against taiwans political military and economic infrast ructure to target the taiwan peoples confidence in their leadership similarly pla special operations forces infiltrated into taiwan could c onduct economic political or military sabotage or attacks against leadership targets an air and missile campaign in which limited srbm attacks and precision strikes against air defens systems including air bases radar sites missiles space asse ts and communications facilities could support campaign to degrad taiwans defenses neutralize taiwans military and political leadership and possibly break the taiwan peoples will to fight maritime quarantine or blockade in which beijing could declare that ships route to taiwan ports must stop in mainland ports for safety inspections prior to transiting on to taiwan it could also attempt the equivalent of blockade by declaring exercise or missile closure areas in approaches to ports with the effect of closing port access and diverting merchant traffic as occurred during the 199596 missile firings and liv efire exercises and an amphibious invasion

amphibious operations short of fullscale invasion of taiwan with few overt military preparations beyond seasonally routine amphibious training china could launch an invasion of small taiwanheld island such as pratas or itu aba such limited invasion of lightly defended island could demonstrate military capability and political resolve would achieve tangible territorial gain and could be portrayed as showing some measure of restraint however such an operation includes significant if not prohibitive political risk as it could galvanize the taiwan populace and generate international opposition pla invasion of mediumsized defended offshore island such as mazu or jinmen while within chinas capabilitie s would involve logistic and military preparation well beyond routine training largescale amphibious invasion is one of the most complicated and logisticsintensive and therefore diffi cult military maneuvers success depends upon air and sea supremacy in the vici nity of the operation rapid buildup of supplies and sustainment on shore nd an uninterrupted flow of support thereafter an invasion of taiwan w ould strain the capabilities of chinas untested armed forces and would almost certainly invite international intervention these stresses combined with the combat attrition of chinas forces the complex tasks of urban warfare and counterinsurgency assuming successful landing and breakout make an amphibious invasion of taiwan significant political and military risk for chinas leaders modest targeted investments by taiwan to harden in frastructure and strengthen defensive capabilities could have measurable effects on decreasing beijings ability to achieve its objectives122 antiaccess force for shortduration conflict more specifically some observers believe that chinas military modernization is aimed at fielding force that can succeed in shortduration conflict consistent with this goal some observers believe china wants its modernized military to be capable of acting as socalled antiaccess force force that can deter u s intervention or failing that delay the arrival or reduce the effectiveness of us intervention forces par ticularly us naval and air forces dod states that some analysts hold that beijing first would pursue measured judicious and deliberate approach characterized by sign aling its readiness to use force in an attempt to coerce taiwan followed by deliberate buildup of force which would optimize speed of engagement over strategic deception others assess that the more likely course of action would be for china to sacrifice

countries could respond if quick resolution is not possible beijing would s eek to deter potential us intervention or failing that delay such intervention seek to defeat it in an asymmetric limited or quick war or fight to standstill and pursue political settlement after protracted conflict123 dod also states that as part of its planning for taiwan contingency china is prioritizing measures to deter or counter thirdpart intervention in any future crossstrait crisis chinas approach to dealing with this challenge centers on what dods 2006 quadrennial defense review refers to as disr uptive capabilities forces and operational concepts aimed at deterring or denying the entry of enemy forces into theater of operations antiacce ss and limited duration denial of enemy freedom of action in theater of operations area denial in this context the pla appears engaged in sustained effort to develop the capability to interdict or attack at long ranges military forces particularly air or maritime forces that might deploy or operate within the western pacific increasingly chinas antiaccessarea denial forces overlap providing multiple layers of offensive systems utilizing the sea air space and cyberspace pla planners are focused on targeting surface ships at long ranges from chinas shores analyses of current nd projected force structure improvements suggest that china is seeking the capac ity to hold surface ships at risk through layered capability r eaching out to the second island chain ie the islands extending south and east from japan to nd beyond guam in the western pacific ocean one area of investment involves combining conventionallyarmed asbms based on the css5 df21 airframe c4isr for geolocation and tracking of targets and onboard guidance systems for terminal homing to strike surface ships on the high seas or their onshore support infrastructure this capability would have particular significance as it would provide china with preemptive and coercive options in regional crisis prc military analysts have also concluded that logistics and mobilization are potential vulnerabilities in modern warfare given the requirements for precision in coordinating transportation communications and logistics networks to threaten regional bases and logistics points china could employ srbmmrbms landattack cruise missiles special operations forces and

miles from its coastline and by 2010 may be able to sustain such operations for few weeks obviously this capability does not accrue to the straits of malacca and the indian ocean china can at best

su30mk2 fighters armed with as17kh31a antiship missiles acquisition of an air refueling platform like the russian il78 would extend operational ranges for plaaf and pla navy strike aircraft armed with precision munitions thereby increasing the threat to surface and air forces bases and logistics nodes distant from chinas coast additionally acquisition and development of longerrange unm anned aerial vehicles uavs and unmanned combat aerial vehicles ucavs including the israeli harpy expands chinas options for longr ange reconnaissance and strike124 regarding the potential time line for s hortduration conflict with taiwan one observer stated in 2005 that the us particularly the us pacific commandpacom seems to want taiwan to focus on acquiring systems and defensive operational capabilities that would lengthen the amount of time taiwan could deny the prc from gaining air superiority sea control and physical occupation of taiwans leadership core namely taipei the idea is to permit sufficient time to bring us forces to bear the amount of time needed is unders tood to be at least 5 days presumably after credible warning that hostilities ither are imminent or are already underway125 chinas emerging maritime antiaccess force can be viewed as broadly analogous to the seadenial force that the soviet union developed during the cold war to deny us use of the sea or counter us forces participating in nato warsaw pact conflict one potential difference between the soviet seadenial force and chinas emerging maritime antiaccess force is that chinas force could include asbms

longerterm goals would be potentially significant for at least three reasons first they imply that if the situation with taiwan were somehow resolved china could find continuing r easons to pursue its naval modernization effort second they would imply that if ch ina completes its planned buildup of taiwanrelated naval force elements or if the situation with taiwan were somehow resolved the composition of chinas nava l modernization effort could shift to include greater emphasis on naval force ements that would be appropriate for supporting these broader or longerterm intere sts such as aircra ft carriers larger number of nuclearpowered attack submar ines serial production of destroyers underway replenishment ships and overseas bases or support facilities third such broader or longerterm goal s would suggest that even if chinas military were never to engage in comb at with an opposing military chinas military forces including in particular its naval forces could still be used on daytoday basis to promote chinas po litical pos ition in the pacific this would create an essentially political as opposed to combat related reason for the united states or other countries to maintain competitive pr esence in the region with naval and other forces that are viewed by obs ervers in the pacifi c as capable of effectively countering chinas forces dod states that chinas nearterm focus on preparin g for contingencies in the taiwan strait including the possibility of us in tervention is an important driver of its modernization however analysis of chinas military acquisitions and strategic thinking suggests beijing is also developing capabilities for use in other contingencies such as conflict over resources or disputed territories129 dod also states

intelligence p 10chinas military appears focused on assuring the capability to prevent taiwan independence and if beijing were to decide to adopt such an approach to compel the island to negotiate settlement on beijings terms at the same time china is laying the foundation for force able to accomplish broader regional and global objectives130 at june 25 2008 hearing before th house armed services committee on recent security developments regarding china the two witnesses both from dod were asked about the meaning of chinas military modernization effort particularly the development of its bluewater navy131 one of the witnesses replied we have observed definite longterm trend of chinese investment in naval expansion and not just quantity but sophi stication and quality it remains unclear to us what the longterm intent of the use of that naval force would be we do not know if they intend or they might intend to use it in some way to assure themselves of energy security thats possibility but we just dont know132 the other witness replied sir in the little bit of time we have left i would say that it would be hard to construe an aircraft carrier as being purely defensive weapon i believe that some of the things we see china doing like pursuing an aircraft carrier presuming some of the other longerrange capabilities that they have conventional capabilities clearly indicate that they have aspirations beyond the shores of taiwan i wouldnt use the terms that you did about taking over the entire world i think theyre very pragmatic and are looking at their economic zone that they consider133 in january 2007 the director of national intelligence stated beijing continues its rapid rate of military modernization initiated in 1999 we assess that chinas aspirations for great power status thr eat perceptions and security strategy would drive this modernization effort even if the taiwan problem were resolved134httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs55 135 2008 dod cmp pp 10 1213regarding chinas economic interests dod states that as chinas economy grows dependence on secure access to markets and natural resources particularly metals and fossil fuels is becoming more significant factor shaping chinas strategic behavior china currently consumes approximately 758 million barrels of oil per day and since 2003 has been the worlds third largest importer of oil and second largest consumer after the united states china currently imports over 53 percent of its oil around 404 million barrels per day in the first three quarters of 2007 with the vast majority coming by ship and transiting through the malacca or lombokmakkasar straits by 2015 chinas oil consumption will rise to 1012 million barrels per day china is also working with russia to develop the east siberiapacific ocean il pipeline with 16 million barrels per day capacity to ensure chinas continued access to russian oil and reduce dependence on seaborne shipping for oil imports the extent to which beijings concerns over the security of its access to energy supplies shapes chinas defense policy and force planning is not known however it is apparent that these concerns influence chinas thinking about the problems of defense planning chinas 2006 defense white paper states explicitly in its description of the security envi ronment that security issues related to energy resources finance information and international shipping routes are mounting it also defines the plas primary tasks as upholding national security and unity and ensuring the interests of national development the pla appears to be debating how to translate these tasks into doctrinal evolution resource allocations force structure changes and contingency planning however as chinas current ab ility to project and sustain power at distance remains limited the pla at leas t for the near and midterms will face an ambitioncapability gap currently it is neither capable of using military power to secure its foreign energy invest ments nor of defending critical sea lanes against disruption looking to the future chinas leaders may seek to close this gap by developing extendedrange power pr ojection including aircraft carrier development expeditionary warfare undersea warfare antiair warfare longrange precision strike maritime c4isr exped itionary logistics and forward basing training and exercises especia lly in open water and more activist military presence abroad135 regarding territorial di sputes dod states that since 1998 china has settled eleven territorial disputes with six of its neighbors however disputes continue over exclusive ec onomic zones eez and ownership of potentially rich oil and ga s deposits including some 7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and up to 100 billion barrels of oil in the east china sea which has contributed to friction with ja pan japan maintains that an equidistant line should separate the eezs while chin claims an extended continental

ning 41 fishermen and in july pla navy ship fired on vietnamese fishing vessels reportedly sinking one ship killing fisherman and injuring several others136 regarding investments relating to broader or longerterm goals dod states that china continues to invest in military programs designed to improve extendedrange power projection current trends in chinas military capabilities are major factor in changing east asian military balances and could provide china with force capable of prosecutin g range of military operations in asia well beyond taiwan given the apparent absence of direct threats from other nations the purposes to which chinas current and future military power will be applied remain unknown these capabilities will increase beijings options for military coercion to press diplomatic adva ntage advance interests or resolve disputes in its favor official documents and the writings of pla military strategists suggest beijing is increasingly surveying the strategic landscape beyond taiwan some pla analysts have explored the geopolitical value of taiwan in extending chinas maritime defensive perimeter and improving its ability to influence regional sea lines of communication analysis of chinas weapons acquisitions also suggests china is looking beyond taiwan as it builds its force fo r example new missile units outfitted with conventional theaterrange missiles at various locations in china could be used in variety of nontaiwan contingencies aewc and aerialrefueling programs would permit extended air operations into the south china sea and beyond

that what the chinese navy the pla navy is doing is developing blue water navy that allows them to in fluence and control events in the western pacific in around some of the critical straits and into the indian ocean that is the navy they are building they are very unabashed about the fact that they are building blue water navy that will operate out to the first island chain as they refer and as we have seen throughout histor and as we have seen in our own country over the course of our nations hi story that we are maritime nation and our navy and marine corps and coast guard are the maritime forces that can influence events in that maritime domain they also see as do other countries the importance of navies to assure their security and their prosperity and that is what is going on and we as navy marine corps and coast guard must so value our navy and what it takes to be global navy to be able to influence events in ways that are advantageous to our country138 2007 report by task force

taiwan operations it was its wider role that was emphasised the navy aims at gradual extension of the strategic depth for offshore defensive operations and enhancing its capabilities in integrated

submarines ssns the successful development of the ssns would allow the plan to deter wouldbe disrupters of chinese energy supplies the majority of which are transported by sea moreover sealane security presents rationale for the development of an aircraft carrier type of ship that would serve only as an easy target in taiwan scenario where chinas landbased airfields are more than sufficient but would allow for the chin military to project its power across maritime regions far beyond the range of landbased aircraft indeed these developments indicate that chinas senior leaders and strategists are increasingly concerned w ith traditional and nontraditional threats eg piracy smuggling terrorism and other disruptions by nonstate actors to ocean commerce141 some pla navy units in

deployment of us navy forces in the area maintaining standing forward deployment of us navy forces in the area while also maintaining us navy forward deployments in other regions such as the persian gulfindian ocean region and the mediterranean sea would require navy with certain minimum number of ships although it is sometimes said that it ta kes three ushome ported navy ships to keep one ship forward deployed in an overseas location the actual ratio traditionally has been higher for example if us navy ships are operated in the traditional manner with single crew for each ship and deployments lasting six months then maintaining one us navy cruiser or destroyer continuously forwarddeployed to the we stern pacific might require total of about five san diegobased cruisers or destroyers154 stationkeeping multipliers like these can be reduced by homeporting us navy ships at locations closer to taiwan s uch as japan guam hawaii or perhaps singapore or by deploying ships for longer periods of time and operating them with multiple crews that are rotated out to each ship the navy has an aircraft carrier strike group amphibious ships and mine warfare ships homeported in japan and three attack submarines homeported in guam the navy has also experimented with the concept of deploying certain navy ships particularly surface combatants for 12 18 or 24 months and rotating multiple crews out to each ship155 navy cruise missile submarines ssgns that are homeported in bangor washington are to be operated out of guam with dual crews that each ro tate out from bangor each

to 25 knots or less due rough sea conditions or in the case of the cruisers or destroyers which are conventionally powered the need slow down for atsea refueling the navys littoral combat ships lcss are to have maximum sustained speed of about 45 knots but their average speed over long transits would likely be less than that as can be seen in the table yokosuka guam and singapore are less than

one aircraft carrier fulltime in the western pacific in the event of conflict with china over taiwan however particularly given the various pla threats to landbased air outlined above having more aircraft carriers on the scene will be extr emely valuable other than any carriers that might be transiting through the regi on however currently the closest additional carriers would be those based on the west coast of the united states given that conflict with china could be gin with little warning this means that as much as two weeks could elapse before additional aircraft carriers reached the area of combat operations the partment of defense has already recommended forwarddeploying an additiona l aircraft carrier in the pacific but it is important to note that precisely where this carrier is forwarddeployed is significant in particular an aircraft carrier based in hawaii would still take at least week to reach waters near taiwan an aircraft carrier based in guam singapore or elsewhere in the western pa cific by contrast could arrive on the scene in about three days161httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs67 162 for list of recommended actions for im proving the ability of bases in the

capabilities for maintaining regional presence and influence for the us navy maintaining regional presence and military influence in the western pacific could place premium on the following among

to ensure system compatibility between us navy ships and ships of allied and friendly nations in the region and conducting frequent exchanges betw een us navy personnel and military and political leaders of other countries in the region factors influencing the navys ability to maintain substantial us navy ship presence throughout the region include the total number of ships in the navys

assessing the adequacy of the 313ship proposal key potential issue for congress is whether it includes enough ship s to address potential challenges posed by chinas naval moderniza tion while also

as the mediterranean sea the caribbean th waters around south america and the waters off west africa if increased numbe rs of navy ships are needed to address potential challenges posed by chinas na val modernization fewer ships might be available for meeting other responsibilities some members of congress have expre ssed concern in recent years that the declining total number of ships in the navy may make it difficult for the navy to perform all if its various missions at least not without putting undue stress on navy personnel and equipment navy official s have responded that the proposed 313ship navy would be sufficient to perform the navys various peacetime and wartime missions pacific fleets share of the navy should greater percentage of the navy be assigned to the pacific

in light of the transfer in 2007 of about 20 additional ships to the pacific fleet potential oversight question for congress is whether the navys steps to increase the pacific fleets sh are of the total navy are inade quate excessive or about right forward homeporting in the western pacific is the navy moving quickly nough to forwar dhomeport add itional ships in the western pacific should the navy expand the number of additional ships it is thinking of homeporting in the area increasing the number of ships forward homeported in the western pacific can increase both the number of ships that the navy can maintain forwarddeployed to that area on day to day basis and the number that can arrive in the early stages of conflict in the western pacific including the taiwan strait area expanding the number of ships to be homeported in the western pacific could require construction of additional homepor ting and support facilitie s particularly in locations such as guam transferring ships from the us west coast to the western pacific can also have implications for crew training and ship maintenance for those ships 2002 congressional budget office c bo report discussed the option of homeporting as many as 11 ssns at guam174 compared with the 3 that are currently homeported there in april 2007 it was re ported that the navy was considering transferring group of three amphibious sh

continuing decline in its size as one article from peoples republic of china prc navalinterest publication states t he decline of us submarine strength is inevitable indeed that wide variety of chinese naval sources share this evaluation suggests that this decline now passes for conventional wisdom within the pla navy the chinese naval community is likely paying close attention to internal us debates k nowing that investments made or forgone today in submarine fleet modernization shape the future fleet taking the long view chinese naval strategists recognize that force levels have dropped drastically from cold war levels one source observes since 1989 the us navys nuclearpowered attack submarine force has been reduced by half more recent chinese naval press article estimates that us nuclear attack submarines will decline in number by close to 40 eventually reaching 30 boats this calculation is roughly consistent with projection in modern navy that anticipated sustained build rate of one boat per year rear admiral yang yi writing in 2006 on the future size of the american submarine force quoted one american analysis as follows china already exceeds us submarine production five times over 18 usn submarines against 75 or more chinese navy submarines is obviously not encouraging from the us perspective183httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs77 184 see for example

deactivated substantial number of aswcapable ships and aircraft including spruance dd963 class destroyers oliver hazard perry ffg7 class frigates tagostype ocean surve illance ships carrierbased s3 airplanes and landbased p3 maritime patrol aircraft since asw traditionally has been platformintensive undertaking meaning that significant number of platforms eg ships and aircraft trad itionally has been required to conduct an effective asw operation against small number of enemy submarines or even single submarine some observers have expressed concern about the resulting decline in numbers of us navy aswcapable platforms184 as discussed below in the section on as w the navy plans to shift to new less platformintensive asw concept of operations the navy also plans to introduce new aswcapable platforms in coming years including littoral combat ships lcss the navys proposal for 313ship fleet includes 55 lcss fully realizing the new asw concept of operations however may take some time particularly in light of the technical challenges involved and lcss will not be available in large numbers for several years this raises potential question of whether the navy will have enough aswcap able ships over the next several years and whether the navy should reactivate r ecently retired aswcapable platforms and keep them in service until the new asw concept is substantially implemented and larger numbers of lcss and other new aswcapable platforms join the fleet advocates of this option could argue that the recent retirements of asw capable platforms occurred before the d imensions of the pla navy submarine modernization effort were fully underst ood opponents could argue that even with these recent retirements the navy retains substantial number of such platforms including ssns aegis cruisers and destroye rs remaining oliver hazard perry ffg 7 class frigates carrier and surface combatantbased sh60 helicopters and remaining p3s they could also argue that there are more costeffective ways to improve the navys asw capabilities over the next several years such as increased asw training and exercise s see discussion below fleet architecture larger vs smaller ships should the navy shift over time to more highly di stributed fleet architecture featuring reduced reliance on larger ships and an increased reliance on smaller ships some observers viewing the

see crs report rl33741 navy littoral combat ship lcs program background oversight i ssues and options for congress by ronald orourkehighly distributed fleet architecture featuring reduced reliance on carriers and other large ships and an increased reliance on smaller ships185 the question of whether the us navy concentrates too much of its combat capability in relatively small number of highvalue units and whether it should shift over time to more highly distributed fleet architecture has been debated at various times over the years in various contexts much of the discussion concerns whether the navy should start procuring sm aller aircraft carrier s as complements or replacements for its current large aircraft carriers supporters of shifting to more highly distributed fleet ar chitecture argue that that the navys current architecture including its force of 11 or 12 large aircraft carriers in effect puts too many of the navys combatcapability eggs into relatively small number of baskets on which an adversary can concentrate its surveillance and targeting systems and its antiship weapons they argue that although large navy aircraft carrier ca n absorb hits from multiple conventional weapons without sinking smaller numbe r of enemy weapons might cause damage sufficient to stop the carriers aviation operations thus eliminating the ships primary combat capability and providing the attacker with what is known as mission kill more highly distributed fleet architecture they argue would make it more difficult for china to target the navy and reduce the possibility of the navy experiencing significant reduction in combat capability due to the loss in battle of relatively small number of highvalue units opponents of shifting to more highly distributed fleet ar chitecture argue that large carriers and other large ships are not only more capable but proportionately more capable than smaller ships that larger ships are capable of fielding highly capable systems for defending themselves and that they are much better able than smaller ships to withstand the effects of enemy weapons due to their larger size extensive armoring and interior compartmentalization and extensive damagecontrol systems more highly distributed fleet architecture they argue would be less capable or more expensive than todays fl eet architecture opponents of shifting to more highly distributed fleet architecture argue could also argue that the navy has already taken an important but not excessive step toward fieldi ng more distributed fleet architecture through its plan to acquire 55 littoral combat ships lcss which are small fast surface combatants w ith modular plugandflight mission payloads186 the issue of navy fleet architecture including the

counterattack on lockheed martins claim that the decreasing price of the f22 which is now at 140 million each will make it so attractive that australia may reconsider its buy already being paid for of 24 twoseat fa18f super hornets until australias recent change in government number of us officials said the government was considering second lot of 24 super hornets and si xplane squadron of ea18g growlers boeing makes the argument that sliding inservice date for the jsf is worrying both the australians and the us military the us air force and navy are now talking lot more about where they need to go with sixth generation to get beyond jsf gower says it could be unmanned but i think you will see combination of missions some manned some unmanned for boeing the real discriminators are going to be extended range 10001500 miles small radar signature against lowfrequency radars expanded awareness through connections with the network and the ability to carry number of bombs internally209 an august 2008 rand study raises num ber of questions about the ability of us tactical aircraft includi ng aircraft as s ophisticated as the air forces new f22 fighter to successfully counter larger num bers of chinese aircraft in scenario centered on the taiwan strait210 an october 2008 pre ss report about the study states new rand study suggests us air power in the pacific would be inadequate to thwart chinese attack on taiwan in 2020 the study entitled air combat past present and future by john stillion and scott perdue says chinas antiaccess arms and strategy could deny the us the ability to operate efficiently from nearby bases or seas according to the study us aircra ft carriers and air bases would be threatened by chinese development of an tiship ballistic missiles the fielding of diesel and nuclear submarines equi pped with torpedoes and ssn22 and ssn27 antiship cruise missiles ascms fighters and bombers carrying ascms and harms and new ballistic missiles and cruise missiles the report states that 34 missiles with submunition warheads could cover all parking ramps at kadena air force base okinawahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs90 an attack like this could damage destroy or strand 75 percent of aircraft based at kadena it says in contrast many chinese air bases are harder than kadena with some superhard underground hangers to make matters worse kadena is the only us air base within 500 nautical miles of the taiwan strait whereas china has 27 us air bases in south korea are more than 750 miles distant and those in japan are more than 885 miles away anderson air force base guam is 1500 miles away the result is that sortie rates will be low with huge tanker demand the authors suggest chinas cetc y27 radar which is similar to russias nebo svu vhf digital aesa could count er us stealth fighter technology china is likely to outfit its fighters with improved radars and by 2020 even very stealthy targets likely would be detectable by flanker radars at 25 nm china is also likely to procure the new su35bm fighter by 2020 which will challenge the f35 and possibly the f22 the authors also question the reliability of us beyondvisualrange weapons such as the aim120 amraam u s fighters have recorded only 10 aim120 kills none against targets equipped with the kinds of countermeasures carried by chinese su27s and su30s of the 10 six were beyondvisualrange kills and it required 13 missiles to get them if conflict breaks out between china and the us over taiwan the authors say it is difficult to predict who will have had the last move in the measurecountermeasure game overall the authors say china could enjoy 31 edge in fighters if we can fly from kadena about 101 if forced to operate from andersen overcoming these odds requires qualitative superiority of 91 or 1001 differential that is extremely difficult to achieve against like power if beyondvisualrange missiles work stealth technology is not countered and air bases are not destroyed us forces have chance but history suggests there is limit of about 31 where quality can longer compensate for superior enemy numbers 24aircraft su2730 regiment can carry around 300 airtoair missiles aams whereas 24 f22s can carry only 192 aams and 24 f35s only 96 aams though current numbers assume the f22 could shoot down 48 chinese flankers when outnumbered 121 without loss these numbers do not take into account lessthanperfect us beyondvisualrange performance partial or complete destruction of us air bases and aircraft carriers possible deployment of new chinese stealth fighter around 2020 or 20 25 and the possible use of chinese robofighters to deplete us f ighters missile loadout prior to mass attackhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs91 211 wendell minnick rand study

airpower would be sufficient to def eat nearpeer competitor in the asiapacific region over the next seven ye ars provided strategy of dispersal was adopted and certain investments are made for the nearpeer competitor in the wargame called pacific vision read china air force officers cautione d however that an adversary could also be resurgent russia in any case the war game was intended not only to test strategic plans but to deter china and russia from miscalculating us power and intentions priority for us commanders in this region in contrast to pacific air forces upbeat assessment the publication defense news reported this week that study by rand the research organization in california suggested that us airpower in the pacific would be inadequate to thwart chinese attack on taiwan in 2020 among the conclusions drawn from th weeklong pacific vision were dispersal before hostilities begin us fighters bombers and aerial tankers should be dispersed to bases ong an arc anchored in alaska and wending south through japan and south ko rea the us territory in guam and on to southeast asia and australia sa id one officer this would complicate targeting for an adversary access starting now the us should intensify efforts to cultivate nations along that arc including treaty allies ch as japan and south korea to assure access to bases within their borders and th freedom to operate from them in the event of hostilities hardening aircraft hangars command posts electrical plants ammunition depots and supply warehouses should be hardened to withstand attack particularly from missiles rapidly be ing acquired or developed by china repair crews and equipment to repa ir damaged bases should be trained and positioned so they can move quickly to bases where they are needed airfield runways for instance would need to be repaired within hours of suffering damage tankers the aging of the air forces tankers has been documented because of long distances in the pacific more tankers would be needed to defend this region than were needed in europe to deter the soviet union during the cold warhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs92 212 richard halloran war game shows us airpower up to task honolulu advertiser october 26 2008stealth pacific vision validated the ad vantages of stealth technology that permits b2 bombers and f22 fighters to evade radar detection we are sure that we can shoot them before they can see us said staff officer communications the war game underscored the vulnerability of communications because the air force relies on unprotected commercial channels moreover china knocked down an inactive satellite in 2007 with an antisatellite missile integration the us navys aircraft ca rriers and submarines armed with cruise missiles would need to be dispersed just like landbased aircraft the navy was represented in the war game but air force officers said more work was needed to fully integrate war plans intelligence pacific vision confirmed the need for global hawk the large unmanned reconnaissance plane that can fly long way covering 40000 square miles day in all weather the first of three global hawks is due to be stationed on guam next year cyber warfare players in the war game discovered that the us has lagged in cyber warfare which includes all manner of electronic operations from jamming enemy radar to attacking computer networks as well as protecting us radar and computers china has emphasized cyber operations control the air operations center in the 13th air force which is next door to and part of pacific air forces has been up and running for two years pacific air forces and 13th air force fight the aerial war in asia and the pacific through this center which still needs to improve controls over pacific air forces widely dispersed forces after pacific air forces officers have digested the lessons learned in pacific vision they plan to incorporate th em into operations and to feed them to air force trainers pacific air

littoral combat ship lcs aaw capability should the currently planned aaw capability of the littoral combat ship lcs be increased the navys littoral combat ship l cs is to be ar med with 11 rolling airframe missiles rams the ship will also be equipped with an aaw decoy launcher222 the plas acquisition of ascms that can be fired from aircraft surface ships and submarines raises the possibility that lcss participating in conflict in the taiwan strait area could come under attack by substantial numbers of ascms other navy ships such as aegis cruise rs and destroyers and in the future ddg 1000 destroyers and cgxs cruisers coul d help defend lcss against attacking ascms but such ships might not always be in the best position to do this particularly if ascms are launched at lcss from undetected submarines or if the supporting us navy ships are busy performin g other duties if lcss were damaged or sunk by ascms the navys ability to counter enemy mines submarines and small boats the lcss three prima ry missions would be reduced the possibility that the lcss aaw system might be overwhelmed or exhausted by attacks from multiple ascms raises the question of whether the aaw capability planned for the lcs should be increased options for increasing the lcss planned aaw capability include among other things adding another 11 round ram launcher or supplementing the cu rrently planned ra m launcher with battery of evolved sea sparrow essm ssiles in assessing such options one factor to consider would be whether installing additional rams or essms would require an increase in the planned size and cost of the lcs antisubmarine warfare asw countering substantial number of pla submarines would likely require coordina ted effort by an asw network consisting of some

sending one sub to defeat another sub because that is not cost effective rear admiral john waickwicz chief of fleet antisubmarine warfare command told inside the navy for example the new virginiaclass subs cost about 2 billion each while advanced diesel subs cost hundreds of millions of dollars each instead of force on force asw tactics will emphasize using networked sensors and communications to allow one platform like sub littoral combat ship or aircraft to defeat multiple di esel subs he said you have to be able to destroy them at very large rate because potential enemies may have large number of subs he explained we dont have that l uxury to go one against one anymore he added noting that individual asw platforms will rely on their greater capability to take on multiple subs jason

dependent on the proficiency of the people operating the asw equipment asw operational proficiency can take time to develop and can atrophy significantly if not regularly exercised in december 2004 the navy approved new concept of operations conops new general approach to as w as describe d in one article the navys new concept of operations for antisubmarine warfare calls for the use of standoff weapons networked nsor fields and unmanned vehicles to detect and attack diesel submarines in littoral waters rather than reliance on force on force engagements chief of naval operations adm vern clark approved the conops dec 20 according to navy spokesman the fivepage document will guide the development of comprehensive asw master plan that is expected to be classified though it might have an unclassified version the conops envisions hundreds or thousands of small sensors that would permeate the operating environment yielding unprecedented situational awareness and highly detailed pictures of the battlespace attack submarines that today carry sensors and weapons could in the future provide logistical support to and serve as command and control bases for offboard sensors and kill vehicles the conops states the networking of autonomous sensor fields with manned and unmanned vehicles will change asw from platformintensive to sensorrich operation it adds224httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs97 225 transcript of conference as posted on the internet by aei at httpwwwaeiorgevents filteralleventid1051transcriptasp an october 2004 article statedmore than just improving antisubmarine operations clarks goal is to fundamentally change asw operations away from individual platforms ship submarine or aircraft to syst em with the attributes of pervasive awareness persistence and speed all enabled by technological agility to meet this goal we think were going to have to go offboard of our platforms using unmanned aerial rface and underwater vehicles and network of distributed sensors to provid the identification and localization that would allow quick transition to the atta ck rear admiral mark w kenny the flag officer in charge of task force asw said thats what were focused on finding high number of quiet contacts in demanding environment with timeline that requires us to gain access quickly the task force has tested those concepts in atsea experiments focused on distributive systems which could be an array of easily deployed underwater sensors passive and active networked together and linked to manned platforms he explained among them is the advanced deployable system which the program executive office for integrated warfare systems currently is studying along with such other aswrelated concepts as multisensor torpedo recognition and alertment function segment previously known as torpedo recognition and alertment function processor and the multifunction towed array to improve detection and tracking capability otto kreisher as

vernon clark who was the chief of naval operations cno until july 22 2005 stated the chinese are building submarines at rapid rate theyre buying them from other countries theyre building their own capabilities and let just to make long story short i published new asw concept of operations couple of months ago i fundamentally dont believe that the old attrition warfare force on force antisubmarine wa rfare construct is the right way to go in the 21st century the questioner mentioned that i had spent part of my past life in the submarine warfare business i have i trailed the soviets around i know what thats about and what i re ally believe is going to happen in the future is that when we apply the netted force construct in antisubmarine warfare it will change the calculus in that area of warfighting forever and it will be courageous commander who decides that hes going to come waltzing into our network225 implementing this new asw concept of operations reportedly will

systems on us navy ships and aircraft raises potential question regarding the adequacy of the navys efforts to harden its systems against emp effects 2004 commission studying the em p issue expressed concerns about the potential vulnerability of us tactical forces to emp235httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs103 increasing dependence on advanced electronics systems results in the potential for an increased emp vulnerability of our technologically advanced forces and if unaddressed makes emp employment by an adversary an attractive asymmetric option the united states must not permit an emp attack to defeat its capability to prevail the commission believes it is not practical to protect all of the tactical forces of the us and its coalition partners from emp in regional conflict strategy of replacement and reinforcemen t will be necessary however there is set of critical capabilities that is essentia l to tactical regional conflicts that must be available to these reinforcements this set includes satellite navigation systems satellite and airborne intelligen ce and targeting systems an adequate communications infrastructure and missile defense the current capability to field tac tical force for regional conflict is inadequate in light of this requirement even though it has been us policy to create emphardened tactical systems the strategy for achieving this has been to use the dod acquisition process this has provided many equipment components that meet criteria for durability in an emp environment but this does not result in confidence that fiel ded forces as system can reliably withstand emp attack adherence to th equipment acquisition policy also has been spotty and the huge challenge of organizing and fielding an empdurable tactical force has been disincentive to applying the rigor and discipline needed to do so pages 4748the commissions report was received at july 22 2004 hearing before the house armed services committee at the hearing representative steve israel asked about the role of emp in exercises s imulating operations in the taiwan strait representative steve israel representative roscoe bartlett and i just attended an ndu national defense university tabletop exercise with respect to the straits of the taiwan just last week to your knowledge has there been any tabletop exercise has there been any simulation any wargame that anticipates an emp attack and if there has not been do you believe that that would in fact be useful exercise for ndu the pentagon or any other relevant entity dr graham do you want to answer that dr william r graham commission chairman thank you let poll the commission and see if they have any experience with that general lawson general richard l lawson usaf ret commissioner sir graham dr wood dr lowell l

which is after all considered by china to be part of its own territory but on us forces in the region which might be involved in the active defense of taiwan in particular the consequenc the emp laydown on us carrier task forces has been explored and while its not appropriate to discuss the details inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs104 236 source transcript of hearingan open session like this the assessed consequences of such an attack singleexplosion attack are very somber since that is circumstance in which the target might be considered pure military one in which the loss of life might be relatively small but the loss of military capability might be absolutely staggering it poses very attractive option at least for consideration on the part of the chinese military i would also remark that chinese nuclear explosive workers at their very cloistered research center in northwestern china very recently published an authoritative digest and technical commentary on emp in english in chinese publication it is very difficult to understand what the purpose of publishing lengthy authoritative article in english in chinese publication would be if it was not to convey very pointed message this came not from military workers it came from the people who would be fi elding the weapon that would conduct the attack graham dr pry on our staff has made survey of foreign writings on emp and he noted that while us exer cises have not to our knowledge played that scenario chinese military writings ve discussed that scenario so its certainly something they have thought of and it is within their mind i have observed generally over the last 40 years that theres tendency in the us military not to introduce nuclear weapons in general and emp in particular into exercise scenarios or game scenarios because it tends to end the game and thats not good sign i think it would be very interesting subject for the ndu group to take up and see and force them not to end the game time will not stop if such an event happens let them understand what the consequences will be236 later in the hearing representative roscoe bartlett returned to the topic of the potential effects of emp on navy ships representative bartlett if china were to detonate weapon high over our carrier task force can we note in th is open session what would the effects on the carrier task force be graham mr bartlett several years ago the navy dismantled the one simulator it had for exposing ships directly to emp it was the empress simulator located in the chesapeake bay so i dont believe any direct experimental work has been done for quite some time however the general character of modern naval forces follows the other trends weve described which is an increasing dependence upon sophisticated electronics for its functionality and ther efore i believe theres substantial reason to be concerned would any other commissioners care to comment representative bartlett dr woodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs105 237 ibidwood in open session sir i dont believe its appropriate to go much further than the comment that i made to representative israel that the assessments that are made of such attacks and their impacts are very somber the navy generally believes that portion of the navy thats at all cognizant of these matters that because they operate in an extremely radarintensive environment since they have great deal of electromagnetic gear on board some of which radiates pulses radar pulses for instance because they can operate in that type of environment that they surely must be emp robust these

winning modern netcentric wars by the mid21st century this document implicitly suggests that china hopes to be in position to successfully challenge the united states challenge that would certainly entail bluewater operations public declarations such as this statement and many others serve as reminders that we must be prepared fo r world that does not always follow our preferences of course we hope that china will choose peaceful path but hope is not strategy so we must be prepared those who might be tempted to dismiss or discount the need to be prepared for major combat operations ought to

on which analysis you go with clearly that should be concern to ou admiral roughead replied well it is source transcript of the hearing 244 source transcript of hearinga press article reporting on an apr il 3 2007 address by admiral michael mullen then the chief of naval operations and now the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff stated that in addition to other topics the admiral also commented on the th reats that drive military spending needs for example he noted china is building new modernized navy the chinese are shifting from landcent ric forces as their main focus to aircentric and navalcentric buildups ch ina is acquiring cuttingedge aircraft new destroyers four new classes of submarines and hundreds of radarguided missiles those investments very much have our attention mullen said241 another short news artic reporting on comments made by mullen at breakfast meeting in early may 2007 stated that in response to question about the need for large navy vessels mullen told attendees that while he doesnt expect to see big sea battles the service has to be mindful of chinas naval build up c hina is very actively investing in their navy building more ships each year their building rate is much higher than ours right now he says we have to be mindful of that not to be mindful of that would be irresponsible242 at december 13 2007 hearing before the house armed services committee admiral gary roughead the current chie f of naval operations acknowledged that chinas rate of submarin production is concern243 and stated later that my judgment is that it is navy that is modernizing at rate that is exceeding what our expectations have been244 at march 6 2008 hearing before the house armed services co mmittee admiral roughead was asked by one member can you tell us what attention is being paid to the china fleet and what were doing to counterbalance that admiral roughead replied yes sir having been the pacific fleet commander and having served in the pacific for several years watching th evolution of chinas navy has been of great professional interest to and then obviously in my positions out there of great import to the navy there is stion that china is building navy thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs110 245 source transcript of hearing the questi on was asked by representative mike mcintyreis increasing in sophistication and capacity it is navy that is focusing more on being able to influence events in the regi on and then being able to move on to the global stage as i watch what they are buying what they are building thats one component of watching the pla navy but the other is their leadership and the expertise and competence of the leadershi p ive had the opportunity to meet with several of the pla navy leaders and it is clear to that they have path that they see for their navy it is path that does not necessarily end with them being threat but it is navy that i believe will have greater influence in the pacific and then also moving into the indian ocean regions the key for us is to be able to enga ge with that leadership to gauge the intent not only of the pla navy but th pla and to have relationship that allows us to see where they are taking their navy and how competent that navy is as you know we have shifted force structure into the pacific carriers and submarines but i would submit that thats not simply because of rising pla navy it is because that is part of the world that and the indian ocean region and the arabian gulf where our prosperity hi nges on and that is the reason why i believe rebalancing of the fleet into those areas where we can respond where we can be present is so important and it is from that response and presence that i am committed to the 313ship navy because of our need to be able to cover the many requirements that are there not si mply at the high end of naval capability but also to be able to work with some of the other countries245 an april 20 2008 news report stated chinese

2004 that one of the newest innovations in tbm weapons deve lopments involves the use of ballistic missiles to target ships at sea this is assessed as being very difficult because it involves much more than just missile248 oni continued the use of ballistic missiles against ships at sea has been discussed for years chinese writings state china in tends to develop the capability to attack ships including carrier strike groups in the waters around taiwan using conventional theater ballistic missiles tbms as part of combinedarms campaign the current conventional tbm force in china consists of css6 and css7 shortrange ballistic missiles srbms deployed in large numbers the current tbm force would be modified by changing some of the current missiles ballistic reentry vehicles rvs to maneuvering reentry vehicles marvs with radar or ir seekers to provide the accuracy needed to attack ships at sea the tbms with marvs would have good defense penetration capabilities because of their high reentry speed and maneuverability their lethality could be increased especially with terminally guided submunitions in order to attack ship or carrier battle group with tbms the target must be tracked and its position direction and speed determined this information would be relayed in near real time to the missile launchers china may be planning ultimately to use overthehorizon oth radar satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs to monitor the targets position reconnaissance assets would be used to detect the ship or carrier strike group before it entered into the range of ch inese tbms facilitating early preparation for the engagement and refining the ta rgets position target information would be relayed through communication satellites or other channels to command center and then to the missile launc hers tbms with marvs would then be launched at the targets projected position the missiles would fly theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs113 249 2004 oni wmc p 22 page 20 stated maneuvering reentry vehicles serve two purposes one to provide an unpredictable target to complicate missile defense efforts and the other potentially to adjust missile flight path to achieve

taken from mcdevitts notes for the presentation which he provided to crspreplanned trajectories until onboard seekers could acquire the ship and guide the missiles to impact249 another observer stated in 2005 the plas historic penchant for secr ecy and surprise when combined with known programs to develop highly advanced technologies that will lead to new and advanced weapons leads to the conclu sion that the pla is seeking to field new weapon systems that could shock an adversary and accelerate their defeat in the mid1990s former leader jiang zemin repopularized an ancient chinese term for such weapons shashaojian tr anslated most frequently as assassins mace or silver bullet weapons one potential shashoujian is identified by the dods 2005 report on china military power maneuvering ballistic missile design to target us naval forces in 1996 chinese technician reve aled that terminal guidance system that would confer very high accuracy was being developed for the df21 intercontinental ballistic missile or icbm such system could employ radar similar to the defunct us pershing2 mrbm or could employ offboard sensors with rapid datalinks to the missile tied to satellitenavigation systems nevertheless should such missiles be realized they will pose considerable threat as the us navy is not yet ready to deploy adequate missile defenses250 separate observer stated in 2005 landbased conventional tipped ballistic missiles with maneuverable marv warheads that can hit ships at sea would be chinese assassins mace sort of capability something impo ssible to deal with today and very difficult under any circumstances if one is forced to defend by shooting down ballistic missiles the capability is depe ndent on beijings ability to put together the appropriate spacebased surveillance command and targeting architecture necessary to make this work251 one more observer stated in 2005 there is yet another exceedingly im portant chapter being written in the pla ballisticmissile saga china is trying to move rapidly in developing ballistic missiles that could hit ships at sea at mrbm mediumrange ballistic missile ranges in other words to threaten carriers beyond the range at which they could engage chinese forces or st rike china among its other advantages for china this method of attack avoids altogether the daunting prospect of having to cope with the us navy submarine force as antisubmarine warfarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs114 252 prepared statement of eric mcvadon for september 15 2005 hearing before the uschina economic and

perfect more reliable and consis tent targeting of ships chinese missile specialists are writing openly and convincingly of marvd ballistic missiles missiles with maneuverable reentry vehicles that maneuver both to defeat defenses and to follow the commands of seek ers that spot the target ships there seems little doubt that our naval forces will face this threat long before the taiwan issue is resolved252 landattack cruise missile lacms regarding lacms one observer stated in 2006 taiwanese civilian and military officials contend that in 2005 the pla has started deployment of its longawaited new land attack cruise missiles lacms asian sources contend that two chinese companies are making lacms one for the second artillery missile forces and one for pla navy and pla airforce platforms most likely based on the new 300 km range yj62 antiship missile it has been well reported that china has sought to develop modern lacms since the 1970s and has sought technology from russia israel and has obtained at least six russian novator kh55 lacms vi the ukraine and has obtained parts of us rgmugm109 tomahawk lacms via iraq afghanistan and very likely pakistan when these lacms are married to new russianassisted eo and radar satellites french assisted communication satellite access to us russian and european navigation satellites signals and then carried by russian assisted nuclear submarines or future russianmade bombers then the pla will have its first limited nonnuclear global strike capability such synergy could emerge by 2010 or shortly thereafter this might not equal the us allweather intimate movingtarget hitting capability but china may be able to use lacms for politicalmilitary influence much as the us does today253 landbased surfacetoair missiles sams regarding sam systems dod stated in 2007 in the next few years china will receive its first battalion of russianmade s300pmu2 surfacetoair missile systems with an advertised intercept range of 200 km the s300pmu2 provides increased lethality against tactical ballistic missiles and more effective electronic c ountermeasures china also is developing the indigenous hq9 air defense missile system phased array radarbased sam with 150 km range254 another observer stated in 2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs115 255 prepared statement of richard d fisher jr for march 16 2006 hearing before the uschina

where russian technology in particular is producing new and dangerous pla capability is that of modern air defenses the pla air force is on its way to purchasing up to 14 to 20 battalions of russian s300pmu1pmu2 surfacetoair miss iles sams which could mean the purchase of 700 to 1000 of these deadly missiles the s300 family is very difficult to jam and can only be evaded with some assurance by stealthy f22a or b2 aircraft the range of the s300pmu2 allows it to target aircraft that operate over taiwan thus denying the taiwan strait as an air defense buffer zone for the taiwan air force janes reports that china may be funding the development of the even longerrange s400 missile while asian sources report that china may be coproducing the deadly short range torm144 which can shoot down precisionguided cruise missiles and bombs255 mines detailed opensource discussion of chinas naval mining capabilities appeared in the winter 2007 edition of undersea warfare publication of the us navys submarine community because ch discussions are few in number it is excerpted here at length the except runs for about five pages the authors state that compared to the chinas submarine modernization effort less well understood by naval analysts and planners is the peoples liberation army pla navys dynamic mine warfare component it is important to understand this emerging capability because sea mines appear to be big component of beijings antisubmarine warfare asw strategy the major conclusions of larger study that surveyed nearly one thousand chinese language articles related to mine warfare are that chinas naval mine inventory likely contains some of th worlds most lethal systems and that beijing may be on the cutting edge of mine warfare miw technology and concept development the study elucidat preliminary outline of chinese miw doctrine that emphasizes speed psyc hology obfuscation mix of old and new technologies and vari ety of deployment methods that target very specific us navy platforms and doctrines it seems that the pla navy sees mine warfare as feasible poor mans asw providing stopgap measure until beijing has put more robust asw posture into place chinese strategists note that submarines are acutely vulnerable to mines because passive sonar is not likely to be effective in locating mines and because submarines have very limited organic256 mine counter measures mcm capabilities lacking substantial modern naval history chinese naval analysts are scrupulously analyzing foreign naval hi story for lessons to facilitate their development and have duly noted the potential for mine warfare to baffle the enemy and thus achieve exceptional combat results perhaps not surprisingly chinese naval strategists have keen understanding of soviet naval doctrine appreciating in particular how mine warfare was revived during the late cold war in part for the purpose of counterin g american nuclear powered fastattackhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs116 submarines ssns indeed one chines survey of asw explains how new mines emerged in the 1980s that are more appropriate to the requirements of modern antisubmarine warfare detailed chinese analysis of russian rocket mines concludes these weapons will attack ssns too rapidly for countermeasures to engage and are also rated to be highly effective against the monohull construction of us submarines chinese strategists have also very closely analyzed the mine warfare as pects of the persian gulf war during 199091 noting that although two us navy usn ships were severely damaged iraqs miw campaign had numerous flaws including an inappropriate reliance on moored mines and failure to execute long range offensive mine warfare operations it is now conventional wisdom in the pla navy that relative to other combat mission areas the us navys mine warfare capabilities are extremely weak pla navy strategists envision wide array of platforms including nonmilitary vessels for delivery of sea mines for operational deployment having systematically analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of these minelaying platforms they appear to have concluded that submarine delivery of mines is optimal for offensive and especially longrange offensive mining missions china reportedly possesses between 50000 and 100000 mines consisting of over 30 varieties of contact magnetic acoustic water pressure and mixed reaction sea mines remote control sea mines rocketrising and mobile mines peoples liberation army navy plan submarines are said to use the chen1 2 3 and 6 type influence mines appropriate for use in the sea area immediately outside of har bor mouths the t5 mobile mine appropriate for port channels and sea areas immediately outside port and the sovietproduced pmk1 and the chinesedeveloped mao5 ro cket rising mines appropriate for waters up to 15 kilometers outside port chinas remotely controlled mines such as the em53 bottom influence mine are thought to be deactivated by coded acoustic signals to allow the safe passage of friendly vessels and again activ ated to prevent the transit of those of an enemy china likely also possesses an inventory of submarine launched mobile mines slmms called selfnavigating mines zihang shuilei in chinese these mines are simply torpedo bodies that carry mine payload to waters inaccessible by other means apparently derived from yuclass torpedoes chinas slmms would travel along user determined course for set period of time when slmms arrived at their programmed destination eg in the middle of harbor the torpedos engine woul d shut off and the weapon would sink to the bottom where the warhead would be c ontrolled by fuse similar to that of any other bottom mine significantly china began to develop rocket rising mines in 1981 and produced its first prototype in 1989 thus beijing has been working on this technology for well over two decades t oday china reportedly offers two types of rising mines for export rising mine systems are moored but have as their floating payload torpedo or explosiveti pped rocket that is released when the mine system detects suitable passing vessel the torpedo or rocket rises from deep depth to

destructive charge reportedly has an operating depth of at least 200 meters russian rising torpedo mines such as the pmk2 are said to be capable of being laid in waters as deep as 2000 meters recent focus on rocket rising mine development indicates for china new understanding of the art of sea mine warfare whereby it is essential to implement effective sea mine warfare over vast range of deep sea areas and to develop and equip rocket sea mines capa ble of mobile attack the pla navy is therefore augmenting its existing inventory of 1970s80s mines designed to defend littoral areas most of which can only be deployed in shallow seas and only fraction of which can be deployed in medium depths in particular chinas navy has started to outfit vertical rocket rising sea mines and is energetically developing directional ro cket sea mines rocket rising guided missile sea mines and rocket assisted propulsion sea mines an article in chinas leading naval publication refers to russia as the worlds sea mine kingdom china has reportedly imported russian mines technology and even engineers to bolst er its indigenous miw programs in this domain of warfare russias wideranging assistance has been natural fit for pla priorities while the true scope of this collaboration remains unknown chinese analysts have clearly deve loped sophisticated understanding of russian mine development and doctrine they note that soviet interest in sea mines actually waned under khrushchev but was subsequently reinvigorated in the late 1960s as it was realized that for conventional war scenarios sea mines would play an ever greater role one chinese article emphasizes that russia has continuously paid great attention to the development of high speed undersea rocket techniques ongoing chinese research foci suggest however that beijing is not content to rely solely on russian mines and tec hnology china appears for instance to be keenly interested in developing and enhancing the effectiveness of its indigenous deep water rising mines scientists at chinas naval aviation engineering and dalian naval academies have developed methods to predict rocket propelled mine attack probability variety of additional studies have analyzed launch platform stability underwater rocket pr opulsi on and launch trajectory additional naval mine research examines target tracking blast maximization and damage to ships rese archers at one of chinas top technical universities have analyzed the extent to which targets can react to and evade deep water rising mines and suggest using the passive signature of target vessels to aim the mines submarines have attracted particular ttention as deployment platform for rising mines an article by dalian naval academy researchers suggests significant plan interest in slmms researcher at institute 705 advocates acquisition of an encapsulated torpedo mine similar to the cold warera us captor mine which could be laid in very deep waters to attack passing submarines mine belts external confor mal containers designed to carry and release large numbers of mines can be fitted to submarines in order to bolster their otherwise limited payloads one article

havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs118 expressed pronounced interest in submarine mine belts the pla very probably has already developed submarin mine belts another source notes however that submarines built after world war ii rarely carry mines externally disturbingly there is some discussion of theoretical nature in chinese naval analyses concerning arming sea nes with tactical nuclear weapons one such analysis in the context of discussi ng russian miw notes that nuclear sea mines could sink adversary nuclear s ubmarines from range of 2000 meters second article finds that nuclear payload is one logical method to increase the destructive power of sea mines while third analysis argues that nuclear miw is especially promising for future deepwater asw operations it concludes at this time various c ountries are actively researching this extremely powerful nucleararmed sea mine an article in the july 2006 issue of modern navy dangdai haijun published by the pla navy itself in the context of discussing potential future pl navy use of sea mines also notes the potential combat value of nucleararmed sea mines while there is direct evidence of the existence of such naval tactical nuclear weapons programs in china these articles do perhaps suggest th need to closely monitor any chinese efforts in this direction recent chinese miw exercises have invo lved air surface and even civilian platforms extensively of particular interest in this forum however is that chinas navy also considers mine laying from submarines to be the most basic requirement of submarine warfare minelaying has become an integral component of recently enhanced chinese submarine force training in which crews strive to conduct wider variety of increasingly challenging exercises attuned to local environmental hydrographic and weather conditions such exercises are documented in some detail in the pla navys official newspaper peoples navy renmin haijun in par ticular chinas navy views submarine delivery of mines as critical aspect of future blockade operations by 2002 minelaying had become one of the most common plan submarine combat methods accordingly plan crews train to handle submarines loaded with large quantities of mines drill variants include hiding and laying mines in deep water broad and deep minelaying against port targets is also emphasized chinese naval officers recognize the cha llenges inherent in penetrating the enemys antisubmarine forces and laying mines behind enemy lines according to one pla navy captain secretly penetr ating the combined mobile formation deployed by the enemys antisubmarine fo rces is prerequisite to fulfilling the minelaying task there is some evidence that china may rely on centralized control of its submarines when conducting offensive mining missions in carrying out offensive mine blockades notes one chinese analysis if there is shorebased submarine command post to handle command and guidance of the submarine for its entire course it will not only ensure its concealment but also improve the strike effectiveness of the mines that are laid the chinese navy is working hard to improve the quality of its submarine officers and sailors including their proficiency in miw what would pla navy miw operations look like in any potential conflict scenario it is possible to imagine the extensive deployment of

cnon87uswissue_33chinahtmlchinese defense analysts now and in the foreseeable future involves the delicate future status of taiwan the bathymetry of the waters proximate to taiwan immediately reveals that the taiwan strait itself as well as wa ters to the immediate north and south adjacent to the islands largest ports are shallow enough to create an environment for the use of all types of mines although taiwans eastern coast has deeper waters the authors nevertheless believe that by relying on combination method of deployment air surface submarine and civilian that major chinese miw campaign could efficiently blockade taiwan especially if working in concert with the pla navy s submarine force chinese analysts moreover assess that taiwans mcm is inadequate to this challenge and that efforts by taiwan to deploy its own mines could be dealt with by the pla the above scenario represents the minimum that could be expected from offensive pla miw operations in taiwan scenario one chinese study on asw suggests that mines are best empl oyed against adversary submarines by laying mines in the egress routes proximate to the enemys bases thus limiting the ability of enemy submarines to get out to the ocean indeed it is conceivable that the pla navy could attempt to lay mines outside foreign bases such ranges are well within the endurance limits of pla navy submarines when considering long distance offensive miw operations it is perhaps noteworthy that chinese naval analysts have evaluated the success of german submarine mining efforts along the american coast during wwii the waters around japans southern ryukyus are also susceptible to chinese offensive mining operations another article suggests on the basis of great quantity of research the pla believes that us nuclear submarines are very quiet are difficult to counterattack and must be restrained according to this analysis this concern has been major impetus for chinese research on mobile mines and the priority would be laying mobile sea mines in each cha nnel of the pacific oceans first island chain thereby forming together bloc kade line and preventing us nuclear submarines from entering chinas nearby sea areas although chinas naval development program remains rather opaque it is clear mine warfare is dynamic component of that program the sources discussed above further suggest mine warfare may be central component of chinas evolving asw doctrine this has variet of important implications first and foremost strong consciousness with respect to the chinese mine challenge should be developed training and doctrin must adjust accordingly programs related to submarine mine detection and neutralization deserve additional impetus second the navy should be actively involved in mine warfare deterrence strategy nations should understa nd that the widespread use of mines in any maritime conflict would be extremely costly as these weapons could be deployed effectively against themselv finally us navy planning must consider that the pla navy is preparin g strategy to counter american ssns such that deployment in conflict scenario would entail new risks257 in another article

overall impression produced by review of chinese military literature is that of chinese s elfassessment of asw antisubmarine warfare weakness there is one notable exception significant prioritization appears to be given to the use of sea mines for the antisubmarine mission as if to produce poor mans asw capability one discussion explains because of tremendous change in the maritime strategic environment since the early 1990s the pla has made mobile asw sea mines focal point of weapons development the analysis continues china is energetically undertaking the research mission of using mobile asw sea mines against us nuclear submarines the same discussion also hints at possible pla navy asw role the major mission of selfguided sea mines is to isolate american nuclear submarines outside the first island chain258 two of these same authors stated in presentation in 2004 that china has large inventory of mines and we see tremendous interest in some of the most modern deadly mines going these deep water rising mines on the projection screen can be purchased from russia they have tremendous ability to mine deeper waters where we would prefer to operate so what we would consider to have been haven for us navy ships may longer be haven259 oni stated in 2004 that china is developing and exporting numerous advanced mines of all types one example is the wireless remote controlled em57 mine that offers many tactical options for example the mine can be turned off and on remotely to prolong its life or it can be activated and deactivat ed to allow safe passage for

over the next decade china likely will attempt to ac quire advanced propelledwarhead mines as well as submarinelaunched mobile bottom mines263 nuclear weapons regarding the potential use of nuclear weapons against us navy forces 2004 study stated that there is some evidence the pla considers nuclear weapons to be useful element of an antiaccess strategy in addition to the nuclearcapable ballistic missiles china has nuclear bombs and aircraft to carry them and is reported to have nuclear mines for use at sea and nuclear antiship missiles at the very least china would expect the presence of thes weapons and the threat to use them to be significant deterrent to american action264 regarding the possibility of china using highaltitude nuclear detonation to create an emp effect dod stated in 2005 that some pla theorists are aware of the electromagnetic effects of using highaltitude nuclear burst to genera highaltitude electromagnetic pulse hemp and might consider using hemp as an unconventional attack believing the united states and other nations would not interpret it as use of force and as crossing the nuclear threshold this capability would most likely be used as part of larger campaign to intimidate if not decapitate the taiwan leadership hemp causes substantial change in the ionization of the upper atmosphere including the ionosphere and magnetosphe re these effects likely would result in the degradation of important wa r fighting capabilities such as key communication links radar transmissions and the full spectrum of electrooptic sensors additional effects could in clude severe disruptions to civil electricpower and transpor tation these effects cannot easily be localized to taiwan and would likely affect the mainland japan the philippines and commercial shipping and air routes in the region265httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs122 266 report by the office of technology asse ssment congressional support agency that was closed in 1995 stated

on ballistic missile in flight it could claim afterward that it didwhether china would agree with the bove view that emp effects could not easily be localized to taiwan and surroundi ng waters is not clear the effective radius of highaltitude emp burst is dependent to strong degree on the altitude at which the warhead is exploded the higher the altitude the greater the radius266 china might therefore believe that it could detonate nuclear warhead somewhereeast of taiwan at relatively low altitude so that the resulting emp radius would be sufficient to affect systems in taiwan and on surface ships in surrounding waters but not great enough to reach systems on chinas mainland 267 following the detonation china could attempt to confuse the issue in the public arena of whose nuclear warhead had detonated alternatively china could claim that the missile launch was an accident and that china commanddetonate d the warhead at altitude as failsafe measure to prevent it from detonating

radiofrequency weapons dod stated in 2006 that chinese technicians are working to develop several types of new concept weapon systems two of which are radio frequency and laserbased systems longrange beam weapons would us narrow radio frequency rf beams to engage targets such as aircraft or precision guided munitions pgms shortrange systems would be packaged into missiles or artillery shells and launched into the vicinity of targets such as radars or command posts before releasing an rf pulse in recent year s the application of rf weapons has expanded to include deployment on small vehicles or in suitcases for targeting critical military or civilian infrastruct ures where close access is possible prc officials have publicly indicated their intent to acquire rf weapons as means of defeating technologically advanced military forces chinese writings have suggested that rf weapons could be used against c4isr guided missiles computer networks electronicallyfused mines aircraft carrier battle groups and satellites in orbit analysis of chinese technical literature indicates major effort is underway to develop the technologies required fo r rf weapons including highpower radiofrequency sources primepower generators and antennas to radiate rf pulses269 one observer stated in 2005 th at at least one us s ource indicates the pla has developed nonnuclear radio frequency warheads for ballistic missiles270 when asked at hearing in 2005 about the possi bility of china using nuclear weapon to generate an emp effect against taiwan nd us naval forces this observer stated what worries more congressman is nonnuclear electromagnetic pulse weapons nonnuclear explosive propelled radio frequency or emplike devices that could be used with far greater frequency and far more effect because they would not run the danger for china of prompting possible nuclear response thereby it would be much more tempting to use and use effectively if you could combine nonnuclear radio frequency weapon with maneuvering ballistic missile of the type that the pentagon report describes very briefly this year that would constitute real assassins mace weapon one that in my opinion we cannot defend ourse lves against and would possibly effectively deny effective military effective american military intervention in the event of not just taiwan crisis but other crises as

greater reliability will likely result in the replacement of all h6d aircraft272 regarding landbased airc raft dod stated in 2007 china has more than 700 combat aircraft based within an unrefueled operational range of taiwan and the airfi eld capacity to expand that number significantly many aircraft in the pl force structure are upgrades of older models eg reengined b6 bombers for extended ranges however newer aircraft make up growing percentage of the inventory the pla air force plaaf is deploying the f10 multirole fighter to operational units the f10 fourth generation aircraft will be chinas premier fighter in the coming decades china is now producing the multirole su27smkflanker f11a fighter under licensed coproduction agre ement with russia following an initial production run of

options for longrange reconnaissance and strike274 another observer stated in 2007 although the modernization of the pl air force has taken backseat to nuclear space and naval development the plaaf is much more modern fighting force in 2007 than it was in 1997 it now boasts about 450 advanced fighter aircraft including about 300 ru ssiandesigned fourthgeneration su27 flankers and chinese jian11s and 76 su30mkk fighterbombers which display substantial ground attack capabilities and are armed with russias most advanced airtoair missiles in january 2007 the plaaf unveiled its new jian10 multirole fighter jet which is based on the israeli lavi airframe itself an evolutionary offshoot of the f16 as of march 2007 the plaaf had re portedly deployed 60 jian10s with the total production run estimated at around 250 although its forwardwing canards are novelty among chinesedesigned fighters the jian10s most remarkable characteristic is its midair refueling module the plaaf has been practicing inflight refueling since at least 2005 with both su27 and older jian8 fighters following peace mission 2005 joint chinese russian military exercise on chinas shandong peninsula china contracted for six to 10 illyushin78s configured as aerial re fueling platforms and 30 illyushin76 cargo aircraft configured for paratroop drops the increasing size of chinas four thgeneration fighter

that the jinclass design is likely to be based on the type 093 ssn design which in turn is believed to be rived from the russian victor iii class design277 another observer stated in 2007 the future mission of the missile submarines appears to be regional because the range of the missiles and operational constraints facing the submarines limit the targets that can be held at risk the range of the julang2 is estimated by the us intelligence community at more than 8000 km 4970 miles which brings hawaii and alaska but not the continental united states within reach from chinese territorial waters assuming they made it out of port past lurking us attack submarines the chinese missile submarines would have to sail through the narrow straight between south korea nd japan into the sea of japan for its julang2 missiles to be able to strike the seattle area the bo hai bay has been suggested as possible deployment area for chinas missile submarines because it would offer more protection against hostile attack submarines from the shallow bay the julang2 missiles could be used to target guam and alaska india russia and at the limit of its range hawaii there are also rumors one apparently even

ssn and type 094 ssbn has been anticipated for some time neverthele ss these programs remain shrouded in mystery and there is little consensus regarding their operational and strategic significance in the broadest terms it can be said that successful type 093 program will significantly enlarge the scope of chinese submarine operations perhaps ultimately serving as the cornerst one of genuine bluewater navy the type 094 could take the survivability of chinas nuclear deterrent to new level potentially enabling more aggressi ve posturing by beijing in crisis moreover these platforms are entering the pla navy plan at time when reductions are projected to occur in the u s navy submarine force that fact was duly noted by senior plan strategist recently in one of chinas premier naval journals285 these observers also stated in 2007 that chinese sources universally recognize that noise reduction is one of the greatest challenges in building an effective nucle ar submarine prc scientists have long been conducting research concerning the fundamental sources of propeller noise for instance experts at china ship sc ientific research center developed relatively advanced guidevane propeller by the late 1990s this and the fact that china already has advanced sevenblade propellers with cruciform vortex dissipaters on its indigenous songclass and imported kiloclass

soundisolation couplings to prevent transmission of vibrations to the ocea n from major freshwater circulating pumps in the steam cycle advanced composite materials are credited with capability to absorb vibrations and sound one chinese researcher states that the type 093 is not as quiet as the us seawolf class or virginia class but is on par with the improved angeles class another analyst estimates that the type 093s noise level has been reduced to that of the russian akulacl ass submarine at 110 decibels he states that the type 094s acoustic signature has been reduced to 120 decibels

the design and production rates of chinas new songclass diesel submarine represent significant advance over its predecessor the mingclass submarine the song class has hy drodynamically sleek teardrop profile possesses new cylindrical environmental sensors and relies on german engines for propulsion most significantly the song is much quieter because it is fitted with an asymmetrical sevenblade

chinas eventual deployment of an aircraft ca rrier battle group except for the carrier china has all the elements of carrier battle gr oup in place according to lieutenant general wang zhiyuan of th pla general armaments department china will finish constructing its first aircraft carrier by 2010 according to an unnamed lieutenant general probably general wang again but its first operational carrier will likely be the varyag the former soviet carrier bought from ukraine chinas oncesecret naval aviation program appears to be underway at full steam at its center is the massive 67000t on former ukrainian aircraft carrier which the chinese government extracted from the black sea in 2001 after considerable costs in both treasure and political capital with turkey in march 2002 the varyag finally completed its 15200mile journey to its new home port of dalian where it was immediately placed under heavy security at the plan dry docks china has reportedly negotiated contract for 48 sukhoi33 jet fighters the carrierbased version of the su27 and is now preparing the varyags flight deck for flight operations reports in the prc media indicate that china will also configure its new jian10 fighter for carrier operations the plan air force planaf schedule apparently envisions developing carrier air wing by the time china launches its own aircraft carrier despite official beijings continuing protestati ons that while china already is capable of building an aircraft carrier fina l decision on construction has not yet been made292 another observer stated in 2006 the year 2005 marked turning point in chinas willingness to continue to deny or obfuscate its ambitions to build aircraft carriers last may it moved the old russian uncompleted aircraft ca rrier hulk the varyag that it purchased and moved to dalian harbor in 2002 from dockside into drydock it then emerged in early august painted in pla navy grey and the most recent internetsource photos show that the carrier

launched from 2003 to 2005 new type 093 nuclear powered atta ck submarines and new fuchi class underway replenishment ships if general wang is to be believed then the carrier varyag now undergoing what appears to be substantial refurbishment will be used for some kind of military mission these could include the refinement of chinas antiaircraft carrier doctrine and tactics training nd development of new carrier air wing and future aerial and amphibious s upport combat missions in august 2005 russian sources interviewed at the mo scow airshow offered confirmation of chinas carrier plans in that two russi an companies offered that china was interested in two types of future carrier combat aircraft the sukhoi su33 and the chengdu j10 modified with new russian engine thrust vector to enable slower carrier landing speeds the russians also used the moscow airshow to market the twinseat su33ub but modified with th rust vector engines it is quite likely that all three will be upgraded with new more powerful russian al31 engines have new activephased array radar and carry range of active guided and helmet display sighted airtoair missiles and precision ground attack missiles as such both could offer some performance parameters that equal or even exceed that of the us boeing fa18ef th main us carrier combat aircraft internet sources also indicate that chin is developing carriersized awacs aircraft that could also be devel oped into antisubmarine and cargo support variants while the us navy benefits from its over 70 years of constant practice and employment of effective ca rrier aviation it is nonetheless major shock that chinas carrier fleet coul d commence with combat capabilities that could neutralize those of the us navy in some scenarios293 another set of observers stated in 2005 that china s increased shipbuilding capacity has direct implications for chinas ability to build an aircraft carrier china now has eight yards capable of vlcc and ulcc294 construction and it will add more such yards in the coming years many of these yards would be suitable for the construction of large carrier nother option for china would be to build mediumsized carrier 3050000 tons fo r launching and retrieving helicopters or vertical short takeofflanding vstol fixedwing aircraft such ship could be built from relatively basic design based on lhdtype platforms ie multipurpose amphibious assault ships similar to the ones used by the united kingdom japan and thailand such vessel could also be completed at number of modern yards in china even ones without vlcc capacity although with substantial na val shipbuilding experiencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs133 295 2005 rand report pp 149150 296 2005 rand report pp 144145although chinese shipbuilders are quite capable of building the hull other parts of chinas defense industry would have to develop the equipment necessary to outfit an aircraft carrier with the necessary propulsion systems navigational electronics or weapon suites for selfd efense or longrange operations in addition china lacks the capability to build either largecapacity aircraftlift elevators or steam catapults for the move ment and launching of aircraft so chinese carrier would have to rely on skijump design thus chinese carrier would not resemble in any way shape or form us bigdeck carrier which serves as the operational hub for an entire carrier battle group if china chooses to build an aircraft carrier the need for more ships will become especially pressing in order to regularly protect and replenish the carrier the plan currently lacks enough modern multipurpose warships to adequately meet the needs of defending and replenishing carrier it is to this end that an expanding and improving shipbuilding infrastruct ure is necessary condition for the development of modern longrange naval capabilities295 surface combatants luhai type 051b destroyer one set of observers stated in 2005 that the luhaiclass destroyer which was launched in october 1997 and commissioned into the plan in late 1998 represented significant design advance over chinas secondgeneration luhuclass destroyer in terms of overall size the luhai is 20 percent larger it has widened hull beam to enhance stability armamentcarrying capacity and crew living space in particular the luhais larger size pe rmits four quad launchers for c801c802 antiship missiles which is double the number deployed on the luhu the luhai also uses gas turbine engine which is more powerful than the luhus diesel gas turbine system in addition the design of the luhais bridge and superstructure exhibits number of stealthy characteristics particularly in comparison to the luhus structure thes design features include streamlined superstructure with inclined angles nd two solid masts with fewer protruding electronic sensor arrays the stepped superstructure may have been designed with the intention to equip the luhai w ith vertical launch systems possibly for sams for an enhanced areadefense capability the absence of such system on the luhai suggests that that option was deferred for time296 luyang i type 052 b and ii type 052c destroyers one set of observers stated in 2005 that the luyang i and ii classes represent important advances in the sh ipbuilding industrys overall design and production techniques the latter have similar design as the former but they appear to be optimized for airdefense missions these four new destroyers represent an important evolution in shipbuilding design capabilities production techniques and management practices the hulls are larger than the luhais which in creases their weapons capacity versatility and stability on the high seas the designs of these vessels are even stealthier with sloped sides and superstructure w ith reduced profile attributes thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33153crs134 297 2005 rand report pp 146147 298 norman friedman new role for active

chinas most modern shipyards modular construction as opposed to keelup allows for work to be done on different sections at the same time increasing the efficiency and speed of the production process one of the most significant aspects of the new destroyers is the fact that china cons tructed these four new destroyers at the same time and quite quickly as well at least compared with past experiences this serial production of an indigenously designed vessel is first in the prcs naval history and testament to improv ed project management the four new 052b and 052cclass vessels have been built or have been under construction within the past four years by comparison in the entire decade of the 1990s china only built second luhu 1993 and one luhai 1997 destroyer the 052cclass destroyer in particular possesses several important attributes first according to goldstein and murray it uses phased array or planar radar on the four corners of the bridges vertical superstructure which would be used with sam vertical launc h system vls for airdefense missiles second important innovation both of these attributes are first for chinese combatant and help the plan resolve its longstanding weakness with air defense in the past chinese combatants relied on shortrange sams for air defense mediumrange vls sam sy stem would provide the chinese navy with its first real areadefense vessel and collection of such ships could allow the pla navy to operate surface action groups if china is able to successfully reverse engineer russianpurchased sa ms then it may deploy them on the 052c destroyer some reports indicate th at china may deploy its hq9 system chinese version of russian sam with range of about 120 km on the new destroyers such system on the front of the new platform combined with older chinese sams in the stern would give the chinese their first fleet airdefense vessels297 regarding the radar to be carried by the luyang ii class january 2006 press article stated the two chinese project 052c destroyers have fixed array radars that are often described as active arra ys though that cannot be certain298 active radar arrays use technology that is more mode rn and more capable in certain respects than the technology used in the spy1 radars on the us navys aegis ships jiangkai i type 054 frigates one set of observers stated in 2005 that the jiangkai iclass design is larger and more modern than that of chinas jiangwei ii class frigates like chinas new destroyers the new frigate has more streamlined design and has larger displacement these change s augment the new vessels warfighting capabilities and its seaworthiness some sources note that the 054 frigate resembles the french layfayetteclass gu idedmissile frigate because of the minimalist design of the type 054s superstructure the design of the new frigate also offers greater options for outfitting the vessel with various weapon suites some estimates indicate that the new frigate will

we did not see second batch of 054a although its not as talk ed about the huangpu hp shipyard also had huge expansion this past year while the dock was being used for building type 022 fast attack craft and the ocean tugging ship the 054a program was put on the back burners i guess that showed the important importance of these auxiliary ships but also that plan wanted to test these new ships out before building the second batch with the huangpu expansion we might see more 054 series frigates coming out in the future in the hp shipyard rather than the hd shipy ard i would imagine that the 054a design will begin construction again at both hd and hp next year we might see another 4 built next year 300 another observer stated french source confirmed reports that as part of its license production agreement china has recently declar ed that it produced 24 semt pielstick diesel engines to support the pr oduction of six 3500 ton type 054a frigates each ship uses four of the diesels this same french source was quite sure that there would be second production batc h of 24 to support second production run for total of 12 type 054a frigates so far three type 054a frigates have been launched since late 2006 from two shipyards hudong in shanghai and huangpu in guangzhou with the fourth just launched by hudong on may 23 2007 at this rate it is possible that all 12 type 054as will be built by the end of 2009 the type 054a marks significant upgrade over the two type 054 frigates launched in 2003 in that the former is outfitted with 32 new verticallaunched versions of the 45km range russian altair shtil1301 this observer also stated according the french and german s ources interviewed at imdex the plan is developing new class of frigate to accompany the type 054a air defense frigate now in series production there was apparently competition between the engines of the french firm semt pielstick and germanys mtu to provide the new diesel engine which will be paired

garage deck for vehicles may be accessed via side ramps port and starboard there is space for the hq7 sam launcher which may be fitted at later date this ship represents major enhancement of
