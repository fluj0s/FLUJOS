operations in an effort to highlight their cause osac news the threat from terrorism never seems to diminish on the ry the threat of being potential victim of terrorist attack is more real today than ever only last month senior police officer who is the deputy national coordinator for counter terrorism in the uk said that the police had recorded 37 increase in suspicious reconnaissance of potential targets in the first four months of 2007 he agreed with the intelligence analysis that the terrorist threat had worsened and said there have been public pronouncements that the threat has grown in volume and i would concur with that since 2005 we have seen an increase in activity and an increase in the gradient of the graph the current threat from international terrorism in the united kingdom is currently assessed as severe this assessment means that an attack is highly likely and indicates continuing high level of threat to the uk statement by the home secretary last year

ding mass casualty suicide attacks in the uk andtomorrows threat may i suggest will incl ude the use of chemicals bacteriological agents radioactive materials and even nuclear tech nology before mounting any attack terrorists need to look at survey or reconnoiter their intended target they need information about the target in orde r to ensure that any planned attack would be successfulthe newsletter of the regional security office united states emba ssy london page 8 the informer terrorist reconnaissance the effort by terrorists to obtain such informat ion on potential targets was amplified by us intelligence official immediately following the appa rent alqaeda threat in new york to us financial institutions in august 2004 referring t the surveillance that the terrorists had undertaken he said that it was chilling in its sco pe in its detail in its breadth he added that the type of information that has been acquired about the target demonstrates that alqaeda is meticulous in its efforts it is patient in it s efforts and since 911 there has been an effort made to ensure that they have the information that they need in order to carry out attackscontinued from page 8 continued page 10abovemore terrorist attacks are imminent the newsletter of the regional security office united states emba ssy london the methods used by terrorists in their surveillanc of target will vary and will neither be sophisticated nor aborate it is unlikely to involve many people or very much equipment the objective is threefold first it is necessary for the individual to assess whethe r particular location is suitable target they would look at the location s security regime its cctv cover the location of guards whether there are armed police deployed at the location the entry and exit proced ures and the building s construction second it is to asce rtain when the most effective day and time would be to mount an attack possibly where casualties can be maximized and third what the most effective method of attack will be such surveillance can last anything from day to w eeks dependant on the target selected as we have previously witnessed here in britain wit h the terrorist campaign mounted by the provisional ira pira the terrorists would go to considerable lengths to reconnoiter potential target they would obtain information from open so urce material that is readily available on the internet from public records from libraries and from local government offices they may walk around the neighborhood talking to people or visiti ng local shops all this could potentially provide wealth of information about specific target w hilst doing this the terrorist would wear clothing andor adopt some form of activity that would ble nd in to the local surroundings if stopped or challenged about their activities they were likely to have wellrehearsed cover story to explain their reason for being in certain place and indee d may have some form of documentation on them to support their story what was once true for pira could be the same for the extremists we face today there are number of methods that terrorists can u when carrying out such reconnaissance they can either be on foot on bicycle passing b the target in vehicle or adopt some form of other static position aboveextensive cctv coverage is paramount to any company s security when on foot lone individual might be more vulne rable to detection unless they can blend in to the cal surroundings they could for example stand at bus shelter occupy telephone box or mix with others who are in queue they could sit in res taurant that provides suitable view of the target or could sit in an adja cent park or on park bench they will attempt to appear as innocent as possible it clearly is easier for the terrorist to be accompanied by anoth er in such way that suspicion is not aroused for example man and woman walking together attempting to identify surveillanc by people on foot can be difficult but such individuals are likely to be reg ularly seen in particular locations at irregular times they may attempt to alter their physical appearance or change clothing from time to time they might be seen making notes drawing sketches taking photographs with camera or more likely cellular phone or using video camera page 9 the informer terrorist reconnaissance continued from page 9the newsletter of the regional security office united states emba ssy london foot surveillance might be used in conjunction with vehicle this may allow greater flexibility to adapt to target s location this could allow the individual to sit in the vehicle watching specific target or parking the vehicle and carrying out f oot surveillance vehicles that seem out of place in the location that they are parked or vehicles that are seen frequently or that cont ain person or persons who are just sitting and watching could ar ouse suspicion staff working at locations that are perceived to be potentially vulnerable to terrorist attack should be acquainted with such information on starting the ir employment at the venue rolling program of training could be put in place in order to keep them up to date with information such as the on going threat they should be reminded not to wear their official work passes outside of their work place in order that they are less identifiable th ey could alter their route to and from work or they could vary the times at which they start or leave w ork out of the work place staff should not talk unnecessarily about their employment especially in locations where their conversations might be overheard lastly and perhaps more important sta ff should be encouraged to report anything that they think is suspicious or out of the ordinary whe ther near their workplace or whilst on way to and from their home address such matters should be reported immediately both to the security office of their workplace and to the police staff should be told that it is never too late to report any incident matter how trivial it may appear to them it is never too late to alter th security regime following any such report where possible and provided it does not p ut the person at any risk staff should try and take down the best possible descriptions of suspici ous persons or vehicles the importance to police to have accurate descriptions cannot be over emphas ized some of the above is fairly rudimentary but given t he terrorist threat landscape these are but useful reminders in today s climate of terrorism one should ever be under the illusion that particular location is not on list of potential t errorist targets it is very unlikely that the current terrorists that we face today will give any prior warning of an attack the time the plac and the method of attack that they employ are of their choosing being conscious of both the threat and the methods used by terrorists serve the dual objec tive of allowing us to react more effectively and to increase inhou security measures if such action is deemed appropriate page 10 the informer the newsletter of the regional security office united states emba ssy london there is perhaps an assumption that it is only gov ernment departments and agencies that need to be concerned with the insider threat as this brief article will argue this is often false assumption and it becomes apparent that all orga nizations need to be co nscious of the potential damage an insider can do to the everyday operations of companyosac news special feature the insider threat continued page 12quite often most positions will not warrant national security vetting but in some areas the position has enough potential to be exploited by terrorists jawed akbar had airside access at london gatwick airport and waheed mahmood previously worked for british gasthe centre for the protection of national in frastructure cpni web site covers many issues one of which addresses the insider threat the site states some attacks whether from criminals terrorists or competitors seeking bus inessadvantage may rely upon could be an employee or any contract or agency staff eg cleaner caterer security guard who has authorized access to your premises in such an instance he or she may already be working for your organization specifically in order to seek information or exploit the access that the job might provide given this assessment it is clearly apparent that such threat cannot be aimed solely at government department or agency all companies irrespective of the nature of their business are potentially at risk from some of the above factors that have been illustrated by the cpni an article published in the daily mail on july 5 2007 claimed that up to eight police officers and civilian staff were suspected of links to extremist groups including alqaeda the article alleged that individuals with close links to islamist extre mists had tried to infiltrate other public sector organizations in the ukunwittingly assist outsiders throug h careless security practices for example displaying passwords by computer or suc cumb to phishingattack leaks can be nonintentional such as unguar ded talk leaving sensitive material unattended or the failure to observe cleardesk policy page 11 the informer the cooperation of an insider this almost all physical and electronic attacks can be ssisted or conducted by an insider there are some attacks that can only be committed by in siders such as the unauthorized release of proprietary information or the sabotage of assets that only employees can access in addition there are some tactics that insiders are likely to use in the course of preparing or conducting their attacks these include manipulation deliberate attempts to acquire in formation or access by manipulating staff the cpni further states that insiders may be delibe rately infiltrated into an organization in order to mount an attack alternatively the views of mem ber of staff in an organization may over time become disaffected in some way their position and opportunity would offer such person an easy way to cause damage in some manner reasons fo r disaffection may includ ideological and ethical concerns insecurity of employment poor career prospects or perc eived unfair treatment other possible motivations include boredom blackmail or simply desire to cause trouble staff can also one such example could be that of omar altimimi who was jailed for 9 years on july 4 2007 for possessing terrorist training manuals including instructions on using gas canisters to make car bombs altimimi is known to have applied for cleaning job with greater manchester police gmpthe insider threat although there is nothing to suggest that altimimi would have carried out any acts of terrorism against the gmp he would nonetheless have had access to sensitive areas of police station this may have given him opportunities to pick up or read sensitive material had it of been left casually lying around or he could have listened in to unguarded conversations given the cpni assessment that highlights the dangers of both unguarded talk and complacency in the workplace it is possible altimimi could have collected some useful information that could in turn have been useful to terrorist over recent years there have been number of examples of infiltration reported in the media whether within the government agency or at other sensitive areas outside the government such as airports the transport system or within the national infrastructure quite often most positions will not warrant national security vetting but in some instances the position has enough potential to be exploited by terrorist continued from page 11 linkhttpnewsbbccouk2sharedsplh

convicted men worked in areas which could be deemed as sensitive jawed akbar had airside access at london gatwick airport and waheed mahmood worked previously for british gas although in this case the planned attacks did not relate to these areas of work they were sensitive loca tions that could have been easily exploited for those with sinister intentions continued from page 12 page 13 the informer the newsletter of the regional security office united states emba ssy london the us government has also had its share of employees willing to sell information to fis the former fbi agent robert hanssen passed information to the russian government and after this was discovered on july 6 2001 he was charged with selling secrets for the personal gain of 14million and diamonds he pleaded guilty to 15 counts of espionage and was imprisoned for life without parole it has also been reported that single issue groups such as animal rights organizations will also try and deliberately

cause stop huntingdon animal cruelty shac has reportedly made numerous efforts to infiltrate members within companies in an effort to gather information that would be valuable to their campaign in conclusion whether we are talking about an extremist organization single issue group or merely competing company there is continuing threat from people attempting to infiltrate from the outside and from those insiders within their motivations can be varied but there can be little doubt that the threat is ongoing the threat is significant enough to demand the need for organizations to ensure that there are adequate policies for the continuous vetting of staff additionally companies need to ensure measures to deal with the revetting of their employ ees are updated to cope with this evolving threataccording to reutersnews article dated december 14 2005 dutch intelligence agency aivd wiretap translator had voluntarily leaked secret information about an investigation into islamist extremism
