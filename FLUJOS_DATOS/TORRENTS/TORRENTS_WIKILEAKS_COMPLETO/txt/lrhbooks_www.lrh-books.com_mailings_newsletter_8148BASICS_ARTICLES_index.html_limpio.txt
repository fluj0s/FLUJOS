l ron hubbard basics enewsletter n this general principle can be created many types of approach to the problem of obtaining clear the one which is offered in this manual is that one which has met with quicker and more predictable results than others researched it has given in use 100 percent results in obtaining clears in the beginning at this time an auditor should not attempt to stray far from this offered technique he should attempt to vary it only when he himself has had extensive and sufficient practice which will enable him to be very conversant with the nature of engrams better techniques will undoubtedly be established which will provide swifter exhaustion of the reactive mind the offered technique has produced results in all types of cases so far encountered there are three equations which demonstrate how and why the auditor and preclear can reach engrams and exhaust them i the auditors dynamics are equal to or less than the engramic surcharge in the preclear ii the preclears dynamics are less than the engramic surcharge iii the auditors dynamics plus preclears dynamics are greater than the engramic surcharge when the preclears dynamics are entirely or almost entirely reduced the auditors dynamics are not always sufficient to force the preclears analytical mind into an attack upon the engram the auditors dynamics directed against an engram in preclear who has not been subjected to process which will inhibit the free play of his reactive mind and concentrate it ordinarily provokes the preclear into one of the four unusable methods of succumbing fleeing avoiding or neglecting the engram demanding that the preclear face reality or see reason or that he stop his foolish actions fall precisely into this category the auditors dynamics operating against preclear can produce break temporary or of considerable duration in the preclear when the preclear is in reverie some of his own dynamics are present and the auditors dynamics added to these make combination sufficient to overcome the engramic surcharge if the auditor releases his dynamics against the analytical mind of the preclear which is to say the person of the preclear while an attempt is being made to reach an engram in violation of the auditors code or with some erroneous idea that the whole person of the preclear is confronting him the auditor will receive in return all the fury of the engramic surcharge im on the new basics book and lecture course while reading the first dozen or so pages and while clearing words and doing demonstrations i found that from 1968 when i got into scientology until this day i had crashing misunderstood on what the word psychosomatic illness meant and this misunderstood has prevented from understanding the scope of what dianetics handles i now fully understand this and am totally blown away with this data after clearing this up yesterday my normally elevated blood sugar plummeted over 30 points overnight when there was other change in my diet or exercise to warrant this change i am so grateful to rtc for again hitting the nail on the head with this pervasive qual action i cant wait to do each and every course one after the other the aliveness i am experiencing is beyond expression the laws of returning course room successes basics l ron hubbards books lectures basics l ron hubbards books lectures this is the fundamental knowledge of scientology the materials of dianetics and scientology comprise the largest body of information ever assembled on the mind spirit and life rigorously refined and codified by l ron hubbard through five decades of research investigation and development the results of that work are contained in hundreds of books and more than 3000 recorded lectures the books and lectures that follow form the foundation upon which the bridge to freedom is built they are presented in the sequence ron wrote or delivered them in many instances ron gave series of lectures immediately following the release of new book to provide further explanation and insight of these milestones through monumental restoration efforts those lectures are now available while rons books contain the summaries of breakthroughs and conclusions as they appeared in the developmental research track his lectures provide the running daytoday record of research and explain the thoughts conclusions tests and demonstrations that lay along that route in that regard they are the complete record of the entire research track providing not only the most important breakthroughs in mans history but the why and how ron arrived at them not the least advantage of chronological study of these books and lectures is the inclusion of words and terms which when originally used were defined by lrh with considerable exactitude far beyond mere definition entire lectures are devoted to full description of each new dianetic or scientology term what made the breakthrough possible its application in auditing as well as its application to life itself as result one leaves behind misunderstoods obtains full conceptual understanding of dianetics and scientology and grasps the subjects at level not otherwise possible through sequential study you can see how the subject progressed and recognize the highest levels of development the books and lectures that follow show where they fit within the developmental line from there you can determine your next step or any earlier books and lectures you may have missed you will then be able to fill in missing gaps not only gaining knowledge of each breakthrough but greater understanding of what youve already studied this is the path to knowing how to know unlocking the gates to your future eternity follow it if you are not already member of the ias find out how
