subject shsbc 39 date 22 mar 2000 162842 0000 from shsbcfzbaorg organization mail2newsnymaliasnet newsgroups altclearingtechnologyaltreligionscientology forgettingness lecture given on 8 august 1961 thank you this is august what eighth audience 8 the 8th very interesting the word eight the letter eight the numeral 8 you know ive been seeing it around since phoenician times and they stuck used to be two money bags youd set money bag on top of money bag thats right thats where we get eight so i hope youve made lot of money today ad 11 well there isnt anything to talk to you about actually new developments except the mind now i suppose youd rather ask questions wouldnt you female voice well ive just made little breakthrough that might be of great interest to you the reactive mind is basically that area of occlusion which the pc is unable to contact and which contains within itself total identification of all things with all things and until released into the realm of knowingness continues to react upon the person compelling him into actions dramatizations and computations which are not optimum to his or anyone elses survival oh you think i couldnt do it again huh well ill show you peter roll back the tape therefore we find in this mechanism called the reactive mind we find that residual of unconfronted notasised material which the individual is seeking to avoid all the discreditable things of his existence are of course contained in this area the knucklehead and he has various mechanisms of survival connected with all this and eventually the fox who has run across the river and has been caught and who has lost his tail on the chopping block to farmer will always come back and explain to the other foxes the great virtues of having tail whatever i imagine if you painted somebody with some kind of paint which was utterly unremovable and completely eradic uneradicable that he would eventually find vast virtues for that coat of paint but one doesnt expect the indulgence in this direction that the reactive mind has received because now we learn that the only reason anybody can do anything is because he is reactive creature circa psychology its definitions early half twentieth century you cant write you cant paint you didnt know this did you you cant accomplish anything in life none of these things unless youre totally plowed in and have very large reactive mind well in view of the fact that locke hume etand company were unable to do anything much about it and by the way their early articles on it are quite interesting the articles on the mind you should read them sometime the faculty psychology circa 1550 ad on forward great many articles on it and theyre all quite interesting faculty psychology of course contains the perceptions and its study of the perceptions faculties it doesnt mean the professors i thought it did for long time and then i did double take on it one day and theyre quite interesting articles they actually do try to take apart the various fields and zones of perception and thinkingness and attention and feelingness and that sort of thing and they are very innumerable very clever analyses of this that and the other thing theyre not applicable they dont go anyplace mostly because they are directed at knowingness and they are the psychology you might say of knowingness or awareness or the analytical sphere of existence its quite interesting they had analyzed and done quite great deal with the analytical spheres of existence and they kept getting thrown off their ponies as they would ride them down their pages they would keep getting thrown by the fact that man didnt act in rational fashion and they would get it all stacked up very nicely how man is rational man always reacts in rational fashion men are always acting for the best in this best of all possible panglosses and you get sudden departure from optimum survival well in saner periods this was harder for men to understand and they tended to just skip it and then all of sudden leave it to the german and the austrian and the russian they went off the springboard and went straight into the middle of reactivity and they got the ideas of stimulusresponse mechanisms and they new philosophy came up in germany leipzig germany professor wundt 1879 leipzig university his papers are also well worth reading someday when youve got comfortable summer afternoon with nothing else to do theyre sort of hohum but there is the cry of desperation this is the cry of desperation it is the last ditch god damn it of philosophy thats about all it is it says well we will cease to consider this dirty beast man as rational being since every time we ride our ponies down our philosophic pages we get thrown right straight into the quill pot because he keeps doing things irrational and we know very well that he should be rational so therefore well abandon the idea of rationality in man entirely and completely and we will label him from here on out as an animal and he is nothing but an animal and we will say that he operates not on the spirit the soul he has tender responses he has none of these things but he operates totally and completely as machine biological machine and he is just an animal and anybody that tries to make him anything else is traitor to our desperation and that in essence was precisely the point of departure of professor wundt and all the psychologists of the world at that moment rose and bowed toward leipzig because this got them off their horrible dilemma longer did they have to confront the idea that rational animal was inexplicably irrational all they had to say is he is always irrational and they had solved the problem neatly and longer had to be bothered with it and that they made progress then to amount to anything hasnt disturbed them at all they have had peace of mind in their own subject they have not had to observe anything they have not had to explain anything they have not had to accomplish anything or do anything actually except punch buttons they said well you see its obvious that if you kick man hard enough in the stomach he gets stomach ache thats all you need to know about it if you take food away from man he will do anything to get food rob steal burn slay anything so therefore to handle men you kick them in the stomach and take food away from them and so they have taught every government on earth and governments are now totally convinced that they are governing stimulusresponse mechanism which can be predicted on an unpredictable level they think man can be predicted if you beat him hard enough you see it all works out according to the textbooks see how simple it is you know you never have to be troubled thereafter nor do you have to inspect the fact that there are just as many unpredictable reactions to these things as there were to the earlier one that man is sane but is sometimes unpredictable now that man is insane has just as many unpredictabilities it is not true that if you kick men in the stomach well they dont even all get stomach aches and in addition to that if you take the bread away from them hundred percent they do not necessarily at all rob steal burn or anything else why i know fellows that you all you had to do was walk up to them and say well all right now what we want you to do is just soandso and soandso and if you dont do that were going to kill off all of your family and starve you to death and ruin your business and so forth and the fellow stands there and says puutt and they go ahead and kill off all of his family and ruin all his business and they come back and say now are you going to do it and he says puutt so you know what the psychologists do with that case history they hide it and psychology could now be called that vast morass of hidden case histories which dispute their theories and you look it over and i think youll find out this is about right it all looks so neat except if datum comes up that belies their favorite theory they put it aside theory now up until scientology theory about man was too precious much too precious it was evidently very difficult to get an idea up to this last ten to twelve years man really considered it tough thing you get an idea man youre really doing something and if you get theory about how things work then whether that theory is true or false whatever else you must do you must stand there with that theory guarded on both sides by raging lions and machine guns nobody must assault that theory because its precious hahahaha its precious and must never be never be threatened and that was true of the old faculty psychologist honest men went to the stake to protect their theories and in the field of psychology they will throw away all evidence to protect the theory the theory is the thing theories are precious now in old scientology 88008 it talks about abundance and scarcity of all things well were looking at up to that time at scarcity of theories about the operation of man and in scientology were looking at an abundance of theories we dont care grass for theory see just whether or not it works in heuristic science ah but this assaults the finest citadels of learning you mustnt have anything that just works now youre in the field of the crass artisans youre in there with the people who eat garlic and black bread you see youre not dealing there with the quill pen in the ivory tower you know somebodys going to come along you say well your modus operandi is always being threatened by the fact that somebodys holding grandly forth about this or that and its not backed up by any workability and what you overlook is the fact that he doesnt think it has to be backed up by any workability its enough that he dreamed up theory about it matter how horrible this theory was the theory is precious he isnt interested in its workability and he does not think that the workability or nonworkability would prove or disprove the theory because he doesnt think the theory is subject to proof or disproof and that you miss all the time so these people appear irrational to you theyre not theyre just protecting the scarcity of theories you think well it should be workable you should be able to do something with it man has shell pass over his head foot away and he goes into state of shock or paralysis well you say somebody that knows anything about the mind should be able to go up to the fellow and say give that hand few times or something like this and the fellow comes around and he says woooah he says that was rough one and you say well that rough one was couple of months ago now lets give that hand and the fellow says yeah what do you know comes out of it see you think that ought to be what you ought to be able to do and actually that is so reasonable that it is very difficult sometimes to conceive an idiocy such as fellow who knows all about the mind doesnt have to be able to do anything about that or help anybody or apply it or do anything with the mind or better anybody or worsen anybody or anything see its enough that he has string of roman candles after his name see thats all none of his knowledge has to be put to test the psychiatrist for instance or the psychologist today explains to you very defensively that he has spent years in schoolroom thats enough you say well what can you do with the mind that has nothing to do with it that has nothing whatsoever to do with it he spent years at it and he is now member of the north pole psychological association for theories about penguins mm and hes fellow of the lets all get together and swap the papers we have written society and thats enough man thats enough and the world at large sits there and says where are the mental practitioners thats kind of what they keep wondering where are the mental practitioners well theyve been gone so long the world kind of cant have them the last effective ones they had were witch doctors the zulus have still got good mental practitioners they go around and get shot of neoarsphenamine for their accidental acquisition of the spirochete and then they promptly walk around the corner and into the corner of the kraal and see the witch doctor to get the spell taken off too so the mental side of it is cared for the zulu is very careful to do that and it drives the medicos down in south africa halfway around the bend their perfectly good neoarsphenamine is apparently not enough and it isnt either thats true that would be true in any lineup you take anybody that needs some neoarsphenamine he probably is in such traumatic state anyhow that youd have to do something rather heroic to make his physical rehabilitation occur so the zulus right now thats the basic history on which were operating unless you understand some of this basic history some of the other things about existence are little bit hard to assimilate for instance why isnt the scientology practitioner at once embraced by governments and industry everywhere clank well they havent had any and its just been an absence for so long that their havingness is shot on it so they hire bunch of theorists you know that cant do anything and their havingness is somebody who cant do anything because there hasnt been anybody who could do anything dont you see all youve got to do is shift this frame of mind of course and the scientologist is the only one who can fill the bill the others cant do you know right now that the united states has literally acquired in relatively short space of time thousands of companies who are now testing people with lie detectors just thousands of companies all over the country they dont know anything about it they dont know how to do it they havent clue theyre turned out by the big lie detector colleges and so forth they know nothing about the mind you can take these boys and put them over the jumps and i mean the practitioners you know and you just leave them sitting there with their eyes as saucers because they never knew one of their machines could do this sort of thing you know and you say what about this little fact this one little fact here that nine percent of your people apparently are not registrable on this machine what about that fact well they say thats right its nine percent nine percent of the people just dont register you say why what why what do you mean why whats tha youve interrupted the conversation here you say why dont nine percent of these people register well he says it says right here in the textbook of the keeley institute or at the keeler institute i get them mixed up one solves drunks and the other solves lie detectors and they say it says right there read that line it says nine perc nine and half percent of the people they put on the machine thats it you know and you say why and they say look it says right here in this textbook it says nine and half percent of the people dont register on lie detec arent you satisfied you say why and they say well to hell with you you must be scientologist people are being fired by these characters who know nothing about the mind know nothing about their machinery theyre being fired theyre being hired its rather pathetic thing now you and i know you can get large strata of people who never register on security check theyre not up to responsibility of registering on security check you dont get fall with the needle the fellows sitting there with his hands dripping red and you say have you ever touched any red paint or blood or murdered anybody or anything and the fellow says the fellow says never did and the needle doesnt even quiver and we know that this is an irresponsible character who cant work we have to look sideways to find his actual identity and he cannot work thats one of the main things he cannot have solutions thats another thing hes every reason under gods green earth why he shouldnt be in an industry and yet he would register out clean on one of these keeler or keeley machines under one of these companies so youd wind up applying all the indigents of the country and the fellows who had little bit on the ball and were registering youd fire all of them so its at least come up to where they can have mistake and believe thats little bit of an advance hundred years ago they couldnt even have mistake but now they can at least have mistaken perverted ineffective mental field well thats paving the way for you and the ways being paved pretty rapidly you suppose after while these companies are all of sudden going to throw in the sponge they are too theyre not using effective machines theyre not using anything that goes with that i noticed the other day that we had got machine here in england reg brought over one were having it taken apart and stood on its ear right now and its not very good machine for the purposes of psychodetection but its very good machine for the purposes of electrical responses in the body its much better at electrical responses than it is detection most of these machines are copies in their present state theyre copies of the machines developed for dianetics and scientology in 1950 1951 theyre mostly mains operated therere very few of them battery operated they caught up to us about 1951 thats what they have done you see well itll take them while to find this other type of machine and find out what you can do with it but thats off the subject at first it was all analytical and that was the only thing you examined and nowadays the only thing they examine is reactivity now it is time then that if were busy examining reactivity and were thus interested in reactivity we should know something about reactivity and this is the field of unpredictability as far as man is concerned ive already in the last two lectures ive given you covered this subject quite bit on the subject of forgettingness but it fits right in here it fits right in here the cure of reactive bank is knowingness that is the cure of reactive bank because the substance of reactive bank is notknowingness i call to your attention the lectures of 1957 on native state notknow the first second and third fourth postulates all that material back there that all of sudden looms into view and we were trying to use it at that time and we were getting someplace using it its 1955 56 57 there was quite bit of that material some of it was released here in england in 56 this is very interesting material and that is the theoretical level of all of this now we go on all these years and we all of sudden run slam bang into the concrete block of workability theres theory and it had some mild workability but now were right up against workability with an exclamation point theres fourth postulate and i think that was remember wasnt it and already stressed that the third postulate forgettingness was senior to that so that you should run forgettingness rather than rememberingness way back then and then the second postulate of course is knowingness and the first postulate is notknowingness so you have your four postulates one notknow this is in order of made by the thetan the thetan made these four postulates in this order native state potentiality of knowing everything first postulate he had to say that he didnt know next postulate he had to know something but now we knew something of high particularity and now the third postulate he had to forget what he knew and then the fourth postulate was remember what he had forgotten and that is the level of action and thats the sequence of action that thetan does on any given subject when you enter engineering school you have to postulate that you know nothing about engineering when you enter the school of arts you are asked to postulate that you know nothing about arts get the idea well take that in finite application down here on earth and youve just about got it now to some degree we do this in scientology to our shame where you go to school why youre asked not to to notknow what you know about the mind you see but actually nobody has ever made that request of you the reverse request has been made however please look around and find something you dont know about it you know actually find something you dont know not just say you dont know just find something you dont know about it and of course we ye moved you off from know back to notknow weve moved you from second postulate to first postulate and in the field of first postulate we can operate because we can move back rather rapidly to native state and the peculiarity of what were trying to do which is to say to marked degree return thetan to native state with the total ability added of experience this is what were trying to do you see and this of course parallels in training you have to find out what you dont know about the mind in order to find out about it in other words were backing up were doing reverse line that is to say in engineering school or the arts colleges or something like that they ask you to not know and then learn lot of nonsense because there is an awful lot of this stuff is pure nonsense you see it has workability thats marvelous for instance theyve just made breakthrough on planing hulls with liquid strips they learned all this from this tremendous upsurge of water skiing thats been going on you know and then they kept looking at fellows on water skis and then kept looking at fellows on water skis and all of sudden it dawned on somebody that you ought to put water skis on boat that water skis were better hull and had better hull performances than hulls and so ill be of gun if they didnt put water skis on boats and i was almost startled out of my life on the potomac one day i was going down the potomac in the huskie and i saw this boat which was about eight to ten feet off the water it was this twentyfour foot cruiser and there was some fantastic you know rube goldbergian mechanism whereby you know you probably pumped wheels and turned levers and ground screws and you got these enormously hidden girders of some kind or another moved down underneath the boat you see and then the boat in some tippy fashion was put forward and eventually got up there and then you rigged propellers in some fashion to get these propellers to operate down underneath the water skis ten feet below the engine and you hung it all together with baling wire and shoestrings you know and the mechanics chewing gum because he gave up long before and that was about the first real adventure on this and then we learn little later that they had them up safe enough to where they let prince philip run one for little while down here and they had and the navy was building some and they went way up in the air and did about supposed to do about fortynine miles an hour and prince philip i think got about fiftyfive out of one but leave it to him and they were everybody was very upset because this wasnt supposed to go that fast but nervy guy that fellow anyway the score is that they had them all on stilts you see water skis and then all of sudden somebody got real smart and said well water skier now isnt just because his eyes are six feet above the water skis is reason the bottom of the hull of the boat has to be six feet above the water skis see they got real smart and they said well put the hull of the boat in the water and well put the water skis right up against the hull and as soon as they did that why the boat in one of the roughest nassau races miami nassau races ever run and that channel out there that gulf stream off miami can really get rough and boat so equipped came in twelve hours before the nearest competitor and all they did was tack water skis on the bottom of hull they put four water skis on the side of each side of the hull it was very interesting well ive got book upstairs marilyn sent that is the technology of planing hulls its very recent book its not an old book at all and it came out just before anybody made practical breakthrough with the water ski its very recent and it is old as methuselah its data is all went it is an antique and there it sits brassy new covers and everything else out of date for instance it tells you rather amazingly that you must never let the forefoot of the boat rise out of the water if youre going to have planing hull you must never let the forefoot of the boat rise out of the water and these water ski boats do nothing else but rise out of the water you see and they explain to you how its utterly impossible for boat to be run with its forefoot out of the water and this is very convincing too nevertheless theres lot of good data in the thing it proves completely that as soon as you get rid of displacement you go faster that theory is very sound but there is this oddity connected with it you see how this data gets boobytrapped here we can look at the last end of the nelsonian theory of shipbuilding see because he had stuff that planed too and it begins right there at this point of where somebody observes somebody on water skis and said why dont we put boats on water skis and right away all their technology goes blooey well it must have been an awful lot of invented technology for it all to go blooey for this much technology to blow up all in one package there must have been an awful lot of false nonobservation connected with it right and thats for sure thats for sure right at the beginning of the book it says of course its impossible to actually model test planing hulls thats wonderful assumption since i could figure out how to water test planing hull at fiftyfive but they never get them at fiftyfive because you cant get something to go tearing down the length of swimming pool at fiftyfive dont you see you cant get anything to start and stop that fast and then the water they would think was turbulent you see if you poured water at fiftyfive miles an hour so they just gave it up well as matter of fact ive seen many smooth stream of water running at fiftyfive miles an hour if you throw enough water down pipe why youll get fiftyfive miles an hour worth of water which is relatively unturbulent providing the pipe is maybe seventyfive feet long about the middle of the pipe if thats very smooth and theres enough volume of water you can certainly get volumes of water going down pipe which would certainly serve to test this sort of thing the theory is real wonderful but if we look too hard itll blow up and with the theory blowing up there will go all of our mrina buttons and all of our importances will blow up because our importances depend totally on theory well thats the first and foremost thing that we have changed in scientology we mustnt neglect that point is our importance depends totally upon our workability that is the total dependence of importance if we could make what we know work were important and if we cant make it work were just another theorist and the world is full of them theres the first time this type of thing has actually appeared the early days of engineering have smattering of this in it but here is late engineering subject called hydrostatics and hydraulics which still has great deal of the sacredity of the theory if anybodyd ever built science of hydrostatics one single discovery couldnt blow up the whole science unless the science itself was bit of phony right something would have knitted together in this ancient science that went but nothing did and now the forefoot of the boat has to ride out of the water in order to make boat go fast it has to i mean theres nothing else to it theres all sorts of weird things have been going on here but if you can make something work then any body of theorists eventually blow up the only thing that ever blows theories up is demonstration of workable countertheory the workability of countertheory is what blows up body of false theory so if you have objection to the false theory which is being stacked up and foisted off on man in all directions the way to blow it up is simply have high level of workability and youll find all of the falsity and pomposity of the entire sphere and area will blow up without any further protestation from you you just go on and do your job and it will blow up believe you dont have to pay much attention to it any more than youve paid attention to little thin zephyr of air blowing through the room you can do your job you can do your job and therefore youd better know how to take reactive mind apart kabangobango because there is the vagary there is the unpredictable there was the thing between faculty psychology and modern quote unquote psychology of 1879 there is the bone of contention and that is all they are arguing about that freud called it the unconscious we dont care what its called they were aware of the fact that there was zone of unpredictable impulse we know more about that zone now than any other body of people on earth so any breakthrough that we make in that particular zone is therefore very valuable breakthrough that would come right on the center line how to cure arsclycus or something that would be different that would be interesting but this other is vital and i found the point where this thing breaks through when i say forgettingnessconfusion what forgettingness would create confusion what forgettingness would cause problem there is the breakthrough point but that isnt as far as it goes it goes further than that and i can give you little additional datum on that today man wants it to be forgotten he not only uses forgettingness as continuous and continuing overt act but he wants forgettingness to occur he wants all of his evil deeds wrapped up in the stygian darkness of yesteryear man is basically good and this is his basic impulse but if his deeds are considered bad then theres only one cure for them that he knows and thats to forget them so you ask this blunt question and it can be put in these very few succinct words what should be forgotten just that very few words what should be forgotten you just ask somebody that what should be forgotten hell recover almost at once screaming impulse to make something forgotten and there is where his volition and the reactive mind cross and they cross at exactly that precise crossroads now i was around in the vicinity of this the way youd spot it with bomb salvo but were standing right in the middle of the x with that one because there is where his volition desires occlusion and sitting back of all of his confusion is actually knowable volition he wishes forgettingness to occur and that wish for forgettingness to occur then creates actively the reactive bank and that is exact the exact point between the analytical and the reactive bank and theres where those two points coincide with this addition that were ahead of the creation of the reactive bank that is the basic basic impulse on the creation of the reactive bank and therefore is very important thing to know one it is reachable thats why its important it isnt theory it becomes workable and it is the impulse which brings about the creation of all of this thing we call the reactive bank without any slightest anything i mean its all there i mean that is the postulate just ahead of all the rest of it what should be forgotten is the question that uncovers it because the statement which starts the reactive bank it must be forgotten or they must forget or he must forget or she must forget the other one must forget and there is the inception and after that person can have reactive bank now when youre trying to clear people youre trying to clear them of reactive bank so obviously this is not workable statement the other ive just made right up to this point is workable statement this is not theoretical statement you theoretically could sweep out the reactive bank with that piece of knowingness all by yourself you see theoretically but of course that of course will become the most easily forgotten point of scientology isnt that interesting so you see why im punching it up to you and why im drawing you pictures and putting red arrows in the direction of it and exclamation points behind it and so forth because it very easily could slide on broad general basis what should be forgotten and of course the insistence that the actual postulate what should be forgotten is the unraveling question and the postulate itself is it must be forgotten so if the postulate is it must be forgotten what do you think amongst the human race would be the most forgotten of all postulates it would be the postulate it must be forgotten actually and therefore would be the least likely to be asised and so would start the concatenation of accumulation which we call the reactive bank its an idiot truth you know i mean its idiotically observable its you know its one of these things that after you see it sitting out there it looks like red barn in the middle of white plain you know you just couldnt miss it you see but its been sitting there all the time but everybodys not only been missing it theyve been walking straight through it interesting huh well now this does quite great deal as you work with this thing there are all manner of variations and we get another rule that goes along with it for the handling of hidden standards this is cousin to this and we get new rule for the handling of hidden standards if you find hidden standard in processing pc he says well his ear his right ear burns burns more or burns less and therefore he knows processing is working you should take your security check and move the ear into the security check now isnt that an odd place to move this hidden standard but heres the rule you move the hidden standard into the security check and then you ask what is hidden about it or what should be forgotten about it or about ears you got it and there goes the hidden standard just like that zoooooom then two things occur the pc longer has his attention bound up on this object and he knows hes getting someplace in processing and youve at once accomplished goal of considerable magnitude youll find that is probably the most pleasant auditing you will ever do is exactly that auditing you get it out in goals by running in difficulties youre running goals assessment dont you see and youre running in difficulties youre doing goals assessment talking about routine 3 now and youll find yourself using routine 3 more and more and more in general and you say well what would you what would have to happen for you to know that scientology works see that nice one and after youve stripped all the motion out of the needle youre going to be sitting there with list of hidden standards well thats great i never told you before to do anything about them particularly i said there were things you could do about them and now im telling you you have to do something about them and that is you move them all over into the security check as terminals find terminal for each one of the hidden standards the actual operation is this while doing goals assessment routine 3 ordinary runofthemill goals assessment introduce this question and bleed it down introduce it often every now and then every few sessions something like that get this one beaten to death again and you will get bunch of goals which amount to hidden standards and the question of course is what would have to happen for you to know that scientology works or what would you have to have happen to know that youre getting better or if what happened would you know that you were getting worse what would tell you that you were getting worse you got the variations of this sort of thing in other words you take all of that class of question which would hunt out the hidden standard and take those and then acquire terminal for each one find terminal more or less for each one thats laborious thing the terminals usually sitting right there he says well id have to stop getting these terrified feelings in the end of my nose and obviously its the end of his nose is the hidden standard that is the terminal hes told you theres reason to beat your brains about it because its not all that important dont you see so theres your terminal and your next step is to move the whole thing over into the security check you dont do anything about it youve gone this far youve done the goals assessment part of it youve wound up with the terminals at once that he gave you the hidden standard you asked for the terminal and you write that down on your goals assessment sheet you see now dont do anything more about it than that at that time but when you come to the security check part of routine 3 you move that whole bunch of hidden standard terminals into the security check you find out what hes trying to hide about them you find out what shouldnt be known about them and you find out in particular what should be forgotten about them and of course that is the question that would break the back of any hidden standard the fellow said the tip of his nose very good the tip of his nose thats fine so you say well what should be hidden about the tip of nose well whats hidden about it i cant see it obviously it is hidden there isnt anything you could do about the tip of the nose because you see you cant see it you get crosseyed you know if you tried to look at the tip of your nose before you and thats pretty desperate so obviously you cant do anything about that well what should be forgotten about it and now this will all of sudden emerge into pay dirt so matter how the question is avoided you could walk around the question and sooner or later go home on it you see thered be some variation of what you know about it and the formula statement which i may or may not make with complete precision is any psychosomatic difficulty or any livingness difficulty which an individual has is in difficulty because he does not want it known theres something about that that he does not want known and something about that class of thing that he does not want known he wishes to hide it and he wants others to forget it and that is the story of psychosomatics and thats all there is to psychosomatics if you can make it work from there on you could make it work and thats all there is to it but of course you see obviously that it belongs in security check and this opens up great big page when i was very young extremely young it was long time ago on the early track i worsened the life and shortened the days of very clever and very very fine old man who was very fine variety you wouldnt have called him wizard thats kind of low scale but he was wise man he was very very wise man and he used to despair of my ever learning anything because i wasnt ever supposed to become wise man but he had great big books and it used to be my lot to stagger around with these books when he let wanted them moved and that sort of thing hed put them on easels and so on you had to put these books on an easel because they were as big as that rug and you opened them up you know and the hinges of the book would groan like the doors in one of those old radio programs and its very interesting the emphasis the emphasis there in that particular library on the subject of rememberingness absolutely fantastic rememberingness was the only thing ever taught and you could pull one of these books out of the shelf and stagger in with it you know lurching from side to side and open it up on one of these easels and it would groan you see and the papers would they wouldnt whisper theyd sort of rasp as you open them and so on stuff was really locked in brass there you see and there was all this knowingness and it was all knowingness knowingness knowingness knowingness how you made things sick and how you made them well and how you did this and did that and made animals make bodies and all kinds of weird things like this you see and it went on and on and on and on and on and to the best of my recollection and belief there wasnt single scrap in the whole thing concerned with forgettingness but you see that as forget and remember are opposite sides of the coin that obsessive rememberingness would bring about sooner or later occludingness you got that if know and not know are the verse and obverse parts of the coin the faces you go in the direction of got to remember got to remember got to remember got to remember you have already said to yourself i might forget and in view of this you will find that the hidden factor of forgettingness will start showing up like small gray ghost and then it will get less gray and less gray and darker and darker and bigger and bigger and eventually you will wonder where did all that big black mass come from well earlier than that you had to set up postulate to forget but it was probably disrelated from the exact thing you were there and the relationships as they came through became accidental on your terror of forgetting you must remember you must remember you must remember dont you see and every time you say i must remember ive just got to if i forgot this it would be terrible ive got to remember this ive got to remember this ive got to remember this ive got to remember this and so forth concentrating all the time that it must be something building up there that says youre liable to forget boy youre liable to forget you see so fear of forgetting actually can be built up by terrific concentration on remembering very interesting you can press on one of those buttons and get the other one now the poor devil who is sitting there in the south sea habitat not phil hudsmith who is down there who is hes desperate today i mean hes down there photographing the last of tahiti and he cant find out from his office whether the film he has taken is any good imagine being in tahiti with all the atmospheric conditions that you have to combat with color photography and youre trying to find out desperately youre trying to find out whether or not the any of the film you have of the hundreds of thousands of feet of film you have taken if theres just one foot of it thats any good or do you have to shoot it all again and nobody will tell you the guy gets pretty desperate you see but hes in different situation and i dont think he will go into this one but the standard robert louis stevenson type south sea bum you see was supposed to sit there and try to forget the reason he went to the south seas in the beginning was to try to forget dont you see so he uses drugs at first it isnt drugs its liquor liquor probably women first probably women and then at first he moves in location thats it and when he gets there its women and then they pall or something of the sort or he cant get any and dont tell women wont cure most anything he goes in for liquor you see and then he must forget you see and then this doesnt help him forget well whats he doing running out here you see but hes now got to go in for liquor you see but right after this youll find him normally trying to go in for dope or something like this and eventually death is his last remedy whats this hes trying to forget isnt he well what is all this urgency about forgetting see if he just relaxed it would probably all evaporate anyhow but i think the guys bragging actually i never ran into many fellows that could be that sinful in one lifetime but this very insistence on forgetting of course brings this thing up day after day after day its getting loomier and loomier and loomier whatever hes done you get the idea he presses on one button over here and the other button fires off you see and then he requires assistance to press on this button he goes out and buys some weights of some kind or another to sit on the button and he does various other things you see trying to get this button to stay put and this other button is the one thats giving him trouble and he isnt paying any attention to it at all see youre remembering well you get away from here we dont want anything to do with you now all weve got to do is forget so they get on opposite sides of these coins and this develops an awful confusion and eventually they develop this mechanism of death and occlusion and so on and just bury the lot and whats buried then becomes the stimulusresponse mechanisms of the reactive mind because of course his power of choice and his postulates are being overwhelmed that they are being overwhelmed by him is less factual that they are being overwhelmed because hes the only one that could overwhelm his own postulates anyhow you see how this cycle of nonsense goes well now that opens some new doors for you opens some big broad new doors now just get inventive for moment and think of how you might apply this principle to general security check now i already had some of you doing negative security checks and we found out they were quite successful well lets do hide security check lets just assume perforce not that the fellow has done any of these things but let us assume accusatively that he has hidden doing these things and lets ask question after question line after line just on that basis only we just snidely meanly viciously assume that he is hiding each one of these things now were not asking him if hes done them you see we have already assumed that he has done them were just asking him how hes going about hiding them how are you hiding all these rapes you see we just take the standard form 3 security check and just use the word hide just as an example you see and it says have you ever i remember the original security check have you ever cooked companys books i thought that was awfully poetic so have you ever cooked companys books now well thats letting the fellow up you see thats letting him out lets ask the question something of this order how would you go about hiding having cooked the companys books well thats kind of letting him off too you can alibi your way out of that one way or the other well lets suppose the needle trembled on that one well then lets lower the boom just ask when did you first hide cooking the companys books get the idea thats very very accusative type of action but all of the difficulty youre having with the security check would rather evaporate the difficulty is trying to get the guy to remember because these things are reactive responses dont you see so you just cut undercut the reactive response and you just assume its there you say well hes hiding it someplace of course in couple of hundred trillion years hes naturally cooked an awful lot of companies books thats true of anybody if you were given whole track check which you arent necessarily doing but the next thing you know youd find your whole track security check became very easy to do if you did form 3 this other way youd find whole track but i was just giving you an illustrative example of the uses of these principles and the use of this thing well whatevers wrong with the guy is what hes hiding dont you see well now lets go for broke on this thing who should forget cooking companys books who should forget it what should be forgotten about companys books haha thats an employment security check that would be an absolute killer i gave you dissertation little earlier in this lecture about the keeler organizations i never could quite regard them before with contempt and i have now managed that because there goes their nine and half percent that i mentioned there goes their nine and half percent if you attack security check questions from the viewpoint of the first postulate that is to say the commonly accepted first postulate which is the third postulate forget of course the fellow just couldnt stay calm about it the reason hes calm about it even if he knows it hes hes forgotten actually what it did hes forgotten the consequences that associated with it hes carefully forgotten these things so he can tell you oh yes i cooked the companys books one time you dont even get tremble on the needle why hes forgotten all the emotional response the charges the fear the overt act of it hes got all this stuff forgotten the fact of cooking the companys books hes conversant with that so you very often will have criminal sit down tell you yes i looted murdered robbed burned did this did that and after while we get the idea were not security checking were listening to somebody brag youve heard that happen probably you get real reaction on the needle for some of the darnedest things well if you want to see the reaction cut into the needle im pretty sure that if you asked about forgettingness youll see that needle start acting and youll see the charge come off that security question so there went the keeler companys nine and half percent and we can now regard them with contempt or maybe its the keeley company im not quite sure which it is one of those names there cures drunks and now if you were to do company security check of this type and you were just asking it just to clear each question as you went down the line of course you wouldnt have prayer you just wouldnt have prayer because this would plunge into the whole track inevitably because youre now undercutting and underprocessing death youre going right on down below death because death is the last effort not to remember so interrogation for companies should be short security checks they must have nothing to do with anything except the person what the person would actually be expected to do in his new employment you know we dont want people around who are going to cut the staff to pieces and cause people unhappiness or try to get other good workers sacked what they very often will do is try to get good workers sacked an insecure person thats one of his first impulses and to protect your own people you actually ought to check across such line so youd have to have very brief security check it couldnt consist of more than fifteen or twenty questions if you ever expected anybody to complete it and then if you ask on forgetting or hiding or forgetting you know general notknow pattern if you ask these things and strip them down and strip them of total reaction you would actually be totally sure of the security quality or lack of it of the person you were testing regardless of his case state you watch you do sec some of you have already done this negative security check and youve seen little more needle reaction havent you well of course youre going to hop up the needle reaction again the second you start asking about hiding and forgetting and notknowing and any one of the odd number of postulates any type of action of that character you see hide is about your fifth postulate by the way youre doing harmonics of the same thing as you go down the line i should probably sit down and figure out the rest of them up to about twentyfive or something like that to give all harmonics on the same scale it would be of use in security checking you see what you could do with that all right as long as you were trying then to do this kind of action and as long as you were trying to undercut the reactive mind it then follows inevitably and invariably that goals would come under the same heading and you could also do goals with this sort of thing your pc is just having one awwwful time trying to get few more goals and he is comm lagging like mad and so forth well whats more natural than to ask him what goals have you had that you have forgotten well that sounds like very mild sort of question to produce the considerable reaction that it will produce because itll produce considerable advance reaction to the other you see all right now lets ask more pertinent question what goal should be forgotten and of course youll get goals on all legs of all brackets what goal should be forgotten if you ask it plural youre liable to trigger an automaticity see you can think of it right now there ought to be lot of goals that should be forgotten man lot of them all dynamics crisscrossed and so forth so of course you dont however commit in either security check or an assessment the blunder of the robert louis stevenson character in the south seas you dont have this thing sitting on the i must forget with total concentration on forget because its just youre trying to bring up this fellows memory and ventilate and aerate the atmosphere and straighten it up but at the same time if you specialized on nothing but forgetting you might run into some sort of mess you might get into zones of occlusion which are absolutely overwhelming you might get on forgettingness stuck flow dont you see im talking now in terms of dozens of hours of auditing and you did nothing but talk about forget you see youre going to have to let him up youre going to have to talk about remember too so in security check you would have to ask the question maybe after weve disposed of what companys books should be forgotten and so forth well have to ask the question have you ever cooked the companys books which is direct invitation to remember you see this and after weve said to him what goals should be forgotten why well have to take some time out and ask him what goal he has not necessarily what goal should he remember lets not get into onetwo dichotomy here but just ask him just what goal he has had got the idea which of course is asking him to remember one youll find that this at first as in the case of all processes which have deep seated residence in the reactive bank is perhaps little bit hard to apply oddly enough it sounds so simple to apply but it might be little hard to apply at first glance and you have to get to living with the lion little bit and then all of sudden itll get very easy if however you find yourself stammering over lets see uh what the hell was i doing uh lets see whats the next auditing question model session model session scientol i don wha what are we doing here uh well well uh here we are in uh well is this new york or pompeiio you know i mean in auditing it youre liable to feel yourself hit little confusion here and there or something like that ride it through itd be quite normal that would tend to disappear in relatively short space of time but the confusion forgetting the confusion of course is onetwo sort of thing because confusion is something that asks itself to be forgotten because it has never really been remembered you dont you very seldom see somebody remembering all parts of the confusion well there was heavy wind earlier today do you remember every rattle of the leaf on the tree there were too many rattles of leaves on the tree dont you see so even while its happening confusion tends to be forgotten or much more accurately tends to be not known because you just didnt observe it youre not knowing it when youre looking at it dont you see which is probably what makes confusion confusion youre just not knowing what you were looking at when you were looking at it and so this gets difficult okay well enough of this i trust that this wont upset the tenor of your ways you are doing routine 3 right now and heavily specializing in routine 3 you go right ahead and specialize in routine 3 and if youre having any difficulty whatsoever in barreling through routine 3 keep this lecture in mind because it will help you out great deal what i would actually do is get the pcs hidden standards out of the road now using the formula which i just gave you in doing goals assessment to know if hes getting better to know if hes getting worse what would have to happen if scientology worked what would have to happen any type of question of this character which would reveal hidden standard get the hidden standards down and get some terminals for them and then forget them as far as the goals assessment are concerned just go right on and run some more goals assessment when it comes around to the security check plow in with those hidden standards and find out what should be forgotten about the tips of noses and what should be forgotten about unkempt hair and what should be forgotten about these various things and the next thing you know those hidden standards will blow up in smoke why because you have brought knowingness into the thing okay well i wish you luck i wish you luck it isnt that you will need it it isnt that you will need it but you will have i think better wider look at this the restoration of memory on the whole track is of course the index by which you can measure case gain most easily the person who has recall on the whole track of any kind who doesnt think he has ever lived before of course just announces the fact that he has just plowed in very heavily into forgettingness but the fellow who has nothing but delusory recall on the whole track of course is doing pretended knowingness on the whole track pretended knowingness on the whole track and youll find out that this is games condition of magnitude do you know what thats all about id better make some mention of that just while im on the subject it is giving somebody some knowingness that isnt do you understand its denying knowingness by giving him instead false knowingness so that one appears at the same time to be very cooperative and not playing game at all because hes giving you all the hot dope dont you see but right alongside of this thing we of course get pretended knowingness it is and that pretended knowingness is actually denial of knowingness hes denying you knowingness thats all thats the game see youre not supposed to know about his whole track so he gives you whole bunch of stuff that hasnt anything to do with the whole track well actually its games condition which is all wrapped up between forgetting and remembering all at the same time dont you see its all compounded in games condition and its in terrible confusion and my do you hate to have people talk about their life as napoleon have you ever sort of listened to somebody running on like this and just flinched audience member jesus christ huh audience member ive listened to about twelve jesus christs yeah well now this sort of situation this sort of situation is your reaction your reaction is not actually to whole track memory to which you might accidentally assign it your reaction is addressed to this you realize you are listening to games condition and that without anybody announcing it theyre considering you target for game such as to give you information that isnt giving you information to appear to be giving you information when they are not giving you information and that of course rattles you this you dont like because you smell games condition here and you arent aware of being an opponent to this person so you kind of go aw and i dont like it you know now this can build up to fact of where if this is played on you long enough and often enough then your own occlusion is enormously assisted the game also has target which is to occlude your whole track with pretended knowingness of their whole track so its quite games condition man dont think that it isnt and dont think that it isnt wild target but ive seen guys around in scientology whove gotten to point where theyll remember something on the whole track and then never open their faces you know never say word about it because somebody else has been going on about that period or something of the sort you know whats happened to you then youve answered up to the game by permitting yourself to be put on withhold of your own past you see so it must be games condition if it results in these nonbeneficial aspects you got the idea now if your whole track opened up from beginning to end and you remembered everything you had ever been and everything you had ever done and everything that had ever happened to you would that be good or bad would it be good or bad audience good bad well ill leave you that ill leave you that to find out because youre right on the verge of discovering it thank you
