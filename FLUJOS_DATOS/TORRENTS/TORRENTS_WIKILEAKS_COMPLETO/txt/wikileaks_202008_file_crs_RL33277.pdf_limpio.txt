current law and issues for congress summary in general business taxpayers are permitted to deduct all the ordinary and necessary expenses they incur in earning gross income such as employee compensation including fringe benefits by contrast expenses incurred by business taxpayers that are personal in nature or primarily for the entertainment amusement or recreation of employees including seni or executives are generally not deductible section 274e2 of the internal revenue code offers an exception to the rule denying deductions for expenses associated with the entertainment of employees specifically business taxpayers may cla im deduction for the cost of goods services and facilities used in connection with the ente rtainment of employees and independent contractors provi ded they treat the expenses as compensation in the case of employees or compensation for servi ces rendered in the case of nonemployees among the facilities covered by this rule are business aircraft for most employees the deduction cannot exceed the actual cost of using the facilities for entertainment but in the case of certain senior executives the deduction cannot exceed the total amount that business taxpayers report on their federal income tax returns as compensation for the executives use of the facilities this report examines the current tax trea tment of the personal use of employer provided aircraft describes proposed changes in this tr eatment being considered in the 109th congress and discusses policy issues raised by these proposals it will not be updated the senatepassed version of tax reconciliation bill hr 4297 contains two provisions that would modify the tax trea tment of the use of employerprovided aircraft for the entertainment of employees and their friends and families section 455 of the measure would expand the current limitation on the deduction for expenses associated with the personal use of these aircraft to cover all employees and independent contractors s ection 463 would require indivi duals who travel for their own entertainment on employe rprovided aircraft to valu those trips for tax purposes as the greater of the actual cost of the travel or its fair market value these provisions are not included in the housepassed version of hr 4297 interest groups that would be affected by these proposed changes led by the national business aviation ssociation are concerned that the changes would act like luxury tax on purchases of busine ss aircraft and dampen demand for such planes and related services they are pressing congress to exclude them from any conference agreement over hr 4297 that may emerge unlike the federal tax imposed on domestic purchases of expensive boats in the early 1990s however the proposed changes would not operate like luxury tax on purchases of business aircraft though they could raise the tax burden on individuals who travel for entertainment on employerprovided aircraft in addition trends in the

the internal revenue code irc business taxpayers eg subchapter c corpora tions general partners sole proprietors and subchapter scorporation owners are llowed to deduct all ordin ary and necessary expenses they incur in earning gross income in general business expense is considered ordinary if it is common or usual and widely accepted in the taxpayers business an expense is considered necessary if it is both appropriate and helpful to the taxpayers business common example of an ordinary and necessary business expense is reasonable compensation including fri nge benefits paid to employees by contrast expenses incurred by busine ss taxpayers that are personal in nature eg personal use of motor vehicle owne d by company or primarily for the entertainment amusement or recreation of employees

version of the bill one provision section 455 of the senatep assed version of hr 4297 would expand the existing limitation on the deductibility of costs associated with the personal use of such aircraft so that it covers all employees the other provision section 463 of the senatepassed versi on of hr 4297 would modify the formula for valuing the personal use of employerprovided aircraft so that individuals receiving such benefit would be requi red to report the actual cost of this travel as taxable compensation interest groups that have stake in the matters addressed by these proposed changes including makers of business airc raft have raised variety of concerns about their likely effects th ey are especially concerned about the implications of the proposed changes for the cost of taxpayer compliance and the demand for and use of business aircraft and relate d services fearing that the proposals pose too great threat to their interests these groups led by the national business

revenue ruling 200561 for the sifl mileage rates and terminal charges for the continuedunder the senatepassed versi on of hr 4297 and discusse s policy issues raised by these changes it will not be updated current law in general the federal tax code allows firms to deduct all or dinary and necessary expenses they incur in producing their gross income thus it comes as surprise that under irc sect ion 274a busin ess taxpayers may claim deduction for expenses they incur in providing entert ainment amusement or recreation unless they can demonstrate that such an activity is directly related to or associated with the active conduct of any trade or business they are engaged in this denial of deduction also applies to expenses incurred for facilities used to provide entertainment amusement or recreation such as yachts hunting lodges swimming pools tennis courts cars and aircraft the main intent of this rule is to prevent business taxpayers from treating personal expenses as ordinary and necessary business expenses nonetheless there are several exceptions to this rule under one exception which resides in irc section 274e2 bus iness taxpayers may claim deduction for the cost of goods services and facilities used in connection with entertainment amusement or recreation they offer to employees including senior executives or independent contractors inc luding directors of comp any who are not employees provided the expenses are treated on the business taxpayers federal income tax returns as compensation paid in the case of employees or as compensation for services rendered or an award or pr ize in the case of nonemployees the deduction cannot exceed the actual cost of th goods and services or the actual cost of using the facilities deduction may be claimed for the use of employer provided aircraft for the entertainment of employees to the extent that the cost is reimbursed by those individuals under current federal tax law all individual taxpayers must include compensation for services rendered such as fees commissions and fringe benefits in their taxable income irc section 61 requires individual taxpayers to include in their taxable income the amount by which the fair market value of fringe benefit exceeds any am ount they pay for it one such benefit is flights taken for personal reasons on employerp rovided aircraft by now it should be clear that conse quential tax consideration for business taxpayers that own or lease aircraft and employees who travel for entertainment on such aircraft is the valuation of the pers onal use of this aircraft making such valuation can involve complicated set of calculations under irs regulation 161 21g the value of personal flights on em ployerprovided aircraft typically is determined under formula known as the sta ndard industry fare level sifl this formula takes into account flight mileage ra tes which vary by the total distance flown terminal charge and the weight of the aircraft1 the sifl formula

fair market value which is measured as the amount an individual would have to pay to charter the same or comparable aircraft for the same period and the same or comparable flight but other considera tions may affect the valuation of personal travel on employerprovided aircraft for entertainment for example if trip that is made primarily for busine ss purposes involves combination of business and personal flights the excess of the value of all the flights taken over the value of the flights that would have been taken if none of the flight s were personal is included in the gross income of employees traveling for personal reasons but if trip is primarily personal the value of all persona l flights that would have been taken if there were business flights is include d in income amount is included in income if an employee takes personal trip on an employerprovided aircraft and at least onehalf of the aircrafts seats are occupied by employees who are traveling primarily for business purposes and are not re quired to include the value of the flight in their income it is possible under current federal tax law for business taxpayers to claim deduction for the personal use of employe rprovided aircraft by employees with certain exceptions that are discussed below or independent contractors that exceeds the amounts they are required to report as compensation on their tax returns such situation is likely to arise when business taxpayer deducts the actual cost of personal flights by certain i ndividuals but includes in th eir reported compensation the value of the flights as computed under the sifl formula the actual cost of such flight takes into account all the expenses of maintaining and operating an aircraft including depreciation allowances and can amount to thousands of dollars by contrast the value of personal flight on employerprovided aircraft using the formula is comparable to the cost of firstclass ticket for senior company executive and coach ticket for other employees2 the legitimacy of such deduction was cen tral issue in lawsuit involving the irs and retail lumber company called sutherland lumbersouthwest inc3 sutherland lumber owned and operated an airplane that its executives used for business and personal travel the compan deducted the actual cost of using the aircraft for this personal travel and th irs challenged the practice on the grounds that it violated irc section 274e2 wh ich limited an employers deduction for the personal use of employerprovided aircra ft to the amount treated as employee compensation on its federal income tax return in its ruling in the case the tax court held that sutherland lumber was allowed to deduct the actual cost of personal flights taken by employees only if those flights were treated for tax purposes as fringe benefit and properly in cluded in the employees compen sation the court also ruled that such deduction was allowable ev if it exceeded the amounts treated

purpose the provision served three purposes 1 to overturn the tax courts ruling in the sutherland lumber case as it applied to senior company executives 2 to raise revenue to offset part of the revenue cost of the act and 3 to deny certain small business owners net deduction for the personal use of airc raft owned by their firms4 before the enactment of ajca such deduction was possible when owners of non corporate firms socalled passthrough entities such as partnerships and s corporations traveled for personal reas ons on company aircraft and claimed business deduction for such tr ips

in the 109th congress the fy2006 budget resolution adopted by congress contained instructions for three different reconciliation measures including bill to reduce revenues by total of 70 b illion from fy 2006 to fy2010 in november 2005 the senate passed revenue reconciliation b ill s 2020 that would reduce revenues by 577 b illion over that period in early december 2005 the house passed revenue reconciliation bill hr 4297 that would lower revenues by 561 billion in the same period and differed in significant ways from the sena tepassed version in early february 2006 the senate approved its own version of hr 4297 by substituting an amended version of s 2020 for the nguage of the housepassed version before final revenue reconciliation bill can be cleared for the presidents signature the house and senate must resolve differences between the two bills in conference committee and any conference agreement reached by the committee must be approved by the house and senate while the housepassed version of hr 4297 would make changes in the tax treatment of the personal use of employ erprovided aircraft the senatepassed version would further modify the rules fo r deducting and valuing expenses associated with such use specifically section 455 of the senate bill would extend the limitation on the deduction for expenses related to the personal use of such aircraft by specified individuals to all employees and independent cont ractors section 463 would require employees and independent contractors who travel on employer provided aircraft for their entertainment to value this use for tax purposes according to the greater of the fair market value of flights taken or their actual cost which takes into acc ount both fixed and variable expenses less any amount paid to employers by employees and c ontractors for the personal use of the aircraft the two provisions are intended to raise revenue and to eliminate what some members of congress consider an unwarranted

in the senatepassed version of hr 4297 would harm the flight departments of us owners of business aircraft and domestic manufacturers of bu siness aircraft leading to revenue declines plant closures and job losses these critics charge that the proposed changes are equivalent to imposing luxury ta x on purchases of business aircraft7 in their view the adoption of the changes would do mo re than discourage the personal use of business aircraft it would make the use of such aircraft less desirable eventually reducing domestic sales of general aviation airplanes and the demand for aviation services8 the interest group leading the opposition to the changes the nbaa contends in policy brief that the pr oposed tax increases would have the same effect on the domestic general aviation ai rcraft manufacturing industry that the federal luxury tax on boats in the early 1990s had on domestic boatbuilders the brief claims without supplying supporting eviden ce that the tax nearly halted domestic production and sales of expensiv boats until it was repealed9 how valid is such concern not enoug h information about the role played by the personal use of business aircraft in dom estic demand for the ai rcraft and related aviation services is available from public sources to offer definitive answer to this question nevertheless ther is reason to doubt that the concern has much validity first the proposed changes in the tax tr eatment of the personal use of employer provided aircraft would not operate like luxury tax on purchases of business aircraft luxury tax is an excise tax on an item that tends to raise the prices paid for it by buyers who may end up bearing th brunt of the tax by contrast the provisions in the senatep assed version of hr 4297 would affect the amount employers could deduct for the personal us of aircraft they make available to employees and independent c ontractors and the amount that individuals traveling for their own entertainment on employerprovi ded aircraft are required to report as taxable income for those trips which ar considered fringe benefit if both provisions were enacted business taxpayer s could deduct more than the amounts reported as taxable income by employees and contractors for the personal use of employerprovided aircraft and employees and contract ors traveling for personal reasons on such aircraft would

aviation week and space technology vol 163 18 nov 7 2005 p 43 as one might expect these changes would have implications for the tax liabilities of eligib employers and employees on the one hand because the actual cost of personal travel on business aircraft tends to be much greater than its fair market value as determined under existin g irs regulations firms with aircraft operations conceivably could claim larger deductions for the personal travel of so called specified individuals than they are allowed under current law perhaps lowering the firms tax liabilities on the other hand employees including senior company executives and independent cont ractors would have to report more as compensation for their personal travel for entertainment on employerprovided aircraft than they are required under current tax law perhaps increasing their tax liabilities for owners of noncorporate or passthrough firms that own or lease aircraft the combined effect of the provi sions on the tax treatme nt of their personal travel on such aircraft may be net increase in their tax liabilities they would be required to report higher amounts as co mpensation for such travel potentially increasing their tax liabilities but they would be allowed to claim larger deductions for the expenses associated with such travel reflecting the higher amounts reported as compensation potentially offsettin g the addition to their taxable incomes second even if the provisions were to raise the tax liabilities faced by most individuals who travel on employerprovided aircraft for their ow n entertainment it appears unlikely that such an increase would have significant effect on domestic demand for business aircraft domestic sale s and use of these aircraft seem to be influenced more by the competitive adva ntages of having ready access to such aircraft for business travel advances in aviation technology and current and expected trends in business profits than by relatively minor tax considerations such as the deductibility and valuation of personal travel on employerprovided aircraft by employees independent contract ors and senior executives10 recent trends in orders for and shipments of business aircraft ffer some empirical support for this view worldwide shipments of business jets in 2005 were 27 above the level for 200411 and from late 2004 to late 2005 worldwide order backlogs for these planes expanded by an estimated 2512 the united states accounted for about 60 of worldwide sales of these aircraft in 2005 this expansion occurred during period when the limitation on deductions for personal travel on employerprovided aircraft by specified individuals imposed by ajca was in effect moreover the estimated revenue cost of the provisions from fy2006 through fy2010
