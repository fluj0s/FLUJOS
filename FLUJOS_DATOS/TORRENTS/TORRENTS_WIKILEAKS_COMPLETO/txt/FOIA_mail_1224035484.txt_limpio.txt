meeting would be bit too big and complicated if we would try to resolve ipcc type issues on the other hand involving chris field and maybe tom stocker may be an interesting way to vent the scientific issues in relaxed setting but i would suggest to avoid agency type things can be convinced otherwise if you feel strongly we do have limited budget too gabi quoting bamzai anjuli anjulibamzaisciencedoegov myles the dept of state is the us lead on ipcc conference of party discussions etc usaid does the bulk of adaptation assistance at the international level at the national level there are various ccsp agencies eg dept of agriculture dept of interior epa who are more on the application side of the ccsp id need to ask someone in those agencies on how they are approaching the issues you raise perhaps chris miller knows someone there programs such as noaa climate change data detection ccdd and doe climate change prediction programccpp focus almost exclusively on ipcc wg i type of questions anjuli original message from myles allen mailtoallenatmoxacuk sent tuesday october 14 2008 500 am to claudia tebaldi gabi hegerl cc knutti reto stott peter zwiersfrancis ontario

tom knutson tim delsole susan solomon jones gareth s tara torres subject re meeting jan 2123 hi all that is very good idea indeed i was talking to tom stocker last week arguing that resolving the differences in the definition of attribution between wg1 and wg2 was going to be one of the key challenges for ar5 particularly as attribution of impacts becomes live topic as countries start to make the case for adaptation assistance how about we invite the cochair of wg1 along as well if we are going to invite chris field we should definitely also invite someone from the double attribution community or it will seem bit like wg1 lecturing to the cochair of wg2 any suggestions david anjuli has anyone in the us state department or whichever department will handle this started addressing the question of how the us government will distinguish impacts of climate change from vulnerability to natural climate variability in allocating resources for adaptation assistance if anyone has even started thinking about this problem it would be very interesting to hear from them to know what questions they are likely to need answering we could also try and find out if anyone in the european commission is worrying about this regards myles original message from claudia tebaldi mailtoclaudiatebaldigmailcom sent 13 october 2008 2046 to gabi hegerl cc myles allen knutti reto stott peter

bamzai anjuli chris miller tom knutson tim delsole susan solomon jones gareth s tara torres subject re meeting jan 2123 hi gabi et i wonder if we could try to get chris field who is going to be the chair of working group 2 for ar5i dont know how likely it is to get him but it may be interesting to get his perspective on what was done in ar4 wg2 and what he would like to see in ar5 wg2 c on mon
