needed background1 in the december 2002 national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction wmd proliferation the bush administrati on highlighted its more activist approach while noting that traditional nonpr oliferation measures such as diplomacy arms control threat reduction assistance and export contro ls should be enhanced the strategy placed increasing emphasis on countering prolifera tion once it has occurred and managing the consequences of wmd use in particular interdiction of wmdrelated goods gained more prominence us policy sought to enhance the capabilities of our military intelligence technical and law enforcemen t communities to prevent the movement of wmd materials technology and expertise to hostile states and terrorist organizations2 president bush

and the united states the agreement on set of principles in september 2003 nd cooperative exercises to st interdiction procedures7 others however question the seriousness of the administrations effort as well as its sustainability as long as formal mechanisms are created8 the current configuration holds nothing particularly to bind psi adherents to this cooperative endeavor since its inception there has been little by which to measure psis success secretary of state rice on the second nniversary of psi announced that psi was responsible for 11 interdictions in the previous nine months9 on june 23 2006 under secretary for arms control and internati onal security robert joseph reported that between april 2005 and april 2006 psi partners worked together on roughly two dozen separate occasions to prevent transfers of equipment and materials to wmd and missile programs in countries of concern10 he also said that psi cooperation stopped exports to irans missile program and the export of heavy waterrelated equipment to irans nuclear program however it is unclear how this achievement compares with efforts conducted prior to the initiative even if psi has resulted in mo re interdictions than before can this be attributed to the success of psi or an upsurge in proliferation activity nonetheless many observe rs believe psi is good effort the 911 commission recommended that the united states seek to expand psis membership11 the european union and the g8 fully endorse psi12 and several proposed bills in the 109th congress have specifically called for expansion of psi

through which proliferators will have difficulty carrying out their trade in wmd and missilerelated technology13 the bush administration has emphasized that psi is an activity not an organization which seeks to develop new means to disrupt wmd trafficking at sea in the air and on land14 however very few new means of disruption appear yet to have been veloped although old means may be applied more rigorously there are differing opinions on enhancing inte rnational legal authority for interdictions on the high seas and in international airspace some states prefer to continue working on psi within existing international law whereas others like the us would like to enhance or change international law to expand the capability to interdict potential wmdrelated transfers several approaches may help improve interdiction efforts first participating states have agreed to review their own relevant national legal authorities to ensure that they can take action second pa rticipating states resolve to take action and to seriously consider providing consentto boarding and s earching of its own flag vessels by other states15 third participating states seek to put in place agreements such as ship boarding agreements with other states in advance so that time is lost should interdiction be required so far the united states has signed shipboarding agreements in 2004 with panama the marsha ll islands and liberia and in 2005 with croatia cyprus and belize such arrangements typically llow two hours to deny us personnel the right to board ship the united states reportedl has consulted with two dozen countries on shipboarding agreements16 fourth approach is to c onduct interdiction exercises psi participants reportedly have trained for maritime interdiction in the mediterranean arabian sea and western pacific ocean all areas that are particularly prone to proliferation trafficking17 in all psi has c onducted 23 joint interdic tion exercises as of august 200618 as many describe it psi relies on the broken taillight scenario officials look for all available options to stop suspected transport of wmd or wmdrelated items in practice cargos can be seized in ports if they violate the host states laws hence the focus on strengthening domestic laws on the high s eas ships have the rights of freedom of the seas and innocent passage under the law of the sea convention and customaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21881crs5 19 see crs report rl32097 weapons of mass destruction count erproliferation legal issues for ships and aircraft 20 the proliferation security initiative an

seizure19 according to state department lawyer as of 2005 authority had been worked out to legally seize cargo in addition key gap in the psi framework is that it applies only to commercial not gove rnment transportation government vehicles ships planes trucks etc cannot legally be interdicted thus the missile shipments picked up by pakistani c130 in the summe r of 2002 in north korea reported by the new york times in november 2002 could not have been intercepted under psi the october 2003 interdiction of shipme nt of uranium centrifuge enrichment parts from malaysia to libya illustrates the need for multilateral cooperation the malaysianproduced equipmen t was transported on germanowned ship bbc china leaving dubai passing through the suez canal the ship was diverted into the italian port of taranto where it was s earched passage through the highlyregulated suez canal may give authorities an opport unity to delay ships and find reason to board them in an interview in november 2003 then secretary bolton suggested that wmd interdiction would target shipments to rogue states and terrorists that pose the most immediate threat20 in the case of rogue states it may be relatively easy to target shipments to iran and north korea and their transhipment points but targeting terrorist acquisitions may place serious st rain on intelligence gathering on february 11 2004 president bush pr oposed expanding psi to address more than shipments and transfers including s hutting down facilities seizing materials and freezing assets21 to some observers it is difficult to imagine how national authorities could shut down facilities seize materials and freeze assets particularly if the material and equipment in question is dualuse which would normally place the burden on the export destination however on april 28 2004 the security council passed unsc resolution 1540 which requires all states to criminalize prolif eration enact strict export controls and secure all sensitive materials within their borders22 unscr 1540 called on states to enforce effective domestic controls over wmd and wmdrelated materials in production use storage and tran sport to maintain eff ective border controls and to develop national export and transshipment controls over such items all of which should help interdiction efforts the resolution did not however provide any enforcement authority nor did it specifically mention interdiction or psi in april 2006 the security council adopted resolu tion 1673 which extended the mandate of the 1540 committee for two years and asked the committ ee to formally report to the security council later than apr il 27 2008 comp ilation of information on the status of states implementation of ll aspects of resolution 154023
