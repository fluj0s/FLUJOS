benefit programs provide cash and noncash aid that is directed primarily to persons with limited income these benefit programs cost approximately 583 billion in fy2004 record high this sum was up 34 billion 62 from the previous peak of fy2003 and it equaled 5 of the gross domestic product gdp federal funds provided 732 of the total higher medical spending accounted for 26 billion of the net increase in fy2004 and 55 cents out of every dollar spent on persons with limited income went for medical benefits federal low income spending represented 186 of the federal budget with 9 attributed to medical assistance see table 1 for an fy2002fy2004 summary after adjustment for price inflation 2004 spending on persons with limited income was up by approximately 215 billion 38 from that of 2003 the previous peak real spending increases 2004 dollars were dominated by medical assistance up 19 billion other increases were in food benefits 33 billion cash aid 24 billion and housing 06 billion spending in real terms dropped in the following areas education benefits by 23 billion jobs and training by 09 billion services by 06 billion and energy aid by 02 billion spending for human capital programs those providing education and employment and training activities accounted for 62 of all dollars spent on persons with limited income compared with 192 for cash assistance and 553 for medical aid this report consists of catalog of 84 needbased programs 1 for each program the report provides the funding formula eligibility requirements and benefit levels at the end of the report tables 1421 provide expenditure data federal and statelocal and recipient data for fy2002 fy2004 program by program one program is new to this series of reports the dc school choice incentive program in addition two programs have been dropped because of the difficulty of obtaining reliable current data general assistance medical component and general assistance nonmedical component spending fo r these programs was only from state and local sources rather than federal most of these programs base eligibility on individual household or family income but some use group or area income tests see table 7 and few offer help on the basis of presumed need most provide income transfers that is they transfer income in the form of cash goods or services to persons who make payment and render service in return however in the case of the job and training programs and some educational benefits recipients must work or study for wages training allowances stipends grants or loans further the tanf block grant program requires adults to commence work defined by the state after period of enrollment the food stamp program imposes work and training requirements and public housing programs require recipients to engage in selfsufficiency activities or to perform community service finally the earned income tax credit eitc is available only to workers this report excludes income maintenance programs that are not incometested including social insurance and many veterans benefits and all but two taxtransfer programs thus it excludes social security cash benefits unemployment compensation and medicare outlays for the old 1 the number of programs in this report is somewhat arbitrary for example the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program is listed under cash services child care and work activities but could also be viewed as single program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33340g5g138g156g145g561g138g151g141g561g16g152g151g140g138g156g145

benefit programs in fy2004 totaled 502 billion financed primarily from payroll tax collections the report also excludes payments even though financed with general revenues that may be regarded as deferred compensation such as veterans housing benefits and medical care for veterans with serviceconnected disability the report includes two taxtransfer programs th eitc for lowincome workers with children and the child tax credit the eitc reduces the taxes of working families with gross income below specified limits and makes direct payments refunds to those whose income is below the tax threshold or whose tax liability is smaller than their credit before the 2001 tax law the child tax credit was refundable only to some taxpayers with three or more children but it now is refundable up to certain limits for those with earnings above 10000 this report treats the direct payment component of these credits but not the reduction in tax liability as welfare expenditure other tax benefits are excluded from the report because they are not refundable make direct payments further in most cases they impose income test for eligibility examples of these other tax benefits are the deductibility of mortgage interest and property taxes on owneroccupied homes equivalent to outlays of 614 billion and 187 billion respectively in 2004 these tax transfers increase families disposable income by reducing their tax liability and are known as tax expenditures the standard deduction and personal exemption in the income tax code also decrease families taxable income

of employment or child or spousal support 16 these ribicoff children named for the former senator who sponsored legislation authorizing this group are individuals under age 21 who do not meet the dependency requirement often because they do not live with their families in the past this eligibility pathway had been used fo r children residing in institutions or in statebased foster care or adoption assistance programs but today most of those children can qualify under other povertylevel eligibility pathways since those pathways do not include family dependency requirement ribicoff as result has little meaning for most children under age 19 for children who are 19 or 20 or are inpatients in psychiatric facilities on the other hand ribicoff may still be valuable pathway to medicaid older children cannot qualify under the other povertylevel groups b ecause those pathways define eligible children to be under age 19 institutionalized children who are in families with income that exceeds the poverty level ceilings also ca nnot qualify as povertylevel children b ecause their parents income is deemed to be available to children under those pathways under ribicoff on the other

temporarily suspend the enrollment of priority group 8 veterans those who enrolled prior to january 17 2003 in v s health care system were not to be affected by this suspension v claims that despite its funding increases it cannot provide all enrolled veterans with timely access to medical services because of the tremendous increase in the number of veterans seeking care from v 28 under current

disability veterans who are v rated as 50 or more service connected disabled and veterans who were released from active duty within the previous 12 months for disability incurred or aggravated in the

rules regarding reallocation vary by fiscal year in the first reallocation legislation for fy1998 and fy1999 pl 106554 redistribution states 12 in fy1998 and 13 in fy1999 were given access to unspent funds from other states equal to their excess spending above their original allotments during the applicable threeyear period after setaside of 105 of the total unspent funds for territories that fully exhausted their original allotments the remaining unused funds were divided among the retention states in proportion to their contribution to the total pool of unspent funds in contrast under the second reallocation legislation for fy2000 and fy2001 pl 10874 different rule was used setaside of 105 of the total unspent funds was made for territories that fully exhausted their original allotments then retention states kept onehalf of their unused funds the remaining unspent funds were then distributed among redistribution states 14 for fy2000 and 19 for fy2001 in propor tion to their contribution to the total pool of excess spending 31 the final rule for reallocation of unspent fy2002 funds was published in the september 29 2005 federal register 32 because law was enacted specifying otherwise the reallocation process followed bba 97 requirements under this law at the end of the applicable threeyear period unspent allotments are subject to redistribution among only

available federal schip accounts in fy2005 based on their august fy2005 estimated expenditures received access to fy2002 redistribution money equal to that estimated shortfall the five shortfall states were arizona minnesota mississippi new jersey and rhode island the remaining balance of unspent fy2002 funds was then divided among to tal of 28 redistribution states including the five shortfall states based on each such states percentage of the total excess spending above the fy2002 allotments during the threeyear period of availability of these funds 33 also according to bba 97 this reallocation pot was to expire at the end of one year in this case at the end of fy2005 access to reallocated funds ie redistributed and retained funds from prior years has added another layer of complexity to schip financing during fy2005 for example states could access reallocated fy2001 and fy2002 funds plus original allotments from fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 generally when multiple accounts are available simultaneously expenditures are applied against reallocated and original allotments in chronological order from earliest to most 31 finally pl 10874 also permits certain states to spend their available balances ie up to maximum of the lesser of the following two amounts 1 20 of the states available fy1998throughfy2001 original schip allotments and 2 the states balance calculated quarterly of any available fy1998 to fy2001 federal schip funds original allotments or reallocated funds from fy1998 through fy2001 for services delivered to medicaid beneficiaries under age 19 who

inception despite the fact that most states began enrolling children in schip in late 1997 or 1998 new programs always take time to get off the ground and participation rates in the early years of schip rose more slowly than expected as consequence spending was slow to ramp up too as evidenced by the fact that minority of states 12 to 19 depending on the year fully expended their original fy1998fy2001 allotmen ts by the applicable threeyear deadlines it was not until fy2005 when the redistribution of unspent fy2002 funds took place that more than half of the states 28 succeeded in qualifying for portion of these unused funds total of 264 billion over onehalf of the total federal schip appropriation of nearly 40 billion to date was made available to states and territories fy1998 through fy2004 by the end of fy2004 nearly 70 183 billion of these funds was spent however an additional 13 billion available to 11 states actually expired at the close of fy2004 these expired funds

guidelines 2005 limit of 29025 for family of four in the 48 contiguous states or 60 of the states median income adjusted for family size in addition household may not be excluded from eligibility if its income is below 110 of the federal poverty income guidelines 378 the law requires that benefits and outreach activities be targeted to those with the greatest home energy needs as well as costs particularly households with young children frail elderly and disabled individuals379 eligibility for liheap benefits is typically determined on household basis and grantees may establish eligibility
