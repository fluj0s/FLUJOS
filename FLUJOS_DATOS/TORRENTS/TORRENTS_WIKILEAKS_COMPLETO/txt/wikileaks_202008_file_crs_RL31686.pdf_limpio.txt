significant military equipment in the united states the demilitarization of military equipment is an important issue today evidence has shown that because of some failures in enforcement potentially harmfu l weaponry and parts are finding their way into the hands of private citizens as well as possible enemies of the united states the effort to dispose of and demilitarize surplus military equipment dates back to the end of world war ii when the fede ral government decided to reduce massive inventory of surplus military equipment by making such equipment available to civilians the department of defe nse dod identifies and disposes of approximately 20 billion of military surplusexcess ma teriel annually items ranging from desks and chairs to full weapons systems recently at july 2006 hearing before the house government reform committee subcommittee on national security emerging threats and international relations bennie williams the defense logistics agency dla director of logistics operations identified four target areas for managing the collection inventory and access to surplus and excess military equipment 1 processing controls for batch lot items and materials requiring demilitarization 2 processing of items received at the defense reutilization and marketing service drms coded with local stock numbers 3 improved controls regarding access to drms inventory assets and 4 reducing the concurrent procurement of items available at drms multiple agencies are involved in the control of excess and surplus defense equipment and weapons because dod does not have the authority to fully enforce all demilitarization standards even th dod demilitarization policy in place is regarded as ineffective and incomplete there is centralized federal authority to manage the program as each federal agency has its own policy and internal regulations which govern the acquisition us and disposal of demilitarized property proponents who argue for the demilitarizati on of military equipment say that it is necessary to prevent accidental injury and death while avoiding the unnecessary transfer of potentially harmful technol ogy or military capability to domestic or foreign sources opponents however ar gue that the demilitarization issue is an attempt by the federal government to usurp the legal rights of lawabiding citizens and groups to own or possess firearms in the future congress may consider several demilitarization options ranging from 1 permitting selective exemption 2 appointing one agency as executive program agent for all agencies 3 conve ning an

disposal of surplus equipment is closely related issue which affects the demilitarization process at the end of world war ii the united states had approximately 34 billion of surplus weapons equipment and supplies on hand in order to reduce equipment inventories and raise monies to repairr eplace aged equipment and purchase modern weapons the federal government increased the size and scope of its defense surplus program and sold or gave away weapons and equipment to individuals and groups the more surplus equipment and weapons available to individuals and groups the greater the need for equipment demilitarization 2 demilitarization manual dod 416021m1 chapter 26k demilitarization and disposal certain military equipment is classi fied as significant military equipment sme and is

of world war ii when the fede ral government decided to reduce massive inventory of surplus military equipment by making such equipment available to civilians1 through the establishment of the fense surplus program the public was able to purchase military goods and supplies as well as scrap tal the federal government created program to loan and donate equipment to private organizations some equipment has become part of historical collections andor is used for military exhibitions and war reenactments before military equipment is released to individuals or groups it is supposed to meet certain demilitari zation standards according to the department of defense dod to demilitarize military equipment is to destroy its inherent military offensive or defense capability the demilitarization process itself may include scrapping melting burning or alteration of the material to prevent further use of its originally intended military or lethal purpose demilitarization applie s equally to equipment that may be in serviceable or unserviceable condition and to equipment that has been screened and rendered to be excess equipment once properly demilitarized the equipment or materiel may be rendered inoperable2 as an example of what can happen when incorrect codes are assigned an article in newsweek revealed how sensitive air force communications parts which required

program manager 6 see httpdocsusapabelvoirarmymiljw2xmldemor700144mainasp although the army was the lead agency prior to 1998 th ere were us army regulations which governed the demilitarization policy thus the military services operated under the broad guidance of title 10 united states code usc section 2572 and each program interpreted the rules differently for example the center for military history often waived the demilitarization requirements for certain orga nizations under this provision the center was able to give away fully operational cobra helicopters to private citizens citing lack of funding to support helicopter restoration th center offered helicopters in exchange for having private citizens assume the restoration costs and granted waivers to certain organizations to exercise control over property for example one museum moved its property from state to state without dods knowledge or permission in 1998 then secretary of the army togo west issued regulation on army demilitarization policies under the new regulation the center would be responsible for the historical collection of military property while the army materiel command would assume responsibility for all other property this report examines the process and problems associated with demilitarizing significant military equipment in the united states the demilitarization issue is an important one today because evidence has shown that due to failures in enforcement potentially harmful weaponry and weaponry parts are finding their way into the hands of private us citizens as well as potential enemies of the united states the process and the problem the demilitarization of sign ificant military equipment can be best understood through an examination of the dod rplus property disposal process the disposal of defense surplus prope rty is delegated to dod from the general services administration gsa the federal property and administrative services act of 1949 authorizes gsa to dispose of government real and personal property and dod is delegated responsibility for the supervision direction sale and final disposition of dod property4 dod further delegates this responsibility to the defense logistics agency dla and dla authorizes component group the defense reutilization and marketing service drms to carry out the disposal activity5 prior to 1972 each branch of milita ry service

accomplishment of demilitarization is also transferred however when surplus and excess items requiring demilitarization are transferred or donated to qualifie d individuals and groups suc h as state agencies museum owners and foundations pr ovisional title transfer is granted meaning that those qualified agencies individuals or groups must return the items when they are longer in possession of them therefore they are prohibited from selling or leasing the items to third party not specifically authorized to possess them property released through public sale is not considered sold until the demilitarization process is completed since demilitarization is condition of sale dod maintains that if there is demilitarization there is sale under these circumstances dod maintains that private

disposal problems as similar to the problems identified some 25 ears earlier at sena tor john mcclellans 1972 committee hearing on the same issue19 senator grassley observed that the problem with lax disposal isnt new the first congressional hearings on this topic were conducted in the early 1970s at that time congress received testimony that the pentagons program for ensuring the disposal of surplus items was in shambles under current practic the pentagon has decided the answer to the question of what to do with surplu s parts is to sell them to the highest bidder with practically controls in pl acemr president the depots which sell sensitive military surplus have become thrivi ng terrorist flea markets in fact the pentagon even has world wide web homepage to advertise military surplus for sale some of it classified who k nows right now some of saddam husseins henchman could be browsing this hom epage looking for spare parts or new weapons finally id like to sum up the situation we have here despite congressional oversight going back to senator mcclellans 1972 hearings nothing has really changed therefore its clearly time for congress to step up to the plate and take action thats why im offering this amendment to the dod authorization bill to give law enfor cement an enhanced ability to catch arms smugglers who are targeting military surplus20 on july 8 1997

investigator with the dod trade security control office who had been interviewed as part of threemonth media investigation into the surplus weapons program he had resign ed from his position in protest over the poor enforcement procedures mr blackway was the head of the dod trade security controls office both mr barrington and mr blackway testified to the existence of many program deficiencies including l ack of resources and staff mr blackway expressed the opinion that the current staff and resources were insufficient to handle the broad range of demilitari zation program res ponsibilities senator grassley noted in his remarks before the hearing that mr barrington has been fundamental in alerting the public to the demilitarization problems and has been interviewed many times on the subject you may have read about his interviews with us news and also 60 minutes 22 according to transcripts of the hearing the 1996 media investigations were major factor in the decision to conduct the congressional investigation and hold the 1997 hearings the media investigation referred to wa s threemonth joint investigation by journalists from the levision news program 60 minutes along with journalists from the periodical us news and world report which uncovered significant problems in the military surplus weapons program23 the investigation examined pentagon records and us customs service documen ts and conducted inte rviews with many federal officials the investigation identified three major deficiencies dod had incorrectly coded many weapon components in the military equipment inventory as result of the push for reducing the size of the surplus military weapon and equipment inventory at the end of the cold war as well as to generate cash for new equipment and modernized weapons dod held weapon and equipment auctions at over 170 military installations in so doing dod inadvertently misla beled many military pa rts that should have been earmarked for total destructi on as result these parts were made available for sale at auctions where scrap metal dealers could purchase them cheaply and by the pound at the hearing it was reported that some dealers woul

from sophisticated weapons systems that when assembled would produce fully engaged weapon of military capability many of these parts were discovered th rough the practice of dumpster diving24 as result many buyers purchased technologically advanced military components dod made available large quantities of usable military weapon components according to the investigation federal task force investigating leaks in the military surplus system seized some 75 tons of usable parts from cobra att ack helicopters parts it said that dod should never have released in another case reporter from us news and world report purchased for 325 the component which guides the hawk missile to its target in this case the dealer who sold the item was unaware of the sensitive nature of the weapon components dod was ineffective in staffing supervision and exercising program controls in the opera tion and management of the program according to dave barrington former dod investigator dod personnel suffered from lack of proper training in identifying and classifying military surplus equipment the sheer quantities of equipment received on weekly basis meant that some equipment that should have been completely destroyed was sold in perfectly good working condition for example dod regulations called for the complete destruction of cobra helicopter parts on the one hand investigators saw cobra helicopters being destroyed at one outlet on the other hand at another surplus outlet in different state two fully functioning cobra helicopters were built with surplus parts and sold as result of the hearings dod designat ed one new staff position for the trade security controls office currently the dod trade security controls office is comprised of the demilitarization policy program manager the dod trade security controls program manager and demilitarization and trade security controls specialist despite the ddition of one new staff position mr blackway states that the demilitarization policy and procedures remain largely unchanged today that despite efforts to improve the program many of the same problems identified in the congressional hearings in both 1972 and 1997 continue to exist today25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31686crs9 25 continued on december 3 2001 26 since 1990 gao has conducted number of investigations into the operation of the dod surplus and disposal programs as

the majority of property in question is property that dod owns or formerly owned the report concluded that dod should be the final decision authority for all dod demilitarization and control items and thus should negotiate memorandum of understanding with gsa giving dod final appr oval for distribution of demilitarization and controlled items or initiate legislation to establish dod decision authority for all demilitarization and controlled items as well as for equipment like tanks that is not covered by the current regulation the report recommended that given the overlaps and gaps in

senate bill 1438 the senateversion of the fy2002 national defense authorization bill sectio n 1062 was defeated in the conference committee in 1998 congress directed dod to draft pr oposed legislation designed to clarify the authority of the federal g overnment to recover significant military equipment released without adequate demilitarization29 dods legislative proposal eventually became known as section 1062 section 1062 would have required the secretary of defense to establish regulatory standards to govern the demilitarization of equipment not covered under current demilitarization policy and do the following 1 define classes of military equipment requiring demilitarization before disposal and what constitu tes demilitarization for each class of significant military equipment 2 ensure that the demilitarized equipment would not pose significant risk to public safety and have uniquely military capability or significant capability for use as weapon 3 place the burden of proof of ownership of such military weapons and equipment on the person in possession of the equipment and not on the federal government 4 provide compensation to those persons whose property was confiscated by the federal government 5 grant the secretary of defense the authority to delegate broad powers to the attorney general to investigate suspected violations including inspection and seizure of the property according to dod the senate armed services committee made some changes to its original legislative proposal by incorporating the recommendations of the defense science board task force the ta sk force studied the issue and issued report titled control of military excess and surplus materiel30 in the report thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31686crs11 30 continued dod agencies could then continue to distribute excess materiel with dod approval of demilitarization and controlled items gsa disagreed with this recommendation 31 the defense science board task force concluded that in some cases dod property was destroyed that could have been sold resultin g in lost revenue from sales while some dod property was sold which should have been militarized resulting in an increase in the potential threat for acts of domestic or fo reign terrorism for further discussion see wichner david bin laden jet trainer was stored in tucson arizona daily star web version november 18 2001 32 views and comments attributed to dod were offered by mr jack blackway dod demilitarization program manager and his staff during an interview conducted at his office on december 3 2001task force identified six sources of potential leaks of materiel requiring demilitarization and control and found that privately owned museums constituted the most significant source of leakage the task force concluded that single agency had the lead authority or responsib ility for controlling such equipment which resulted in overlaps and gaps in coverage that law enfor cement efforts were largely resourcedependent and that the demilitarization coding process was too complicated31 current issues on demilitarization views expressed by dod and various public interest groups are in stark contrast to each other dod officials believe that the passage of the proposed but deleted section1062 of the fy2002 dod authorizati on bill would have allowed dod to correct past demilitarization errors and write new rules to address the demilitarization of all items32 in contrast however several gr oups of military equipment enthusiasts spoke out against the bill including its use of the term significant military equipment dod has reportedly sought to gain c ontrol over military equipment in the possession of individuals or groups nd has long advocated for tighter military equipment demilitarization policies ho wever the dod demilitarization program manager ddpm maintains that the program lacks authority staff and resources the ddpm could not estimate how much it would cost to implement fullscale demilitarization program as it cannot estimate the large number of items that fall under the category of significant military equipment more specifically the ddpm believes that the program lacks resources to implement lifecycle from cradle to grav management program three staff members administer demilitarization and trade security control policy eleven criminal investigators make up the dods trad security controls office whose job is to ensure that nothing is released from dod without proper controls due to the sheer volume of the materiels received they can only investigate the most egregious cases dod maintains that efforts to inves tigate and recover this property have been less than successful when dod officials have referred suspected cases to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31686crs12 33 the ddpm believes that doj does not place high priority on these cases and that there is some reluctance on dojs part to investigat such cases due to its past

that is militarily unique sme and therefore requires special xport controls the remainder of the materiel on the usml that is not designated as sme is afforded special conditions for release from dod control includi ng enduse certification and clearance of recipients additionally dod requires these same controls on dualuse materiel listed in 15 cfr 774 commerce control list which is under the jurisdiction of the department of commerce for export control 36 control of military excess and surplus materiel report of the defense science board task force office of the under secret ary of defense for acquisition technology december 1998 p 31 37 ibid p 42department of justice action has been taken according to mr blackway doj has cited lack of definitive authority to take action33 in addition dod does not always know where its military equipment loaned to museums is located according to dod there have been instances where museums have moved trad ed and sold property w ithout dods permission dod has maintained that equipment loaned to private museums is given for conditional display meaning that the museum does not have full ownership of the property museum has clear title to the property dod maintains ownership as in the case of property released through public sale property is not considered sold until the demilitarization process is completed another issue is the different agency authorities for demilitarization policies the responsibilities for both the surplus weapons program nd the demilitarization of military equipment are dispersed and thus create some jurisdictional problems the gsa and the departments of commerce defense justice34 state and treasury all have separate rules governing the disposal of demilitarized property for example materiel that is classified as significant military equipment is listed on the united states munitions list usml which is under the jurisdiction of the department of state35 the state department is also responsible for direct commercial sales and transfer s the department of co mmerce is responsible for items on the commercial control list items ccli36 in contrast dod surplus disposal falls under the jurisdiction of the dod trade security controls office which has limited authority for the demilitarization of military equipment the task force concluded that while dod had streng thened its control and monitoring of surplus and donations gsas more generous management control guidelines needed considerable improvement 37httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31686crs13 38 section 1062 would have required those in possession of such equipment to prove that they legally owned it ultimately the issue of who lawfully owns an item would be matter for the court 39 in response the ddpm offered the following however sme is clearly defined in 22 cfr and while broad is not ambiguous merely removing the guns from military attack aircraft does not negate its military capability over civilian aircraft nor preclude replacing those guns obtained from different source 40 httpwwwaopaorgwhatsnewnewsitems2001011012letterhtml 41 httpwwweaaorgnewsnewsdemil_letterhtml the letter goes on to say that all continueda number of groups including some veterans groups and military weapons enthusiasts were opposed to the proposed section 1062 they take great pride in owning the relics of war some have channeled their affinity for military weaponry into attending war reenactments military air shows and expeditions and owning private gun collections others have or ganized private muse ums of military weapons and artifacts some groups were concerned that if the proposed section 1062 had been enacted into law dod would have been able to confiscate the item from whomever had possession of it and be re quired to reimburse the owner for the fair market value of the item or scrap metal in the ev ent that dod found demilitarization costs to be prohibitive according to the provisi ons of section 1062 dod would have been required to develop both po licy and process for impleme ntation of the new policy and notification process w ould have been made public38 the aircraft owners and pilots associ ation aopa had strongly opposed the passage of the proposed sec tion 1062 in lette r to the chair of the house armed services committee aopa president phil boyer acknowledged that section 1062 was proposed largely due to the discovery that some surplus military equipment was improperly coded resulting in sensitive military tec hnology having f ound its way into the public sector he believed that s ection 1062 served valid military purpose but argued that the definition of what is considered significant military equipment was broad ambiguous and might lead to an unn ecessary destruction of military aircraft39 mr boyer offered to work with the conference committee members to draft an alternative piece of legislation that would narrow the scope of section 106240 mr boyer stressed that certain aircraft possibly aircraft not demilitarized had been carefully maintained over the years and were now serving useful purposes in joint letter to the house armed services committee aopa and the experimental aircraft association eaa stressed that the nation faced serious pilot shortage and that having historical airc raft visible at public air s hows would encourage youth to consider careers in military or commercial aviation in letter to the senate armed services committee members eaa also described the terms significant military equipment and militarization as broa d and ambiguous stating that legitimately acquired exmilitary aircraft from many eras commonly known as war birds pose threat to the public but instead are used to display our history as living aviation

the defense science board task force office of the under secret ary of defense for acquisition technology december 1998 62 p 43 peckenpaugh jason bush proposes massive overhaul of homeland security agencies government executive june 6 2002policy options for congress several policy options are available to congress to reexamine the current united states demilitarization policy they include 1 permit selective exemption 2 appoint one agency as executive program ag ent for all federal agencies 3 convene an independent panel 4 conduct hearings and 5 take action permit selective exemption congress may introduce revised version of the previously proposed section 1062 but make certain types of military equipment and weapons exempt from the demilitarization process as an example congress may exempt any equipment that is commercially available or exempt specific types of equipment congress may also seek to set specific time frame for dod to develop regulatory policy establish one agency as execu tive agent for all federal agencies congress may introduce legislation to gi ve one federal agency the statutory authority for the demilitarization of all military equipment given dods responsibility to protect public safety and provide for na tional security some argue that dod should be in charge of all demilitari zation policies42 another option would be to make the department of homeland security the executive program agent some would argue that the department of homeland security is logical choice given its mission to coordinate domestic security law enforcement border security emergency management intelligence and the anti terrorist activities of the federal government by firmly establishing the federal governments military equi pment demilitarization policy under the department of homeland security congress might help ove rcome turf war and avoid crossing political and institutional lines among older more established federal agencies43 the drawback is that the demilitarization policies of several federal agencies overlap with dods and congress woul d likely meet resistance from federal agencies unwilling to cede authority congress would need to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each agency in doing so congress could create new accountability to govern futu re demilitarization and trade security controls policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31686crs15 44 in response the ddpm believes that the convening of an independent panel is unnecessary as the demilitarization program has been fully studied in the past convene independent panel congress may convene an independent panel on militarization ac tivities with panel members representing various constituencies federal government agencies and the general public the pa nel could be directed to st udy the issue and to develop policy and process for future demilitarization activities in the past congress has generally accepted and implemented the recommendations of such independent groups44 however by their very nature their conclusions may not have popular support with some members of congress or the public conduct hearings in an exercise of its oversight func tion congress may want to reexamine the final report of the defense science board task force on the control of military excess and surplus materiel and hear testimony from panel members as well as demilitarization experts from both defense and law enforcement communities by conducting hearings congress may i nvite testimony from individuals or groups that may not have surfaced during the debate over the proposed section 1062 such public forums can generate new info rmation as well as more intense look at any unintended consequences of actions congress may consider hearings might assist members who are unfamiliar or uncommitted to any particular point of view take action congress may elect to take action by taking action some might argue congress can preserve the citizens right to bear arms and the right to privacy congress may also avoid diffi cult battle with veterans gr oups that represent strong base for political support taking acti on might be difficult position to support if any undemilitarized equipmen t formerly owned by dod is used offensively against the united states
