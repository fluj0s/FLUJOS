federal laws executive orders and presidential directives currently in force that govern comput er security the report focuses on the major roles and responsibilities assigned various federal agencies in the area of computer security this report will not be updated one major area of federal activity in computer security deals with securing federal computer systems the roles and responsibilities for securing federal computer systems are split between national security systems and all other federal systems the federal information security management act of 2002 authorizes the director of the office and management and budget to oversee the development of and compliance with security standards and guidelines developed by the national institute of standards and technology and promulgated by the secretary of commerce these authorities however do not apply to computer systems considered to be national security systems the roles and responsibilities for securing national security systems are established by national security directive 42 n sd42 nsd42 establishes what is now called the committee on national security systems which it authorizes to develop and require compliance with standards and guidelines for national security systems in general the federal government does not regulate the security of nongovernment computer systems however the federal government does require certain information held on non government systems to be protected against unauthorized access and disclosure primarily out of privacy considerations to date this has been limited to financial information grammleach bliley act and medical information health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 number of regulatory agencies have authority for developing and enforcing standards for financial information the secretary of health and human services has authority to develop and enforce standards for medical information the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires certain companies to certify the accuracy of their inte rnal financial controls the security exchange commission has authority to develop standards and enforce these regulations although it currently has limited role in securing the nations overall information infrastructure the federal government does through the department of homeland security work with and encourage the private sector state and local government academia and the general public to protect the nations information infrastructure this role is authorized in generic sense for all critical infrastructure by the homeland security act of 2002 it is also reinforced more specifically in homeland security presidential directive 7 and the national strategy for securing cyberspace to date these activities are voluntary for nonfederal entities other roles established for the federal government include investigation and prosecution of federal computer crimes assisting state and local law enforcement entities in their investigation and prosecutions and developing the nations expertise in information security httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32357g5g152g150g153g158g157g142g155g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561 g561

provides short summary of selected federal laws executive orders and presidential directives currently in force that govern computer security the report focuses its discussion of the roles and responsibilities for computer security that have been assigned different federal departments and agencies some of which were assigned 20 or more years ago this report is primarily concerned with the security of computer systems and the electronic information contained on or transmitted by those systems from unauthorized access use disclosure disruption modification or destruction in the context of information services the report does not discuss broader issues associated with information assurance which includes such concerns as the marking and handling of information in both electronic and physical formats the assignment of certain status to certain types of information and determining who should and should not have authorized access to it the report also touches on telecommunications to limited extent even though the technologies associated with computers and telecommunications have become inextricable there remains dist inction between the use of that technology for information services ie the internet and its use in some cases of the very same hardware for telecommunication services the major federal role and responsibility in computer security relate primarily to securing federally owned leased or operated systems or those systems operated for the federal government under contract or by third parties in general the federal government does not regulate the security of nongovernment computer systems other than those used by contractors for the federal government however the federal government does require certain information held on nongovernment systems to be protected against unauthorized access and disclosure in addition as part of its effort to enhance the security of the nations critical infrastructure the federal government is working with and encouragin g the private sector to improve security of the nations information infrastructure more generally another role the federal government plays in computer systems security is to investigate and prosecute federal computer crimes the federal government also offers assistance to state and local law enforcement entities in their investigation and prosecution of computer activities made illegal at the state level finally the federal government has programs in research and development and in the development of the nations expertise in computer security

and the use of computers in telecommunication networks and the inextricable nature of the technologies involved it is necessary to spend few paragraphs discussing the national communication system nsd42 makes reference to the national communication systems committee of principals the national communication system ncs was first established by presidential memorandum 252 signed by president kenned in 1963 following the cuban missile crisis the memorandum called for establishing ncs by linking together and improving on an evolutionary basis the communication facilities and components of various federal agencies this original memorandum since has been amended and superseded over time the executive order currently in force is executive order 12472 signed by president reagan on april 3 1984 which was amended slightly by president george w bush in executive order 13286 on february 28 2003 eo 12472 established ie defined national communication system as those telecommunication assets owned or leased by the federal government that can meet the national security and emergency preparedness needs of the federal government together with an administrative structure that could ensure that national telecommunications infrastructure is developed that is responsive to national security and emergency preparedness needs the administrative structure includes national communication system committee of principals an executive agent and manager the national communication system committee of principals consists of those agencies designated by the president that own or lease telecommunication assets identified as part of the national communication system or which bear policy regulatory or enforcement responsibilities of importance to national security and emergency

national communication system together the national security council the homeland security council the director of ostp and the director of omb in consultation with the executive agent and the committee of principals determine the requirements for the national communication system the committee of principals also works closely with private sector service providers which own and operate some of the assets that make up the ncs through the national security telecommunication advisory committee the committee of principals also acts as forum in which members may discuss and report on ongoing and perspective national security and emergency planning plans and programs and ensures that the ncs is responsive capable of satisfying priority telecommunication requirements and survivable to the maximum exte nd practicable at all times including times of crisis and emergency infrastructure security is specifically mentioned as one of the concerns of the ncs section 1c3 the responsibilities of

act which was superceded by fisma had authorized nist to develop in consultation with the office of personnel management guidelines for training agency employees in information security practices the guidelines developed cover range of needs from making users aware of security issues and practices to guidelines for agencies to use when developing training courses for people charged with securing computer systems nsa has similar guidelines for training personnel in securing national security systems the national security agency citing its authorities under nsd42 to develop standards for securing national security system and in response to pdd63 also has established national information assurance education and training program part of which includes the national centers of excellence in information assurance education the centers program selects certain universities who have developed programs in information assurance that meet criteria established by the committee on national security systems following the release of pdd63 the clinton administration began program called scholarshi pforservice sfs which leveraging nsas center of excellence program seeks to help schools develop information security programs that could qualify for nsas centers program and to pport students with 2year scholarships upon graduation students receiving sfs support would be required to work

ittee on national security systems are responsible for federal computer systems designated as national security systems while inheriting the ncs and its responsibilities in the area of the ncs and telecommunications the primary role of the department of homeland security is to work with the private sector state and local governments and the public to protect the nations information infrastructure ie the internet the secretary of health and human services enforces regulations related to the privacy of individual health information held on private computer systems maintained by health care organizations the sec and other agencies with jurisdiction over financial institutions enforce regulations related to the privacy of individual financial information held on computer systems maintained by financial institutions the sec also enforces regulations related to the certification of internal financial controls including those associated with companys computer systems for

at least three issues have arisen concerning these roles and responsibilities 1 the role the federal government in regulating the nations privately owned and operated critical information infrastructure 2 the relative roles of the department of homeland security and the national security agency in setting policy and standards for computer and telecommunication systems handling critical infrastructure information and 3 the relative roles of the national cyber security division and the national communication system in setting policy and standards for dealing with the private sector

federal government in regulating private sector computer systems is primarily derived from its interest to protect the privacy of individually identifiable information held on private computer systems or to improve th oversight of financial reporting by the private sector security of companys or an individuals computer system or the internet as whole are not the policy objective there is long running debate about whether the federal government should take more active regulatory role in improving private sector computer security two options that have been discussed include requiri ng the development of more secure computer software andor requiring users to improve and maintain the security of their systems over time number of critics of the national strategy to secure cyberspace have asserted that the strategy did not go far enough in either of these directions in its recommendations 5 these critics tend to come from the developers of security products and services both software developers and software users take the position that it is in companys interest to sell and maintain secure products and systems and that market forces are the best way to ensure costeffective security current policy is to engage the private sector and collaborate in efforts to raise awareness of security issues and to disseminate best practices

information called critical infrastructure information critical infrastructure information is information coming from the private sector and state and local governments to the department of homeland security concerning the identification of critical assets their vulnerabilities measures taken to protect them and suspicious incidents the act gives the secretary of homeland security authority to develop the information systems as well as the protocols etc needed to facilitate the sharing storage and analysis of this information while not necessar ily considered classified information critical infrastructure information is considered sensitive and exempt from public disclosure it might also be held and transmitted over systems that also handle classified or other types of sensitive information that would make the information systems handling it national security system which falls within the jurisdiction of the committee on national security systems and nsa who takes the lead in developing the policies and standards governing the systems being designed to handle this information

analysis and infrastructure protection directorate at dhs has both national cyber security division and the national communication system as the technologies of telecommunications and computer become even more inextricable there may appear to be some redundancies in the roles and responsibilities of these two entities the role of the ncs is well established from over 40 years of experience its jurisdiction while wide still deals primarily with those assets considered necessary for national security related communications or during times of national emergencies the ncsd has much wider mandate to work with all owners operators and users of the nations information 5 for example see white house scales back cyberspace plan the new york times february 14 2003
