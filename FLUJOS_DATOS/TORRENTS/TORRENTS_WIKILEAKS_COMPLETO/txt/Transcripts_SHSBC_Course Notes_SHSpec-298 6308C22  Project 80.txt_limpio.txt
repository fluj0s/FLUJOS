6308c22 shspec298 project 80 80 is mathematical trick to say oo and 0 it embraces all project 80 has to do with organizational targets dissemination and technical planning 1964 will be the year of scientology for everyone organizations suffer from loss of personnel one would be rich if one just lived and persisted long enough if you are persistent you yourself become sort of institution to solve problem is mest universe way of looking at things the right way is to find out how did it become problem lrh operates on the basis that if he conceives of problem he is about fortyeight hours away from seeing what made it problem an organizations problem of losing all its people is one that we have licked with all the shifts and changes we the people are the stability in the development of the tech we have the material for scientology 4 research towards ot see p 462 above making ots wrapped up as far as research is concerned in view is wrapping up of the betweenlives area so as to strip out the reportback mechanism it is bit tougher than lrh thought it would be there are in addition to gpms screentype incidents and postulationtype incidents the gpms are all negative on the beginning end of the screen and positive on the leaving end so the dichotomy makes them tend to collapse some rules for cleaning up charge faster have developed but it is all just auditing keeping the pcs attention directed to those areas of the track where he gets ta action that is the highest level of professional skill drills for thetan exterior is all wrapped up not everyone will reach the technical level of those who are at st hill who have been through all the developments and changes that is too much to expect auditors elsewhere are operating at different levels of reality which establish different levels of arc for them the gap between our r and theirs has been getting wider and wider so we are in an informed ivory tower with bridge behind us that is rather important this planet is in slightly different circumstances then others it has chance not to get tilted things put here tend to stay other nearby planets are more tightly governed and are harder to enter to salvage them they are invasionary planets this area used to be controlled by the espinol confederacy but their return platforms are closed off that spells defeat for them is there some other implantive system that is deeper into the heart of this galaxy system that is going to backfire against this one probably so it is probably coming up soon but conquerers almost always spare the jails we cant bet on the preservation of earth but we can bet on this planet having better chance of becoming rehabilitation center than other planets but what if we have left bridge in the rehabilitation center so that everybody flounders around with way to improve if you dont leave bridge you will wind up with group of people who are very angry at those who might assist them that would be very undesirable weve got to leave bridge however at present our feeder lines into the public are weak not organizationally but technically project 80 is the bridge it requires that we find what the public agrees with and use that to improve their arc up to another level and that we keep doing that in order to bring them up gradiently we are not necessarily improving their arc with us we are just improving their arc to point where we can hit another level of agreement the dynamics various scales the arc triangle and the dynamic principle of existence all of these are too hightoned for scientology 1 so they comprise scientology 2 see p 462 above for description of the scientology levels so we are back to 3060 day hcahpa training this is only possible because of the discovery of the itsa line some of you as auditors overlook what is win for pc knowing that your goal is to run out gpms etc you miss the fact that the pc has had win in being able to talk to an auditor when he couldnt talk to anyone before the feeling that one is getting case advance and real case advance lies in the fact that the itsa line is in and the ta is moving get the itsa line in and the ta moving and you will get level of improvement and result never before achieved this has nothing to do with significances if you get somebody talking about his health or his lumbosis you find out that the cures solutions decisions discoveries cognitions comments reiterations and hopes about that lumbosis in their aggregate caused the individual to have lumbosis if you get them off with ta action you get recovered lumbosis the condition could well vanish just from getting the pc to itsa about these cures etc this does not apply to broken legs yet someone who has been trained in getting an itsa line in and not cutting it given also some basic training in the auditors code the axioms the arc triangle the cdei scale etc would have good results and wins scientology 1 operates at the level of it is possible to have happy marriage or if you want to get along with children better listen to what they say and let them know you heard it dont just ignore them or employeeboss relations are mainly problems of communication in fact you should make communication the stable datum how you design this line is all regulated by what people can go into arc with you have to talk to people at level where they can have arc r1c is list of questions that you can use to get in an itsa line specific questions from this list could be used by book auditor to run on someones lumbosis this could be done on coaudit basis and would get fine results that is the auditing level of scientology 1 lower grade scientology 2 hpahca can get fabulous results with r2c r2c is r1c preceded by an assessment on the expanded cdei scale plus the eight dynamics see hcotf 17oct63 r2c slow assessment by dynamics as well as hcob 17oct63 r2c slow assessment by dynamics directions for use of hco technical form 17oct63 and hcob 31oct63 r2c slow assessment by dynamics continued the tone arm is used the pc first looks over the cdei scale to see which level best characterizes his life it might take ten minutes and it might take fifty hours the pc has to see which levels applied at which times in his life and where and how and which they are and how they relate etc you can get lot of ta on examining the scale eventually the pc comes out with level x now give him the eight dynamics expanded ie broken down into subparts he has to find out which ones he has been most concerned about this lifetime this could also take ten minutes or fifty hours eventually the pc comes out with dynamic therefore the question becomes x the pc gets asked about the combined assessments eg curious about children the question could have third component considerations solutions decisions about concern for so you have matched up the arc triangle with mest form and location the pc will start off with arc vs arc then when he can confront mest he will get into the sixth and seventh dynamics so as you repeat this operation the pc will go up the dynamics to the sixth and seventh this would be way of clearing this lifetime uppergrade scientology 2 would use r2h arc break dating and any other process like prepchecking that uses needle action as well as ta it is retread level for hpahcas so the lineup for scientology 1 and 2 is scn 1 nonauditing pelevel scientology b auditing book auditing on coaudit basis scn 2 lower level hpahca level uses r2c tone arm used only not needle action b upper level hpahca retread level processes using needle action and ta another element enters the scene the arc break assessment this would be specialized activity it can be done by central orgs or auditors in private practice to patch up field auditors pcs and at the same time the field auditor whose pc needs this action can be nudged about following the auditors code eg about keeping his mouth shut try to bring it home that arc break assessments need to be done we can use them both on pcs and on auditors you can keep lot of coauditors straightened out by having someone around to do arc break assessments you could have course in which you can give classification of hba hubbard book auditor the student gets gen on 1 the itsa line 2 the auditors code this course would also include testing and coaudits the whole secret of our communication is that it is up to us to establish the level of the communication that we engage in we have considered it somewhat dishonest to put our communication at level of anything less than everything we know but it isnt really dishonest to say less then we know there is reason to overwhelm people with all the data it would just be outreality there will be snags in the program there will always be people who are uncomfortable with motion and change these people will try overtly or covertly to stop it all they will be the people who despair of getting result by doing the usual because they wont do it they will be the ones who keep applying unusual solutions dont get your attention pinned on one bad apple and forget that everywhere else it is going fine to do this would be to embark on crusade in an illadvised direction probably all evil generates from too great concentration on evil if you concentrate on how the show isnt getting on the road when it is in fact on the road you will contribute to keeping it from being on the road you should take care of such matters on routine rather than an emergency basis when we have auditing at lower levels totally shaped around the definition of an auditor as listener we will have trouble getting the whole project well done
