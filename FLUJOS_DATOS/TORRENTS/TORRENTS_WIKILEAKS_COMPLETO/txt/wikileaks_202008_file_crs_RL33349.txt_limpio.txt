over 100 reported human deaths from vietnam to turkey and appearing in birds in africa and europe the strain is considered particularly dangerous because of its human fatality rate to date of over 50 and because of the risk that the virus may develop the ability to pass efficiently between humans this report focuses on the efforts of overseas governments to combat the spread of avian influenza specifically on the response of those countries which have confirmed human deaths from the virus as of august 2006 the vast majority of fatal and total cases have been in east asia including vietnam

appearing in birds and humans in hong kong in 1997 the virus resurfaced in late 2003 and since has spread throughout asia causing over 130 reported human deaths from vietnam to turkey and appearing in birds in africa and europe the strain is considered particularly dangerous because of an apparent fatality rate of well over 50 and because of the risk that the virus may develop the ability to pass efficiently between humans international health officials fear that some countries could constitute weak link in prevention efforts by allowing the disease to spread through birds to humans and possibly mutating into form that can be passed easily among humans though varying widely the typical national response to confirmed outbreak of h5n1 has included quarantining the area of infection culling or vaccinating exposed or atrisk poultry and wild birds restricting the movement of poultry for trading purposes testing and treating exposed humans initiating public information campaigns and seeking access to antiviral medication the most effective government responses have established clear directives for which ministries are in charge of prevention and containment mobilized resources and political authority to enhance surveillance efforts and have worked closely with international health authorities and neighboring countries congress provided 313 million for international avian flu activities through fy2005 emergency supplemental appropriations fy2006 emergency supplemental appropriations reserved 280 million for global h5n1 initiatives the administration requested 215

sarah lister crs2 overview of international responses east asia in east asia the epicenter of the h5n1 outbreak the degree and sophistication of preparation for avian influenza varies widely among the affected countries in many cases government response and openness to international health authorities appear to have improved from the experience of dealing with the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak in 20031 the more affluent governments have undertaken extensive measures and have committed national resources to hedge against the risk of pandemic japan and taiwan reportedly have accumulated stockpiles of antiviral medication for human treatment and are preparing to manufacture their own supply singapore has reportedly stockpiled antivirals for 15 of its population enhanced surveillance and put detailed contingency plan in place who world health organization the health agency of the united nations officials praised an exercise run by south korea that simulated how the government would respond to an outbreak2 outbreaks in birds reported in japan and south korea were subsequently controlled and both are now considered free of the disease among the hardesthit countries thailand and vietnam struggled to control initial outbreaks but largely have been praised by health officials for containing the virus through the commitment of government resources and international assistance continuing to report new human cases in 2006 the central governments in indonesia and china have launched determined campaigns but face considerable challenges in poor public health infrastructure limited resources for compensation of farmers and lack of government transparency cambodia and laos with little capacity for reporting cases because of minimal transportation and communication networks represent possible gaps in documented cases given their geographic proximity to thailand and vietnam which struggle with ongoing outbreaks in poultry on the far end of the spectrum the closed governments of burma myanmar and north korea offer little reliable information about the presence of bird flu within their borders although both yangon and pyongyang have provided limited cooperation with international organizations outbreaks within their borders could constitute weak link in the event of pandemic central asia and the middle east human cases were reported outside of east asia until early 2006 confirmed human deaths from h5n1 in turkey iraq and azerbaijan heightened international concern about the scope of potential pandemic turkish authorities although slow to respond to the initial outbreak have welcomed international help and taken strong measures to contain the virus in the infected areas the ongoing instability in iraq 1 sars first appeared in china in 2002 and eventually infected at least 8098 people in 26 countries according to the who the disease died out later in 2003 2 the front lines in the battle against avian flu are running short of money the new york times october 9 2005 crs3 has prevented h5n1 from being top priority for authorities in baghdad and public information on the cases is limited h5n1 in animals continues to spread fear of human deaths and economic damage from h5n1 has spurred other countries to step up national and multilateral efforts as the disease has spread rapidly among birds through three continents in february 2006 the world organization for animal health known by its french acronym oie reported spike in the number of countries confirming the h5n1 virus in birds all outside of the asia epicenter3 as of august 2006 the total number of countries with confirmed cases in birds was approaching 60 many cases in birds have been confirmed outside the developing world in countries with relatively poor

iraq is not included in this section because of the dearth of available information africa4 in early july the presence of h5n1 in poultry had been confirmed in seven sub saharan african countries nigeria niger cameroon sudan burkina faso cote divoire and djibouti have reported poultry outbreaks the outbreak in nigeria is seen as notable because nigeria is the most populous country in africa5 and because it is seen as likely source of the h5n1 detected in niger and cameroon in may 2006 djibouti confirmed the first human case of avian flu infection6 nigerias response nigerian authorities responded to the detection of h5n1 by quarantining affected farms destroying suspected infected birds and testing poultry and people who have close contact with poultry on commercial farms policies call for all birds within three kilometers of each infected site to be culled though this was reportedly not taking place in all instances and for presumptive h5n1 cases to be treated as actual cases pending testing national and state authorities formed integrated response teams though initially national ministries primarily health and agriculture reportedly coordinated their h5n1 responses separately officials have launched public information campaigns providing safety and education messages about bird flu and advising the public to report bird deaths and have begun to compensate farmers for losses due to h5n1 control measures7 extensive selloffs of poultry nationwide by bird owners seeking to minimize potential economic losses followed the reported detection of h5n1 in

poorest forgotten in bird flu compensation payouts march 9 2006 crs5 order to prevent the further spread of the disease officials tried to ban sales and intrastate trade of poultry but with reportedly mixed results international experts found that such efforts were not being implemented uniformly or completely joint federalstate nigerian healthcare teams are testing suspected h5n1exposed persons such as poultry workers such testing has reportedly been stymied by lack of bird flu testing kits only symptoms of flu and respiratory infections were initially being checked and lack of knowledge by

the patients may have been working together to gather feathers from wild bird carcasses after confirmation of the outbreak several measures were taken by the government state commission to prevent the spread of bird flu coordinated the government response with its members including the ministers of agriculture economic development ecology finance public health and interior the chairman of the state customs committee and the director of the state border service the commission was charged with providing information on the flu to the public and to formulate preventive measures authorities banned all imports of live poultry or poultry meat and allocated 33 million from the reserve fund of the state budget to improve veterinary services and purchase disinfection equipment and protective clothing some observers accused azerbaijani authorities of being inadequately prepared to respond to the avian flu outbreak the head of one azerbaijani ngo criticized the government for allegedly moving too slowly to inform the public about possible human cases cambodia13 since february 2005 five cambodians have died from the h5n1 avian flu virus four in kampot province in 2005 and one in kompong speu province near phnom penh in march 2006 all cambodian victims lived in areas where poultry had fallen ill and died oie has confirmed more cases in birds in 2006 health experts predict that more cases in cambodia are likely compared to thailand poultry farms are smaller but more numerous and many chickens roam freely while transportation and communications links are far less developed hence monitoring the nations poultry stocks is more difficult despite warnings many villagers have eaten birds that had been sick because food is not plentiful furthermore the cambodian government has limited capacity to contain outbreaks the united states government assessment team that visited laos cambodia and vietnam in july 2005 reported that the us government fao and who have strong working

the peoples republic of china prc renewed fears that the spread of h5n1 could accelerate within china the close proximity of millions of people birds and animals in southern china has made it common breeding ground for deadly viruses including the h5n1 avian flu virus that jump the species barrier to humans additionally the prcs poor public health infrastructure and the communist governments traditional lack of transparency have made international health specialists particularly concerned about the prc as possible contributor to an h5n1 global flu pandemic health care specialists have cited the prc governments early lack of cooperation during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars previously unknown virus that surfaced in southern china in 2003 as principal cause for that virus quick global spread before it was contained17 as of august 14 2006 21 cases of human h5n1 infection had been reported in china of which 14 were fatal the most recent of these deaths involved 62yearold male farmer from the xinjiang uigur autonomous region in the northwestern part of the country recent poultry outbreaks have been reported in the vicinity of the mans home the zinging uigur autonomous region had not previously reported human case18 the world organization for animal health has also confirmed continuing outbreak of h5n1 infections in birds in china in2006 in hong kong in late 1997 the h5n1 avian flu virus was recorded as jumping directly from its traditional animal species to humans for the first time infecting 18 people in hong kong and killing six although the hong kong government responded aggressively at that time in three days exterminating its entire poultry population of 15 million birds the 1997 outbreak marked the beginning of the cycle

conference further announced the adoption and immediate implementation of contingency regulations to combat the spread of the disease and to punish government officials that delay or obfuscate medical and scientific reports about the virus the regulations include requirements that provincial and municipal level officials notify the central government within four hours after new flu outbreak by november 2005 prc officials confirmed that they had either destroyed or vaccinated millions of healthy domestic poultry and that they were planning to inoculate the entire chinese poultry population massive effort which would include as many as 14 billion chickens geese and ducks22 as logistical effort the initiative faces daunting difficulties first among them the sheer size of chinas poultry population and the fact that the poultry industry is widely scattered including millions of rural households with dozen or fewer chickens that roam free second according to medical experts to be fully effective the poultry vaccine must be given in two separate doses about month apart meaning the entire undertaking has to be performed twice23 in addition some health officials have expressed concern that such broad campaign could backfire and actually contribute to spreading the disease further potential problems include the use of unlicensed or substandard vaccines problem announced in liaoning province in 2005 which could mask flu symptoms in birds but leave them still contagious24 and the possibility that vaccinators 19 us centers for disease control avian influenza current situation at

there have been 5 deaths since midfebruary 2006 when avian influenza was first detected in egypt since then it has spread to 19 of egypts 26 provinces in response the government has reportedly ordered the mass culling of poultry banned the transportation of live poultry between provinces closed markets of birds in all villages and towns and banned the slaughtering or selling of poultry in private stores the government estimates that at least 10 million birds have been culled the egyptian government believes that avian flu was first spread by infected birds mixing with chickens ducks and pigeons which are raised on peoples apartment rooftops to supplement their income as developing country with the largest population in the arab world egypt has an estimated 25 million people employed in the agricultural sector with the majority of these workers farming small plots of land many rural workers are illiterate and have little or access to government services including quality health care under these circumstances containing the spread of bird flu has been particularly troublesome as government awareness campaigns may be ineffective in the egyptian countryside and some farmers may be unwilling to slaughter their chickens several children were reportedly infected after playing with infected poultry in addition many egyptians continue to improperly dispose of bird carcasses and after carcasses were found in the nile rumors spread that the nile had been infected with the virus and sales of bottled water skyrocketed indonesia37 although indonesia was initially viewed as weak link in the effort to curb an outbreak of avian flu jakarta has made strides in stepping up its prevention and containment campaign as the outbreak has become more severe still lack of resources expertise and slow recognition of the problem has hindered indonesias response indonesia has population of some 13 billion chickens with as many as 400 million of those in informal settings such as family farms or in some cases balconies of urban apartment buildings in 2003 when h5n1 was first seen in the bird population there was not much alarm in indonesia as the virus was not generally viewed as significant threat to humans the virus is now considered endemic in the bird population of indonesia and outbreaks in birds have been reported in most of indonesias provinces concern grew in june

in indonesia surpassing vietnam in number of fatalities from the virus while indonesia was viewed as initially trying to cover up the outbreak the government has more recently moved to address the problem plans to stem the spread of the disease should it mutate into pandemic strain and spread more widely among human populations involve rapid reaction and vaccine distribution such an approach is dependent on early detection and reporting by local health officials as well as the availability of resources necessary to treat an outbreak in addition the government announced plans to establish national commission for bird flu control that includes all ministries private and nongovernmental agencies and the red cross38 in december 2005 indonesia announced threeyear national strategic plan to

indonesia agreed to give full access to its h5n1 data to foreign scientists55 laos56 an outbreak of h5n1 in poultry was confirmed in early 2004 but laos has had known cases in humans and new outbreaks

the vast majority of poultryrearing in laos takes place in smaller familyrun farms some experts argue that there is an urgent need for foreign health organizations to focus upon and assist laos given its proximity to other countries with the disease and the lack of government capacity particularly its weakness in surveillance the central and local governments have limited capabilities for collecting and disseminating information monitoring avian populations and conducting laboratory analysis to confirm cases of the virus in addition according to us government assessment team that

confirmed human cases in russia the avian flu spread to eight southern regions of russia including two regions bordering the caspian sea but did not spread north toward moscow62 most observers judged russia as fairly efficient in identifying avian influenza and working with international health organizations at least at the outset the areas where the outbreaks occurred were quarantined poultry or products were permitted to be exported beyond the areas poultry in these areas exposed to h5n1 were slaughtered and many people were examined other observers raised concerns about russias ultimate capacity to respond to the spreading virus or to deal with human cases they warned that since russia has devoted few budgetary resources in recent years to improving public health services it has not
