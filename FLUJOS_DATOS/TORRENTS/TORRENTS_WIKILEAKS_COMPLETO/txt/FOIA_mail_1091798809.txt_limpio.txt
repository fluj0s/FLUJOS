from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to janice lough jloughaimsgovau subject re liked the paper date fri aug 6 092649 2004 janice most of the data series in most of the plots have just appeared on the cru web site go to data then to paleoclimate did this to stop getting hassled by the skeptics for the data series mike mann refuses to talk to these people and i can understand why they are just trying to find if weve done anything wrong i sent one of them loads of series and he barely said thankyou it seems they are now going for tom crowley lonnie thompson and gordon jacoby as most of their series are not on web sites below is link to an awful piece by legates he told he is writing paper but wrote the press release first the pdf is worth getting for couple of sentences when he said that mj restricted their use of paleo series to those that had correlations with instrumental data it is classic our uncertainty estimates are based solely on how well the proxy records match the observed data the legates piece must have been sent to loads of environment correspondents across the world and number of oped pieces appeared some were awful most have had responses from ray bradley caspar amman and others hope all is well with you and all the best to all glad you enjoyed the paper cheers phil ps do you want to get involved in ipcc this time im the cla of the atmospheric obs chapter with kevin trenberth and well be looking for contributing authors to help the lead authors we have paleo is in different section this time led by peck and eystein janssen keith is lead author as well phil jones has made valid point in that some of the articles cited in my critique do not directly address problems with mann and jones mj but rather address problems with earlier works by mann bradley and hughes mbh and other colleagues fair enough i have changed the critique to reflect that fact the revised version has been posted since july 19 at 1httpwwwncpaorgpubbaba478ba478pdf however i still contend that most of my original arguments namely the problems with the shaft blade and sheath apply equally to mann and jones as well as the other mann et manifestations of the hockey stick mj incorporate data from number of the same sources as those used by mbh for example manns unpublished pc1 from the western north american treering data cooks tasmanian tree rings thompsons quelccaya and dunde ice core oxygen isotope records the latter embedded in yangs chinese composite and fishers stacked greenland ice core oxygen isotope record calibration and verification of mj includes the flawed mbh curve thus any errors in mbh effectively undermine the calibrationverification results of mj leaving this study unsupported and any problems with the underlying common proxies identified in critiques of mbh will also result in identical problems in mj my criticism regarding the blade is that 06 deg c warming for the last century is noted by the ipcc whereas mj and other m et representations have up to 095 deg c warming in their observed record see mjs figure 2 where for the global and nh reconstruction their estimates for 2000 exceed 04 and 05 nearly 06 respectively mjs nh curve is included in the attached graph thus i stand by my criticism of mj on this point which is more egregious in mj than other m et representations from jones the trend over the 20th century in the figure and in the instrumental data ipcc quotes 06 deg c over the 19012000 period fact but legates is eyeballing the curve to get 095 deg c figure isnt given in mann and jones 2003 take it from the trend is about the same as the instrumental record funny but there is figure in mj see their figure 2 as for eyeballing an apparently nonexistent curve i attach figure from soon et 2004 that contains portion of mjs figure 2 to allow others to decide for themselves whether mj suggest twentieth century warming of 06 deg c or 095 deg c moreover maybe someone can explain why every time mann and his colleagues draft another curve the temperature in 2000 gets warmer and warmer after the fact my criticisms regarding the sheath largely from paper on which i am working stem from the characterization of the uncertainty by mj that arises solely from the fit statistics to the 16001855 period using crossvalidation with not observations but composites of three previously compiled reconstructions including that developed by mbh the focus of known flaws and errors in the shaft note that some of the same data are used in both mbh and mj which doesnt allow for truly independent crossvalidation my rather obvious point was not that fit statistics should not be included as jones asserts but that mj included errors in either input realization observations or proxy data or other obvious sources of error the claim by mbh and mj is that only the model lackoffit contributes to uncertainty is inherently flawed considerable errors exist in the representation of both fields annual temperatures from both observations and proxy records and must be incorporated clearly there is spatial bias associated with observations that are biased away from the oceans high latitudes and high altitudes the spatial problem is far more pronounced when only handful of proxies are used to represent the global temperatures at earlier time periods both mbh and mj are equally guilty in this regard david r legates at 1555 06082004 1000 you wrote dear phil just finished reading your paper with mike m in rev of geophysics which i very much enjoyed will let you know when it hits the mission
