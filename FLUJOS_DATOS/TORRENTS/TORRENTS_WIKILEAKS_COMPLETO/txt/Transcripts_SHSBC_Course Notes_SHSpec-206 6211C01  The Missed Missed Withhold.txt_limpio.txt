6211c01 shspec206 the missed missed withhold lrh enumerates the many bulletins that have come out on missed withholds starting in february 1962 in spite of all this the subject has not been duplicated by students people keep picking up withholds instead of missed withholds all arc breaks stem from missed withholds i dont know exactly how to get this across to you except to be brave squint up your eyes and plunge get the missed withhold missed withhold is withhold that people nearly found out about but didnt you want to find out what people almost found out withhold is something pc did and isnt talking about it is not missed unless someone nearly found out about it the missed withhold has nothing to do with what the pc did or is doing its not the pcs action it is the other persons action and the pcs wonder about it it often shows up as recurring withhold one which the pc keeps giving you the charge keeps coming up because of the restimulation as yet unlocated of someone possibly finding out missed withhold has nothing to do with the pc it is another persons action and the pcs wonder about it forget that it is even withhold you are looking for exact moments in the lifetime of this pc when somebody almost found out and hes never been sure since whether they did or they didnt we dont care what they almost found out we only care that they almost found out something that is the address to missed withhold its an otherpersonthanthepcs action its an other persons action the pc is stuck in the unknownness of the uncertainty as to whether someone else knew this blows when the pc spots it missed withhold is an overt and withhold plus mystery the magnitude of the overt has nothing to do with its evaporation the degree of mystery is what holds it in place if you want to know what is sticking thetan to something look for the mystery sandwich even overts themselves wind up in the mystery of whether you should have done it this causes withholding of further action all things boil down to right conduct so when you ask the pc for missed withholds be alert for whether the pc is giving you withholds or missed withholds the number of withholds person has on the whole track is undoubtedly staggering you dont need to get them all to clear somebody the whole anatomy of game is ow you gather energies by the mechanism of ow which result in solidmass terminals making game possible etc in spite of all that you dont have time enough to run nut all the pcs overts even for one lifetime general ow does have its uses it is useful for getting the pc into session and smoothing things out but it is generally too lengthy so to see case go sproing ask the pc for nearlyfoundouts when i tell you to pick up pcs missed withhold i want you to pick up another persons action not the pcs and it is best characterized as nearly found out you are running the almostdiscovered track youll never see anybody quite so upset as somebody who has been just barely missed look at pedestrian who was not hit or bear that is biting at bullet that just missed him or an exam that you failed by one or two points its the nearness of the miss that counts it is misestimation of effort or thought thetans main attention is on estimation of thought effort and look he wants to know how much look is look his certainties are all based on proper estimation of thought effort look etc when an error is made here it is upsetting how much knowledge is knowingness that is an estimation how much emotion does it take to be emotional enough to create the desired effect what is proper symbol etc you can estimate everything except how much mystery constitutes mystery because that is mystery you are now into the noestimation band and it is all mysterious the notknowingness of it is upsetting notknowingness that is probably known is especially painful because of the multiple notknow flows involved take notknowingness and play with it both ways they knew but they didnt or couldnt have known you know they knew but you know they didnt know the fourway flows of missed withhold are painful to thetan this is the stuff of which insanity is made insanity in the effort band of the know to mystery scale is cant reachmust reach insanity in the mystery band is diddidnt mustmustnt know that is what missed withhold is and what it is doing to the pc its just pure mystery mucilage and the thetan will stick right to it getting just the overt and withhold off when there is an added mystery of missed withhold doesnt produce an asisness of the section of track where the pc is stuck because the pc is not stuck with the overt or the withhold the pc is stuck with the almost found out so of course nothing asises if you only get the ows and you get recurring withhold you could get remarkable results running get the idea of people nearly finding out about you you could run this on three flows this process would free up track that the pc had never seen before but which had been right in front of his nose so when pulling missed withholds it is not what the pc did which is of interest when pulling withholds get the name rank and serial number of the person who missed it i couldnt care less what was missed i dont want the pcs action i want the pcs guess about the other guy get who the pc thinks might know etc etc if you have gotten off his overts on something and he still feels bit weird about it you are apt to think that he must have more overts so you keep after him for more this will send him around the bend since you are essentially cleaning clean you have to find 1 who nearly discovered the overt 2 when 3 how often this is what is needed to complete the cycle that was started when the overt was almost discovered just as far as time is concerned it is mystery sandwich the thetan is wondering whether certain punitive track is going to happen it doesnt so that time doesnt exist the result in the creation of mockedup track that never actually appears on the track and therefore hangs up in time not dropping the other shoe is like producing missed withhold so you dont ask what have we failed to find out about you ask what have we nearly found out about you and when did we nearly find it out the first gets withholds the second gets missed withholds the worst type of missed withhold is where the pc is asking himself which one of my crimes did he maybe discover
