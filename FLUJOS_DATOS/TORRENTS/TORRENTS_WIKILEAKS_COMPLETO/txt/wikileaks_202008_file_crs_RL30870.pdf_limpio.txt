legal issues re data for reapportionment and redistricting summary the release of the 2000 cens us data for the apportionment of the house of representatives among the states and the release of the state redistricting data to the states as required by pl 94171 has renewed the decennial debate over several issues first the debate over the use of sampling to adjust the decennial population census data was not completely resolved by the us supreme court decision that federal statute prohibits the use of sampling to adjust the decennial census for the purposes of apportionment of the house of representatives among the states the court did not hold that the adjustment of census data for other purposes such as intrastate redistricting was prohibited additionally last year the census bureau indicated that it would likely release both adjusted and unadjusted sets of data in the wake of these developments there were legislative efforts in many states to specify which data are to be used in intrast ate redistricting controversy surrounded preclearance under the voting rights act for some state laws meanwhile the transition between administrations resulted in policy change concerning the release of adjusted census data for redistricting last year the secretary of commerce promulgated rule which delegated the decision to adjust the official decennial census figures to the director of the census bureau and required the release of adjusted figures where the secretary chose not to release them as the official redistricting data despite the recommendation of the executive steering committee for accuracy and coverage evaluation policy escap to adjust the data this year the secretary of commerce under the new administration rescinded that rule and took back the authority to decide to adjust state redistricting census data the city of angeles joined by other municipalities filed suit challenging the anticipated change in policy on the grounds that proper rulemaking procedures were not followed the suit relied on the assumption that the escap would recommend to adjust however on march 1 2001 the acting director of the census bureau and escap recommended not to adjust redistricting data accordingly on march 6 2001 the secretary announced the releas of the unadjusted data since this appeared to render the angeles suit moot the city attorney for angeles announced that he would amend the complaint to add new allegations that the secretarys decision is arbitrary and capricious and violates the census act which requires the secretary to use statistical sampling where he considers it feasible for purposes of the census other than apportionmen t of the house of representatives congress has the constitutional authority to determine issues of census methodology including whether or not the release of adjusted data suitable for intrastate redistricting purposes is feasible second utah has filed suit challenging the apportionment of the house of representatives on the grounds that expatriate utahans specifically missionaries for the church of jesus christ of the latterday saints should have been included in the population count for utah such an inclusion would have meant that utah would have gained congressional seat which went to north carolina instead although the us supreme court held previously that the secretary of commerce had the discret ion to include overseas federal personnel in the apportionment census it did not address the issue of whether other expatriates should be included as well once the decision was made to include

representatives among the states because the court stated in one part of its opinion that section 195 of the census act requires the use of statistical sampling in assembling the myriad demographic data that are collected in connection with the decennial census5 supporters of adjustment argued that sampling techniques were not only permissible but were required in the taking of the census for the purposes of intrastate redistricting and federal funding allocations they indicated an intention to seek the use of sampling techniques in population counts used for intrastate redistricting and funding allocation formulas other case law arguably supports the use of figures other than the official data for apportionment of the house of representatives among the states the federal constitution does not require the use of federal decennial census data for intrastate congressional and state legislative redistricting it only provides for the use of census data for apportionment among the states not for redistricting and reapportionment within them federal courts have held that states are not required to use federal census data adjusted or unadjusted for redistricting and therefore the bureau of the census itself has duty or requirement to provide the states with adjusted data for redistricting purposes in the 1969 supreme court decision in kirkpatrick v preisler6 involvi ng missouris congressional redistricting plan the supreme court while invalidating the plan nevertheless indicated that the use of projected popul ation figures was not per unconstitutional and that states may properly consider such statistical data if such data would have high degree of accuracy however the court also stated that the federal decennial census data were the best data available7 in senate of the state of california v mosbacher8 in which the state senate was suing for the release of adjusted data after the bureau decided not to adjust the official 1990 census data the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit noted that if state knows that census data is underrepresentative of the population it can and should utilize noncensus data in addition to the official count for

us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit held that the statistically adjusted data was exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act in young v klutznick suit by the city of detroit to get an adjustment of the alleged undercount in the 1980 census data in dicta the appeals court stated that the state legislature is not required by the federal constitution to use census data supplied by the bureau for congressional redistricting but could use adjusted population figures when redistricting between decennial censuses as long as the adjust ment is thoroughly documented and applied in systematic manner14 in city of detroit v franklin 15 the city sought an adjustment of the alleged undercount in the 1990 census data and argued that the causation analysis by the court of appeals in the case involving the 1980 census had been overruled by the holding in karcher v daggett 16 the city argued that in karcher the us supreme court held that the apportionment clause imposes an obligation on states to use only the official population count as determined by the bureau in redistricting this argument is probably based on the sentence adopting any standard other than population equality using the best census data available would subtly erode the constitutions ideal of equal representation17 and the fact that the court considered the census data the only reliable indication of the districts relative population levels18 the district court in city of detroit held that the plaintiffs misconstrued karcher and that it did not hold that states must use census figures in redistricting and did not overrule young rather the supreme court had merely reiterated wellestablished rule of constitutional law states are required to use the best census data available or the best population data available in their attempts to effect proportionate political representation19 in the cases above except for kirkpatrick v preisler where the courts held that the states

electionactivities the plaintiff states had chosen to use the total population based on federal census figures as the basis for redist ricting activities and sued to obtain the census data as adjusted by the census bureau federal courts have also considered cases where state legislatures did not use federal decennial census data or even total population data as the basis for redistricting activities in kirkpatrick the state legislature apparently performed rather haphazard adjustments and projections based on total population and the court found that the legislature had not justified its methodolo gy in burns v richardson 20 the supreme court held that in state legislative redistricting cases the constitution does not require the states to use total population figures derived from the federal census as the standard of measurement the court noted that in earlier cases it was careful to leave open the question of what population basis was appropria in redistricting activities even though in several cases total population figures were in fact the basis for comparison when determining whether the equal protection clause of the constitution had been violated the court recognized that in particular case total population might not be the appropriate basis for redistricting plans in the burns case hawaii had used the number of registered voters as the basis for redistricting the state senate the court found that the redistricting plan satisfies the equal protection clause only because on this record it was found to have produced distribution of legislators not substantially different from that which would have resulted from the use of permissible population basis21 hawaii was found to have unique situation wherein the significant number of tourists military personnel and other transient population segments distorted the distribution of actual state citizens the redistricting plan that would have resulted from total population basis would not have reflected the true state population distribution as accurately as state citizen population basis since registered voter population basis was the closest approximat ion of state citizen population basis the use of the registered voter population basis was deemed consistent with the equal protection clause however the court was careful to note that the ruling in the burns case did not establish the validity of the unique redistr icting population basis for all time or circumstances22 although the federal decennial census figures need not be used as the basis for redistricting activities any alternate figures used must be shown to be the best data available or to be justified by particular circumstances as resultin g in more accurate redistricting plan than one based on federal decennial census total population figures since under the federal cons titution the states arguably can and should use data other than the officia l apportionment census data in their own redistricting process

prescribe redistricting procedure by statute for state legislative redistricting many do not have statutory procedure for congressional redistricting the state legislatures in such states conduct the congressional redistricting as they decide on an ad hoc basis after federal decennial census this means that often in such states there is explicit statutory requirement to use official federal decennial census data for congressional redistricting although there may be such an explicit requirement for state legislative redistricting to the extent that states own laws do not explicitly require the use of official federal decennial census data for intrastate redistricting the state is free to use any other data even if states laws require the use of official federal decennial census data it is unclear what reference to official federal decennial census data would mean if the federal government released two official sets of data this issue was also considered during the oral arguments in the census sampling cases23 if the secretary of commerce transmits an official second adjusted data set that data arguably could still be considered official federal decennial census data even if it is not the data used for apportionment of the house of representatives one should note that the courts holding on standing for the plaintiffs in department of commerce v us house of representatives indicates that majority of the court considers the references to official federal decennial census data to be reference to the apportionment data24 because of the absence of sufficiently clear and explicit statutory guidelines concerning the appropriate data to be used in intrastate congressional and state legislative redistricting activities at the time of the decision in department of commerce v us house of representatives in the wake of that decision there was flurry of state legislative activity concerning the type of federa l decennial census data to be used in intrastate redistricting although there has been congressional activity concerning state redistricting census data as yet there is potential role for congress in determining what data will likely be used by the states state legislative activity since the 1999 supreme court decision concerning sampling majority of the states have considered legislation concerning the type of data to be used for

constitute change in redistricting laws and practices requiring preclearance 2 that the new law does not have the purpose nor will have the effect of abridging the right to vote of minority voters and 3 that the attorney generals plans to use adjusted figures in evaluations of redistricting plans violates federal law another claim dealt with part of the law unrelated to redistricting census data

census data39 after this decision resulted in lawsuits challenging the decision the secretary planned to make the adjustment decision personall according to guidelines pursuant to court order in the main adjustment lawsuit at that time40 ultimately following process pursuant to these guidelines the secretary decided to not adjust41 the litigation over this decision culminated in the us supreme court decision in wisconsin v city of new york 42 the supreme court held that the secretary of commerce had acted within his broad powers over the census in manner consistent with the constitutional goal of equal representation in deciding not to adjust the 1990 census data in light of the fact that there was clear consensus among experts that the adjusted data were superior to the unadjusted data although the supreme court did consider the goal of equal representation to be important it did not find that the goal was violated by the use of unadjusted data in wisconsin the court did not decide whether congress had constrained the secretarys authority to decide not tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30870crs11 43517 us at 19 note 11adjust the census since the issue was not raised by the parties to the case43 as noted above in department of commerce v us house of representatives the court found that section 195 of the census act require d the secretary to use statistical sampling techniques if he considere d it feasible for purposes other than apportionment of the house of representatives proponents of sampling interpret this as meaning that adjustment must be used for intrastate redistricting data if feasible the issue to be raised by the city of angeles that the secretary refused to adjust although adjustment was feasible has not been decided before but the recommendation of the acting census director and the escap would seem to constitute finding within the census bureau and the commerce department that adjustment within the statutory timetable for reporting redistricting data was not feasible congressional activity although the adjustment debate has moved to the state legislatures and the federal courts for the moment there is possible congressional role should congress choose to intervene congress could legislatively require that the census bureau make adjusted data available whether or not it is the official data transmitted through the pl 94171 program just as it has already required the release of unadjusted data under pl 105119 as noted above although congress has not explicitly required states to use federal decennial census data in congressional redistricting it could arguably do so under the same constitutional powers which give congress the authority to establish other redist ricting guidelines if it chooses art i 2 cl 1 which provides that the members of the house of representatives shall be chosen by the people and art i 4 cl 1 giving congress the authority to determine the times places and manner of holding elections for members of congress where it is not clear that one data set is more accurate than the other and the constitutional goal of equal representation is not implicated arguably congress could require that particular type of data unadjusted or adjusted be used in congressional redistricting however it could not do so with regard to the redraw ing of state legislative or municipal districts which remain the preroga tive of the states as long as constitutional voting rights are violated hr941 introduced by rep james clyburn on march 8 2001 would require the use of

involve challenge to redistric ting statute thus it may take longer for the suit to reach final resolution since decision by threejudge panel could have been appealed directly to the us supreme court whereas now decision would have to be appealed to the us court of appeals for the 10th circuit before any potential hearing before the us supreme court the house has delayed certification of the disputed seat until after district court decision on march 20 north carolina has joined the federal government in opposing the suit by utah with regard to census methodology the leading relevant decision is that of franklin v massachusetts 45 in which the united states supreme court upheld the decision of the secretary of commerce to include and allocate overseas federal employees in the census data for the apportionment of the house of representatives which resulted in loss of one congressional seat for massachusetts the court held that there was final agency action reviewable under the administrative procedure act and that the allocation of overseas federal employees to their home states was consistent with the usual residence standard of other censuses and furthered the constitutional goal of equal representation however the issue of distinguishing between overseas federal employees and other expatriate us citizens by including the former in the census and excluding the latter was not before the court and was not decided by it congress could have role by legislatively mandating the inclusion of all expatriate us citizens in the decennial census one bill has been introduced by representative malo ney hr 680 to provide funds for special census of expatriates and to urge the census bureau to plan for the inclusion of expatriates in the 2010 census46 according to franklin v massachusetts the decision to include overseas federal employees in the 1990 census appears to have been in response to legislative activity in the late 1980s additional reading crs info
