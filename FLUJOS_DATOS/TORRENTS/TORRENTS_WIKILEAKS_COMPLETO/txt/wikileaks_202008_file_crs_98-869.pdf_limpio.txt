understanding the problem summary an adequate level of dissolved oxygen is necessary to support most forms of aquatic life while very low levels of dissolved oxygen hypoxia can be natural especially in deep ocean basins and fjords hypoxia in coastal waters is mostly the result of human activities that have modified landscapes or increased nutrients entering these waters hypoxic areas ar more widespread during the summer when algal blooms stimulated by spring runo ff decompose to diminish oxygen such hypoxic areas may drive out or kill animal life and usually dissipate by winter in many places where hypoxia has occurred previously it is now more severe and longer lasting in others where hypoxia did not exist historically it now does and these areas are becoming more prevalent the largest hypoxic area affecting the united states is in the northern gulf of mexico near the mouth of the mississippi ri ver but there are others as well most us coastal estuaries and many devel oped nearshore areas suffer from varying degrees of hypoxia causing various envi ronmental damages research has been conducted to better identify th human activities that affect the intensity and duration of as well as the area affected by hypoxic events and to begin formulating control strategies near the end of the 105th congress the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia research and control act of 1998

annelid worms are more tolerant of low oxygen conditions and can survive hypoxic episodes that last many weeksmarine dead zones understanding the problem introduction and background hypoxia refers to depressed concentr ation of dissolved oxygen in water while definitions vary somewhat by region it is generally agreed that hypoxia in marine environment occurs seasonally when dissolved oxygen levels fall below 23 milligrams per liter normal dissolved oxygen concentrations in nearshore marine waters range between 5 and 8 milligrams per liter and many fish species begin having respiratory difficulties at concentrations below 5 milligrams per liter in extremely low oxygen environments less to lerant marine animals cannot survive and either leave the area or die1 mortality is especially likely for sedentary species in addition spawning areas and ot her essential habitat can be destroyed by the lack of oxygen if these conditions persist so called dead zone may develop in which little marine life exists2 the recovery of marine ecosystems following hypoxic event has not been extensively studied decreased concentrations of dissolved oxygen result in part from natural eutrophication when nutrients eg nitrog and phosphorus and sunlight stimulate algal growth eg algae seaweed and phytoplankton increasing the amount of organic matter in an aquatic ecosystem over decades and centuries as organisms die and sink to the bottom they are consumed decomposed by oxygendependent bacteria depleting the water of oxygen when this eutrophication is extensive and persistent bottom waters may become hypoxic or even anoxic dissolved oxygen while surface waters can be completely normal and full of life hypoxia is more likely to occur in coastal waters where the water column is stratified ie layered because of differences in temperat ure or salinity or both marine dead zones become most noticeable when and where natural eutrophication has been accelerated by humaninfluenced increases in nutrient loads hypoxia often develops as result of upwelled ocean waters particularly along the western coast of the americas in many instances cool nutrientrich deep marine waters rise along the coastal ma rgin and support massive algal blooms that lead to hypoxia in other instances upwelle d deep water is simply devoid of oxygen eutrophication as result of human activ ities usually

sewage plants and emissions from vehicles power plan ts and other industrial sources hypoxic zones frequently occur in coas tal areas where rivers enter the ocean eg estuaries rivers deliver fresh waters that are rich in nutrients to the saltier estuaries and coastal oceans the fresh wa ter is less dense than the salt water and typically flows across the top of the sea water the fresh surface water effectively caps the more dense saline bottom waters retarding mixing creating twolayer system and promoting hypoxia development in the lower more saline waters in the northern gulf of mexico

largest observed in the estuarine and coastal regions of the western hemisphere15 first recognized in the early 1970s it is the largest and most hypox ic area in the united states the area of hypoxia extends westward from the mout h of the mississippi river to the upper texas coast16 the seasonal shape and extent of the dead zone are mostly function of the mississippiatchafalaya river plume the combined outflow from these two major rivers and the biological processes it influences the most reliable predictor of the size of the hypoxic zone is the nitr atenitrogen load in the two months before the midsummer mapping cruise17 this hypoxic zone generally occurs from may to september but varies from year to year in summer 1993 following massive missi ssippi river flooding the dead zone covered more than 18000 square kilometers an area as large as the state of new jersey it reached its largest size in summer 2002 22000 square kilometers an area as large as the state of

responsible for only 23 of the nitrogen delivered to the gulf some scientists be lieve that nitrogen removal andor runoff prevention strategies should focus on this area because of its much greater relative nitrogen contribution31 and likely more economically efficient nitrogen removal researchers estimate that the benefits of nutrient controls in this lower basin could be twice as effective as implementing them in upstream basins32 others dispute that approach believing that nitrogen removal is much more effective in small streams ie headwaters in drainages than in larg rivers they contend that while an area with higher yield per area may seem like suitable place to focus management attention focus should be directed to upstr eam areas where the total yield regardless of the yield per area is greater33 workshops and conferences have identified strategies for implementing nutrient controls in the lower mississippi basin34 many farming interests maintain that evidence has not proven that agricultural practices are the primary contributors to th development of the gulf of mexico dead zone35 some farmers dispute that they contribute substantially to creating dead zone that is as much as 1000 miles away th ey argue that their goal is to keep as much as possible of the applied nutrients on their land since any nutrients that wash away represent wasted money on the othe r hand it is estimated that as much as half of the applied nutrients are lost to surf ace or ground water and to the air resulting in approximately 750 million in exce ss nitrogen calculated as fertilizer

sales to l ouisiana and supporting almost 50000 jobs37 these highly productive fisheries are the direct result of the input of nutrients from the mississippi rive r watershed several studies have linked fishery effects including declines in shrimp yields with hypoxic episodes and areas in the gulf evidence suggests that the dead zone forces fish and shrimp further offshore as well as into shallow nearshor areas and reduces the area of essential habitat38 hypoxia increases stress on aquatic ecosystems and may decrease biological diversity in areas experi encing repeated and severe hypoxia39 crowding of marine life into restricted habitat also may lead to indirect consequences through altered competition and preda tion interactions in ddition hypoxia may delay or impede the offshore migration of older larger shrimp preventing shrimp trawlers from selectively targeting larger shrimp for harvest while it is unclear what specific effects the dead zone has on gulf fisheries the occurrence of this dead zone may force fishing vessels to change their normal fishing patterns possibly expending more time and fuel to harvest their catch one study has concluded that any increase in fishing ex penses could drive marginal operators out of business other potential impacts on loui siana fisheries include concentration of fishing effort in other areas resulting in localized overfishing damage to essential habitat and possible decreas ed future production she llfish mortality if hypoxic conditions impinge on barrier island beaches and coastal bay waters

consecutive years of dry weather these nutrients stimulate large summertime algal blooms in the bay reducing dissolved oxygen in bay waters when these organisms sink to the bottom and decompose in 2006 the total hypoxic area in the bay was smaller than in previous years possibly because spring rainfall was close to the lowest on record resulting in less runoff and reduced nutrient input to the

from important habitats in addition to nearcomplete mortalities of benthic invertebrates that are impor tant in coastal foodwebs47 the appearance and growth of this dead zone is attributed to fundamental but not well understood changes in ocean conditions off the oregon coast48 the severity of the 2006 dead zone appears to reflect 1 changes in ocean and atmos phere conditions that include the strongest declines in offshore sourcewater oxygen content on record 2 an exceptional shift in coastal wind patterns that has greatly enhanced upwelling currents and 3 the persistence of lowoxygen

to the task force to assist in developi ng policy recommendations and strategy for addressing hypoxia in the northern gulf of mexico in response to an integrated scientific assessment of hypoxia in the northern gulf of mexico by the multiagency watershed nutrient task force52 plan of action for addressing hypoxia was released in january 200153 this plans environmental objective is to reduce the five year running average of the dead zones area to 5000 square kilomete rs or less by the year 2015 estimates ba sed on water quality measurements and streamflow records indicate that 40 reduction in total nitrogen flux to the gulf is necessary to return to average loads comparable to those during 1955197054 model simulations suggest th at short of this 40 reduction nutrient load reductions of about 2030 would result in 1550 increase in dissolved oxygen concentrations in bottom waters strategies selected focus on encouraging voluntary practical and coste ffective actions using existing programs including existing state and federal regulatory mechanisms and following adaptive management reassessment of progress on implementing this action plan was initiated in 200555 key consideration is th level and duration of the necessary reduction in excess nutrients from watersheds many ag ricultural lands have been saturated with nutrients for many years and it may take long

this problem may have fast solutions and any management regime considered will need to recognize that progress or impr ovement may not be pparent for years or even decades others suggest that impr oved agricultural practices in efficient application of chemical fertilizers and prevention of soil erosion could yield immediate and measurable benefits one model suggests that 12 to 14 reduction in the use of fertilizer on cropla nds in the mississippi river basin would reduce the net anthropogenic nitrogen input s by about 30 without any loss in crop production various policy options for modi fying agriculture practices continue to be discussed57 because nonpoint sources are major contri butors to the problem at the mouth of the mississippi river system many belie ve the clean water act is the appropriate legal framework for addressing future nutrient inputs under 319 of the clean water act louisiana and other st ates have initiated nonpointsource58 control programs these programs seek to combine local state and federal agency resources to address pollution from nonpoint sources within each state59 to effectively address concerns however nonpointsource programs would need to be
