communications infrastructures commercial stores conference centers airports and sites with high person traffic in general practically any crowded place is vulnerable and the risks should be controlled and minimized as much as possible access control and rapid response to potential dangers are properties that every security system for such environments should have the indect project is aiming to develop new tools and techniques that will help the potential end users in improving their methods for crime detection and prevention thereby offering more security to the citizens of the european union in the context of the indect project work package 4 is responsible for the extraction of information for crime prevention by combining web derived knowledge and unstructured data this

publicly or under licence available corpora the aim of work package 4 wp4 is the development of key technologies that facilitate the building of an intelligence gathering system by combining and extending the currentstateoftheart methods in natural language processing nlp one of the goals of wp4 is to propose nlp and machine learning methods that learn relationships between people and organizations through websites and social networks key requirements for the development of such methods are 1 the identification of entities their relationships and the events in which they participate and 2 the labelling of the entities relationships and events in corpus that will be used as means both for developing the methods 21 objectives and results in this report we provide an overview and thorough review of the annotation schemes used to accomplish the above goals based on our review we propose new annotation scheme able to extend the current schemes the wp4 annotation scheme is used for the tagging of the xml data corpus that is being developed within workpackage 4 our general objectives can be summarised as follows review of current annotation schemes for entity resolution and attribute identification our first objective is the study and critical review of the annotation schemes employed so far for the development and evaluation of methods for entity resolution coreference resolution and entity attributes identification proposal of new annotation knowledge representation scheme based on the first objective our second goal is to propose new annotation scheme that builds upon the strengths of the currentstateoftheart additionally the new annotation scheme should be extensible and modifiable to the requirements of the project 211 main objectives given an xml data corpus extracted from forums and social networks related to specific threats eg hooliganism terrorism vandalism etc an annotation and knowledge representation scheme that should provide the following information the different entity types according to the requirements of the project the grouping of all references to an entity together the relationships between different entities the events in which entities participate additionally the annotation and knowledge representation scheme should be extensible to include new semantic information xml data corpus wp4

wp4annotation knowledge representation scheme the wp4annotation knowledge representation scheme allows the identification of several types of entities groups the same references into one class while at the same time allows the identification of relationships and events the inclusion of multilayered ontology ensures the consistency of the annotation and allows the satisfaction of the requirements of extensibility and modifiability of the current scheme 2122 wp4annotation knowledge representation scheme applications the wp4annotation knowledge representation scheme facilitates the use of inference mechanisms such as transitivity to allow the development of search engines that go beyond simple keyword search this is accomplished by the use of multilayered ontology additionally the rich annotation offers benchmark for the evaluation of nlp methods as well as significant resource for their development and finetuning 22 list of participants roles this report has been produced by the university of york uoy and has been utilized by innotec for the purpose of dissemination d91 23 description of datasets annotation schemes in this report we focus on the annotation schemes used in set of 6 publicly or under license available corpora these datasetsannotation schemes are the following automatic content extraction ace the first dataset is the automatic content extraction dataset release ldc2007e63 2 this dataset is provided by the linguistic data consortium 1 under license this dataset has been produced using variety of sources such as news broadcast conversations etc table 11 provides an overview of the dataset properties more importantly ace annotation also focuses on coreference resolution identifying relations between entities and the events in which these participate knowledge base population kbp the annotation scheme in kbp focuses on the identification of entity types of person per organization org and geopolitical entity gpe location loc facility fac geographicalsocialpolitical gpe vehicle veh and weapon wea the goal of the 2009 knowledge base population track kbp 3 is to augment an existing knowledge representation with information about entities that is discovered from collection of documents snapshot of wikipedia infoboxes is used as the original knowledge source the document collection consists of newswire articles on the order of

from an october 2008 dump of english wikipedia the annotation scheme in kbp focuses on the identification of entity types of person per organization org and geopolitical entity gpe netflix netflix 9 is movie rental site that has started competition to improve upon its movie recommendation engine the movie rating data contain over 100 million ratings from 480 thousand randomlychosen anonymous netflix customers over 17 thousand movie titles it is straightforward that netflix focuses on domainspecific task hence its annotation is wellsuited for this domain weps2 the web people search weps workshop 4 5 focuses on two tasks 1 clustering web pages to solve the ambiguity of search results and 2 extracting18 kinds of attribute values for target individuals whose names appear on set of web

detailed review of the ace and kbp annotation schemes 31 automatic content extraction annotation scheme the purpose of this section is to present the annotation scheme employed by the automatic content extraction ace project2 the vast amount of electronic information most notably lying around the web provides huge resource that can be exploited to enhance the development of natural language understanding applications however in order to take advantage of this potential it is essential to develop technology that extracts content from human language automatically this is the objective of the ace project ie the development of content extraction technology that supports the automatic processing and exploitation of language data in text form language data is derived from variety of sources such as newswire forums blogs etc the ace scheme supports large number of natural language processing nlp applications by extracting and representing language content ie the meaning conveyed by the data the specific objective of the ace project is to develop technology to automatically infer from human language data the following the named entities being mentioned in text the relations that exist among the identified entities the events in which the identified entities participate all references to an entity and its properties it should also be mentioned that the ace data sources include audio and imaged data in addition to pure text in addition to english ace has also released datasets for chinese and arabic based on the above the ace project consists of the following four tasks 1 entity detection characterization edc 2 relation detection characterization rdc 3 event detection characterization edc 4 entity linking tracking lnk 2 httpwwwitlnistgoviadmigtestsace accessed

that they annotate 2 the categorization scheme employed to organize the annotated data and 3 the exact annotation used in text for each task and type of data annotation we provide number of examples to allow the comprehension of the annotation framework 311 entity detection characterization edc the goal of the ace edc task is the recognition of entities not just names this means that all mentions of an entity ie name description or pronoun are identified and then classified into equivalence classes therefore coreference resolution entity linking tracking task is important ace classifies entities into one of seven main types which are further divided to more specific subtypes these five main types are the following persons per organizations org location loc facility fac geographicalsocialpolitical gpe vehicle veh weapon wea 3111 persons per this type is used to annotate entities that refer to distinct person or set of people for instance person might be specified by hisher name eg george robertson occupation eg the lawyer family relation eg uncle pronoun eg he or any combination of these the persons is further subdivided into the following subtypes individual tag per individual the identified entity refers to single person for example3 and bold its head silvio berlusconi the prime minister of italy police foundhis gun group tag pergroup 3 square brackets indicate the extend of an entity mention xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 1241 this subtype is used to classify an entity which refers to group of people unless the group can also be characterized as an organization or gpe this not represented by formal organization eg the ancient greeks for example the walshes family the friends of arsenal indeterminate tag per indeterminate in cases where it is impossible to assign an entity to one of the afore mentioned types based on the available context then the indeterminate type is used 3112 organizations org the mention of an organization or group of organizations in given document gives rise to an entity type of organization note that an organization entity must have been established in formal manner some examples of organizations are firms government units sports teams music groups and others this entity type is divided into the following subtypes government tag orggov this subtype refers to entities that are related to governmental affairs politics or the state note that the entire government of gpe is excluded from this subtype and should be classified as gpeorg as we will see later this subtype also includes military organizations that are connected to the government of gpe some examples are the following the british navy announced yesterday that the ministry of culture has funded our research commercial tag orgcom this subtype refers to organizations which primarily focus on providing products or services for profit some examples are the following googles search engine is based on pagerank apple announced yesterday the release of its new iphone educational tag orgedu this subtype refers to organization which primarily focus on providing educational services some examples are the following the university of york was founded in the university of dublin has an excellent reputation entertainment tag orgent this subtype refers to organizations which primarily focus on providing entertainment services but excludes giant organizations such as disney which is commercial organization some examples are the following the york theater company decided to increase the number of plays beatles was one of the most famous music groups that nongovernmental organizations tag orgnongov this subtype includes organizations that are not related to government or xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 1341 commercial organization and whose primary focus is politics in broad sense charity and advocacy it includes several diverse organizations such as paramilitary groups eg pkk political parties eg labor party political advocacy groups eg palestinian support group professional regulatory and advocacy groups eg the greek medical association charitable organizations eg the red cross and international political bodies eg the eu media tag orgmed this subtype includes organization whose primary focus in on the distribution of news or publications this subtype will include organizations such as bbc guardian national geographic etc religious tag orgrel this subtype includes organizations that focus on religious issues and affairs some examples are the following the orthodox church was established after the division the vatican aims to have good relations with medicalscience tag orgsci this subtype includes organizations that focus on applying medical care or scientific research some examples are the following the london general hospital deals everyday with 1000 of cases nhs has designed program to quit smoking sports tag orgspo this subtype includes organizations that focus on organizing or participating in athletic events these events can be professional amateur or scholastic this subtype also includes groups whose sports are board or card games some examples are the following the international football federation set new rules manchester united has lost the european championship because finally it should be noted that many organization might fit to more than one subtype in these cases ace annotators assign organizations to the most specific subtype geographicalsocialpolitical entities gpe this type includes composite entities that consist of population government physic location and nation or province state county city etc all the mentions of these aspects are marked as gpe for example in the phrase the people of uk there are two mentions that are marked ie people and uk this is because these mentions are co referenced as they refer to different aspects of single gpe the government of country is also treated as reference to the same entity represented by the name of the country thus the greece and greeces government are mentions of the same entity note however that specific units within government are tagged as organizations gpe type is divided into the following subtypes xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium

survivors were italian stateorprovince tag gpesta this subtype includes mentions of the entireties of any state province canton of nation an example is the following new yorks governor was elected yesterday countyordistrict tag gpecou this subtype includes mentions of the entireties of any county district prefecture of nation some examples are the following yorkshire county is one of the most popular kavala prefecture is located on the north part of greece populationcenter tag gpepop this subtype includes mentions of the entireties of any gpe below the level of gpecon an example is the following yorks mayor announced yesterday gpecluster this subtype includes groupings of gpe that can function as political entities eg the european union it should be noted that 1 nonpolitical clusters of gpe are marked as location eg the northern italy 2 coalitions of governments are marked as organizations eg the nato additionally each gpe entity is associated to role that can be person organization location or gpe this judgment depends on the relations that the entity enters into 3113 locations loc places referring to geographical or astronomical regions and do not constitute political entities give rise to location entities for example the ouse river mountain everest or the solar systems are location entities this type is further divided into the following subtypes address tag locadd this subtype includes postal addresses or the name of location eg 25 windmill lane xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental

the goal of this task is to identify and characterize the relations between two target entities that have been identified in the edt task each relation takes two arguments ie the entities that participate in the relation each identified relation has to be assigned one of the seven class types these types and their subtypes are the following 3121 physical tag phys this type includes relations that describe physical proximities of target entities it is further divided into the following subtypes located tag physlocated this relation captures the location of an entity with respect to another entity some examples are the following physlocated the station is located at the top of the hill the top of the hill physlocated the base in london london near tag physnear this relation indicates that an entity is near another entity however it is neither in that location nor part of it an example is the following physnear the station is 20 miles north of london london partwhole tag physpartwhole this relation indicates that an entity is part of another one an example is the following physpartwhole state within the us the us 3122 personalsocial tag persoc this type describes relations between entities of type per the order of the arguments does not have any impact on the relations it is further divided into the following subtypes business tag persocbusiness this relation captures the professional connection that exists between two entities for example persocbusiness my lawyer lawyer persocbusiness the senators secretary the senator family tag persocfamily this

gpeaffcitizen us athlete us basedin tag gpeaffbasedin given that organizations are not always located in the gpe in which they are based ace distinguishes between the physical locations of an org with their gpw of origin for example google zurich focuses on the development gpeaffbasedin google zurich zurich other tag gpeaffother this subtype is used for gpe affiliations that do not fit to any of the above subtypes 3127 discourse tag disc discourse relation captures partwhole or membership relations which are established only for the purposes of the discourse the group entity referred to is not an official entity relevant to world knowledge for example many of these people disc many of these people people disc each of whom whom 313 event detection characterization edc the goal of this task is to identify and characterize events according to five predefined types each event is tagged by its textual anchor full extend and participating entities for each event type there is salient entity salient entity can be the object of the event object salient events or the agent of the event agent salient events table 21 shows this classification in the following examples square brackets are used to denote the extend of an event curly brackets are used to denote the anchor of an event while parenthesis are used to identify the salient entity event type salient entity role mov object

people object salient events as it has been mentioned in object salient events the edt entity filling the object role is the focus of the event there are four types of object salient events destructiondamage brk an event is classified as brk when the salient entity is damaged destroyed or killed for example last year 5 people were killed by the terrorist attack in gaza creationimprovement mak an event is classified as mar when the salient entity is created improved or born for example google was founded by larry page and sergey brin movement mov an event is classified as mov when the salient entity is moved for example google moved to mountain view transfer of possession or control giv an event is classified as gic when the salient entity changes with respect to possession or control for example he was arrested with the charge of possessing weapons agent salient events as it has been mentioned in agent salient events the edt entity filling the agent role is the focus of the event there is only one subtype for this type which is the following interaction of agents int an event is classified as int when the salient entities are agents engaged in some kind of interaction note that an entity can be an agent if its type is per org or gpe for example five thousand people demonstrated in athens protesting against the death of teenager 314 entity linking tracking lnk the goal of the entity linking task is to group all references to an entity and its properties together while an entity is an object or set of objects in the world that can be referenced by their name nominal phrase or pronoun composite entity results from linking an entity to all attributive mentions of its properties entity grouping xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 2141 all specific and generic entities are linked with the predicates and other attributive mentions that ascribe properties to them this ensures that each composite entity consists of set of strings which either refer to or describe given entity in text the following relations are examined for entity linking predicate complements in cases where property is ascribed to an entity via an asserted predicate complement the attributive mention is linked with the entity it describes for example london is very popular destination apposition in cases of apposition the first element is specific reference to the entity while the second element is an attributive mention for example london very popular destination premodifiers all premodifiers are attributive hence they are linked with referential entities when they ascribe property that is derived from an entity for example greece is very popular destination and greek islands are famous for their clean sea the specific referential entity greece and the attributive mention greek will be linked since greek is ascribing greece attributes to islands crosstype metonymy crosstype metonymy can happen when composite entity consists of edt entities that can be assigned to different edt types depending on the context one example is that of orgs and the facs they occupy while in the edt stage these two characteristics are tagged separately org fac depending on context in this stage group entities of different types are grouped together into composite entity by creating links between them when they refer to different aspects of the same underlying object for example the white house announced yesterday that john smith reports from the white house park in this example the first mention of white house is of type edtorg however the second mention is of type edtfac each of these mentions will be linked since they evoke different aspects of the same underlying entity 32 the kbp annotation scheme the goal of the kbp track at the 2009 text analysis conference is to evaluate the ability of automated systems to discover information about named entities and to incorporate this information in knowledge source 3 kbp consists of be two related tasks entity linking where names must be aligned to entities in knowledge base and slot filling which involves xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 2241 mining attributes of entities from text in contrast to ace kbp focuses on the following types of entities person per organization org geopolitical entity gpe the description of the kbp scheme does not provide any details regarding the categorization of the toplevel types to more specific ones however as in the ace evaluation gpes include inhabited locations with government such as cities and countries wikipedia infoboxes are the basis for the reference knowledge base an infobox is data structure that allows the description of target entity through set of desired attributes called slots there is one generic infobox for each entity type table 22 shows these generic infoboxes and their slots that include the attributes of entities as it can be observed kbp provides richer scheme in terms of entities attributes and relations than ace on the other hand ace provides clear classification of relation types which ensures consistency and avoids duplications in the next section we present the advantages and disadvantages of using infoboxes as knowledge representation scheme as opposed to having fixed set of relations or events based on that discussion we propose an extended version of ace that includes infoboxes in the next chapter organization geopolitical entity

apparent that the annotation scheme of ace provides rich scheme for the identification grouping of entities and the discovery of the relations and events in which they participate however ace does not include knowledge base which would enhance its extensibility and modifiability according to the domain or genre of interest the extensibility of ace to specific domains of interest is essential since it would allow the development of methods focusing on domainspecific threats such as hooliganism vandalism terrorism and other kbp has significant advantage over aces annotation and knowledge representation scheme in that it can be easily extended this is consequence of the use of wikipedia infoboxes in which one can introduce new slot names describing attributes relations or events related to an entity however infoboxes are not the ideal representation scheme since they can introduce duplication and loss of integrity this is verging on something that should be classified as major problem with this representation the following example illustrates this problem xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 2541 infobox bill clinton infobox barack obama name bill clinton name barrack obama date of birth19081946 date of birth04081961 office president of the united states office president of the united states spouse hillary rodham clinton spouse michelle obama education bsc in phd in university degree bsc in msc in website httpwww url httpwww children chelsea clinton children malia ann obama natasha obama table 24 two example of infoboxes in table 24 we observe that although both of the entities refer to presidents of the united states the corresponding infoboxes differ in two slots ie educationuniversity degree and websiteurl this is due to the each slot pair refers to the same underlying concept for example educationuniversity degree refers to the education someone has received while websiteurl refer to hisher official website this inconsistency has been caused by the same property that offers extensibility ie the ability to add new slot names in the created infoboxes 35 summary to summarize this section has provided an overview of the annotation knowledge representation schemes used in ace kbp netflix and weps it is apparent that ace provides rich scheme which however is not easily extensible or modifiable as it lacks structural relationships between objects of interest while at the same time knowledge representation scheme is absent in contrast kbp is essentially subset of ace in terms of annotation however kbp uses knowledge base and wikipedia infoboxes as means to represent knowledge this allows having an easily extensible and modifiable scheme yet it introduces duplications and does not ensure integrity in the next section we aim to overcome the above limitations by proposing extended annotation scheme of ace which includes the use of an ontology xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 2641 4 design of new annotation scheme in this chapter we outline the deficiencies of kbp and ace proposing an extension of ace annotation as the wp4 annotation and knowledge representation scheme we also argue that clear and consistent ontology design is necessity for any application that requires sophisticated search and reasoning and for overall efficiency in knowledge management we also propose the use of the proton ontology 8 the choice of this ontology was motivated by the fact that this ontology already conforms to the ace annotation guidelines 41 methodolgy on data collection d41 aims to focus on analysis of security related data from websites blogs chats and other social medium the project aims to analyse data related to hooliganism terrorism and other types of crime the agh prof wieslaw lubaszewskis team has initiated the task of data collection this section describes the ongoing effort and the methodology employed it does not include the actual data as this is currently being collected the current effort is directed towards collecting data on football hooliganism and sale of human organs in parallel to this the ostrava team mr adam nemcek has also started work on data collection on similar topics the current data collection activity follows the following methodology only highly relevant data will be collected to ensure that machine learning systems trained using the data will not be swamped by noise the data will be multilingual covering number of different languages currently data is being collected in polish and czech specialised crawlers will be used to help with 1 and 2 and to lessen the need for manual filtering both ostrava and agh already have built their specialised crawlers in addition open source crawlers are also available the subset of the collected data will be annotated using the annotation scheme described in this report this annotation will be detailed in that it will identify all relevant potential threats the participants the locations the time and connections between entities involved end users ie the police will be used to verify the correctness of the annotation where it is necessary 42 data cleaning methodology data from websites blogs and social networks especially user forums etc do not always follow strict html standards these are usually ill formed and usually requires cleaning and preprocessing before it becomes usable by any natural language processing pipeline however manual cleaning of such data is neither feasible or acceptable as nlp systems developed within the project need to be robust enough to handle such data for the above reasons we propose to employ standard supervised machine learning methods to automatically convert illformed data into well formed corpus xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 2741 for example given an illformed html such as the following html titleblog exampletitle body p strong johnbam strong strong12 july 2009 1159 gmt strong p italian officials say two train cars filled with liquefied natural gas have derailed and exploded in western italy killing at least 14 people p body html human annotator will manually convert the above into its correct form html titleblog exampletitle body p strongsender johnbam strong strongdate 12 july 2009strong strongtime 1159 gmt strong p pstrongtextstrong italian officials say two train cars filled with liquefied natural gas have derailed and exploded in western italy killing at least 14 people p body html it can be observed that the tags sender date time text have been inserted in the html code to allow the recognition of entities dates and text within blog entry the above pair constitutes single training example number of such pairs will be collected to form training set for supervised machine learning system such as an svm the task of the svm is to predict the location of different tags eg sender recipient posting date etc at specific points in the input this can be formulated as binary decision problem separate xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 2841 svm will need to be trained for each tag and svms can be used in pipeline to generate all the missing tags 43 wp4 annotation knowledge representation scheme the aim of the new annotation scheme is build upon the strengths of ace annotation scheme and the kbp annotation knowledge representation scheme as mentioned in section 22 ace provides clear classification of relation types which ensures consistency and avoids duplications this should be the primary characteristic of the new annotation scheme secondly ace annotation already defines subclass relationship wikipedia infoboxes which are used as knowledge bases for kbp are set of subjectattributevalue triples that lists the key aspect of the articles subject however using infoboxes as knowledge representation scheme has the following disadvantages multiple templates exists for the same class multiple attribute names for the same property attributes lack domains or datatypes however the infobox classes and attributes can be mapped to corresponding ace entity and relation annotation scheme so we can view kbp as subset of ace however for the purpose of this project combining the good features of both annotation schemes seems to be the way ahead ace has clearly defined guidelines for events which the kbp annotation does not address meanwhile the infoboxes can be easily extended however there is clear ontology defined by these schemes so an ontology based upon ace annotation scheme should be implemented the need of better defined ontology is necessary for the following reasons query capabilities one key advantage of using an ontology is that we can go beyond keyword queries and ask sql like queries ontologies allow various kinds on inference mechanisms such as transitivity to allow sophisticated queries for example to answer which person got the golden boot at 2006 fifa world cup we might have to realize that footballer is subclass of person extensibility an ontology can be catalyst for acquisition of further knowledge largely automated maintenance and growth of the knowledge base as the knowledge is changing and ever growing automated extension is desired characteristic which could be built on to the ontology there are lot of existing ontologies that use automated knowledge acquisition or extension based on the current ontology relations for example gene ontology go 6 generates more detailed concepts from existing go concepts by utilizing syntactic relations among the existing concepts xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 2941 for example the hyponymy relation between two concepts chemokine binding and cc chemokine binding can be inferred from the hyponymy relation between the subconcepts chemokine and cc chemokine in other words one way to expand an ontology is build upon the relationship between the terms in the existing ontology based on syntactic dependency and semantic information extracted from the original text containing these terms another such example is the crossmarc 7 ontology in which new instances for the existing concepts are learned from domain specific corpus using machine learning approaches initially the domain specific corpus is annotated with existing concept instances automatically using the existing ontology to identify new instances single hidden markov model hmm is trained for each set of instances of particular concept hmm parameters are calculated from the annotated domain specific corpus using maximum likelihood estimation simply put the hmm learns the context in which the instances occur and use it to detect new instances belonging to the training instance concept expressivity it can be an enabler for semantic search on the web for detecting entities and relations in web pages and reasoning about them in expressive logics for example probabilities can be attached to the concepts and properties during ontology building thus allowing us to reason using probabilistic logic such kind of extension reduces the problem in reasoning when only partial information about the concept or the instance exist in the ontology and allows reasoning with partial and imprecise information 431 ontology structure the central idea is to create an ontology compatible with ace annotation this can be done if the top layer of the ontology reflects the entities defined in ace in addition to the ace entities the top layer also contains separate class for events and other properties we are interested in such as timeinterval to denote some timestamp an ontology that satisfies the above is proton ontology it was developed to be complaint with ace annotation scheme among others proton4 is divided into four modules system top upper and knowledge management figure 31 shows the four modules with the classes it contains system module it introduces the key class entity which can have aliases basically this module is used to maintain knowledge that needs to be hard coded for ontology based applications top module this module contains the most general class descriptions about 20 classes most of the classes chosen are domain independent with an aim to be able to link existing ontologies upper module this module contains more general classes of entities for example various sorts of organizations and comprehensive range of locations 4 httpprotonsemanticweborg xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 3041 knowledge management module it contains 38 classes of slightly specialized entities that are specific for typical knowledge management tasks and applications as can be observed in figure 31 all of the ace entity types are incorporated in the top module proton was designed to be general purpose and domain independent the top layer starts with very basic entity classes figure 31 proton modules object agents locations vehicles etc happening events and situations abstract abstractions that are neither object or happening these are further specialized into generally defined entities meetings military conflicts employment job positions commercial government and other organizations people and various locations it also covers numbers time money and other specific values xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 3141 additionally the featured entity types have their characteristic attributes and relations defined for them eg subregionof property for locations has position for persons locatedin for organizations hasmember for groups etc specialization of the classes is achieved with the help of upper layer for example mountain as specific type of location and user as subclass of agent separating the ontology into two layers allows for domain specific extensions the top module contains the most general classes as per the requirement of the project the subclasses of these classes belong to the upper module for example the top class happening includes the subclasses event and situation situation is further specialized into jobposition and role figure 32 shows the top module classes the design is an object oriented design the subclasses inherit the properties from its super classes for example person inherits properties from agent and object apart from the inherited properties it also has its own properties such as hasposition this relates entity person to jobposition and hasrelative this relates person to another one in this case the hasrelative relationship is of bidirectional manytomany type figure 33 shows the specialization of this relationship figure 32 top module classes xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 3241 figure 33 hierarchy of hierarchy of relations proton architecture also incorporates events into the top layer the top layer class happening has event situation timeinterval and jobposition as its subclasses this class thus incorporates both static situation and dynamic happenings event dynamic events include subclasses like accident military conflict and sports event static events include holding position like board member or manager the rationale is that both static and dynamic event has temporal marker associated with it for example sport has start time and end time building an ontology in such way allows user to search for example all uk prime minister before 1980 the knowledge management module further contains specialization that are specific to knowledge management task for example the top class agent contains informationsource subclass that belongs to the knowledge management module the instance ecommerce of informationsource contains collection of documents relating to activities and entities concerning electronic commerce xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu

from the web the first text fragment is weblog on hooliganism the second is news report on violent events between hooligans of uk football teams while the third is partial transcript of conversation between terrorists the goal in this section is to demonstrate the feasibility of extending the ace annotation scheme and the associated ontology to new genres in the following example entities and their corresponding references are annotated with their corresponding ace tag 441 weblog on hooliganism5 in this weblog domainrelated events have been identified the tagged entities are shown below

attack their corresponding types are shown in table 41 the extension of the ontology is straightforward since the proton already defines an event class hooliganism and its subclasses children can be added under the event node in proton this means that the top layer remains the same while the new subclasses can be directly added to the upper layer in the proton hierarchy figure 34 proton extend event hierarchy additionally each of the identified event types in the ontology can be assigned variety of attributes which indicate for example whether an event was completed or not or weights

event types for identified events in the same vein as in the previous example we can extend our ontology with different types and subtypes of events for example it is apparent that the first two events refer to an illegal transportation the next two refer to illegal financial transactions the fifth refers to legal transportation and finally the last two refer to law enforcement activities the corresponding event types which extend the proton ontology are shown in table 42 45 mapping of publicly available datasets to wp4 annotation scheme since the ontology we propose will be based around ace annotation scheme we can easily incorporate publically available datasets whose annotations either are directly compliant to ace or can be mapped to one in cases where the new dataset has new entity it can be plugged into the most relevant position in the hierarchy in the ontology suppose we did not have specific category for the entity asteroids since the ontology design starts with very general system module and spans to specific instances upper module we could still plug asteroids as an instance of object class at worst case we can fit any new entity to the entity class in the system module netflix mapping regarding netflix we can view the data as stating x commented on movie in case of the ontology movie would fall under the class movie subclass of mediaproduct which itself is subclass of product comment meanwhile is static event since it was given at specific time by x weps mapping similarly with the weps dataset we can view the annotation as stating x owns document since documents are clustered for each name we can visualize that person owning that web page artifact kbp mapping finally as we have already mentioned kbp can be considered as subset of ace hence the infobox name slots can be easily mapped to their corresponding events or relations included in proton 46 summary it is well understood that kbp annotation has problems regarding consistency and clarify in its definitions ace annotation has the basic characteristic that we look for clean and consistent design however the knowledge we are trying to maintain can change and evolve over time as result an extensible framework for knowledge representation is essential multilayered ontology such as proton seems to be the way forward an ontology additionally xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 3841 allows us the use of more powerful and expressive queries multi layered architecture allows the flexibility for the ontology to cater to specific application needs furthermore proton ontology already incorporates ace annotation scheme mapping ace and kbp annotation scheme onto an ontology is achieved by carefully selecting the top layer classes mapping netflix and weps dataset are quite trivial as mentioned earlier xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 3941 5 conclusions this report has provided thorough overview of the currentstateoftheart on the annotation schemes employed for the identification of entities and the attributes that characterize them the survey part focused on the annotation schemes used publicly and under license available datasets in particular we presented the ace scheme which annotates number of different entity types relations between them and the events in which they participate following that we presented the kbp annotation and knowledge representation scheme which in terms of annotation coverage can be considered as subset of ace additionally two smaller annotation schemes were discussed ie netflix and weps2 based on the critical survey we proposed new annotation knowledge representation scheme that extends ace so that the new annotation scheme has the following properties it is extensible in order to fit to the requirements of the project this is particular useful in the early stages of the project where the requirements are not fully specified extensibility is achieved by using an ontology which allows the addition of new entities relations and events while at the same time avoids duplication and ensures integrity as opposed to the kbp scheme it allows search engine to go beyond simple keyword queries by exploiting the semantic information and relations within the ontology it allows the use of expressive logics and becomes an enabler for detecting entity relations on the web xml data corpus wp4 d41 indect consortium wwwindectprojecteu d41 xml data corpusdocx confidental 4041 6 bibliography
