current cafe standards the arab oil embargo of 19731974 and the subsequent tripling in the price of crude oil brought into sharp focus the fuel inefficiency of us automobiles new car fleet fuel economy had declined from 148 mpg in my1967 to 129 mpg in my1974 in the search for ways to reduce dependence on imported oil automobiles were an obvious target the energy policy and conservation act epca established cafe standards for passenger cars for my1978 the cafe standards called for an eventual doubling in new car fleet fuel economy epca also granted nhtsa the authority to establish cafe standards for other classes of vehicles including lightduty trucks1 nhtsa established fuel economy standards for light trucks beginning in my1979 for passenger cars the current standard is 275 mpg for light trucks the standard was set at 222 mpg for my2007 the cafe standards to my2011 are summarized in table 2 as noted on april 6 2006 nhtsa issued additional rules to further increase light truck

my2008my2011 nhtsa rule that was remanded back to the agency to be redone d average that was estimated by nhtsa in the proposed rule based on my2011 reformed standard compliance with the standards is measured by calculating salesweighted mean of the fuel economies of given manufacturers product line with domestically produced and imported cars measured separately the penalty for noncompliance is 550 for every 01 mpg below the standard multiplied by the number of cars in the manufacturers new car fleet for that year civil penalties collected from 1983 to 2003 totaled slightly more than 600 million however these penalties have been paid mostly by small and speciality european manufacturers not by the major us or japanese automotive manufacturers the effectiveness of cafe standards since inception has been controversial since 1974 domestic new car fuel economy has roughly doubled the fuel economy of imports has increased by roughly onethird some argue that these improvements would have happened as consequence of rising oil prices during the 1970s and 1980s regardless of the existence of the cafe standards some studies suggested that the majority of the gains in passenger car fuel economy during the 1970s and crs4 1980s were technical achievements rather than the consequence of consumers favoring smaller cars between 1976 and 1989 roughly 70 of the improvement in fuel economy was the result of weight reduction improvements in transmissions and aerodynamics wider use of frontwheel drive and use of fuelinjection the fact that overall passenger car fleet fuel economy remained comparatively flat during period of declining real prices for gasoline also suggested that the cafe program may have contributed to placing some sort of floor under newcar fuel economy recent and historic fleet fuel economy averages are shown in figure 1 figure 1 passenger car and light truck fuel economy averages for model years 19782006 miles per gallon 35 30 25 20 15 1978 1982 1986 1990

major issues in the cafe debate some of the arguments made on behalf of or in opposition to raising cafe or making significant changes in the program touched on longstanding themes that are also complex these issues include what is the effect of combining the passenger automobile and lightduty truck fleet for the purpose of calculating manufacturers average cafe during the congressional debate some contended that it should make difference whether the average is calculated across one entire fleet or weighted across two crs5 if an umbrella standard has to be met for the entire fleet on the other hand had the classes been kept separate there might be differential effects of the standards on different vehicle classes opponents of eliminating the distinction between the fleets referred to that policy as backsliding under the cafe program prior to the enactment of eisa manufacturer was required to meet the cafe standard separately for its fleet of passenger cars produced in the united states and abroad the cafe of each could not be averaged across one another manufacturer could not earn cafe credits for one fleet that could be applied to bring its other fleet into compliance nor could manufacturers buy and sell credits from one another the twofleet rule had been crafted originally to protect the diversity of models manufactured in the united states the united auto workers uaw argued that eliminating the distinction between foreign and domestic fleets could cost jobs in the industry domestically the final bill retained the distinction between the two vehicle classes the presumption is that this will place greater weight for fuel economy improvement on passenger cars than on light trucks will higher cafe standards bring about loss in jobs some argued that higher standards might compel manufacturers to make fewer vehicles that consumers want as result older less efficient vehicles might be retained longer others suggested that any impact on jobs in the industry would be selective that is unionized jobs might be more vulnerable if higher standards do affect demand for vehicles what might be the effects of allowing credit trading among manufacturers andor between passenger car and light trucks fleets under the previous structure of the cafe program automakers could bank excess cafe credits for use in future years but could not trade those credits with other automakers manufacturers also could not trade credits between their passenger car and light truck fleets each fleet had to meet the standards independently under the fuel economy program restructure by eisa credit trading is allowed supporters of this approach argued that it may improve the economic efficiency of the system and lower the cost of compliance opponents raised the possibility that allowing credit trading could lead to competitive advantage for some manufacturers and could affect auto industry employment do higher cafe standards have an effect on gasoline price there are many external and often shortterm and cyclical variables that can affect gasoline prices if higher standards do reduce overall oil demand from baseline projection world oil prices may be less volatile when an incident or sequence of events raises uncertainty about the adequacy and security of world supply however it is impossible to make any reliable projections given such large universe of possible scenarios crs6 how do attributebased standards work and what are the advantages and disadvantages of them any system for regulating cafe will have winners and losers whether an attributebased system or the previous straightline average additionally the choice of which attribute or attributes on which to base cafe will also affect individual automakers differently under the new system nhtsa will set fuel economy target calculated for each new car as mathematical function of individual vehicle attributes the final regulations developed by nhtsa may for example base standards on vehicle size or footprint under that scenario and visualized on graph each years standard would longer be represented by single line but appear instead as curve that would peg desirable fuel economy target for vehicles based upon their footprint in successive model years the curve would be replotted with the intention of reaching designated cafe fleetwide average in some future model year individual vehicle would be required to meet specific fuel economy standard but the average of the fleet would need to meet or exceed the average of the individual vehicles sizebased targets see figure 2 in the detailed discussion below are there arguments to be made for and against designating cafe standards as an expression of both miles per gallon and as grams per mile of co2 emissions one bill hr 2927 included such provision technically co2 emission rates are not measures of fuel economy but of greenhouse gas emissions however there may be few ways to reduce emissions other than increased fuel economy currently states may establish emissions standards under the clean air act but are preempted from setting fuel economy standards by the energy policy and conservation act epca amending epca to establish cafe standards both in terms of miles per gallon and grams per mile of co2 could have bearing on states authority to regulate co2 on april 2 2007 the supreme court issued its ruling in case commonwealth of massachusetts v epa brought by 12 states and the district of columbia that challenged the environmental protection agencys epa decision not to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles the supreme court decision upheld the petition and requires epa to regulate co2 emissions2 ruling of the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit overturning the final rule promulgated in april 2006 setting light truck fuel economy standards for my2008my2011 was based in part on determination that nhtsa failed to thoroughly analyze the effect of the final rule on co2 2 see additional discussion later in this report cafe and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions crs7 how the interim rule for my2011my2015 would work overview of the rule on april 22 2008 nhtsa released notice of proposed rulemaking nopr that would establish fuel economy standards for model year my2011 my2015 passenger cars and light trucks under the rule cars and light trucks would have fuel economy target based on specific vehicles footprint the product of wheelbase and track width with higher targets for smaller vehicles and lower targets for larger vehicles for given model year the targets for manufacturers fleet would be averaged to calculate that manufacturers mandated fuel economy the agencys estimate of costs benefits and net benefits from the proposed rule are shown in table 3 the agency estimates that the total benefits of the proposed passenger care rule would be roughly 31 billion over the lifetime of the 5 model years societal benefits the agency notes includes direct impacts from lower fuel consumption as well as externalities such as reduction of air pollutants and greenhouse gases3 after netting out the 158 billion cost of the rule the net societal benefit is estimated at 151 billion from the improvement in passenger car fuel economy for the proposed light truck standard the table shows 573 billion in gross benefits nearly 31 billion in costs and net societal benefit of 264 billion for both classes of vehicles the greatest percentage of benefits an estimated 8485 percent is projected to accrue to consumers the 1516 percent balance of benefits is attributed to environmental benefits and reduction in oil imports however its important to note that the agency calculations assume lower gasoline price of 226 to 251 per gallon than was being observed when the nopr was released4 3 us department of transportation national highway traffic safety administration average fuel economy standards passenger cars and light trucks model years

average fuel economy standards passenger cars and light trucks model years 20112015 docket nhtsa2008 0089 p 292 to date the cafe standards have not applied to vehicles over 8500 pounds gvw vehicles between 850010000 pounds gvw which are categorized as mediumduty passenger vehicles mdpv would be included under the proposed rule beginning in my2011 before my2004 these vehicles were considered heavy duty vehicles for both fuel economy and emissions purposes for the purposes of emissions standards starting in my2004 the environmental protection agency epa first defined mdpvs and included them in the tier 2 emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks the justification at the time was that these vehicles are used primarily as passenger vehicles and should be regulated as such nhtsa reached similar conclusion adding that fuel economy standards for mdpvs were feasible and that standards would save additional fuel approximately 250 million gallons over the operating life of my2011 mdpvs under the proposed rule work trucks such as longbed pickups and cargo vans and trucks described as multistage built in stages by more than one manufacturer would be excepted from regulation5 work trucks may subsequently 5 under the provisions of epca nhtsa has had the authority to regulate the fuel economy of vehicles up to gross vehicle weight gvw of 10000 pounds if after study it was determined that it was feasible to set standards for these vehicles and if there was evidence that the vehicles were used for the same purposes as passenger automobiles and that including them under cafe regulation would save significant amount of fuel in eisa congress directed that vehicles up to 10000 pounds be subject to cafe standards eliminating the need for any administrative determination that there were grounds to include continued crs9 come under cafe regulation but eisa directed first that the national academy of sciences conduct study on the feasibility of including work trucks with nhtsa to conduct subsequent evaluation of its own reformed standards prior to the passage of eisa one of the key criticisms of the cafe structure was that increased cafe standards promoted smaller lighter vehicles because fuel economy tends to decrease as vehicles get heavier the concern was that fuel economy standards would be met to great degree by decreasing vehicle weight because larger vehicles tend to offer greater passenger protection in accidents and tend to be heavier fuel economy program structure that does not factor vehicle size into the setting of cafe standards could promote the use of smaller less safe vehicles corollary and further criticism of the program was that it favored producers of smaller vehicles that would tend to be more fuel efficient some proponents of higher cafe standards responded by arguing that through the use of new technology vehicle efficiency can be improved without affecting size or performance under the proposed rule fuel economy targets vary with vehicle size with smaller vehicles required to achieve higher fuel economy than larger vehicles under the system in the proposed rule each vehicle would be assigned fuel economy target based on its footprint which is the product of vehicles track width the horizontal distance between the tires and its wheelbase the distance from the front to the rear axles the average of the targets for manufacturers fleet is the cafe average that the manufacturer must achieve in given model year in this way specific vehicle is required to meet specific fuel economy but the average fuel economy required will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer the challenge to the rule and court decision as noted earlier november 15 2007 decision by the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit overturned final rule issued by nhtsa in april 2006 establishing fuel economy standards for light trucks my2008my2011 the court ruled that nhtsa had not conducted sufficiently rigorous analysis to measure whether the standards would have beneficial effect in improving environmental quality through reduction of greenhouse gas emissions eleven states the district of columbia new york city and four public interest organizations had petitioned for review of the final rule governing light truck fuel economy for my2008my2011 in its decision the court ruled that nhtsa would have to promulgate new rule that among other elements assessed the costs and benefits from different levels of standards in reducing carbon dioxide co2 emissions among the petitioners arguments were that the costbenefit analysis performed by nhtsa assigned benefit to reducing co2 emissions and that the 5 continued them crs10 rule did not establish floor fuel economy that an individual manufacturer had to achieve in given model year at this point there would be reason for nhtsa to resubmit its rule for my2008my2011 because there is insufficient advance notice to the manufacturers whose product lines are planned well in advance of their introduction the analysis accompanying the nopr for my2011my2015 appears intended to address the deficiencies identified by the court in the earlier rulemaking whether if challenged the court would find it sufficient is uncertain however there is some prospect of challenge should nhtsa issue final rule that maintains as is expressed in the nopr that any state regulation that affects fuel economy including any state regulation governing tailpipe emissions is forbidden by epca the text of the nopr observes with emphasis added for those rulemaking actions undertaken at an agencys discretion agencies are instructed to closely examine their statutory authority supporting any action that would limit the policymaking discretion of the states and assess the necessity for such action this is not such rulemaking action nhtsa has discretion not to issue the cafe standards proposed in this document epca mandates that the issuance of cafe standards for passenger cars and light trucks for model years 20112015 given that state regulation for tailpipe emissions of co2 is the functional equivalent of cafe standard there is way that nhtsa can tailor fuel economy standard so as to avoid preemption further epca itself precludes state from adopting or enforcing law or regulation related to fuel economy 49 usc 32919a6 cafe and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions additional history and discussion carbon dioxide emissions clearly figured into the challenge and ruling on the nhtsa my2008my2011 light truck fuel economy rulemaking mobile sources are key source of greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the united states transportation accounts for roughly onethird of all us carbon dioxide co2 emissions passenger vehicles alone represent roughly 60 of transportation emissions or roughly 20 of total us co2 emissions because passenger vehicles play such significant role in us ghg emissions there is growing interest in reducing their emissions as part of strategy to address climate change concerns in general there are three ways to reduce vehicle greenhouse gas emissions these choices are to 1 reduce vehicle miles traveled through strategies such as carpooling transit or teleworking 2 reduce vehicle permile fuel consumption 6 us department of transportation national highway traffic safety administration average fuel economy standards passenger cars and light trucks model years 20112015 p 378379 docket nhtsa2008 0089 crs11 through improved fuel economy and permile noncarbon emissions7 through improvements in vehicle systems and 3 convert to lowercarbon transportation fuels as consequence there is likelihood that any program to reduce ghg emissions will likely raise fuel economy conversely any program to increase fuel economy will lower ghg emissions there is some debate whether raising the cafe standards would be an effective or marginal way to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide on one hand improvements in fuel economy should enable the same vehicle to burn less fuel to travel given distance however to the extent that technologies to improve fuel economy add cost to new vehicles it has been argued that consumers will tend to retain older less efficient cars longer further improving fuel economy lowers the permile cost of driving to the extent that fuel savings are reduced by additional driving the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will also be offset some this is what is referred to as the rebound effect perhaps the most significant current issue regarding automotive fuel economy has its origins in the 2002 decision by the state of california to require carbon dioxide emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks legislation passed by the state legislature that year ab 1498 requires the state to promulgate regulations to achieve the maximum feasible and costeffective reduction of greenhouse gases from cars and trucks the regulations adopted by the california air resources board on september 24 2004 require reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 30 by 2016 the regulation covers passenger vehicles but would not affect heavier vehicles such as commercial trucks or buses although states do not have authority to regulate fuel economy under the clean air act california solely may be granted an exemption from restrictions on setting vehicle pollutant emissions standards subject to the state filing petition with the environmental protection agency epa and being granted waiver by that agency any stateestablished standards must be at least as stringent as the federal standards and as long as they are needed to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions8 while only california can petition for waiver other states may adopt any california standards that are put into place following the granting of the waiver several auto manufacturers and dealers challenged the california auto greenhouse gas standard in court central valley chryslerjeep inc vs witherspoon 104cv06663 ed cal filed december 7 2004 the plaintiffs argued that california lacks the authority to establish standards that are almost certain to bear on vehicle fuel economy requirements and that greenhouse gases are not pollutant under the clean air act california officials maintain that they have the authority under the clean air act to regulate vehicle greenhouse gas emissions the state estimates that complying with the standard could cost 1000 per vehicle by 2016 while opponents argue that costs could be as much as 3000 per vehicle depending upon the cost of compliance the new standards could reduce demand for 7 eg fluorinated gas emissions from air conditioner systems 8 for more information on the clean air act waiver process see crs report rl34099 californias waiver request to control greenhouse gases under the clean air act crs12 new vehicles the impact of the standards on manufacturers would likely vary depending upon the mix of vehicles they offer in early 2007 the court indicated that it would withhold decision pending resolution by the supreme court of case that might bear on the one before the court on april 2 2007 the supreme court issued its ruling on that related case commonwealth of massachusetts v epa in that case 12 states and the district of columbia challenged epas decision not to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles arguing that epa has the responsibility to set greenhouse gas standards for passenger vehicles under that decision epa is required to establish greenhouse gas standards for automobiles or explicitly justify why such standards are not justified the decision in that case will likely affect the outcome of the case against california9 on december 11 2007 the united states district court for the eastern district of california ruled that both epa and california through the waiver process are equally empowered to regulate ghg and that preemption of state laws regulating fuel economy did not preempt the proposed california standard to reduce ghg then on december 19 2007 epa administrator stephen johnson sent letter to california governor arnold schwarzenegger informing him of epas plan to deny californias waiver request without this waiver californias program cannot move forward epas rationale appeared to consist of two arguments first that california has not shown that its regulations are needed to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions as required by the clean air act and second that the administration and congress are addressing climate change through national standards specific reference was made to the newly enacted cafe standards in eisa as addressing vehicle emissions officials in california were not satisfied by the agency explanation for its decision on january 2 2008 california along with 15 other states filed suit against epa in the us court of appeals 9th circuit challenging epas rejection of the petition overview of congressional interest in cafe 19912005 significant efforts to raise cafe began in the early 1990s and were highly controversial one proposal included in omnibus energy legislation was so controversial that it contributed to an insufficient number of votes in the senate in 1991 to bring the bill up for debate on the floor general criticisms of raising the cafe standards was that owing to the significant lead times manufacturers need to change model lines and because of the roughly ten years it generally takes for the vehicle fleet to turn over increasing cafe is slow and inefficient means of achieving reductions in fuel consumption further it was argued that the standards 9 for additional background see crs report rl32764 climate change litigation growing phenomenon by robert meltz crs13 risked interfering with consumer choice and jeopardizing the economic wellbeing of the automotive industry opponents of raising cafe have often cited concern that higher efficiency will likely be obtained by decreasing vehicle size and weight jeopardizing vehicle safety proponents of cafe increases have argued that boosting the standards could bring about the introduction of technological improvements that would not compromise features that consumers value but which would otherwise not be added because of the increase in vehicle cost stemming from these improvements language in the fy1996fy2000 department of transportation dot appropriations prohibited expenditures for any rulemaking that would make any adjustment to the cafe standards in conference on the fy2001 appropriations the senate insisted that the language be dropped opening the way for nhtsa to initiate rulemakings once again the conferees also agreed to authorize study of cafe by the national academy of sciences nas in conjunction with dot that study effectiveness and impact of corporate average fuel economy cafe standards released on july 30 2001 concluded that it was possible to achieve more than 40 improvement in light truck and suv fuel economy over 10 to 15year period at costs that would be recoverable over the lifetime of vehicle ownership study released in december 2004 by the national commission on energy policy ending the energy stalemate bipartisan strategy to meet americas energy challenges established by foundation money recommended that congress instruct nhtsa to raise cafe standards over fiveyear period beginning not later than 2010 the commission recommended that manufacturers be able to trade fuel economy credits earned by exceeding the standards draft report from the national petroleum council facing the hard truths about energy comprehensive review to 2030 of global oil and gas released in late july 2007 argued that vehicle fuel efficiency could be doubled by 2030 through the use of existing and anticipated technologies and assuming vehicle performance and other attributes remains the same as today the draft report noted that technologies to improve fuel efficiency had been used to compensate for the addition of horsepower and other amenities to current vehicles the council estimated that doubling fuel economy could achieve savings of 35 million barrels day by 203010 the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 authorized 35 million annually during fy2006fy2010 for nhtsa to carry out fuel economy rulemakings it also required study submitted to congress in august 2006 to explore the feasibility and effects of significant reduction in fuel consumption by 2014 and required that the estimated inuse fuel economy posted to the window of new vehicles more closely approximate owners experience in august 2006 nhtsa issued to congress the report study of feasibility and effects of reducing use of fuel for automobiles the report concluded that nhtsas light truck rulemaking will lead to significant reductions in fuel 10 national petroleum council facing the hard truths about energy p 8687 the text of the report is currently available at httpwwwnpcorg crs14 consumption and that granting nhtsa the authority to establish similar rules for passenger cars would lead to even greater reductions inuse fuel economy estimates the fuel economy of individual vehicles is calculated by running vehicles through test on dynamometer intended to simulate driving cycle that assumes 11 miles driven in an urban setting and 10 miles on open highway to bring this calculation more into line with inuse fuel economy experienced by drivers the epa makes downward adjustment of 10 for the city portion of the cycle and 22 for the highway portion however many argued in the past that this adjustment was longer sufficient and that the gap between estimated fuel economy and actual inuse fuel economy had widened significantly epact required revision of the adjustment factor applied against tested vehicle fuel economy to estimate consumer inuse fuel economy on december 11 2006 epa finalized rule to incorporate the effect of factors such as higher speed limits faster acceleration differences in the ratio between city and highway driving and use of air conditioning on inuse fuel economy the inuse fuel economy stickers posted to the windows of new cars will reflect the results of these tests beginning in my200811 the change affects only the estimation of inuse fuel economy it does not affect the cafe calculation for purposes of determining manufacturers compliance with the
