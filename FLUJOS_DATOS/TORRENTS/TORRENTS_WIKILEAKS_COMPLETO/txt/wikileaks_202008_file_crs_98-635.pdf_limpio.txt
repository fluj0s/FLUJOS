neither senate nor party rules discuss how subcommittee chairs ranking members and other members are selected however there are two prevalent approaches under one approach the full committee chair exercises discretion to choose subcommittee leaders and members consultation with the ranking minority member and other committee members is common some committees rules explicitly require prior consultation particularly with the ranking minority member or majorityparty members of the full committee under the other common practice senators choose subcommittee leadership slots and other assignments in order of seniority on the full committee typically there are separate parallel processes for republicans and democrats allowing each senator to choose one subcommittee assignment before anyone in the same party chooses second assignment each senator then selects second assignment before anyone in the same party selects third assignment although they do not address the assignment process both senate and republican conference rules limit the number of subcommittee assignments or chairs per senator senate rules do not limit subcommittee ranking memberships and democrats do not have written conference rules addressing subcommittee assignment and leadership issues

popularly called the b and c committees senators generally are limited to two and one b committee assignments although waivers can be granted in addition senators are restricted from serving on more than three subcommittees of each committee except appropriations and two subcommittees of b committee senate rule xxv paragraph 4b1 and 2 the full committee limitations sometimes are waived and assignment to an additional committee usually also allows service on additional subcommittees service restrictions exist on subcommittees of c committees although c subcommittees have been rare in recent years special provision is made for the chair and ranking member of each full committee to serve ex officio without vote as member of any of committees subcommittees senate rule xxv paragraph 4b3 some committees also allow their members to sit with any subcommittee during its sessions although their role may be restricted for instance some committees prohibit senators from participating in subcommittee votes if they are not regular members of subcommittee
