attention on the security status of the nations drinking water supplies and the vulnerability of this critical infrastructure sector to attack congress since has enacted security requirements for public water systems and has provided funding for vulnerability assessments emergency planning and drinking water research the environmental protection agency epa the lead federal agency fo r the water sector has worked with water utilities state and local governments and federal agencies to improve the drinking water security the public health security and biot errorism preparedne ss and response act of 2002 pl 107188 amended the safe dr inking water act to require some 8400 community water systems to assess vulne rabilities and prepare emergency response plans it authorized funding for these activities and for emergency grants to states and utilities and it directed epa to review methods to prevent detect and respond to threats to water safety and infrastructure security the act did not require water systems to make security upgrades to address potential vulnerabilities since fy2002 congress has appropriate d funds annually for epa to work with states and the water sector to improve the s ecurity of drinking water supplies in the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 congress created department of homeland s ecurity dhs and gave the dhs responsibility for assessing and protecting the na tions critical infrastructures however the act did not transfer epas water security f unctions and the 2003 homeland security presidential directive hspd7 affirmed epas lead role in

1997 p a45safeguarding the nations drinking water epa and congressional actions background ensuring the security of the nations dr inking water supplies poses substantial challenge partly because the number of water systems is very large and also because the responsibility for protecting drinking wate r safety is shared among federal state and local governments and utilities nationwide there are some 158000 public water systems and these systems range gr eatly in size serving from as few as 25 persons to more than 1 million persons roughly 53000 of all public water systems are community water systems cwss that serve the same residences yearround1 these 53000 systems provide water to approximately 282 milli on people nearly 400 community systems serve more than 100000 people and provide water to nearly half of the total population served because water supp lies support many uses from drinking water to fire suppression thei r disruption could have significant impacts2 1996 executive order on cr itical infrastructure protection 13010 included water supply systems as one of ei ght national infrastructures vital to the security of the united states3 in 1997 the presidents commission on critical infrastructure protection created by the executive order issued report on the vulnerabilities of these infrastructure sectors and strategies for protecting them the commission identified three attr ibutes crucial to water s upply users water must be available on demand it must be delivered at sufficient pr essure and it must be safe for use4 actions affecting any of these factors could be debilitating for the infrastructure and also for the communities that depend on it major threats to water supplies include physical destruction of facilities or distribution systems biological or chemi cal contamination of supplies and cyberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31294crs2 attacks the 1997 commission found that dr inking water systems had inadequate protection against the threat of chemical or biological contamination and that technology was insufficient to allow det ection identification measurement and treatment of highly toxic waterborne contaminants water utilities we re also found to be vulnerable to cyber attacks as they rely increasingly on computers to control water flow and pressure information sharing was identified as the most immediate need whereas warning and analytical capabilities and research and development all were found to be insufficient in response to these findings and rela ted developments president clinton in 1998 issued presidential decision directive pdd 63 on critical infrastructure protection under this directive publicp rivate partnership wa s established to put in place prevention response and recovery m easures to ensure the security of the nations critical infrastructures against criminal or terrorist attacks pdd63 designated the environmental protection agency epa as the lead federal agency for the water supply sector and epa ppointed the association of metropolitan water agencies amwa to coordinate the water sector however before september 11 2001 the main focus of pdd63 efforts for all critical infrastructure sectors was on cybersecurity subsequen tly the breadth and depth of efforts to protect the nations critical infrastru ctures have expanded significantly epa efforts to increase drinking water security in 2003 president bush issued homela nd security presidential directive 7 hpsd7 which affirmed epa as the l ead federal agency for coordinating the protection of the nations critical infrastru cture for the water sector under this directive epa is responsible for devel oping and providing tools and training on improving security to roughly 53000 community water systems and 16000 municipal wastewater treatment facilities to carry out its water sector responsib ilities epa establishe d water security division within the office of ground wate r and drinking water this division works with drinking water and wastewater utilities states tribes and other stakeholders to improve the security of these utilities and improve their ability to respond to security threats and breaches among its respons ibilities and activities the water security division provides security and antiterrorismrelated technical assistance and training to the water sector although the water security division was established in 2003 the office of water d provided assistance to its stakeholders for number of years securityrelated activities unde rtaken by epa and the water sector have fallen into five general categories including 1 establishing an information center for drinking water alerts or incidents 2 developing vulnerability assessment tools 3 identifying actions to minimize vulnerabilities 4 revising emergency operations plans and 5 supporting research on bi ological and chemical contaminants considered to be potential w eapons of mass destruction several key government

preparedness information for drinking water and wastewater utilities5 t h waterisac is supported by membership fees and epa grants it has been supplemented with the water security channel watersc which provides free email notification of water security alerts and other information issued by federal government agencies tools and technical assistance epa has worked with its water sector partners to provide practical tools and technical assistance to utilities on wide range of security matters in 2000 the amer ican water works association research foundation awwarf and the sandia nati onal laboratories with epa support initiated project to develop methodol ogy for utilities to use to assess their vulnerabilities and develop plans to minimize identified risks the project was expedited after september 11 2001 and completed in nove mber 2001 and many large water systems used this risk ssessment methodology to conduct vulnerability assessments states and drinking water organizations in collaboration with epa developed additional vulnerability assessment tools with particular focus on the needs of smaller communities to help cover the costs of conducting vulnerability assessments and preparing emergency res ponse plans epa awarded total of 51 million in grants to community water systems that serve more than 100000 persons while direct grants have not been available for smaller water systems considerable amount of techni cal assistance has been aime d at helping these systems which typically may have less capacity to address security concerns epa has used trainthetrainergrants to build pool of environmental prof essionals that has provided training and technical assistance to water systems serving fewer than 50000 people6 in addition onsite assistance for vulnerability assessm ent and emergency response planning was made available to small and dium wastewater utilities at cost through the wastewater operator training program technical assistance also has been provided through numerous guidance documents designed to help water utilities address range of security concerns7 key product is the response protocol toolbox planning for and responding

some initial steps to improve security of this critical infrastructure the office of homeland securitys 2003 national strategy for the physical prot ection of critical in frastructure and key assets reported that the water sector had taken great strides to protect its critical facilities and systems and had focused on categories of possible attacks that could have the greatest health or economic consequences9 however the report noted that the water sector needed better threat information to prioritize investments on security measures it also reiterated the need for research and development of new monitoring and analytic capabilities to enhance detection of biological chemical and radiological contaminants that coul d be introduced to the water supply research epa has participated in variou s research and development projects related to water security including research to evaluate the ability of drinking water treatment systems to remove and inactivate biological and chemical agents the agency also has supported research effort s to determine the fa and transport of contaminants within rivers and streams and within water treatment plants and distribution systems and to develop bi

monitoring systems and analytical methods for drinking water containing treating decont aminating and disposing of contaminated water and material contingency planning addressing infrastructur interdependencies risk assessment and communication and protecting wastewater treatment and collection systems10 key concern the nrc expressed regard ing the action plan was that it did not discuss the financial resources that woul d be required to complete the proposed projects and to implement c ountermeasures needed to improve water security the nrc recommended that epa try to quantify the costs and benefits associated with the research and technical support proj ects the nrc further noted that more emphasis was needed on communicating the value of water and increased security because water rate increases would likely be needed to generate the resources needed to implement counter measures11 in progress report on the action plan ep reported that more than 100 projects had been initiated to address the needs listed in the plan12 projects have included review of early warning systems tracer studies guide for use by water utilities treatability guide for biological contaminants in water review of emerging detection technologies for wa ter contaminants review of the impacts of biological toxins on water systems and performance verifications of the effectiveness of monitoring treatment and d econtamination technologies the water infrastructure protection division has lead responsibility fo r much of this research and has been producing tools guides and other products for use by water utility operators public health officials nd emergency responders for several years epas major water secu rity research effort has involved the water security initiative formerly called the watersentinel initiative which is demonstration project to develop model contamination warning system for drinking water systems the goal of the initiative is to establish pilot early warning systems through intensive water monitoring and surveillance in selected cities as noted below congress has given partial support to the initia tive using the resources available epa published interim guidance for the water security initiative in mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31294crs6 2007 and established the first contaminant warning system pilot in july 2007 the agency plans to award grants for additional pilot projects in march 2008 funding for drinking water security activities since 2001 congress has provided funds annually to epa to improve the security of public water supplies the emergency supplemental appropriations act for fy2002 pl 107117 provided epa with 1756 million for emergency expenses to respond to the september 11 attacks and to support counterterrorism activities the accompanying conference report hrept 107350 specified that approximately 90 million was for improving security at epa laboratories performing drinking water vulnerability assessments and anthrax decontamination activities another 5 million was for state grants for counterterrorism coordinators to work with epa and water utilities in assessing drinking water safety congress has continued to provide roughly 5 million for these state grants each year during fy2002 epa allocated roughly 89 million of the amount provided in the emergency supplemental ppropriation to support secur ity enhancements at the nations drinking water systems of th is amount epa targeted approximately 80 million to 1 provide grants to the larg est drinking water systems to conduct vulnerability

this directive instructed epa to develop comprehensive surveillance and monitoring program to provide early det ection of contaminants in water systems hspd9 also directed epa to develop an integrated network of water quality laboratories to support the surveillance program epa s pursued these responsibilities through its water security initiative and water alliance for threat reduction program as both epa and dhs have responsib ilities for protecting critical water infrastructure the potential for overlap nd duplication is perhaps unavoidable epa and dhs for example have separate communications and informationsharing networks and have had diffe rent policy advisory groups in recognition of the need for coordinating entity for the water sector the major drinking water and wastewater organizations established the water sector coordinating council wscc in 2004 this c ouncil is associated primarily with dhs but coordinates with both agencies in 2005 epa and dhs

maintain resilient infrastructure and 4 increase communication outreach and public confidence issues and legislation the 110th congress considered several bills addressing the security of public water supplies but legislation was not enact ed key water sector issue has involved the status and adequacy of public and privat efforts to improve the security of public water systems because of actions on the part of drinking water utilities epa and the congress vulnerability assessment and planning efforts in the water sector have proceeded more rapidly than those in certain other sectors such as chemical facilities however it is unc lear how much has been done within the sector to implement security upgrades although th bioterrorism preparedness and response act required community water systems to conduct vulnerability assessments and prepare emergency response plans it did not require systems to make security upgrades to address any identified vulnerabilities22 chemical facility security an issue relevant to the water sector that has received significant legisla tive attention for several ears involves the security of chemical facilities including certain water utilities that are located where terrorist attack could cause harm to nearby popul ations for water utilities the primary concern is the onsite storage hazardous ga seous chemicals such as chlorine that pose potential risks to local communities if released the 109th congress several bills in the 109th congress targeted such high consequence facilities within the water sector s 2855 proposed to amend sdwa to require community water systems to replace hazardous gaseous chemicals with inherently safer technologies ist for ex ample switching from the use of chlorine gas to liquid chlorine s 2855 also woul d have required epa to provide grants to highconsequence facilities for use in paying capital expenditures needed to make the transition to the use of ist s 2781 and s 1995 proposed to amend the clean water act to address security at wastewater treatment facilities the senate committee on environment and public works reported wastewater treatment facilitie s bill s 2781 srept 109345 which did not contain ist requirements but did authorize grants to wastewater treatment facilities for securityrelated efforts including conduc ting vulnerability asse ssments preparinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31294crs14 site security plans and making security upgrades an identical bill was offered in the 110th congress s 1303 broader chemical facility security bills also were offered in the 109th congress that had implications for water utilities these bills generally would have authorized the secretary of the department of homela nd security to regulate chemical facilities including water treatment plants that pose certain risks s 2145 as reported by the senate homeland security and governmental affair s committee srept 109332 and its companion bill hr 4999 would have directed the secretary of dhs to issue rules designating which ch emical facilities would be subject to regulation and establish security performance standards such facilities under these bills facilities would have been required to submit to the dhs vulnerability assessments security plans and emergency response plans for rrorist incidents hr 5695 hrept 109 707 shared several similar ities with s 2145 but woul d have exempted water facilities covered by the gislation from redundant requi rements such as conducting vulnerability assessments unless the dhs determined that more stringent security requirements were needed s 2486 proposed to cover wi der range of facilities and establish general duty to ensure that facilities would be designed operated and maintained in safe manner the bill defined this obligation to include use of inherently safer technology to the max imum extent practicable hr 1562 would have required consultation be tween dhs and epa and would have imposed stronger security and emergency planning measures rather than requiring changes in technology hr 2237 would have expa nded epas existing authority to oversee chemical facilities but would have required consultation with dhs several local government and water organizations including the american water works association awwa sought exemptions from s 2145 and other bills that proposed to give the dhs authority to regulate water utilitie s that use hazardous chemicals such as chlorine gas these stakeholders argued that epa already has an established water security program and has been designated the lead agency for water infrastructure security in genera l the awwa has opposed legislation that would require water utilities to switch treatment processes wit hout considering specific utility circumstances and local water and climate characteristics others have argued that mandating the adoption of safer technologies is warranted because of the potential risk that hazardous chemi cals particularly ga seous chlorine may pose to communities the 109th congress included chemical facility security provision in the dhs fy2007 appropriations act pl 109295 s ection 550 the provision authorized the department to regulate for three years highrisk chemical facilities excluding drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities and facilities in ports the act directed dhs to establish riskbased s ecurity performance standards for designated chemical facilities and to require these facilities to prepare vulnerability assessments and security plans to implement this provision the dhs promulgated regulations in june 2007 that established chemical facility antiterrorism standards cfats these standards require chemical facilities to report the amounts and types of chemicals on site so that dhs can determine whether facility will be further regulated by cfats rules regulated f acilities are placed into one of four tiers based on risk andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31294crs15 performance the facilities placed in the high estrisk tier will be subject to the most stringent security required pursuant to pl 109295 the cfats regulations will sunset in october 2009 the 110th congress because of the scope and time limitation of the departments authority to regulate chemical facilities as well as implementation issues chemical facility security remained on the congressional agenda in particular the interim final rule issued by dhs stated that it might preempt future state and local chemical facility security regulations in response to this preemption language the 110th congress amended pl 109295 in th consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 to establish states right to promulgate chemical facility security regulations that are at least as stringent as the federal chemical facility security regulations pl 110161 further pr ovided that state regulations would be preempted only in the case of an actual conflict between federal and state regulations several other bills were introduced to modify dhs authority to regulate chemical facilities perhaps of most in terest to the water sector was hr 5577 hrept 110550 the chemical facility antiterrorism ac t of 2008 reported amended from the house committee on ho meland security in march 2008 hr 5577 would have revised ex panded and made perman ent dhss authority to regulate chemical facility security curre ntly water and wastew ater facilities are explicitly exempt from p l 109295 nd the cfats regulations however these utilities were not categorically exempt unde r hr 5577 this legislation would have directed the dhs secretary to maintain list of covered chemical facilities determined to be of sufficient security ri sk based on several crite ria 1 the likelihood that the facility will be the target of an attack 2 the potentia l extent and likelihood of death or injury or harm to the envi ronment critical infrastructure national security or the economy that could result from an incident and 3 the proximity of the chemical facility to population centers the bill also would have authorized dhs to designate any chemical substance as s ubstance of concern and to establish and revise the threshold quantity for designated substances further hr 5577 proposed to require owners and operators of covered facilities to conduct vul nerability assessments and to develop and implement dhs approved security plans to address the possibility of redundant federal requirements dhs would have been authorized to cons ider whether require ments under other laws such as the bioterrorism preparedness act satisfied these requirements another provision would have required owners and ope rators of affected facilities to complete an analysis of methods to re duce the consequences of rrorist attack the bill did not use the term inherently safer technol ogies and would have authorized the dhs secretary to require higher risk facilities to implement such methods or technologies under certain conditions as amended in markup the secretary would not been authorized to order drinking water or wastewater facilities to implement inherently safer technolog ies unless dhs provided fundi ng to assist with the conversion also of relevance to the wa ter sector was the provision authorizing dhs to order facility assigned to the high risk tier to cease operations if the facility failed to comply with dhs compliance order as reported hr 5577 would havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31294crs16 23 for more information on this and other bills see crs

consideration of hr 5577 through may 2008 the bill was not referred to the house committee on transportation and infrastructure which has key jurisdiction over wastewater utilities further action occurred on this legislation assistance for security measures also at issue is the availability of funding for water systems to make secu rity upgrades needed to address risks identified in their vulnerability assessments based on limited assessment epa reported in 2005 that community water syst ems would need more than 1 billion to make security improvements24 the awwa estimated that municipal water systems would have to spend more than 16 billion ju st to ensure control of access to critical water system assets25 congress has not provided funding specifically for this purpose26 although community water systems potentially are eligible to receive funding from the states through the dhs state homeland security grant program competition for funds has been severe and f unds largely have gone to meet the needs of first responders in an effort to addr ess one element of this funding issue the conference report for the department of homeland security appropriations act for
