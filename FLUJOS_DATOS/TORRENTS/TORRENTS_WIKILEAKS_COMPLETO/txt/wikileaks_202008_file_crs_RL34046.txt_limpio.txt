act 2008 was included as division k of the act the thud appropriations act provided 1036 billion after rescissions and other adjustments in total budgetary resources 40 billion more than the fy2007 level dot received 655 billion an increase of 23 billion over fy2007 hud received 376 billion 14 billion over the fy2007 level in an exchange of amendments between the senate and the house congress converted the state foreign operations and related agencies appropriations bill 2008 into the consolidated appropriations bill 2008 and completed action on the new bill during december 1719 2007 prior to that on november 14 2007 the conference committee on the fy2008 thud appropriations bill hr 3074 had reported conference agreement hrept 110446 on november 13 2007 and the house had approved the agreement on november 14 2007 the conference agreement recommended 1058 billion after rescissions and other adjustments 62 billion more than the fy2007 enacted funding level and 55 billion over the administrations budget request the president threatened to veto the bill for exceeding the requested funding level the senate did not take up the agreement during the period between the beginning of fy2008 october 1 2007 and the signing of the consolidated appropriations act 2008 congress provided funding through series continuing resolutions generally at fy2007 funding levels on september 12 2007 the senate passed hr 3074 which provides 1059 billion after rescissions and other adjustments for transportation and housing and urban development appropriations for fy2008 the senate committee on appropriations had reported draft of the legislation in the form of s 1789 on july 16 2007 the committee recommended total of 1047 billion after rescissions and other adjustments 12 billion was added to the bill during deliberations on the senate floor for highway bridge repair and replacement in response to concerns about the integrity of bridges raised by the collapse of an interstate highway bridge in minnesota on august 1 2007 this is 59 billion 6 more than the comparable amount for fy2007 and 56 billion 6 more than requested for fy2008 crs2 on july 24 2007 the house passed hr 3074 which provides 1044 billion after rescissions and other adjustments in thud appropriations for fy2008 this is 44 billion 4 more than the comparable amount provided for fy2007 and 41 billion 4 more than requested for fy2008 overview the presidents budget request the presidents net fy2008 request for the programs covered by this appropriations bill was 1003 billion after scorekeeping adjustments this was 300 million less than 1 over the net total provided for fy2007 the dot request was 645 billion 13 billion 2 more than the amount provided for fy2007 this increase was largely for highway net 17 billion increase and transit net 447 million increase programs these increases reflected the increase in the fy2008 authorized funding level over the fy2007 level for these two programs which receive almost all of their funding from transportation trust funds however the request did not provide the full authorized funding level it was 631 million below the authorized level for highway programs and 309 million below the authorized level for transit programs the hud request was 356 billion 10 billion 3 less than the amount provided for fy2007 this reduction reflected the administrations continued effort to reduce or eliminate funding for number of hud programs that it regards as ineffective or inefficient secretary jacksons introductory letter to the fy2008 hud budget summary document noted in budget season marked by the presidents goal to continue to support what works and cut the federal budget deficit the fy2008 hud budget request demonstrates an effort to prioritize funding towards programs with measurable documented results1 the administrations fy2008 budget request included spending reductions that had also been proposed by the administration in previous budget requests without success these proposed reductions from fy2007 funding included roughly 1 billion from reductions in several hud programs and elimination of several other programs and roughly 1 billion from cuts to several dot programs among the programs proposed for reductions or elimination were dots airport grants 764 million amtrak 494 million and subsidies for air service to small communities 59 million programs huds community development funds 735 million housing for the elderly 160 million and housing for the disabled 112 million programs and 1 united states department of housing and urban development fiscal year 2008 budget summary p 1 crs3 huds hope vi rural housing and economic development brownfields redevelopment and section 108 loan guarantees programs for which funding was requested 130 million total house and senate action both the house and the senate have passed versions of hr 3074 the fy2008 appropriations bill for thud both chambers rejected the administrations proposed reductions and provided increases for both dot and hud over both the fy2007 levels and the fy2008 requested levels the housepassed version of hr 3074 would provide total of 1044 billion 41 billion 4 more than requested and 44 billion 4 more than the fy2007 funding within that total the bill provides 655 billion for dot 11 billion more than requested and 24 billion more than fy2007 387 billion for hud 31 billion more than requested and 20 billion more than fy2007 and 235 million for the related agencies 1 million more than requested and 12 million more than fy2007 the senatepassed version of hr 3074 would provide total of 1059 billion 56 billion 6 more than requested and 63 billion 6 more than the fy2007 level within that total the bill provides 669 billion for dot 24 billion more than requested and 38 billion more than the fy2007 level 387 billion for hud 31 billion more than requested and 21 billion over the fy2007 level and 235 million for the other independent agencies 1 million more than requested and 12 million over the fy2007 level the senate bills major funding difference with the house bill is in providing more funding for dot most of that additional funding is for repairs to bridges in response to the collapse of an interstate highway bridge in minnesota after passage of the house version of the bill the conference agreement the conference agreement on hr 3074 recommended total of 1058 billion this is 55 billion 6 more than requested and 62 billion 6 more than the fy2007 enacted level the agreement recommends 667 billion for dot 22 billion more than requested and 35 billion more than provided in fy2007 the conferees recommended 387 billion for hud 31 billion more than the budget request and 24 billion more than the amount provided in fy2007 the conference agreement was reported on november 13 2007 it was brought to the house floor on november 14 2007 and approved by vote of 270147 later that day the primary topics of discussion during consideration of the agreement had to do with the time available to review the bill and additions made by conferees some members complained that not only had the rule that members should be given three days to review bill before voting on it been waived but also that the informal practice that members be given at least 24 hours to review bill was being ignored there were also criticisms of the number of earmarks in the bill and of the addition by conferees of some earmarks that had not been in either the house or senate passed versions of the bill practice known as airdropping earmarks complaints were also voiced about provision section 193 added by conferees that would prohibit any funds in the agreement from being used to provide budget justifications to any congressional committee other than the appropriations crs4 committees prior to may 31 2008 in 2006 the office of management and budget began directing agencies to make their budget justifications available to the public and to post the justifications on the internet within two weeks of the transmittal of those materials to congress in early february similar provision was inserted in the conference agreement on the transportation treasury housing and urban development the judiciary district of columbia and independent agencies appropriations act of 2006 tthud pl 109115 section 182 and was added to the senatepassed version of the fy2007 tthud appropriations bill hr 5576 that bill was never passed by the senate and the prohibition was not included in the continuing resolution that provided funding for those agencies for fy2007 pl 110 5 the president issued statement of administration policy on the conference agreement threatening to veto the bill for exceeding the level of funding requested by the administration the margin of passage of the bill in the house was less than the twothirds majority that would be required to override veto the consolidated appropriations act in december 2007 with 11 unfinished appropriations bills including the thud bill several of which faced veto threats from the president for exceeding the level of funding requested in the administration budget proposal congress decided to combine the unfinished appropriations bills into one consolidated appropriations act the legislative vehicle used was hr 2764 originally the department of state foreign operations and related programs appropriations act 2008 the thud appropriations act became division k of the consolidated appropriations act after negotiations with the administration over the total level of spending in the bill congress agreed to reduce the overall level of spending in the bill leaving it up to each appropriations subcommittee to achieve the agreedupon reduction the thud committee did so through rescission of contract authority in certain programs and 2 rescission applied to the earmarked projects in the bill see sections 129 and 186 in

division k of the explanatory statement in the congressional record of december 17 2007 pps h16632h16640 however there are some inconsistencies between the figures in that table and with the funding

the committee print on hr 2764 by the house committee on appropriations in january 2008 is correct see note in division k page 2589 of the committee print thus for thud figures the table in the

httpwwwgpoaccessgovcongresshouseappropriations08conapprohtml total represents total budgetary resources after scorekeeping adjustments totals may not add up due to rounding and scorekeeping adjustments crs6 changing appropriations subcommittee structures since 2003 the house and senate committees on appropriations have reorganized their subcommittee structure three times in 2003 new subcommittee homeland security was added in order to maintain the existing number of subcommittees at 13 the transportation appropriations subcommittees were combined with the treasury postal service and general government appropriations subcommittees becoming the subcommittees on transportation treasury and independent agencies in early 2005 the house and senate committees on appropriations again reorganized their subcommittee structures the house committee on appropriations reduced its number of subcommittees from 13 to 10 this change included combining the transportation treasury and independent agencies subcommittee with the district of columbia subcommittee to the resulting subcommittee in addition jurisdiction over appropriations for the department of housing and urban development and the judiciary as well as several additional independent agencies was added the subcommittee was then known as the subcommittee on transportation treasury housing and urban development the judiciary district of columbia and independent agencies or tthud the senate committee on appropriations reduced its number of subcommittees to 12 the senate also added jurisdiction over appropriations for the departments of housing and urban development and the judiciary to the transportation treasury and independent agencies subcommittee the senate retained separate district of columbia appropriations subcommittee as result the areas of coverage of the house and senate subcommittees with jurisdiction over this appropriations bill were almost but not quite identical the major difference being that in the senate the appropriations for the district of columbia originate in separate bill at the beginning of the 110th congress in 2007 the house and senate committees on appropriations again reorganized their subcommittee structures the house and senate committees divided the responsibilities of the tthud subcommittees between two subcommittees transportation housing and urban development and related agencies thud and financial services and general government whose jurisdiction included the treasury department the judiciary the executive office of the president the district of columbia and many of the independent agencies formerly under the jurisdiction of the tthud subcommittees these changes make yeartoyear comparisons of transportation and housing and urban development appropriation bills complex as their appropriations appear in different bills in combination with various other agencies other factors such as supplemental appropriations for response to disasters such as the damage caused by the gulf coast hurricanes in the fall of 2005 and changes in the makeup of the department of transportation portions of which were transferred to the department of homeland security in 2004 also complicate comparisons of yeartoyear funding table 3 shows funding trends over the fiveyear period fy2003fy2007 and the amounts requested for fy2008 for the departments of transportation and housing and urban development the purpose of table 3 is to indicate trends in the funding crs7 for these agencies so emergency supplemental appropriations are not

for the faa both chambers have passed bills providing higher level of dot funding than requested by the administration 655 billion 11 billion more by the house and 669 billion 24 billion more by the senate the major difference between the house and senate totals is that the senate version provides an additional 1 billion 2 this total includes 669 billion in new appropriations and 24 billion in rescissions crs10 for the fhwas bridge repair and replacement program and an additional appropriation of up to 195 million for emergency funding to minnesota both in response to the collapse of the interstate 35 bridge in minneapolis on august 1 2007 neither chamber supported the administrations requested decreases in the various transportation accounts nor did either chambers bill reflect the proposed restructuring of the faa budget as congress is still considering the reauthorization of the faa among the largest increases over the requested levels were those for the fhwa bridge program 1

reauthorization see crs report rl33920 federal aviation administration reauthorization an overview of selected provisions in proposed legislation coordinated by bart elias highway congestion initiative the highway congestion initiative would redirect 175 million largely from unused funds previously designated by congress for specific projects for pilot programs in cities to test comprehensive congestion reduction strategies including such strategies as congestion pricing flexible work schedules to reduce the concentration of commuter traffic during peak rush hour periods and more use of realtime traffic information to encourage drivers to adjust the timing and route of their trips in light of current traffic conditions the house rejected the request for 175 million for the congestion initiative noting that dot has considerable discretion with regard to awarding grants from the fy2007 funding for highway and transit discretionary programs and that congestion initiative should be more comprehensive in scope than the administrative proposal involving other modes besides highways the senate approved 136 million for the congestion initiative but provided the funds from the additional funding produced by the raba mechanism rather than by taking money from projects previously designated by congress the final thud appropriations act directs the government accountability office gao to provide review of dots implementation of its congestion initiative in fy2007 to the appropriations committee by march 31 2008 the act also limits the amount of ftas bus program funds that dot may use for the congestion initiative in fy2008 to not more than 10 of the unallocated funds4 reducing amtraks federal subsidy for fy2008 the house provided 14 billion for amtrak 475 million for operating assistance and 925 million in capital assistance and debt service plus another 50 million for matching grant program to encourage state investment in passenger rail the senate provided 137 billion for amtrak 485 million for operating assistance and 885 million for capital assistance and debt service plus another 100 million for matching grant program to encourage state investment in passenger rail both amounts represent an increase over the 13 billion provided for fy2007 the senate also approved floor amendment eliminating provision in the fy2006 thud appropriations act pl 109115 119 stat 2414 continued in fy2007 by pl 1105 121 stat 9 that prohibited amtrak from offering discounts of more than 50 off the normal peak fare on route both of the house and senate appropriations committees expressed concerns about amtraks failure to reach collective bargaining agreements with the majority of its workforce since the expiration of the previous agreements several years ago and about the role of freight railroads in amtraks poor ontime performance 4 according to fta total of 966 million was unallocated fta supplemental fiscal year 2008 apportionments and allocations and program information federal register vol 73 28 monday february 11 2008 p 7790 crs12 the conference agreement recommended 1375 billion for amtrak 475 million for operating assistance and 900 million for capital assistance and debt service this is 80 million 6 more than the amount provided for fy2007 the conference agreement also recommended 75 million for matching grant program to encourage states to invest in passenger rail service the grants would provide 50 federal share of the capital costs of improving existing intercity passenger rail service and providing new intercity passenger rail service the final thud act provided 1325 billion for amtrak 475 million for operating assistance and 850 million for capital assistance and debt service this is 31 million more than the amount provided in fy2007 the act also provided 30 million for matching grant program to encourage states to invest in intercity passenger rail service the grant program would provide 50 federal share of the capital costs of improving existing intercity passenger rail service and providing new intercity passenger rail service the administration requested 900 million for amtrak for fy2008 this was 394 million 31 less than the amount provided in fy2007 and of the 900 million requested 100 million would not go to amtrak directly but to matching grant program to encourage states to invest in intercity passenger railrelated capital improvements only 300 million was requested for operating assistance amtrak received 490 million in operating assistance in fy2006 and fy2007 amtraks board of directors whose current members have been appointed by the bush administration submits separate grant request to congress each year for fy2008 the board requested 15 billion to maintain operations and 100 million for matching grant program to encourage states to make intercity passenger rail related capital improvements for the past several years the administration has sought to force changes in amtraks operations and in intercity passenger rail policy in general by requesting less funding for amtrak than is needed to maintain amtraks status quo level of operations arguing that only constrained budget will force amtrak to change the way it conducts business5 in its fy2008 budget the administration states that it expects the boards newlyinstalled management to make significant changes required to enable the company to succeed without federal operating subsidies6 in previous years congress has provided more funding for amtrak than requested by the administration though less than requested by amtraks board while imposing conditions on amtrak in the annual appropriations bill amtrak is quasigovernmental corporation that provides intercity passenger rail service throughout the country and operates and maintains rail infrastructure in the northeast it operates at deficit and requires federal support each year to continue its operations amtraks authorization expired at the end of fy2002 reauthorization efforts since then have been stalled by fundamental disagreements 5 united states office of management and

federal grants to airports for airport planning development and expansion of the capacity of the nations air traffic infrastructure the presidents budget requested 141 billion for fy2008 10 billion less than was provided for fy20077 most of that reduction would come from the airport improvement program both of the house and senate approved 146 billion for faa for fy2008 as did the conference agreement and the final thud appropriations act airport improvement program aip the presidents budget proposed cut of 764 million to aip funding from 35 billion in fy2007 to 28 billion for fy2008 similar cut was proposed by the administration for fy2007 but was not supported by congress both the house and senate rejected the proposed cut the house approved 36 billion for fy2008 95 million increase over fy2007 the senate approved 35 billion the same amount provided in fy2007 the conference agreement also recommended 35 billion the final thud appropriations act provided that amount aip

essential air service program 59 million 54 reduction from the 109 million provided for fy2007 similar decrease was proposed by the administration for fy2007 but was rejected by congress both the house and senate again rejected the proposed cut providing 110 million for fy2008 the conference agreement also recommended 110 million the final thud appropriations act provided that amount this program seeks to preserve air service to small airports in rural communities by subsidizing the cost of that service supporters of the essential air service program contend that preserving airline service to rural communities was part of the deal congress made in exchange for deregulating airline service in 1978 which was expected to reduce air service to rural areas some members of congress have expressed concern that the proposed cut in funding for the essential air service program could lead to reduction in the transportation connections of rural communities previous budget requests from the current administration as well as budget requests from previous administrations have also proposed reducing funding to this program 7 total enacted new fy2007 faa funding was 151 billion the

transportation programs by safetea pl 10959 the authorized level of fy2008 highway funding was increased by 631 million over its original level as result of higherthanexpected revenues to the highway trust fund an adjustment provided for in safetea through mechanism known as raba the administration request did not include this additional funding the dot secretary noted that the highway trust account is projected to go into deficit in fy2009 unless some preventive action is taken and stated that not requesting the additional 631 million authorized for fy2008 by the raba adjustment was one of the steps the administration was taking to forestall the projected fy2009 deficit9 the house approved 410 billion in new funding for federal highway programs for fy2008 an increase of 11 billion 3 over the comparable fy2007 amount this represented the full authorized level for fy2008 as increased by the 631 million raba adjustment the senate approved 422 billion in new funding adding 1 billion to the fhwa bridge program and up to 195 million in emergency funding for repair of the interstate 35 bridge in minneapolis minnesota the conference agreement also recommended 422 billion in new

figure and 17 billion more than the administration requested the increase is due to increases in the authorized level of highway funding including an increase due to raba adjustment that was not requested by the administration and 1 billion provided for inspection and repair of highway bridges following the collapse of the i35 bridge in minnesota federal motor carrier safety administration

administration requested 1081 billion for fra for fy2008 this is decrease of 400 million 28 from the 1478 billion provided for fy2007 the largest portion of fras budget is for support of amtrak and virtually all of the proposed reduction was in funding for amtrak as discussed above the next largest portion of fras budget is for safety programs intended to reduce railroad accidents the administration requested 148 million 2 million 1 less than provided for fy2007 the other component of the fra budget is research and development of rail safety improvements the administration

administration request aside from 35 million for rail line relocation grant program that was authorized in safetea but not previously funded and an extra 1 million for research and development all of the increase over the administration request is for amtrak the senate approved 1657 billion for fra an increase of 179 million over the fy2007 funding and 577 million over the administration request all but 7 million of the increase over the administration request is related to amtrak the conference agreement recommends 1656 billion this represents the same level of funding as fy2007 for fras safety and operations account an increase of 15 million over the fy2007 funding for fras research and development program an increase of 81 million over the fy2007 funding for amtrak and funds for two programs that were not funded in fy2007 75 million crs16 for capital grant program for states to support passenger rail service and 20 million for rail line relocation and improvement program the

administration requested 9422 billion for fta for fy2008 this was an increase of 447 million 5 over the amount provided for fy200711 but was 309 million below the authorized fy2008 funding the increase was in funds provided to states and localities through formula programs the requested reduction from the authorized funding level was in the popular new starts program which helps fund the construction of new transit projects and extensions to existing transit systems the administration requested 14 billion for new starts decrease of 166 million 1 from the fy2007 figure and 309 million 2 less than the authorized level of 17 billion the administration defended the reduction in new starts funding by saying that difficult budget choices had to be made12 and asserted that it had requested enough funding to cover all the new starts projects that were ready for funding in fy2008 as well as having set aside funding for projects that might become ready for funding during fy2008 the request also included 100 million for the newly created small starts portion of the new starts program which provides funding for projects whose total cost is less than 250 million the small starts portion is authorized for 200 million for fy2008 but that programs regulations had not been finalized as of the publication of the administration budget request so the administration did not expect that the program would be able to make 200 million in grants in fy2008 the house approved 9710 billion for fta the authorized level for fy2008 this is 701 million more than the fy2007 level and 288 million more than the administration request the house provided the 17 billion authorized funding level for the capital improvement ie new starts program including the 200 million authorized for the new small starts portion of that program the house appropriations committees report on the bill recommended several recipients for portion of the small starts funding the senate approved 9565 billion for fta an increase of 590 million over the fy2007 level and 143 million over the administration request but 134 million less than the authorized level for fy2008 the primary difference from the house funding and the authorized level was the 1566 billion provided for the new starts program this is the same amount provided for fy2007 and 166 million more than requested for fy2008 but 134 million less than the fy2008 authorized level the senate committee also recommended several recipients for portion of the funding provided for the small starts component of the new starts program the senate also approved floor amendment prohibiting fta from finalizing its proposed new start evaluation rule 11 not counting 35 million in emergency funding provided in an fy2007 supplemental funding act pl 11028 12 funding for the new starts program comes from the general fund while almost all other fta programs are funded from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund crs17 the conference agreement recommended 9649 billion for fta the primary difference between this level and the levels approved by the house and senate was the funding for the new starts program the house approved 1700 billion the senate 1566 billion and the conference agreement recommended 1650 billion the final thud appropriations act provided 9358 billion for fta this is 348 million over the fy2007 enacted level while 358 million below the fy2008 authorized funding level and 320 million below the amount recommended by the conference committee most of the difference from the authorized level was due to reduction of 104 million in the amount provided for formula and bus grants further rescission of 105 million of bus funding and an appropriation of approximately 131 million less than the authorized level provided for the capital grants program maritime administration marad the administration requested 295 million for marad for fy2008 4 million 2 above the 291 million enacted for fy200713 marad supports the maritime transportation sector the largest components of its budget are the maritime security program and operations and training the administration requested 154 million

the comparable amount for fy2007 and equal to the amount requested for fy2008 the senate approved 330 million in new funding for marad 39 million more than the comparable fy2007 figure and 35 million more than requested the increase is largely due to 20 million provided for assistance to small shipyards and 10 million provided for loan guarantees under the maritime guaranteed loan program funding was provided for either of those purposes in fy2007 nor was any requested for fy2008 the conference agreement recommended 313 million in new funding for marad for fy2008 the final thud appropriations act provided this amount this is 23 million more than the comparable amount provided for fy2007 and 18 million more than the comparable amount requested for fy2008 these increases are largely due to

budget for fy2008 the amount was estimated to be about 250 million although legislative proposals were offered to increase the amount for more detailed discussion see crs report rl34022 the department of housing and urban development fy2008 appropriations by maggie mccarty libby perl bruce foote eugene boyd and meredith peterson on july 11 2007 the house appropriations committee approved its version of the fy2008 departments of transportation housing and urban development and crs22 related agencies appropriations act thud funding bill hr 3074 the following day the senate appropriations committee approved its version s 1789 both bills would have increased funding above the presidents request for number of hud programs including section 8 tenantbased rental assistance housing for the elderly and housing for the disabled and cdbg both bills also would have provided funding for all programs that were slated for elimination in the presidents budget on july 24 2007 the house approved hr 3074 several floor amendments were adopted that would have made administrative changes to hud programs but only one amendment changed funding levels by transferring 676 million to housing counseling assistance from huds inspector general account on september 11 2007 the senate began consideration of its version of hr 3074 after substituting the content with the language of s 1789 on september 12 2007 the senate approved the legislation after adopting several housingrelated amendments including setaside of 100 million in the home account to fund foreclosure prevention activities transfer of 380000 from huds salaries and expenses account to the fair housing account in order to fund the creation and promotion of translated materials to help in serving persons with limited english proficiency setaside of 25 million in the home account to fund the american dream downpayment initiative and transfer of 24 million from the working capital fund to the research and technology account to provide additional funding for tribal colleges and universities on november 8 2007 house and senate conferees agreed to fy2008 thud funding bill the total for hud in the conference agreement hrept 110446 was lower than the house and senatepassed levels but higher than the presidents request the agreement was reported on november 13 2007 and was approved by the house on november 14 2007 according to statement of administration policy released by the office of management and budget the president intended to veto the bill since its funding level was above his request the full senate never considered the conference agreement on december 19 2007 congress enacted the consolidated appropriations act 2008 attached to hr 2764 to fund most of the federal government including hud for the remainder of the fiscal year the overall hud funding level provided in the consolidated appropriations act is less than originally approved by the house senate or housesenate conference committee but is about 2 billion higher than the presidents request it funds most hud programs at the levels provided in the conference agreement hrept 110446 although it reduces funding for some programs including the hope vi program the home program and the community development block grant program it also reduces funding for huds research and technology working capital and management expenses accounts additionally the bill contains rescission of 723 million in advance appropriations for the section 8 voucher program the bill was signed into law by the president on december 26 2007 pl 110161 crs23 tenantbased rental assistance section 8 vouchers the presidents budget requested 16 billion for tenantbased rental assistance slight increase over the 159 billion enacted for fy2007 hr 3074 as passed by the house would have provided 163 billion the senatepassed version of the bill would have increased funding for tenantbased rental assistance to 166 billion the conference agreement would have funded the account between the house and senatepassed levels at 164 billion pl 110161 funded tenantbased rental assistance just below the conference agreement level but also included rescission of 723 million leaving the total amount available for the account at 156 billion the majority of tenantbased rental assistance funding is dedicated to voucher renewals since fy2004 congress has made changes each year in how hud is to distribute voucher renewal funding to public housing authorities phas for example the fy2007 cr did not adopt the same allocation formula that was in place in fy2006 in fy2006 phas were funded based on what they had received in fy2005 with some adjustments for fy2007 congress directed hud to fund phas based on their actual leasing and costs from the previous 12 months with some adjustments in his fy2008 budget the president requested that phas receive renewal funding using formula similar to the one in place in fy2006 the housepassed version of hr 3074 adopted formula similar to the one requested by the president the committee report hrept 11038 noted that the committee chose not to use updated data for allocating fy2008 funding because the committee wanted to give phas additional time to adjust to their fy2007 allocations before changing the formula again since hud had delayed allocating fy2007 funding under the new formula the senatepassed bill would have allocated funding based on phas most recent 12 months of leasing and cost data with adjustments similar to the formula used in the fy2007 cr the conference agreement would have used formula similar to the one included in the senate version of the bill the final appropriations act pl 110161 allocates renewal funding using different formula from the house senate or housesenate conference agreement renewal funds will be allocated to phas based on their leasing and cost data from the prior year plus inflation and other adjustments and then reduced by the amount by which their unusable program reserves exceed 7 of their fy2007 funding allocation as noted earlier pl 110161 reduced the total funding for renewals with rescission of 723 million the amount estimated to be available in unusable agency reserves for more information see crs report rl33929 recent changes to section 8 housing voucher renewal funding by maggie mccarty and crs report rl34002 section 8 housing choice voucher program issues and reform proposals in the 110th congress by maggie mccarty prior to fy2008 new vouchers called incremental vouchers had been funded since fy2002 both the house and senate bills for fy2008 proposed funding for new incremental vouchers targeted to certain populations the house version of hr 3074 would have provided 30 million for incremental vouchers for certain nonelderly disabled families and homeless veterans the senate bill would have provided 105 million for incremental vouchers for homeless veterans and for families with children in the child welfare system or youth transitioning out of foster crs24 care the conference agreement would have provided 135 million for incremental vouchers for the same populations pl 110161 provides 125 million for incremental vouchers for homeless veterans families with children in the child welfare system or youth transitioning out of foster care and nonelderly disabled families public housing the presidents fy2008 budget requested 130 million increase in funding for the public housing operating fund in recent years hud has not requested and congress has not provided sufficient appropriations to fund all phas at 100 of their operating fund formula eligibility instead phas generally receive some percentage of their eligible budgets referred to as the proration level the fy2007 cr provided 38 billion for the operating fund which resulted in proration of 83 for fy2008 the president requested 4 billion 399 billion for formula grants which is estimated to result in proration level of just over 80 the fy2008 appropriations law pl 110161 as proposed in the house bill senate bill and their conference agreement provides 200 million more than the presidents request for the operating fund for more information see crs report rs22557 public housing fact sheet on the new operating fund formula by maggie mccarty for fy2008 the president requested 2 billion for the capital fund 400 million reduction from fy2007 funding the majority of the reduction would come from the formula grants that hud provides to phas to use to modernize their public housing both the house and senatepassed bills would have increased funding above the presidents requested level for the public housing capital fund the house bill would have funded the account at the fy2007 level 400 million above the presidents request and the senate bill would have provided almost 500 million above the presidents request pl 110161 like the housesenate conference agreement funds the account at the housepassed level for fy2008 the president again requested that congress provide new funds for the hope vi program and that congress rescind the 99 million provided to the program in fy2007 pl 110161 like the house bill senate bill and the house senate conference agreement provides funding for the hope vi program and does not rescind fy2007 funding as requested in the presidents budget pl 110 161 funds the program at 100 million which is less than the amount proposed in the house bill and housesenate conference agreement 120 million but the same as proposed by the senate bill community development programs the presidents fy2008 budget recommendation for the formula portion14 of the community development block grant cdbg program was approximately 3 billion 20 less than the 37 billion appropriated for distribution to entitlement communities and states in fy2007 as 14 the cdbg program also generally receives some funding for indian tribes and other purposes for more information see crs report rl34022 the department of housing and urban development fy2008 appropriations by maggie mccarty libby perl bruce foote eugene boyd and meredith peterson crs25 approved by the house hr 3074 would have provided 39 billion for cdbg formula grants the senatepassed version of hr 3074 would have funded cdbg formula grants at 37 billion the conference agreement would have provided 38 billion pl 110161 funds cdbg at 36 billion less than the amount proposed by the house senate or housesenate conference agreement in addition to the cdbg program the community development fund account has also been used to fund other community development programs including congressionally directed projects through the economic development initiatives edi and neighborhood initiatives programs the presidents budget proposed eliminating funding for edis and nis characterizing these programs as duplicative of the activities funded by the cdbg formula grant program both house and senate bills would have provided funding for edi and earmarks the house passed version of hr 3074 recommended 160 million for edis and 20 million for nis the senatepassed version would have provided 248 million for edis and 40 million for nis the conference agreement would have provided 184 million for edis and 27 million for nis pl 110161 provides slightly less than the conference agreement 180 million for edis and 26 million for nis the administrations budget also proposed eliminating funding for several community development programs funded outside of the community development fund account including brownfields redevelopment section 108 loan guarantees and rural housing and economic development grants the presidents request for new funding for these accounts was rejected in the house and senate bills as well as the housesenate conference agreement and pl 110161 the house bill would have funded section 108 loan guarantees at 37 million brownfields redevelopment at 99 million and rural housing and economic development grants at the enacted level for fy2007 168 million the senate bill would have provided 6 million for section 108 loan guarantees 10 million for brownfields redevelopment and 17 million for rural housing and economic development pl 110161 as proposed in the housesenate conference agreement provides 45 million for section 108 loan guarantees 10 million for brownfields redevelopment and 17 million for rural housing and economic development homeless programs the presidents budget for fy2008 proposed to increase funding for the homeless assistance grants by 144 million above the fy2007 level to 1586 billion however 25 million of the fy2008 requested appropriation would have been transferred to the department of labor to fund prisoner reentry initiative under the presidents request as in past years the administration also proposed to consolidate the three competitive homeless assistance grants the supportive housing program shp the shelter plus care sc program and the section 8 moderate rehabilitation for single room occupancy dwellings sro program into one competitive grant as passed by the house hr 3074 did not include the prisoner reentry initiative and instead proposed to fund the homeless programs at 25 million less than the presidents request 1561 billion the senatepassed bill also did not fund the prisoner reentry initiative however it would have funded the homeless programs at 1586 billion the same level recommended by the president of that amount 25 million would have funded new demonstration program to rapidly crs26 rehouse homeless families living in shelters pl 110161 as proposed in the housesenate conference agreement adopts the senatepassed funding level and includes funding for the demonstration program none of the funding bills considered by congress including pl 110161 included the presidents proposal to consolidate the competitive grants however separate legislation introduced in both the house hr 840 and senate s 1518 proposed to consolidate the programs for more information about the distribution of the homeless assistance grants see crs report rl33764 the hud homeless assistance grants distribution of funds by libby perl housing programs for the elderly and the disabled the presidents fy2008 budget proposal for the section 202 housing for the elderly program would have reduced funding by almost 160 million nearly 29 from the fy2007 level to 575 million the housepassed version of hr 3074 would have provided just under 735 million for elderly housing programs while the senatepassed version would have provided exactly 735 million pl 110161 as proposed in the housesenate conference agreement provides 735 million for the section 202 program for more information see crs report rl33508 section 202 and other hud rental housing programs for the lowincome elderly by libby perl the presidents fy2008 budget like that for fy2007 proposed to cut funding for the section 811 housing for the disabled program nearly in half in fy2007 the program was funded at just under 237 million in fy2008 the administrations budget requested 125 million for the section 811 housing for the disabled program the decrease would have resulted from the presidents proposal to stop funding the capital grants component of the program and to only fund the rental voucher component of the program the housepassed bill would have provided funding at the fy2007 level just under 237 million the senatepassed bill conference agreement and pl 110161 included 237 million for section 811 federal housing administration fha for fy2008 the fha account was expected to generate 250 million in offsetting receipts which is less than the amount of administrative expenses expected to be incurred by the account this is significant change from few years ago when the income to the insurance funds which was regularly in excess of 1 billion exceeded the costs and resulted in negative appropriations for fha this decline in offsetting receipts tracks fhas declining market share the presidents fy2008 budget included three legislative proposals that it estimated would generate 362 million in budget savings the first proposal was to remove the aggregate limit on the number of home equity conversion mortgages hecms and set the loan limit for hecms at 100 of the conforming loan limits rather than allowing them to vary by area the second proposal was to amend the national housing act to permit hud to increase the loan limits on the various multifamily housing programs by up to 170 on an areabyarea basis and by up to 215 on projectbyproject basis the third proposal was to increase the fee charged by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae for guaranteeing mortgagebacked securities by six basis points pl 110161 as proposed in the house bill senate bill and housesenate conference agreement crs27 adopted only the first two proposals but with larger estimates of savings 540 million as shown under the heading legislative proposals in table 5 the presidents budget also proposed to move several accounts from the general insurancespecial risk insurance fund to the mutual mortgage insurance fund none of the appropriations bills considered by congress including pl 110 161 adopted the presidents proposed transfer for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34046
