foreword the purpose of this handbook is to provide units with current information from operation enduring freedom oef two weeks after the highly successful election of president karzai the center for army lessons learned call deployed collection and analysis team caat to afghanistan this handbook is result of combining information from several sources including members of the combined joint task force 76 cjtf76 the intent of this handbook is to provide followon units with current view of operations in support of the recently elected government in afghanistan the army faces variety of possible adversaries in both oef and operation iraqi freedom oif these potential adversaries use differing levels of technology and ever changing tactics and strategies friendly forces are challenged with enemies that plan on the move and stretch our combat power planning demands adapting instantaneously to these asymmetric methods to remain ahead of the enemy decision cycle understanding the nature of the operational environment oe encountered in oef is essential to sharpening the critical planning skills of brigade and battalion staffs soldiers and leaders must be able to protect themselves from

anticoalition forces in afghanistan anticoalition members acms are drawn from alqaida taliban and other factions opposed to the government of afghanistan ambush tactics techniques and procedures during the sovietafghan war mujahedin ambushes were the most effective counter to sovietdemocratic republic of afghanistan army military activity us forces have encountered similar ambushes by acm organizations or factions ambushes are conducted for either harassment or resupply ºharassment ambushes are generally small scale as few as two to four personnel and brief followed by rapid withdrawal of troops ºambushes for spoils require more personnel and destroyed or abandoned vehicles are looted for weapons munitions food and anything else of value small ambush element consists of 2 to 15 personnel whereas large ambush element can include from 100 to 150 personnel ambush teams include the following elements ºobservers three to four men possibly unarmed pretending to be shepherds farmers etc children are sometimes used as observers ºfiring element the ambushs firepower ºalert element positioned along the likely direction of the ambushed elements direction of retreat or maneuver to hinder his withdrawal ºreserve element reinforces the firing element or covers the ambushing elements withdrawal these ambushes have an established chain of command and radio communications if radios are available communication will be accomplished by visual signaling such as smoke grenades mirrors flares and waving the ambush deployment consists of three lines ºfirst line the firing element of the ambush ºsecond line communications element located 20 to 25 meters behind the first line in order to relay communications between the command element and the firing element ºthird line command element located 30 meters behind the second line for official use only 1oef handbook iiiambush sites are carefully selected they are usually set up along the entrance and exit routes through canyons and other narrow passageways in builtup areas the ambushes are set up behind earthen walls or in houses or other structures ambushes usually occur in the early morning or in the evening additionally most convoy ambushes have been reported to occur on return trips typically because routes of travel are restricted once force leaves on mission enemy forces know that they will be returning soon and usually on the same route acm forces have also become adept at setting ambushes to intercept reaction forces responding to shelling attacks on bases compounds or other fixed installations lessons lesson 1 advance reconnaissance patrols are necessary but simply driving through the suspected area does not clear it of enemy forces or prevent an ambush on trailing convoy reconnaissance and security elements have to secure the entry and exit locations of suspected ambush sites in addition to clearing surrounding high ground lesson 2 helicopter support is crucial in preventing ambushes narrow time gap between reconnaissance flight and the point element of convoy will prevent or hinder the deployment of the ambushing force from concealed positions recent experience has shown that acm forces will go to ground and hide in order to avoid detection and possible engagement by unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and armed aircraft lesson 3 it is important to avoid predictable and set patterns of movement lesson 4 the mujahedin continued to use similar tactics and the same ambush sites months later when the soviets failed to inform replacement units of the mistakes that compromised route security and likely ambush sites sniper operations us and coalition forces experience with acm snipers has been minimal there is little evidence of welltrained and qualified snipers most engagements seem to feature high volume fires shoot and spray as opposed to disciplined wellaimed fires where snipers have been detected they have been quickly neutralized some afghan fighters have demonstrated an ability to fire accurately the zadran tribe is well known for producing excellent marksmen alqaida sharpshooters have also demonstrated excellent skills but average acm fighters appear to lack fire discipline in combat situations 2 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedraids raids usually conducted at night are common afghan tactic raiding groups attempt to gather forces covertly attack the objective seize needed supplies and retreat before the defensive forces can effectively react acm forces routinely use cover of darkness to conceal their approach to and departure from the target area taliban or alqaida fighters will resort to raids or ambushes to resupply themselves with food ammunition and equipment nongovernment facilities are frequent targets since they have minimal guard force and provide sources of vehicles food and other items of importance such as batteries and radios acm forces will frequently bring their own cargo transportation but will also attempt to steal vehicles at target sites individual and smallteam tactics individuals or small teams that contain as few as three or four fighters can infiltrate the area near an installation and use rocket propelled grenades rpgs or sniper weapons to engage personnel or equipment harassment attacks are conducted by teams that fire at the installation from distance and rapidly leave the area once they have fired their munitions it is most likely that while firing teams depart the area another team or individuals are in place to assess damage to the target if any and to assess the response to the attack from any reaction force after patterns are established that is strength timing and procedures followon attacks with remote improvised explosive devicesieds or ambushes may be attempted shelling attacks number of attacks on cities have taken place in recent times with 107mm rockets impacting seemingly at random causing civilian casualties as acm combatants establish an organized resistance it is likely these tactics will be featured more prominently the primary objective of shelling attack is to show the governments inability to ensure the safety of its citizens and demonstrate the power of acm forces and secondarily harass the enemy and destroy war materiel acm tactics mujahedin gunners construct multiple firing sites then fire and quickly displace before enemy artillery aviation or ground response forces can effectively respond when possible mujahedin will keep water near their firing sites to dampen the ground behind rockets or recoilless rifles this will limit dust raised by the back blast reducing the firing signature and making detection of firing positions more difficult current experience has been with individual rockets crudely aimed but as experience is gained and aiming devices are improved firing accuracy will improve rockets set up to fire with delays ranging from minutes to hours is also commonplace as it allows firing party to depart its firing location before the rockets fire timed firing devices range from crude mechanical devices to more sophisticated timers such as electronic watches or circuit boards that can initiate firing sequence of several individual rockets for official use only 3oef handbook iiimortars and multiple rocket launchers were the favored weapons to bombard airfields during the soviet occupation attackers can establish concealed mortar positions rapidly fire several rounds into the airfield and then rapidly leave the area rockets can be fired using improvised launchers and timedelay firing devices this is especially true for 107mm rockets regular military rocket launching systems may also be employed providing greater range and accuracy the raid is likely to be hitandrun affair therefore withdrawal and survivability are important factors to deter ground pursuit the attackers may mine routes ahead of time evade through the safe lanes in existing minefields or scatter mines as they leave if favorable terrain and weather exist the attackers may establish an ambush site from which to attack pursuers fleeing attackers will also attempt to blend into local populations dropping or hiding their weapons along the way and attempting to fit into local village or group cave and mountain defense and ambush techniques and procedures afghanistans caves and irrigation tunnels have served as protection and defense from foreign invaders since the time of genghis khan coalition forces should recruit reliable antitaliban afghan scouts to assist in locating caves defensive positions and likely ambush sites prepared defenses caves trenches and spider holes are incorporated into prepared mountain defensive positions and the taliban will attempt to draw us and coalition forces into an attack on them these defensive positions may be networked and interconnected particularly in large cave complexes allowing the taliban forces to move unseen or withdraw from the immediate area ambushes mountainous terrain is particularly suited to ambushes narrow passes and valleys are often the only means to travel between locations without using long circuitous routes acm forces are well aware of this fact and have ambushed coalition forces when they returned on the same routes this is not new the vast majority of ambushes against soviet forces in afghanistan were executed as they returned using the same route note see also the earlier section on general ambush tactics techniques and procedures ttp superior air surveillance and reconnaissance available to coalition forces will reduce the enemys capability to successfully conduct large ambushes but the threat of smaller ambushes and snipers will be constant especially when support aircraft are not seen or heard by acm forces lessons lesson 1 at night noise and light discipline of acm forces is generally very good both in defensive positions and for movements reconnaissance recon by fire is often used to determine location of key weapons systems of coalition forces 4 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedlesson 2 acm forces use cave shuttle system to move fighters and supplies to battle positions moving in or out of caves or from cave to cave to pick up ammunition and weapons in order to sustain the fight caves also provide cover from aerial observation and attack and shelter for wounded fighters urban ambush and bomb training urban areas from small villages to large cities provide talibanalqaida and insurgent forces excellent opportunities to conduct both combat and noncombat activities they will use the multitude of people and buildings to conceal their activities in order to create fear and distrust of us and coalition forces individual homes businesses religious centers and even some government facilities may be used as cover for these operations one technique used in carbombings involves the detonation of two ieds several minutes apart small bomb is exploded with the intention of drawing security forces and an increased crowd of onlookers to the site at this point second larger ied is detonated either by time delay or remote control in order to inflict greater number of casualties coalition forces must expect second followon explosion to any ied attack hostile houseclearing and hostagetaking when taking group of hostages the talibanalqaida team will consist of 6 to 10 terrorists armed with ak47s and akms at least one terrorist will carry hand grenade the terrorists will move from room to room shooting guards and gathering hostages finally consolidating the hostages in single location an abduction is carried out using traditional kidnaping technique vehicle will pull in front of the targeted individual and stop second or third vehicle will box in the victims vehicle the kidnappers will exit the vehicle kill guardsdriver subdue the victim place him in the escape vehicle and exit the scene recoilless rifles acm tactics for recoilless riflesguns will be similar to those employed by talibanalqaida rpg gunners ammunition for various calibers of recoilless rifles has been found in caches throughout the country specifically large amounts of b10 rocket ammunition the following systems have been encountered in afghanistan 90mm recoilless rifle note not much information is available regarding acm tactics for use of the 90mm recoilless information contained here is based on the m67 recoilless rifle the 90mm recoilless rifle weighs approximately 36 lbs has maximum effective range of approximately 450 meters and maximum range of approximately 2100 meters b10 82mm recoilless rifle the b10 has maximum selfdestruction of the round range of 400 meters for highexplosive antitank rounds and 4500 meters for highexplosive rounds it weighs approximately 109 lbs the b10 has been called the talibans favorite infantry heavy weapon for official use only 5oef handbook iiiand although large amounts of ammunition have been recovered it has not been seen in engagements with us and coalition forces spg9 73mm recoilless rifle the spg9 has maximum effective range of 800 meters and maximum selfdestruction of the round range of 4500 meters the firing tube weighs 99 lbs often fired on the shoulder the trailer weighs 35 lbs and the tripod weighs 27 lbs ammunition for the spg9 is nearly identical to the ammunition used by the bmp1 the spg9 has maximum effective range of 1300 meters when mounted on the bmp1 and an improved round with maximum range of 6500 meters is available rocketpropelled grenade rpg even though rpgs are classified as an antiarmor weapon acm forces will use rpgs against slowmoving aircraft especially helicopters rpgs are not very accurate against aircraft so the enemy will use high volume of fire single rpg attempts against aircraft are rare but possible rpgs have achieved some success in downing coalition aircraft rpgs display back blast and flash signature at launch most rpgs have rocket motor that ignites approximately 20 meters after the round has been fired this rocket motor ignition leaves visible gray puff of smoke person looking in the general direction of the launch should notice these indicators nightvision devices including thermal imagers may help see the rpg launch and rocket while in flight unlike man portable shoulderlaunched surfacetoair missiles rpgs do not corkscrew in flight but have relatively straight flight path with very little smoke tactics rpg gunners have been observed wetting down the ground behind firing positions to reduce back blast signature acm rpg gunners will sometimes track flight patterns and use the information as basis for planning their attacks acm rpg gunners will position themselves to take advantage of higher elevations in mountainous terrain this enables gunners to engage their target from above the side or the rear to take advantage of blind spots this technique is also applicable in urban terrain where rpg gunners can fire from rooftops or highlevel windows some rpg gunners have taken advantage of the rockets selfdestruct feature to do this gunners lob rounds to the maximum range approximately 900 meters to achieve an air burst to engage aircraft in flight or to engage unprotected troops on the ground rpg teams normally consist of two personnel the gunner carries the rpg and two to four additional rounds the assistant helps reload after firing provides limited security with an ak type rifle and also carries two to four additional rounds larger groups may contain two or more rpg teams with additional rounds carried by other fighters within the group 6 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedcountermeasures understanding tactics employed by rpg gunners and capabilities of the weapon will enhance the value of countermeasures used countermeasures can be grouped into two categories physical and tactical physical countermeasures include actions taken to reduce or negate the damage of an rpg or other antitanktype round once it has been fired these measures include chain link fences berms sandbags reinforced bunkers and other facilities that can be used in fire bases around vehicles and aircraft parked on the ground and in prepared firing positions trees and other natural shrubbery can also provide some degree of physical protection but may also reduce fields of observation and fire tactical countermeasures are actions taken to reduce the ability of rpg gunners to fire or to lessen the value of target suppressive fires on known or suspected firing positions are perhaps the most effective technique direct or indirect fires andor small or large caliber systems can provide these fires aerial fire support is particularly effective speed of movement is also helpful as is varying speed of movement in order to avoid setting identifiable patterns of movement threat to coalition patrols common threats to combat patrols include ied sniper area and close ambush civil disturbances mines breakdowns human intelligence humint against us forces and rocket or indirect fire in the oef environment identification of enemy forces is difficult some enemy ttp include attempts to cause casualty to force medical evacuation medevac mission all likely helicopter landing zones hlz are then mined rigged with ieds or overwatched by direct fire weapons that will down the aircraft and cause symbolic victory as well as mass casualty situation the enemy uses the mountainous desert terrain to establish an area ambush kill zone that is similar to baited box engagement the enemy engages unit from one direction with small two to five man element at long range once coalition forces deploy against the contact the enemy will engage friendly forces from second or third direction to cause disruption and greater casualties enemy uses observedcommand detonated ieds and solar cells to defeat us counter measures like the acorn the solar cell is covered with dust that becomes exposed by vehicles passing by completing the circuit after the us countermeasure has passed lessons lesson 1 use direct fire and mortars to quickly fix the enemy use close air support cas artillery andor attack aviation to finish the enemy lesson 2 once contact has been initiated likely hlz identified during planning should be cleared or disregarded in favor of another farther away hlz for official use only 7oef handbook iiisection ii fire support mortars when us and coalition forces make initial contact with acm prepared defensive positions the enemy typically responds with immediate mortar fire their primary fire support weapon when us cas approaches acm fighters seek nearby cover frequently leaving mortars set up and remain under cover until the air support leaves then the fighters will return to their fighting positions if possible control of high elevations is key to acm defensive operations higher elevation provides greater fields of observation although poor weather conditions may reduce visibility the 82mm mortar is the primary indirectfire weapon used by acm fighters the 120mm mortar has been used but it is not the preferred system likewise 60mm mortars have been found in cache sites but have not yet been employed against us and coalition forces ammunition for both 120 and 60mm mortars is readily available in country acm forces use 82mm mortars in two different methods of firing indirect fire acm fighters will fire from the reverse slope of the terrain when possible this requires forward observer direct observation acm forces refer to this method as disturbance firing this method will be used when the mortar is within the line of sight of the target it does not require forward observer since the mortar crew can adjust fire visually acm forces have been observed displacing carrying only the tube and bipod and leaving the base plate in position for future use base plates have been found cemented in place allowing the mortar crew to quickly occupy and set up new firing positions achieving high accuracy with first shots mortars have been observed set up in the open as crews went to nearby caves to resupply ammunition the same practice has been noted when coalition aircraft were in the area ammunition for the 82mm mortar is readily available in afghanistan there are numerous caches in the country many of which contain 82mm mortar ammunition mortar ammunition can remain serviceable long after the expiration of its expected shelf life rockets acm forces do not have organized rocket units but they do use 107 and 122mm rockets rocket firing locations may be placed on high ground overlooking the target rockets are being rigged with timers and propped up on dirt piles and sand bags and aimed at coalition fobs and compounds without the aid of directional or elevation aids 8 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedacm forces consider harassment of enemy forces as valuable as accurate fire the use of singlelaunch tubes and timedelayed firing devices targeted against installations is intended to disrupt operations with incidental damage to buildings enemy casualties are fortunate coincidence cities and military bases especially airfields are prime targets for rocketfire and rocketharassment missions 107mm rocket the 107mm rocket is available in truckmounted towed and portable variations it is easy to transport by vehicle manpack or pack animal and has maximum effective range of approximately 8400 meters the weapon needs only small area of level ground for firing the 107mm rocket ammunition is readily available from number of countries highexplosive fragmentation rounds are the only ammunition used the launcher uses simple mortar sights for target acquisition direct observation does not require the use of sights and eliminates the need for firedirection center however this method exposes the crew to detection and counter battery fire since it may require multiple rocket firings to adjust onto the target time delay may be used to reduce risk to crews from counter battery fires acm crews will fire from the reverse slope of hill or mountain when possible as this gives the weapon crew additional protection from counterfire vehiclemounted 107mm rocket does not have to be dismounted from the vehicle in order to fire and can be set up and fired from the vehicle in approximately 1 minute if towed the set up and fire time increases to approximately 15 minutes standard towed launchers fire 12 rockets however small manportable singletube launchers are also used acm fighters have become adept at rigging launchers to fire using nothing more than piled rocks or crossed sticks to provide elevation although not always accurate this launch method can be used to conduct effective harassing fires against targets such as airfields fuel and ammunition depots and garrisons or fortified areas rockets fired in this method can be armed with simple timedelay firing mechanisms allowing the crew to set up the rocket for delayed launch after they leave the area 122mm rocket the 122mm rocket comes in two versions long rocket with range of approximately 20380 meters fired by the bm21 truckmounted launcher with four rows of 10 launch tubes and short rocket fired by smaller portable systems the manportable version of the 122mm rocket launcher fires shortrange rocket with range of approximately 14000 meters variations of the manportable launchers include the single double and the 12 tube manportable launchers for the 122mm rocket are ideal for use in unconventional warfare where fire direction is simple each of these launchers needs three to four men for for official use only 9oef handbook iiitransport and can be used in more restrictive firing positions than the truckmounted version expedient aiming methods and platforms may be used to fire rockets from the tubes when fired at higher altitudes the range of the weapon increases although its accuracy decreases artillery the acm forces will employ their artillery if available in an unconventional manner target acquisition will be mostly visual with manual fire direction and without the use of computers since the fall of the taliban artillery resources have come under the control of local warlords and have not been employed against coalition forces 122mm d30 howitzer m1963 of the numerous weapon systems the taliban had available prior to the initial air strikes in 2001 the d30 howitzer was the most plentiful and considered the most dangerous artillery system in their inventory there have been recent indications that acm forces are using the d30 or any other artillery pieces in afghanistan the d30 is towed closesupport howitzer it has conventional range of 15300 meters and range of 1000 meters when used in the directfire mode emplacement time is approximately 15 minutes and displacement takes approximately 3 minutes acm forces will place the weapon under trees in heavy brush or in cave entrances to avoid detection ammunition for the d30 is available in numerous caches spread throughout afghanistan section iii air defense the three primary portions to the air defense threat in afghanistan are the manportable air defense systems manpads shoulderfired surfacetoair missiles smallarms and rpgs and light antiaircraft weapons generally 127mm through 23 mm acm forces may possess old military or available commercial night vision equipment and may employ it with air defense weapons manportable air defense systems manpads limited number of manpads still exist in theater the threat of manpads can come from anyplace in the theater including border areas and neighboring countries common strategy is to have the manpads gunners work in pairs or small groups the first manpads operator engages the aircraft if the first missile fails to destroy the target the additional manpads operators opens fire acm manpads gunners will try to position themselves on high ground overlooking potential aircraft especially helicopter flight paths this allows manpads operators more time to locate and fire on the aircraft this tactic is more likely to be used in the warmer months since winter weather conditions limit the gunners ability to survive at high elevations common tactic used by acm soldiers is to attack aircraft at their most vulnerable moment taking off or landing when near airports the manpads operators will choose place along the takeoff or landing flight path and wait for an appropriate moment to engage the aircraft after firing gunners move to the nearest shelter or cache and conceal the launcher 10 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedantiaircraft artillerymachine guns most largecaliber taliban antiaircraft artillery aaa was destroyed during initial air strikes against the taliban in 2001 prior to that time the taliban had aaa ranging from 127mm to 100mm currently the threat to coalition aircraft is from smallcaliber 23mm and smaller aaa serviceability of acm 37mm aa guns is currently questionable guns larger than 127mm are normally mounted on or towed by trucks when possible acm forces will position themselves at higher elevations allowing them greater visibility and fields of fire the acm forces will use machine guns in both antiaircraft and antipersonnel roles dshk 127mm machine gun one of the primary acm aaa weapons is the dshk127mm machine gun this weapon is deployed throughout afghanistan and difficult to detect or track the complete weapon system has been found cached in various places throughout the region as have spare parts and ammunition dshk requires crew of two to four people when ground mounted on tripod but only one gunner when vehicle mounted the dshk has tactical antiaircraft aa range of 1000 meters with maximum vertical range of 4200 meters in the groundsupport role it has maximum distance range of approximately 7800 meters the dshk can be vehicle mounted or transported by manpack or pack animal it is used in both aa and antipersonnel roles as are other small and mediumcaliber aaa weapon systems the dshk has been one of the primary support weapons used by acm forces against coalition forces in afghanistan zgu 145mm machine gun the zgu is vehiclemounted or towed aaa machine gun it is possible to dismantle and transport the zgu via pack animal or manpack ammunition is readily available and has been found cached throughout afghanistan the zgu requires crew of 10 people to manpack it but only twoman crew for firing the weapon has tactical aa range of approximately 1400 meters against fast moving aircraft with maximum vertical range of 3700 meters in the groundsupport role it has maximum distance range of approximately 5900 meters zu 232 23mm machine gun the zu 232 is towed or vehiclemounted aaa machine gun the zu 232 normally has fiveman crew the gun commander or crew chief gunner assistant gunner and two ammunition bearers the zu 232 has tactical antiaircraft range of 2500 meters against fast moving aircraft with maximum vertical range of 5100 meters in the ground support role it has maximum distance range of approximately 7000 meters unexploded 23mm rounds present particularly dangerous hazard these rounds have been found throughout afghanistan in and around cities battle areas and caches caution in handling or disposing of these rounds must be exercised snipers snipers situated on mountainsides will target helicopters flying through mountain passes snipers will target the cockpits attempting to kill the crew snipers will for official use only 11oef handbook iiialso target aircraft during landing and take off the most effective weapons for this are highpowered rifles and machine guns fitted with optical sights even the venerable 303 enfield can be effective against low slowflying aircraft section iv command and control c2 amateur or commercial brand very high frequency vhf radios could be used by transnational elements including alqaida and former taliban forces for tactical c2 because these radios are line of sight the signal is degraded by high ground between the transmitting and receiving stations normally tactical leaders squad level operate vhf radios at higher levels above the equivalent of company radio operator may be used all acm forces within afghanistan use amateur or commercial brand high frequency hf radios hf radios with the proper antennas are used for communications over longer distances including over mountains the afghanistan wireless communications company awcc is installing global system for mobile communication gsm infrastructure there is now gsm system in five of afghanistans major cities kabul kandahar mazare sharif herat and jalalabad konduz will be the sixth city to receive all of the necessary equipment for service awccs goal is to have gsm network installed in each provincial capital within the next four to five years each gsm base station is paired with verysmallapertureterminal vsat communications systems this combination has brought limited national communications international and internet connectivity to those cities acm forces are communications parasites on host nations public switched telephone networks pstn cellular telephone satellite telephone and internet communications are used in afghanistan as afghanistan slowly restores its communications backbone acm forces will increase their use of these systems the primary satellite telephone systems that cover afghanistan are thuraya inmarsat and asiasat alqaida leadership is probably using communications officers for many of their communications including satellite telephones couriers are the most secure means of communication available to acm forces while secure couriers are not time sensitive the courier may not know the contents of message if it is on paper or some electronic media if the courier has memorized the message it may be in brevity code when operational information is passed between acm forces this is probably the method used couriers are taught ways of hiding information including ways to take advantage of cultural biases acm forces will use challengeandpassword system the challenge and password system may be in arabic if the force is all alqaida or mixed acm force if the force is made up of only local soldiers the challenge and password could be in dari or pushtu depending on the tribal affiliations of the forces challenges and passwords may be local sayings or proverbs intelligence and reconnaissance acm forces have very effective humint collection and dissemination capability most acm forces operate in their home areas and know the terrain and people there well this knowledge allows them to move in and out of areas with ease often using covered routes acm forces use this capability to their advantage often moving close enough to coalition forces to note friendly positions and security operations 12 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsince acm forces have family and friends in the area they can easily use these people to collect information on the surrounding area to provide them with early warning of coalition activities moreover it is very possible that afghan persons employed by coalition forces are either acm themselves or at least sympathizers take caution in providing missionessential information to afghan government forces until just prior to their need to know acm forces use many commercially bought offthe shelf radios that use hf ultra high frequency uhf and vhf radio bands because radios can be used to listen as well as transmit any radio can be used to intercept radio signals that are not encrypted therefore if coalition radio is sending in the clear it is highly likely that acm forces will be listening although most acm members do not understand english enough do to make this viable threat acm forces are not known to possess the capability to monitor encrypted communications commercial radio scanners are available on the world market and acm forces are known to use them when commercial scanners are used they can quickly pick up nonsecure communications and identify the information as useful or not icom scanners are small enough to be hand held highly portable and used anywhere acm forces particularly those operating in areas where they have lived most if not all their lives are well suited for tactical reconnaissance these personnel are known to be very patient and because they are familiar with the area the people and local events they are particularly adept at conducting reconnaissance missions acm forces will patiently watch coalition force installations in order to determine strength layout key locations daily routines and particularly reaction force capabilities acm forces may conduct an attack or even an ambush only to have observers assess responses of the attacked force it is not unreasonable to expect at least one observer on the inside of facility that can report not only on defenders reactions but also on the attack from the defenders perspective acm forces will use any means necessary to obtain information from the local population they may pay rewards exploit religious or tribal affiliations or threaten locals with various forms of punishment or death the same techniques may also be used to feed false information to coalition forces the local afghanistan population can be potent source of information tribal chiefs and village elders are typically the ones receiving the most information and can pass it to acm forces as easily as they can pass it to coalition forces consider the source of information and motivation of the source when acting on information obtained from the local population checkpoints the traditional fundraising function of the checkpoints declined under the taliban rule although it continued to use them for the same purpose the taliban checkpoints were more accepted since they were more systematic in nature than the ones operated by the warlords while tribal leaders or warlords may attempt to keep the imposition of unofficial tolls to minimum undisciplined and poorly paid afghan militia force amf members may demand payment from travelers unofficial checkpoints usually do not hamper coalition operations for official use only 13oef handbook iiisection v mobility and countermobility mine threat afghanistan remains one of the most heavily mined nations in the world with nearly five million mines still uncleared mines are found in all areas of the country in urban and rural areas near water wells and irrigation canals on roads around mountain strong points and in agricultural regions all these areas have seen frontline fighting additionally major military installations and strategic locations such as airfields and major cities were protected by extensive minefields border areas have been heavily mined in the past the afghanistanpakistan border was heavily mined with antipersonnel mines especially from the border north to kandahar the iranian border region was less heavily mined but has extensive surface laid antitank minefields to prevent supplies being trucked in across the open desert region south of herat rubble in many destroyed cities and villages has been mined sometimes in multiple layers acm forces and supporters can be expected to employ mines and other explosive devices in novel and ingenious ways against coalition forces wellexperienced acm forces have developed many successful and unconventional ttp for using explosive devices against personnel and vehicle targets particularly on trails city streets and roadways especially if coalition forces set patterns of movement markings mines and in many cases unexploded ordnance uxo are marked when locations are known in afghanistan improvised signs have been developed using readily available materials that will not burn wood is often stolen or cut for fires or are not worth stealing such as stones and rocks mines and uxo will be marked with piles of stones or rocks if paint is available stones will be painted the following should be seen as very reliable signs that mines are present rows of lightcoloredpainted white stones are used by the to mark safe lanes and cleared areas stones are usually in regular patterns and close together individual piles of lightcolored rocks unevenly spaced are used by the various fighting factions and locals to mark the minefield perimeters pilesindividual rocks painted red are and faction danger area markers red lettering and marks painted on rock faces or building walls that is start point sp are demining reference markers minefields will be close to these points note lettering is normally on the safe side the uses white paint marks on walls to mark cleared buildings or areas approach with caution since it indicates that mines were in the area there may be more 14 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedlocals use circles of stones surrounding objects to mark individual mines and items of uxo where there is one mine there are usually more crossed sticks pieces of debris on routes and footpaths are signs of mines pieces of material red attached to poles sticks and walls are signs of mines indicators acm forces will take great pains to emplace mines carefully and to camouflage them initial efforts to camouflage mine will be successful but after short time of natural weathering this effect will diminish or will be exposed by nature coalition forces must be trained to spot unusual groundvegetation conditions that might indicate unnatural activity such as mine laying depressions in the ground regularodd spacings raised patches of earth regularodd spacings wiltingdead patches of vegetation potholes in tracks circles of lush grass among thin grass trees bushes and scrap lumber not collected for firewood overgrown fields footpaths and buildings coalition forces should also be observant of the local population if there is an area where they do not go or an abandoned building that has not been salvaged it probably indicates an unsafe area with mines boobytraps or other ieds dead animals with missingdamaged limbs may also indicate mines are in the area note the animal may have walked some distance before dying reference has been made above to uxo which is generally categorized as follows dropped projected thrown and placed ordnance uxo may be found throughout afghanistan and should neither be disturbed nor approached acm forces may however attempt to reuse some of this ordnance in which case it should properly be considered as boobytrap or ied improvised explosive devices ieds and boobytraps bt over the last 20 years afghan fighters have become adept at producing bts and ieds much of this experience was gained during the soviet occupation but experience gained in bosnia and chechnya have also contributed to this knowledge bts and ieds will be sited to avoid detection to improve their effectiveness when activated although historically victim activated recent acm forces trends indicate an increasing use of remote or command detonation especially along roadways the use of ieds such as bts is limited only by the imagination of the enemy bts and ieds have the following characteristics usually explosive in nature usually actuated when an unsuspecting person disturbs an apparently harmless object for official use only 15oef handbook iiidesigned to kill or incapacitate designed to cause random unexpected casualties and damage designed to create an atmosphere of uncertainty and suspicion may be initiated either physically trip wire pressure plate time fuze etc or remotely electronic device such as cell phone or other electronic timer or delay the abundance of uxo and land mines has provided acm forces with ready supply of material for the construction of ieds and bts there are many different techniques for employing ieds coupling is linking two ieds or mines together usually with detonating cord daisy chaining is linking mines commonly antipersonnel ap type with detonating cord detonation of one mine causes the other mines to detonate daisy chains of mines and detonation cord over 200 meters long involving several vacated buildings have been discovered in afghanistan boosting is stacking buried mines on top of each other to increase the force of the blast sensitizing antitank mines involves cracking the pressure plate on some nonmetallic mines in order to reduce the pressure needed to initiate the mine common practice has been to emplace two explosive devices with either timed delay between explosions or remotely detonating each device to achieve maximum destruction or casualties one example would be car rigged with small initial explosive device and larger device which is detonated either by time delay or remotely to kill or injure onlookers emergency ordnance disposal eod police or military personnel investigating the first explosion cartruck bombs sometimes called vehicleborne improvised explosive devices vbieds can serve multiple purposes small bombs may be used to attack personnel convoys or small structures large amounts of explosives such as in van or truck are suitable in attacks against infrastructure such as larger buildings acm forces are capable of using such devices particularly as they try to destabilize or degrade the security provided by government forces section vi logistics caravan and convoy movement acm forces will use the cover of convoys and caravans hereafter referred to as convoys in order to transport military supplies convoys are used to bring weapons ammunition and other supplies into afghanistan from neighboring countries convoys use vehicles livestock camels donkeys or horses or combination of both for transportation 16 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedconvoys move almost exclusively at night to avoid detection by aircraft convoys traveling during daylight hours are usually decoys and rarely carry militaryrelated materials during the day convoys stop in wellconcealed places such as canyons caves dry river beds green zones vegetated areas near oases and rivers destroyed villages or any other available form of cover convoys usually have their own air defense including manpad surfacetoair missiles sams and vehiclemounted machine guns both vehicle and animal convoys depend on advance observation teams or patrols to determine the safety of the route vehicle convoy typical convoy deployment consists of three elements advance observation team personnel on horseback or motorcycle compose the advance team and precede the convoy by several miles they often fire their weapons in order to provoke return fire from suspected enemy or threat decoy team small portion of the convoy follows 15 to 45 minutes behind the observation team this group is loaded with foodstuffs clothing or other nonmilitary material and serves as decoy to draw out enemy troops main element the significant part of the convoy accompanied by armed mujahedin fighters follows as much as an hour or more behind the decoy team if either the observation team or the decoy team are interdicted the main element disperses and hides in available covered areas animal convoy advance observation team teenager an old man or couple of men with donkey will lead the convoy by two to three km as rule they do not carry weapons or radio and use small signal mirror to inform the next element about route security decoy team the decoy team follows the observation team at distance of 500 to 800 meters the distance is adjusted to maintain line of sight to observe the mirror signals from the advance team this element usually consists of 10 to 20 armed men equipped with radio to communicate with the main element they will often have two or three animals loaded with less valuable supplies to allay suspicion if stopped if they come under attack their mission is to offer sufficient resistance to allow the main element to turn back or take an alternate route main element the main element follows one to two km behind the decoy team and disperses if either forward unit encounters threat forces the most valuable items are usually carried in the middle of the convoy and are heavily guarded when fighting the soviets false deceptive convoys were often used in this case real convoy does not follow forward patrols instead the main element consists of 5 to 15 animals with 20 to 40 handlers transporting nonmilitary items such as food or clothing this tactic prevented the soviets from blanket targeting similar convoys for ambush for official use only 17oef handbook iiicaches caches are used to supply acm forces throughout afghanistan acm forces typically travel with very light loads sometimes without weapons and ammunition as these forces arrive in their operational area they are supplied from nearby caches with arms ammunition and sometimes additional supplies such as food clothing and communication equipment needed to conduct specific operations or missions cache points also provide convenient hiding places for weapons unused ammunition and other supplies upon mission completion allowing acm forces to move about without incriminating materials in their possession cache points are typically well concealed and range in size from small containing few rifles machine guns or rpg launchers and ammunition to large containing several hundred weapons of varying sizes ammunition communications equipment food clothing and in some cases shelter cache points include caves houses and possibly commercial or government facilities guards may be posted to protect cache points the number of guards is determined by the size and importance of the cache most individualshouseholds in rural areas have their own small cache of small arms and ammunition they are used for selfdefense purposes and are often embellished with personal decorations these caches should not be confused or mistaken for caches maintained by warlords or acm forces which include larger numbers of weapons and heavy or crewserved weapons section vii denial and deception dd technical understanding and knowledge of signatures there are numerous potential scenarios where knowledge of target deception and signature management may be employed against coalition forces acm forces have demonstrated basic and sometimes effective knowledge of dd measures to counter coalition force capabilities some acm forces especially alqaida trained fighters understand the principles of thermal and radar imagers and nightvision equipment and have disseminated plans for countering these sensors the author of document found in afghanistan makes this distinction quite clear by saying nightvision devices see in the dark whereas thermal imager is heat detector countermeasures while few acm fighters have comprehensive knowledge of modern sensors most fighters have learned the importance of countermeasures to degrade or defeat these sensors some of the following countermeasures are quite simple but nonetheless effective spider holes acm fighters use various signaturecontrol techniques to avoid being targeted by thermal sights and sensors these techniques involve the use of spider hole fighting positions and vehicle coverings the spider hole consists of digging mansized hole or finding crack in rocks which can be covered for concealment once the hole is prepared it is covered by brush blankets andor tarps the coverings may also have layer of snow soil or ice on top or they may be wet vehicles may be concealed by covering them with tarp that supports snow or soil in manner similar to the spider hole 18 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsensor savvy acm soldiers used covering tarps to attempt to defeat infrared sensors and other means of detection they put tarps over vehicles and blankets over themselves when they note an unarmed aerial vehicle overhead employed in combination with spider holes and placed beneath trees or bushes tarps and blankets proved quite effective they may be used because of lack of purposemade camouflage nets or coverings they are also readily available since many afghans use them as tents or sleeping bags reliable information indicates that acm forces understand the technical concept of reducing their signatures to blend with the ambient temperature of the terrain around them thermal decoys among the documents recovered from alqaida associated sites in afghanistan was document in arabic titled information to my afghani mujahideen brothers that outlined the basics of nightvision equipment and thermal imagers it described technique to counter thermal imagers that consists of creating thermal decoys with smoldering wood fires built in shallow pits to make the pilot launch his missiles at the pit it discussed how to build and place these decoys with the intention of creating false heatemitting targets subtle differences will differentiate between this form of heatemitting false target and the heat signatures of real targets ºthe decoy targets will appear somewhat brighter than clothed fighter ºthe decoy signature will also differ from that of vehicle exhaust in that other parts of the vehicle that are normally present in the thermal image would be absent in the case of the deception however an observer unaware of possible deception may not recognize these clues among the documents recovered from alqaidaassociated sites in afghanistan was document that provided insight into how one might deceive radar with decoy built from available materials ºthe method described using pieces of metal including tin cans interspersed with pile of rocks approximating the size of the vehicle or other asset such as crewserved weapon that the decoy depicts ºthis decoy in combination with thermal decoys and signature management could prove effective in target denial and deception ºoperationally these methods could be used to simulate the presence of acm troops in an area where they are not deception to conceal or to deceive coalition forces as to the disposition and composition of an actual acm presence tactical responses acm forces may use variety of tactical methods to counter coalition forces capabilities to include spider holes caves or rocks to hide in or behind decoys for equipment and positionsoef handbook iii for official use only 19camouflage individual equipment and

defense operations include establishing the base defense coordination net passing indications and warning iw to unit tocs and all personnel on the base raising force protection levels for all soldiers on base activating and manning all perimeter supplemental positions reacting tostopping perimeter breach by armed personnel reacting to ied incident reacting to attack from indirect fire or air attack activating the bunker occupation plan reacting toevacuating casualty actions for base defense should be clearly outlined in the base defense sop the base defense sop should be disseminated down to the soldier level ensuring that every soldier understands his part in the base defense plan base defense exercises should be conducted regularly to ensure compliance with the sop it is too late to discover flaw in the base defense plan when an actual attack occurs units should consider the following when creating or updating base defense sops force protection levels systematic approach needs to be established to alert all units on base about the increase in the force protection level often isolated units and civiliangovernment organizations are overlooked 38 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsoldiers need to ensure that protective equipment such as iba and protective mask is readily available units especially staff section noncommissioned officersincharge ncoics must establish an sop based on the current threat for ensuring protective equipment is on hand bunkers engineers should routinely inspect bunkers to ensure that they are safe to occupy units that maintain bunkers should ensure that plan exists to provide light heat food and water for the bunker in the event that bunkers are occupied for extended periods these life support items are essential when bunker occupation plan is activated each bunker must have type of communication means to ensure that soldiers remain informed of the situation either land line or an fm radio will work there must be plan to ensure accountability of personnel when bunker occupation plan is activated there will be different personnel in different bunkers depending on time of occupation alarms alarms such as sirens need to be tested routinely alarms should be heard throughout all areas of the base supplemental alarms such as vehicle horns may need to be used to reach isolated areas of base different alarms can be used to distinguish between different types of attacks one type of alarm can signify an airmortarartillery attack and different type of alarm can signify ground attack different actions may be required of soldiers for these two types of attacks newtransient soldiers and visitors ºunits should ensure that new soldiers are briefed on force protection levels on the first day they arrive in theater units should also provide guidance to newly arrived soldiers on actions to take in the event of an attack on the base ºsoldiers in transit and visitors may be at base when it is attacked these soldiers will not be aware of the actions that are required of them in the event of an attack it is the responsibility of all soldiers to assist and provide guidance to these visitors who are not familiar with the base sops civilianslocal nationals on base there may be many local nationals on base doing various jobs these local nationals need to be accounted for ensuring their safety from attack the safety of soldiers should be considered in the event that some of these local nationals decide to participate in the attack perimeter security varying the patterns or activities of base camp security helps avoid routines and reduces the possibility of being targeted for official use only 39oef handbook iiieffective base camp security measures are the best precaution to deter prospective intruders from attempting base camp penetration constant assessment and reevaluation of incidents and reporting from units and convoys assist the s2g2 in identifying trends and analyzing the tactics and techniques of perpetrators proactive army criminal investigation command cid programs are the cornerstones to thorough investigation of incidents and civil affairs campaigns assist in identifying community needs and the dissemination of information alert procedures alert procedures vary slightly for each base but are generally initiated by an alarm followed by instructions issued over public address system the alert is also passed by word of mouth by inhabitants of the base once initiated personnel occupy their battle stations or bunkers depending on the battle drill units ensure accountability of personnel and report the status to the base defense operations center bdoc stand down from the alert is issued on the public address system civilians inside the base camp there are many civilians inside the wire at any given time these civilians include local nationals contractors civil servants department of defense dod and department of the army da as well as personnel from other government agencies civilians need to be accounted for and secured at protected location if the situation permits local civilians should be escorted outside the wire c2 of the perimeter defense the bdoc is responsible for c2 of the base during an attack each living area has commander responsible for accountability and security of all personnel these commanders take direction from the base operations or airfield support task force commanders during base defense operations regardless of rank or duty position individuals should take direction from designated base defense leadership during an attack designated key and essential personnel who will not assist in the base defense plan should move as soon as possible to their assigned positions in the toc or joint operation center joc section vi tactical convoy operations convoy planning and preparation procedures and tips this section contains useful information that augments doctrinal guidelines to support convoy operational planning and execution it provides quick reference on methods and ttp for the proper conduct of convoys it focuses on planning and preparing convoy operations there are important planning considerations that 40 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedshould be included in unit sops the following subject areas assist convoy commanders and noncommissioned officers ncos in the planning process unit sop complete sop facilitates planning at company level sops should conform to the next higher headquarters at minimum the sop should cover the following subjects duties of the convoy commander and other convoy control personnel convoy organization weapons and ammunition to be carried hardening of vehicles protective equipment to be worn preparation of convoy vehicles for example information on tarpaulins tailgates and windshields counter ambush actions operations security measures immediate action drills actions during scheduled halts maintenance and recovery of disabled vehicles refueling and rest halts communications actions at the release point reporting command responsibilities the commander of the moving unit is responsible for the mechanical condition of his vehicles leaders must inspect all vehicles according to appropriate tms before departing for the mission convoy commanders should also ensure that additional fuel water and lubricants are provided for enroute requirements loads are inspected tarpaulin troop safety straps and end curtains are provided when required vehicles are hardened when required columns are identified with appropriate markings weapons are inspected marshaling or assembly area inspection teams technique for large unit movements is to establish marshaling area or assembly area inspection points as convoys are ready to depart they proceed to the inspection point for final checks and driver briefings unitlevel maintenance personnel may be available to assist unit leadership in correcting lastminute minor for official use only 41oef handbook iiideficiencies trucks with major problems will be returned to the parent unit and replaced with serviceable vehicles hardening vehicles cover the cargo bed of troopcarrying vehicles with at least double interlocking layer of sandbags cover the cab floor of all vehicles with double layer of sandbags under the drivers seat take care not to hamper pedal movement or the drivers access to the pedals as an additional precaution place heavy rubber or fiber mat over the sandbags to reduce danger from fragments such as sharpened stones sand and metal parts of the vehicle this also prolongs the life of sandbags sandbags may also be placed on the fuel tank fenders and hood when contemplating hardening vehicles for escort andor gun truck duty use one escortgun truck for every eight task vehicles prior approval from higher headquarters must be received before task vehicles are converted into escortgun trucks convoy identification identify each column with blue flag on the lead vehicle and green flag on the rear vehicle mount flags on the left of the vehicles either front or rear position flags so they do not interfere with driver vision or functional components of the vehicle when movement is at night the lead vehicle shows blue light and the rear vehicle green light the vehicle of the convoy commander and the march unit commanders must display white and black diagonal flag on the left front bumper this flag is divided diagonally from the lower left corner to the upper right corner with the upper left triangle white and the lower right triangle black trail party vehicles carry an international orange safety flag state and local police or mp escort vehicles do not display convoy identification flags the convoy movement order includes convoy clearance number ccn that identifies the convoy during its entire movement the ccn is placed on both sides of each vehicle in the convoy and if possible on the front and back of each vehicle it is also placed on the top of the hood of the lead and rear vehicles of each march unit final preparation final convoy preparation includes organizing the convoy briefing personnel and inspecting individual equipment and vehicles convoy personnel are usually briefed after the vehicles are lined up after the convoy commanders briefing personnel are returned to the control of the march unit commanders who give final instructions leaders make final inspections of loads to ensure that they are properly secured and that vehicles are ready to move night convoys night convoys are extremely vulnerable to ambush and sniper fire if night convoys are required units must be trained in techniques for night convoys night loading and offloading and night refueling heed the following guidelines for night convoys keep night convoys small use roads that drivers know make maximum use of nightvision devices 42 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedrehearse movements conduct leader reconnaissance plan night moves in the same manner as daylight moves however night moves take longer and there is greater chance for mistakes injury and fratricide when planning night move determine if the convoy will operate in an area that requires blackout drive the area commander will make this decision harbor area is space set aside for normal halts traffic control and emergency congestion relief harbor areas are used to hold vehicles at both ends of crossing or defile make changes in density especially at first or last light contain spillovers in serious delays likely to be caused by enemy air attack or its results allow columns to rest and carry out maintenance and decontamination allow elements to change position in column if there is change in priorities vehicle hardening as the nature of conflict changes so does the threat to logistics units war and certain other operationsespecially peacekeeping or peacemakingplace renewed emphasis on convoy security and reinforce lessons learned in vietnam current threats include the use of commanddetonated and pressuresensitive mines placed on above or along the shoulders of roads traveled by military vehicles and the ambushing of convoys and harassment with sniper fire these methods of disrupting military operations are highly effective and cheap additionally these methods require limited time and labor are easy to coordinate and can be accomplished by an unsophisticated enemy to counter these threats motor transport units may be provided with security forces and supporting arms firepower special vehiclehardening techniques using sandbags and other improvised material have proved successful in protecting convoy personnel equipment and cargo although effective vehiclehardening techniques must be tailored to fit the specific environment in which the motor transport units are operating hardened vehicles hardened vehicle is made less vulnerable to the effects of explosives and small arms fire by adding sandbags armor plating ballistic glass and other protective devices hardening may make certain vehicle components and cargo less vulnerable its primary purpose however is to protect the trucks occupants the protection afforded is significant and often means the difference between injury and death sandbags sandbags are effective in reducing the effects of blasts preventing fire from reaching the driver and providing protection from small arms fire and fragmentation sandbags are usually readily available and do not permanently impair the flexibility of vehicles sandbags can easily be added or removed from the vehicle as the situation dictates one drawback to using sandbags is that their weight limits the vehicles capability to haul cargo for official use only 43oef handbook iiiexperience shows that using sandbags to harden vehicle cabs for protection against mine blasts saves lives normally the cabs of all vehicles subject to detonating mines are hardened certain cautions however must always be observed sandbags should be placed so that they ºdo not restrict the movement of foot pedals levers or controls ºdo not interfere with the normal functions performed by the driver ºdo not restrict driver vision to reduce the sandblast effect when mine is detonated near the vehicle various materials may be placed on top of the floorboard sandbags rubber mats light metal plates plywood or scraps of runway membrane material wetting down the sandbags is also effective but contributes to deterioration of the metal to properly prepare the vehicle cab doublestack sandbags under the passenger seat and on the cab floor stack the sandbags two high under the drivers seat in some vehicles this may not be possible remove the tools from the basic issue item bii storage compartment and place them inside the bed place sandbags in the storage compartment to give the driver required protection as an added precaution place heavy rubber or fiber mat over the sandbags this reduces danger from fragments stones sand and metal parts from the vehicle if the tools remain in the bii storage compartment and the vehicle detonates mine the tools may become secondary projectiles that can injure the driver if sandbags cannot be placed under the passenger seat because batteries are located there stack the sandbags on the seat never place sandbags directly on the batteries the cab of 5ton m923 cargo truck needs about 14 to 20 sandbags while 2 12ton truck requires about 12 to 18 sandbags figure 21 proper placement of sandbags in the cab 44 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned cover side windows and the front windshield with wire mesh to protect personnel from rocks and grenades the convoy commander will decide whether to have windshields removed lowered or left in place if the windshield interferes with the use of weapons and blackout operations and must be lowered place single layer of sandbags under the windshield lower the windshield onto the bags place second layer of sandbags over the windshield and then cover both with canvas placing sandbags under the windshield ensures that constant vibrations of the vehicle do not damage the windshield sand is not blown into the drivers face glass will not shatter and injure the driver and passenger leaving the windshield in place protects against heavy and driving rain incoming grenades and decapitation of personnel from wire stretched across the road figure 22 proper placement of sandbags under the windshield depending on the type of load the cargo bed may or may not be hardened for example if troops are being transported the bed needs to be hardened with double layer of sandbags the bags also need to be properly fitted to the contours of the vehicle stack the bags five high around the sides of the vehicle to add protection to hold the sandbags in place construct support structure and place it inside the bed of the vehicle this structure can be made by using fourbyfours on the corners and twobysixes in between for official use only 45oef handbook iii caution must be taken to ensure that the sandbags do not exceed the allowable weight of the vehicle bed doublestacking the sandbags increases the possibility of exceeding the vehicles payload capacity the mission coupled with the enemy threat must determine the extent of hardening single or doublelayer sandbags the bottom line is to ensure soldier safety it takes about 226 sandbags dry weighing about 40 lbs each to prepare the bed of 5ton m923 cargo truck distribution is as follows 86 on the floor bed single layer five high on each side 50 per side 100 bags 20 in the front and 20 in the rear of the bed protective plating around the fuel tank will lessen the damage to the fuel tank it will also help to ensure that the fuel tank is not pierced thus immobilizing the vehicle this protective measure is especially critical when vehicle is caught in the kill zone of an ambush an alternative solution to this problem is to hook up 5gallon can of fuel in safe location for use as an auxiliary fuel tank this will allow the vehicle to travel safe distance outside the kill zone if all the fuel is drained from damaged fuel tank figure 23 support structure for the bed of the truck 46 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned top view 5ton cargo body frame is constructed using pressure treated lumber end posts are 4x4s 48 high side and end rails are 2x6s once the frame is completed cover the sides with plywood 2x6 cut to fit 4x4 48 highfigure 24 sandbagged 5ton m923 cargo truck 5ton m923 cargo truck requires about five sandbags to provide top protection consider placing protective plating around the sides and bottom of the fuel tank to increase protection older vehicles in the army inventory may still be operating on motor gasoline mogas if tank filled with mogas is ruptured the fuel may ignite and seriously burn operating personnel when putting sandbags or protective plating on or around the fuel tank ensure that the hanger straps of the fuel tank do not crack or break gun trucks logistical convoys cannot always depend on military police support or added firepower to provide more firepower for convoy units developed the gun truck the purposes of hardened gun truck are to provide base of fire help counter enemy attacks increase survivability of the convoy the gun truck is equipped with crewserved weapons system preferably in protective position in vietnam this principle worked well and provided convoys means of selfdefense deploy the gun truck in the convoy where it can best provide the needed firepower if adequate communications assets are available they should be located with the gun truck and the convoy commander this enables the convoy commander to call the gun truck forward when needed predesignated signal is required to bring the gun truck forward and inform the crewserved weapon system personnel of the enemy location if communications assets are not adequate pyrotechnics may be used to signal the gun truck to move forward for official use only 47oef handbook iii the gun truck should not be maneuvered right on top of the enemy location the crewserved weapons on the gun truck can cover significant distance therefore the vehicle should be situated where it has clear field of fire to engage the enemy with the maximum effective range of the weapon if necessary and if available multiple gun trucks can be used when using multiple gun trucks in convoy overlapping fields of fire greatly increases the convoys chance of survival based on availability types of weapon systems and size of the convoy the placement and number of gun trucks may vary with companysize and larger convoys minimum of two gun trucks should be used to provide overlapping fire one gun truck for every eight vehicles in the convoy is recommended consider using the mk19 or m203 to penetrate prepared defensive positions since small arms fire may not be capable of destroying enemy positions ballistic test results it is critical that the most protective material available be used to harden vehicle ballistic tests show that sand is about twice as effective as clay in hardening vehicles at maximum velocity of 3250 feet per second at range of zero feet it takes about 6 feet of sand and 12 feet of clay to stop 556mm round at maximum velocity of 2750 feet per second it takes about 9 feet of sand or 17 feet of clay to stop 762mm round finally at the maximum velocity it takes about 14 feet of sand or 26 feet of clay to stop 50caliber round using the most protective substance could mean the difference between life and death for our most precious resourceour soldiers camouflage and concealment camouflage and concealment techniques can be used to make it more difficult for the enemy to spot the convoy the type of cargo being transported can be disguised or concealed by tarpaulin other effective measures include the following camouflaging or covering shiny surfaces before convoy departure painting vehicles in pattern to blend in with the terrain and break the outline training operators to look for other means of concealment to break the outline of the vehicle covering vehicle bumper markings the vehicle bumper markings can provide great deal of intelligence information to the enemy mines and booby traps forces engaging in ambushes frequently use mines and booby traps commanddetonated mines are often used to initiate an ambush mines may also be planted along the shoulder of the road to harass and interdict booby trap system may be used against personnel and equipment convoys have employed the following guidelines to effectively limit damage from mines 48 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedtrack the vehicle in front avoid driving on the shoulder of the road whenever possible do not run over foreign objects on the road avoid potholes and fresh earth on the road watch local national traffic and the reactions of people on foot they will often give away the location of any mines or booby traps when possible arrange for the engineers to sweep the road ahead before the convoy moves over it use 2 12ton or larger truck as the lead vehicle instead of hmmwv hard vehicles such as tanks are useful in exploding small mines in front of the convoy harden vehicles use water in vehicle tires when there is threat of mines exploding under the tires increase ground clearance distance between the point of explosion and the vehicle if possible use the following personal safety measures ºwear protective equipment ºuse safety belts ºensure seat belts are tight otherwise whiplash may occur during an explosion also fasten the seat belt as low as possible on the stomach ºuse correct posture keep the backbone straight and supported by backrest to better absorb shock and place feet flat on the floor ºadjust vehicle speed based on the situation ºdisperse vehicles and maintain intervals in somalia the army experienced commanddetonated mines of 30 50 and 60 pounds these devices were placed in one of the many potholes in the road to avoid such obstacles andor minimize damage implement the above techniques currently the acms employ similar methods using ieds with greater potential for destruction some indicators that have proven effective in identifying the location of potential mines are damaged vehicles signs of digging holes in the road potholes concrete removal or puddles boxes along the roadside wires on the road surface evidence of vegetation disturbance disturbances in previous tire tracks for official use only 49oef handbook iiidifferences in plant growth such as wilting or dead foliage irregularities in color or texture of the ground signs warning local populace the enemy is likely to place mines on frequently used roadways leading to and from construction sites brush and other traffic obstructions placed on roadways bridge bypasses obvious turnarounds and shoulders convoy planning tools all too often convoys are treated as administrative moves instead of the combat operations they are there is such thing as an administrative move in combat zone tactical convoys are combat operations and must be treated as such they require additional planning and coordination beyond normal linehaul operation the probability for running into enemy contact is greater and therefore more detailed preparation is necessary what follows is framework to assist with the planning and execution of tactical convoy it is not an allinclusive list but it will give the convoy commander checklist to successfully complete the mission appendices b c and d contain convoy checklists section vii vehicle battle drills driver side contact drill driver must continuously scan and remain alert for threats within his sector of scan 9 to 1 oclock position by observing driver side passenger side and rearview mirrors early threat identification will allow the driver to more quickly place direct fire on the threat within hisher sector of fire 9 to 1 oclock position using the following weapon engagement techniques and procedures the drivers method of engagement will be reflexive fire trained during close quarters marksmanship cqm however the weapon is pointed not aimed because the drivers primary task is controlling the vehicle the weapon is best handled like pistol the right hand is controlling weapon movement and elevation by allowing the upper receiver to pivot on the drivers left arm the weapons rate of fire will be on semiautomatic with rapid trigger squeezes this rate of fire is recommended as firing on burst will cause the weapons muzzle to rise up and become uncontrollable drill 1 this drill begins with the drivers weapon stored in its proper location in the cab unit standing operating procedures sop based on type of vehicle the type of vehicle and physical size of the driver and truck commander tc will have significant impact on this battle drill as the weapon is passed between both bottom line is to ensure that weapons are on safe that positive control is maintained for each weapon and that vocal commands are understood 50 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnednote m249sm203s are not recommended for use by drivers due to possible loss of control of weapon system and vehicle 1 upon making threat contact the driver will activate the left turn signal and announce contact 2 the tc will place the drivers weapon into the crook of the drivers left arm by grasping the weapon by the pistol grip with the left hand and the handguard with the right during placement of the weapon the barrel should extend over the drivers left arm with the magazine located against the crook of the elbow the tc will then announce secure weapon 3 the driver will grasp the pistol grip with his right hand and announce weapon secure 4 hearing this the tc will release the weapon and turn to scan his sector 5 during the engagement the driver will observe the threat area for two seconds firing rapidly on semiautomatic he should then direct attention back to the operation of the vehicle for two seconds this should continue until there is longer threat 6 in the event the driver runs out of ammo or experiences weapon malfunction the following actions will take place the driver will announce out of ammo or malfunction and place his weapon on safe b the tc ensuring his own weapon is on safe will place his weapon between the drivers body and the drivers weapon using the same weapon handling procedures and announce weapon c the tc will then grasp the butt stock of the drivers weapon with his right hand and announce secure weapon d the driver will then remove his hand from his weapon and grasp the pistol grip of the tcs weapon and announce weapon secure the tc will then remove the drivers weapon using twohand control and return to his seat f tc is responsible for clearing misfiresreloading the drivers weapon 7 following the reduction or elimination of the threat the following actions will occur the driver will place his weapon on safe and announce secure weapon b the tc will grasp the weapon with both hands and announce weapon secure for official use only 51oef handbook iiic the driver will then place his firing hand back onto the steering wheel resume scanning and turn off the turn signal 8 drivers should not fire when vehicle is moving at speeds of 40 miles per hour mph or greater b during times of limited visibility night fog heavy rain dust storm c during severe hazardous or limited road conditions bridges narrow paths damaged roads road construction d in situations where there is passenger who could cover hisher sector of fire for example in four seat high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle hmmwv in areas crowded with noncombatants truck commander tc contact drill the tc must continuously scan and remain alert for threats within his sector of scan 11 to 3 oclock position early identification will allow the tc to more quickly achieve proper body position and place effective suppressive fire on the threat within hisher sector of fire 1 to 3 oclock position using the following drill drill 2 1 once threat is identified the tc will announce the threat to the driver activate right turn signal while attempting to engage the threat with suppressive fire within his sector of fire 1 to 3 oclock position using proper weapon engagement techniques body positioning tc should attempt to achieve position that allows maximum stabilization inside the cab maximum stabilization depends on the type of vehicle and equipment in the area of the tc and must be practiced until the individual is comfortable ºfiring shoulder should be the same side the individual normally uses ºin order to achieve rapid effective aim the weapon is brought up to the head the head should not drop down ºthe firer should ensure his elbow is down

increasing speed in order to reduce exposure and deny the threat the ability to effectively engage the convoy figure 25 drill 1 1 continuously observe sectors of scan 2 place suppressive fire on the threat using individual weapon engagement techniques provided in vehicle battle drills proceed through the contact for official use only 61oef handbook iii zone increasing speed and interval and do not bunch up 3 activate vehicle turn signal to indicate direction of contact or most dangerous contact when engaged from both sides 4 report contact on internal communications identifying truck number type of contact and clock direction 5 gun trucks maintain front and rear security of the convoy as the convoy continues movement through the contact zone engagement of the threat should occur without affecting the momentum of the gun truck or the convoy if gun trucks are required to reposition or stop in order to engage they will assume their original positions when the convoy passes out of the contact area 6 convoy leadership submits size activity location unit time and equipment salute report to higher 7 convoy will proceed to rally point forward 8 any vehicle with casualty will maintain momentum and activate fourway flashers if possible the uninjured occupant will notify convoy leadership using communication systems techniques and procedures drivers must remain focused on the vehicle to their front and rear as those vehicles may be unaware that contact has occurred maintain interval and be ready to execute sudden maneuvers if vehicles to the front are forced to stop activate turn signal only while the contactthreat is in each vehicles sector this action will assist personnel to quickly focus on the exact location reporting should be second in priority to engaging the threat when reporting within convoy call signs should be designated vehicle position first vehicle is truck 1 second is truck 2 etc this allows personnel to quickly identify the location of concern reports should be accurate and concise who what where and when convoy leadership should identify and direct target engagements of gun trucks for example gun truck 1 engage rpg team 3 oclock 200 meters convoy commanders should submit request for medical evacuation medevac as soon as there is an indication of serious casualty do not wait until you reach the rally point specific grid can be transmitted later

forced to stop will return fire and exit the vehicle 2 all other vehicles in the convoy will stop and where possible return fireexit the vehicle once dismounted the convoy will rapidly gain fire superiority using wellaimed semiautomatic fire from both flanks of the threat 3 vehicles not in direct contact will report on internal communication if possible identifying truck number type of contact and clock direction 4 convoy leadership will reposition to better assess the situation and reposition gun trucks using available cover and concealment and standoff range to increase the volume of fire in the contact zone from multiple directions figure 27 5 once convoy leadership determines the convoy has either gained fire superiority or defeated the enemy threat the senior convoy leader will decide to execute casualty evacuation casevacrecovery predetermined destruction criteria should be established during planning to expedite operations when recovery is not possible 6 if the convoy leadership determines the convoy cannot gain fire superiority or eliminate the threat the leadership will break contact from the kill zone techniques and procedures leaders outside the contact zone must establish 360degree security and be aware of second potential threat from different direction convoy leadership should identify and direct gun trucks target engagement for example gun truck 1 engage rpg team 3 oclock 200 meters conservation of ammunition is important once dismounted all personnel should be engaging with weapons in the semiautomatic mode and engage only visible threat targets prior to breaking contact an attempt should be made to recover all weapons and sensitive items from vehicles that are nonrecoverable andor being abandoned casualty evacuation casevac and recovery drill casevac is defined as the removal of casualties from highrisk situation or area personnel will not be able to provide immediate aid until fire superiority has been established once fire superiority is achieved extraction and movement of casualties will often require field expedient procedures recovering vehicles from the contact zone should be conducted with hasty recovery procedures 64 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned figure 28 drill 3 1 once the convoy leadership determines that the area in the vicinity of the casualtys andor disabled vehicles is secure or the enemy is suppressed casevac and recovery operations may begin 2 casevac the team will move forward blowing their horn continuously to warn dismounts of the vehicles approach and position their vehicle on the noncontact side of the vehicle with the casualtys the team will then extract casualties and load them immediately into the aid and litter vehicle as safely and quickly as possible b treatment of the casualtys will not occur inside the threat area except for emergency treatment to prevent loss of life and then only as the vehicle is departing the area c the convoy commander must decide what other vehicles in the convoy will accompany the vehicle with casualties on board to floating rally point as minimum there will be one additional vehicle to provide security with leader and singlechannel ground and airborne radio system sincgars capability 3 vehicle recovery procedures recovery team will position on the safe side of the disabled vehicle in the same manner as the team b tc will dismount and assess the disabled vehicle looking for any safety reason why hasty recovery chains towstraps or cables not tow bars cannot be accomplished for official use only 65oef handbook iii c if it is determined the vehicle can be safely recovered tc will guide the recovery vehicle into position that best allows hasty hookup the driver of the disabled vehicle will then mount and operate the disabled vehicle until free of the contact area if the driver is casualty the tc of the recovery vehicle will operate the vehicle being towed d upon exiting the contact area or at the rally point hookup procedures will occur using tow bar techniques and procedures cls or medic should not be assigned to an team unless the unit has sufficient clss to provide first line treatment at the rally point personnel assigned this task should have basic cls knowledgetraining in order to provide basic treatment at the casualty collection point ccp personnel dismounted inside the contact zone will initially engage the enemy threat due to the risk of more casualties treatment or casevac is second in priority to permit rapid pickup and safe transportation of casualties team vehicles should be free of extraneous equipment to ensure quick exit from the contact area and recovery vehicle drivers will not exit their vehicles in the contact zone hasty hookup procedures should be established by unit leaders hasty recovery devices can be chains or cables already rigged on the recovery vehicle all other vehicles must have capability to quickly hookup this chain or cable and recovery personnel will not separate themselves from their weapons during casevac or recovery operations once the casualties are loaded or the vehicle recovered and recovery teams should contact convoy leadership when ready to move break contact drill this drill is designed to establish basic procedures for withdrawing personnel and equipment from situation where the convoy is either unable to gain fire superiority or the mission dictates immediate withdrawal leaders must adapt to the situation as different actions may be required based on disposition of convoy assets on either side of the contact zone this drill begins with the decision to withdraw drill 4 1 convoy leadership will identify either rally point rear or forward or if necessary both rally points communication systems andor appropriate pyrotechnic signals will be used to communicatesignal the decision to break contact and the designated rally points 2 personnel on vehicles to be abandoned will remove weapons and other sensitive items and initiate destruction based on guidance established in the convoy brief 66 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned3 personnel in the contact zone will assist with evacuation of all casualties as required personnel not required will continue to engage the threat location in order to provide fire support for the convoys withdrawal once dismounted individuals have bounded back to safe locations leaders must ensure that all personnel are accounted for 4 leaders within the contact zone will direct personnel remaining to bound individually in the direction of egress maintaining covering fire to the extent possible figure 29 5 vehicles that are functional can displace either backwards or forwards vehicles closest to the threat move first as demonstrated in figures 29 or 210 vehicles will continue to displace in this fashion until all personnel and vehicles have cleared the contact zone as personnel and vehicles displace it is important to reposition leaders and gun trucks as necessary to maintain command and control and suppressive fires in support of the breakout figure 210 for official use only 67oef handbook iii rally point rear 1 2 3 4 56 rally point rearrally point forward 6 3 1 2 4 576 upon exiting the threatcontact zone personnel andor vehicles will move to and occupy the designated rally points and begin consolidation and reorganization techniques and procedures conservation of ammunition is important all personnel once dismounted should be engaging with weapons in the semiautomatic mode when executing casualty evacuation casevac it may be necessary to maneuver additional personnel from teams into the contact area to assist personnel in the contact zone are best positioned to determine the direction they break contact movement from the contact zone in vehicles may not be possible if it requires turning the vehicle around while in contact personnel in these situations may be required to abandon their vehicle it is essential for dismounted individuals breaking contact to move in the shortest direction to achieve safe covered position this may cause round about route back to the remainder of the convoy when moving in or from the contract zone it is important to use all available cover and concealment predetermined destruction criteria and procedures should be established and provided if the vehiclecargo is sensitive occupy floating rally points drill floating rally points are established using determined distance either forward or rear of contact depending on the nature of the contact and disposition of vehicles floating rally point rather than fixed or predetermined rally points is used because contact locations are unpredictable once at floating rally point unit will need to establish formation that facilitates security command and control consolidation and reorganization activities figure 211 68 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned civilian trafficdrill 5 1 unless otherwise directed floating rally point forward will be located approximately two to six miles in the direction of movement andor outside the range of enemy weapon systems being employed against you the floating rally point rear will be located approximately two to six miles andor outside the range of enemy weapon systems being employed against you whenever possible the actual rally point site selected should be in an open area with maximum observation in all directions and should not be located near built up areas 2 occupation of the rally point will occur using the box formation if possible the shoulder of the road will be used if conditions are appropriate and safe for all vehicles if unable to pull off the roadway vehicles will establish the formation to the right side of the roadway to allow civilian vehicles to move around the convoys left side occupation will begin with the first vehicle positioning hisher vehicle in manner that blocks direct entry into the front center of the formation all additional vehicles will alternate right and left in order to establish the rest of the box as pictured in figure 211 the convoy commander andor command and control vehicles will be positioned inside the centersafe area the rear of the box will be blocked in the same manner as the front 3 gun trucks while primarily responsible for maintaining support by fire positions are also part of the consolidation and reorganization gun trucks will normally occupy the 12 and 6 oclock position in the convoy box formation if the rally point is in restricted terrain gun trucks may be positioned to cover dead space or even patrol around the convoy box 4 drivers and passengers dismount towards the inside of the box and establish perimeter security leaders must ensure that 360degree security is established and maintained 5 casualty treatmentevacuation casualty treatment will begin upon occupying the rally point vehicles with casualties on board will have fourway flashers turned on the team will remove the casualty from the vehicle and immediately begin buddyaid until relieved by cls b clss will scan vehicles in search of casualties fourway flashers upon encountering casualty the cls will evaluate buddyaid and if adequate continue his search c teams secure and transport casualties to the ccp designated by convoy leadership using litters fully assembled cots body bags or other improvised conveyance the ccp is typically located in the center of the formation behind the convoy commanders vehicle after movement of casualties teams will assist the cls with treatment and preparation for movementevacuation teams are also responsible for securing weapons and other sensitive items belonging to seriously wounded casualties for official use only 69oef handbook iiid convoy commander will direct initiation of the medevac request based on situation and casualty status the convoy commanders driver will submit the actual medevac request using the approved 9line report see example in section four reports and signaling 6 landing zone lz procedures the lz should be at least 75 to 100 meters downwind from the rally point it can be marked with vs17 panel smoke reflective hazard triangles chem lites or vehicle lights b helicopters land and take off into the wind the lz selected should not require the helicopter to land or take off over the convoy c the lz is secured with gun truck or similar vehicle equipped with an automatic weapon the gun truck moves to location away from the flight path of the landing helicopter but in good fire support position to provide early warning of approaching enemy elements the lz area is cleared of anything that may be sucked into the aircraft engine or is hazardous in any way d when the aircraft notifies the convoy that it is inbound member of the lz team deploys smoke grenade if available to indicate wind direction the grenade should be dropped on the downwind side of the lz so as not to obscure it the casualty is positioned within the box formation at point which allows rapid movement to the lz and is sheltered from the rotor wash once the aircraft has setdown the helicopter crew chief will signal the team when to approach the aircraft the team approaches the aircraft from the flank staying well clear of the tail rotor once loaded the team should retrace their steps away from the aircraft and return to their normal duties 7 consolidation and reorganization begin when the rally pointlocation has been secured these procedures can be accomplished concurrently with treating and evacuating casualties 8 personnel will report their ammunition status to first line leaders ammunition report will be based on how many full magazines are available subordinate leaders will immediately redistribute ammunition at their level and report to the next leader 9 drivers will inspect vehicles and cargo for damage concurrently recovery teams will conduct proper hookup procedures and prepare damaged vehicles for safe operation subordinate leaders will conduct weapon communication and sensitive item inspections and ready personnel for onward movement 10 any personnel from the cargo areas of large vehicles may be used to fill in on perimeter security or special tasks for example lz setupsecurity support more than two personnel should occupy any firing position 70 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned11 convoy commander will submit salute and ammunition casualty and equipment ace report to higher techniques and procedures to protect yourself from vbieds it is recommended that you pull off the road at least 100 m to create standoff from other vehicles distance to floating rally points should be varied constantly to prevent setting pattern that can be exploited by the enemy gun truck crews will not dismount at rally point unless required for casualties these vehicles must be manned and ready to reposition at all times in high vbied threat areas gun trucks may need to be positioned away from the box along both directions of travel if either the lead or trail gun truck repositions other vehicles must move to close the end of the box interval between vehicles should be enough that vehicles can pull out of the formation however the interval should be tight enough to prevent threat vehicles from having highspeed avenue into the safe area the box formation allows leadership and individuals to speed consolidation and reorganization activities as well as provide safe and secure area herringbone and column formations fail to provide these basic requirements dismounted personnel positioning should be inside the safe area using vehicles as cover locations between the rear and front of vehicles provide protectioncover and are also considered an unsafe area if vehicles are still in gear or should happen to roll forward personnel providing security will normally be positioned inside the box personnel should stay inside the box unless directed otherwise and must take care to avoid being run over by other vehicles entering the box all security personnel will exit the box only if required by special tasks for example cover restricted terrain or set up an lz all measures should be taken to prevent civilian vehicles from becoming blocked by convoys rally point formation as this will cause additional problems with crowd control issues personnel in the rear of the box should be prepared to direct people around the convoy drivers of command and control vehicles should remain mounted to monitor the radios it is possible that the initial vehicles entry into the floating rally point will be leader vehicle accompanied by the vehicle as the remainder of the convoy approaches they will establish the box around these vehicles rally point procedures should be completed as rapidly as possible because of the proximity of the enemy threat vehicle borne improvised explosive devices vbiedsimprovised explosive devices ieds vbieds and ieds are currently the greatest threats to coalition forces in theater threat forces have turned to the employment of ieds as the preferred method of for official use only 71oef handbook iiiattack as this provides the threat standoff capability to initiate an attack and then quickly escape the area some of these attacks include the use of direct fire weapons immediately following or prior to the detonation of an ied training should be scheduled frequently to update all personnel on the current ied threat the intent of this drill is to safeguard the unit or element while securing the ied site unexploded ordnance uxo should be treated in the same manner as an ied all personnel in convoy must be alert for camouflaged ieds in their sector of scan vbied trends vbieds with suicide drivers are targeting coalition convoys initially these vehicles attempted to enter convoy formations on the move this proved ineffective due to convoy speed and intervals the emerging technique is to target stationary convoys or groups of soldiers ttp to mitigate the threat include the following hang signs in arabic remain 100 meters from vehicle do not pass visible at 50 meters use flashbang grenades nonlethal as warning devices for vehicles getting too close employ any electronic countermeasures available use cones andor barriers with signs to keep vehicles 100 m away while halted if suspicious vehicles ignore these warnings and close within 50 m you may engage them what vbieds look like ºmostly cars some light trucks ºvehicle appears heavy laden rear axle weighted down ºsingle male drivers normally in their mid20s but this is not always the case dressed in normal iraqi attire or dressed inappropriately for vehicle type may be clean shaven with short haircut as this is part of the purifying ritual that many follow prior to an attack ºaggressive or erratic driving this factor alone is insufficient to engage ºsome vehicles are stationary on the side of the road and are detonated from standoff position what vbieds do not look like ºlarge trucks and buses ºvehicles carrying multiple people family or children in vehicle ºaggressive or erratic driving this is also common driving behavior here ºvehicle stationary on the side of the road with people around it or working on it 72 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedreaction to vbieds vehicles rapidly approaching convoys who have the characteristics of vbieds and fail to slow down or maintain safe distance represent credible hostile intent there is designated 100 m exclusion zone and suspicious vehicles may be engaged within the 50 m the point of aim should be the driver the engagement should be short bursts into the drivers side of the windshield hitting the vehicles

planned often multiple ieds are emplaced in one general location 76 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned ieds and other devices have been deployed from overpasses typically these devices are either thrown by personnel or swung down or hung from measured ropes to ensure target strike is at windshieldoperator level trip wires has also been used and piano wire has been used to decapitate gunners individuals of all ages both male and female have employed ieds the majority of ieds are placed during darkness to limit the chance of the individual being seen or confronted while emplacing the device ieds are often employed during early morning hours against the first convoy passing by maintain standoff distance of at least 300 meters from suspected iedsuxo as communication devices may cause detonation or enemy personnel may have the ability to remotely command detonate the enemy has begun to burn vehicle tires on asphalt roads this is to loosen the asphalt for emplacement of ieds underneath the road surface the ied then looks like patch in the road ieds are now being executed followed by small arms ambush or rpg attack this is complex ambush and may come from both sides of the convoy the enemy have begun to put ball bearings into ieds to achieve more fragmentation they are also putting soap chips in ieds with fuel so when it explodes it sticks and burns the skin reaction to iedsuxo drill the following steps the five cs describe the mnci standard for reacting to an ieduxo that is discovered prior to detonation the intent of this drill is to

complexes the use of caves as hiding places caches for food munitions and weapons headquarters complexes and protection against air strikes and artillery fire has been characteristic of the nature of the war in afghanistan and other desert environments extensive cave systems containing conference storage and hiding rooms as well as interconnected fighting points have frequently been encountered figure 224 these complexes present formidable and dangerous obstacle to current operations that must be dealt with in systematic careful and professional manner once the cave complex is cleared it is usually destroyed or at least the entrance is destroyed to deny future use by the acm coalition members often receive aerial support from american b1 bombers 2000pound bombs and f16 fighters 500pound

mortars 6 high x 3 deepcave techniques trained cave exploitation and denial team is essential to the expeditious and thorough exploitation and denial of enemy caves untrained personnel may miss hidden cave entrances and caches take unnecessary casualties from concealed mines and booby traps and may not adequately deny the cave to future enemy use each unit should designate cave teams cave teams should be trained equipped and maintained in ready status to provide immediate expert assistance when caves are discovered careful mapping of cave complex may reveal other hidden entrances as well as the location of adjacent cave complexes and underground defensive systems two and threeman teams should enter caves for mutual support claustrophobia and panic could well cause the failure of the teams mission or the death of its members constant communication between the cave and the surface is essential to facilitate cave mapping and exploitation cave exploitation and destruction the area in the immediate vicinity of the cave is secured and defended by 360degree perimeter to protect the cave team the entrance to the cave is carefully examined for mines and booby traps two members of the team enter the cave with wire communications to the surface the team works its way through the cave probing with bayonets for booby traps and mines and looking for hidden entrances food arms caches and air vents as the team moves through the cave compass headings and distances traversed are called to the surface team member at the surface maps the cave as exploitation progresses captured arms and intelligence documents are secured and retrieved for destruction or analysis upon completion of exploitation cratering charges or other available explosives are placed at all known cave entrances to seal each and prevent reuse by the enemy caves are frequently outstanding sources of intelligence and should therefore be exploited to the maximum extent practicable since cave complexes are carefully concealed and camouflaged search and destroy operations must provide adequate time for thorough search of the area to locate all caves complete exploitation and destruction of cave complexes is very time consuming and operational plans must be made accordingly to ensure success the presence of cave complex within or near an area of operations poses continuing threat to all personnel in the area area containing cave complexes should ever be considered completely cleared for official use only 89oef handbook iiiin some areas the combat situation will permit hasty search for hidden tunnel entrances but either lack of time or enemy occupation of the tunnel will not permit searches by tunnel team dangers dangers inherent in cave operations fall generally into the following categories and should be taken into account by all personnel connected with these operations presence of mines and booby traps in the entranceexit area presence of small but dangerous concentrations of carbon monoxide produced by burningtype smoke grenades after caves are smoked note protective masks will prevent inhalation of smoke particles but will not protect against carbon monoxide possible shortage of oxygen as in any confined or poorly ventilated space enemy still in the cave who pose danger to friendly personnel both above and below ground note in some instances dogs can successfully detect enemy hiding in caves section xi operations in highaltitude environment soldiers deploying to afghanistan must understand the simple rules of soldiering at high altitudes including some significant health problems that they otherwise may never encounter highaltitude operations increase energy requirements by as much as 50 percent and coupled with cold temperatures and increased physical activity have the potential of making the mission secondary to just surviving the increase in physical activity is only offset by thorough acclimatization conditioning special skills and training and using equipment designed for the conditions highaltitude sickness acute mountain sickness ams may begin at 8000 feet above sea level many factors influence who becomes ill and who does not however the following symptoms are typically linked to high rate of ascent headache and possible dizziness sleep disturbance fatigue more serious high altitude sickness hypoxia has lifethreatening implications and the potential for disrupting military operations hypoxia occurs when the tissues of the body are starved for oxygen the body reacts to this loss of oxygen by increased breathing to get more air the physical activity of the body increases the heart rate and can cloud judgment symptoms of hypoxia include dizziness giddiness tingling sensation euphoria blurred andor tunnel vision lack of muscle coordination and slow reaction time the condition affects every soldier differently depending on the soldiers age general health physical conditioning and training 90 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedthe results of hypoxia can have minimal effect on an individual at 10000 feet but effects increase as the individual increases altitude loss of consciousness and possible death can occur above 35000 feet operations above this level require an oxygen supply highaltitude weight loss weight loss is characteristic of operations at high altitude the average weight loss for special forces team living on pakistani rations and working with the highaltitude mountain school in 1994 was 20 to 25 pounds working at high altitudes requires more energy and soldiers will lose weight but weight loss must be controlled so it does not become incapacitating weight loss leads to fatigue loss of strength and psychological changes such as decreased mental capacity alertness and low morale all of these conditions can contribute to accidents and failure to accomplish the mission soldiers should eat and drink the following while operating at highaltitudes highcomplex carbohydrates portions of the complete ration verses one item or the other at least one hot meal day using whatever heat source is available that is chemical heat packs in meals ready to eat mres variety of foods and nutritious snacks four to six 46 quarts of noncaffeinated beverages day soldiers should not do the following while operating at highaltitudes skip meals although you will not feel like eating consume little of everything in your ration eat high fat snacks or fatty foods or consume alcohol of any type force yourself to eat this will result in vomiting and make the situation much more hazardous drink unpurified water or melted snow that is not properly treated restrict water intake to save it for later or attempt to avoid urinating altitude sickness in most forms is preventable leaders must take precautions to protect their soldiers at moderate altitudes to avoid illness successful strategies to prevent altitude sickness are simple and inexpensive spend night at an intermediate altitude before moving higher take it easy one day at each succeeding altitude level drink plenty of fluids eat full diet and avoid all alcohol tactical considerations during highaltitude operations initial observations received from afghanistan provide some interesting interpretations as to how soldiers are performing in the theater in most cases these observations include soldiers that have been in training already for mountainous operations either as conventional infantry or sof the real test of longterm operations may depend on followon light infantry forces that have to this point rarely trained for this type of operation there is still time to prepare soldiers for for official use only 91oef handbook iiithe rigor of highaltitude operations but the training and equipping of these soldiers must begin now doctrine organizations training materiel leadership and education personnel and facilities dotmlpf provide the basis for examining these initial observations and how the army can begin reacting to the needs of soldiers in theater these operations are unique they were made in specified region of the world where many of these conditions may never be duplicated the observations are relatively concise many offer simple and easy solutions to problem few others will take some considerable effort time and resources to resolve section xii operations in cold weather to win in cold weather soldiers must also overcome an additional enemy the extreme and unforgiving cold weather environment this means preventing and defeating cold injuries such as hypothermia and frostbite if allowed to develop cold injuries become debilitating or possibly fatal in the case of hypothermia to the soldier and threaten the units ability to defeat an enemy force in cold weather operations the four essential requirements for survival in cold environments are warmth food water shelter keeping the soldier warm and nourished are essential factors in preventing cold injuries and sustaining the combat power of the fighting force shelter is particularly important because without it it is difficult to provide warmth and nutrition to soldiers in cold environment heat production the bodys three main physiological means for producing heat are metabolism exercise and shivering metabolism biochemical reactions which keep us alive produce heat as byproduct our basal metabolic rate is constant internal furnace however when we are exposed to cold wintry conditions for long periods metabolism by itself does not produce enough heat to satisfy our bodys entire heat requirements exercise exercise is an important method of heat production muscles which make up 50 percent of our body weight produce most of our heat during work short bursts of hard physical effort generate tremendous amounts of heat moderate levels of exercise can be sustained for relatively longer periods there are limitations however physical conditioning strength stamina and fuel in the form of food and water are necessary to sustain activity shivering shivering is random inefficient quivering of our muscles it produces heat at rate five times greater than our basal metabolic rate it is 92 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedour first defense against cold shivering occurs when temperature receptors in the skin and brain sense decrease in body temperature and trigger the shivering response as with work and exercise the price of shivering is fuel how long and how effectively we shiver is limited by the amount of carbohydrates stored in muscles and by the amount of water and oxygen available heat loss the primary means of heat loss is through the skin there are five mechanisms by which our bodies lose heat conduction is the transfer of heat through direct contact between relatively hot and relatively cold object heat moves from the warmer to the colder object we lose heat when we lie on snow ice and cold or wet frozen ground foxholes or sit or lean against floors and bulkheads in unheated interiors of armored mechanized or wheeled vehicles convection is the transfer of heat by the circulation or movement of relatively colder ambient environment air or water around the body evaporation is heat loss in the form of vapor heat is necessary to the evaporation of perspiration from the skins surface evaporative heat loss accounts for 20 percent of the bodys normal total heat loss when we become overheated through physical exertion evaporation becomes our major mechanism for heat loss sweating accounts for roughly two thirds of our evaporative heat loss the remaining one third is lost through breathing respiration also cools the body as soldier breathes in cold dry air it is warmed and humidified in the lungs as it is exhaled as much as 25 percent of the bodys heat can be lost placing wool scarf or mask over the mouth and nose warms inhaled air and assists in keeping the body warm radiation is the emission of heat energy in the form of particles or waves energy is emitted by one body transmitted through an intervening medium and absorbed by another body infrared or heat radiation is transferred from relatively hot to relatively cold object in winter we lose heat to the environment through radiation we can receive radiative heat input from fires from the sun or from reflection off snow water or lightcolored rocks when exposed to the environment the skin serves as radiator unlike the rest of the body the blood vessels in the head do not constrict and reduce the blood supply flowing to the scalp the head is therefore an excellent radiator of heat eliminating from 35 to 50 percent of our total heat production in cold weather operations dry insulation especially on the head is essential in minimizing heat loss the right approach to winning in the winter keeps soldiers healthy and focused on the mission there are four basic rules to remember keep soldiers in shape cold weather clothing is heavy and presents an additional burden to soldiers normal equipment the additional for official use only 93oef handbook iiiequipment coupled with the difficulty of trudging through the snow causes soldiers to expend extra energy the importance of maintaining high level of physical conditioning cannot be overemphasized eat to keep fit regular satisfying hot food is essential for sustained performance even if soldiers are not hungry they must eat or they will lose physical conditioning they will also lower their threshold of resistance to cold stress because their bodies will not have the fuel it needs to sustain heat production and protect against lowering of the core body temperature drink plenty of water normally in cold climates soldiers drink only when they are thirsty this will not give them the water needed to avoid dehydration drinking plenty of water avoids dehydration and the fatigue that comes with it irritability is often an early sign of dehydration soldiers should not eat snow as water substitute the moisture content of snow is relatively low and eating it will lower the bodys core temperature also there is danger of illness from bacteria however melted snow can be consumed after treatment with water purification tablets maintain positive attitude in cold weather operations soldiers will face many new challenges but none that they cannot overcome leadership will be reflected in soldiers attitudes and performance leaders must watch for early signs of cold stress in their soldiers such as fatigue lethargy apathy irritability withdrawal loss of dexterity or decisionmaking ability decreased group cooperation disorientation or slurred speech common cold weather injuries hypothermia moderate hypothermia when hypothermia is detected in its early stage soldier may respond well to the removal of the cold stress in the absence of serious underlying medical condition the chances for successful rewarming are good while we cannot change the air temperature we can replace wet clothing with dry protect the soldier from the wind add layers of insulation and apply heat keep in mind that rewarmed soldier should not return to the cold until his energy and fluid reserves have been replenished after rewarming from the early stage of hypothermia the soldier should be given good hot meal several quarts of liquids and adequate rest before returning to duty fatigued or dehydrated soldier is strong candidate for another episode of hypothermia advanced hypothermia symptoms if chilled or cold soldier does not respond immediately to basic rewarming efforts or if he continues to exhibit symptoms of hypothermia the soldier may be in more advanced stage of hypothermia than initially thought and the leader should immediately initiate action to evacuate the soldier to medical facility 94 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedtreatment move the casualty out of the wind to sheltered environment replace wet clothing with dry clothing or sleeping bags cover the casualty with blankets or other insulating material apply heating pads if available wrapped in towels to the casualtys armpits groin and abdomen give the casualty warm nutritious fluids to drink do not give alcoholic beverages or tobacco products to the casualty wrap the casualty from head to toe and evacuate to medical treatment facility in recumbent lying down position during evacuation the soldier should be insulated from the cold surfaces of vehicle or sled wind proof outer layer will reduce the patients convective and evaporative heat loss wet clothing must be replaced with dry if the patient is conscious and alert he can be given warm liquids to drink being careful not to burn him and simple sweetened foods to eat including candy bars carbohydrates are the fuel most quickly transformed into heat and energy however hot liquids should not be given by mouth to severely hypothermic soldier if the patient is semiconscious try to keep him awake severe hypothermia symptoms in severe cases of hypothermia the patient produces little or heat and in the absence of external heat sources may cool further immediate evacuation is the preferred action for casualties suffering severe hypothermia treatment should not be undertaken in the field do not delay evacuation to attempt rewarming rapid rewarming may lead to rewarming shock treatment cut away wet clothing and replace with dry clothing ensure that the casualtys airway remains open but do not use an oropharyngeal airway jtube perform mouthtomouth resuscitation if the casualtys breathing rate drops below five respirations per minute apply an additional heat source the casualtys body is not able to generate sufficient body heat and must receive warmth from another source one method is to place the casualty in sleeping bag with his outer clothing removed and have another soldier also remove his outer clothing and get into the sleeping bag with him cover both soldiers with additional clothing the casualtys body will absorb the heat given off by the second soldiers body evacuate the casualty to medical treatment facility as soon as possible evacuate the casualty even if you cannot detect respiration or heartbeat handle the casualty gently frostbite frostbite is the freezing or crystallization of living tissues exposure time can be minutes or instantaneous if skin is directly exposed to extreme cold or high winds heat loss occurs faster than it can be replaced for official use only 95oef handbook iiiby blood circulation and is compounded by intense cold and inactivity the extremities fingers toes and ears and face are affected first damp hands and feet may freeze quickly since moisture conducts heat away from the body and destroys the insulating value of clothing the extent of frostbite depends on temperature and duration of exposure frostbite is one of the major nonfatal coldweather injuries encountered in military operations the categories of frostbite are superficial frostbite mild ºinvolves only the skin ºskin usually appears white or gray ºsurface will feel very stiff or hard but underlying tissue will be soft deep frostbite severe ºextends beyond the first layer of skin and may include the bone ºjoint movement may be absent or restricted depending on the extent of the injury ºdiscoloration is the same as for superficial frostbite but the underlying tissue is hard ºlarge areas such as foot or hand may appear purple as the result of sludging of blood within the vessels blackened appearance will be noticed after the injury has thawed this category of frostbite requires immediate evacuation to medical facility factors contributing to frostbite ºdehydration ºbelowfreezing temperatures and wind chill ºskin contact with supercooled metals or liquids ºuse of caffeine tobacco or alcohol ºconstriction of an extremity caused by tight boots gloves gaiters watchbands or confinement in cramped position that reduces blood flow ºneglect if tissues freeze evacuate the victim immediately before the frozen area begins to thaw thawing of frostbitten victim is medical procedure field thawing should not be attempted by non medical personnel if the victim has frozen extremities apply first aid protect the frozen areas and evacuate as litter casualty give the casualty liquids and keep him comfortable during evacuation ºdo not expose the frostbitten area to extreme heat that could result in burns 96 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedºdo not apply ointments or medications to the frostbitten area ºdo not rub massage or soak the frostbitten area ºdo not give alcoholic beverages or tobacco products to the casualty ºgive the casualty something warm to drink ºprotect the frostbitten area from cold and additional injury ºevacuate the casualty to medical treatment facility as soon as possible the buddy system is one of the prime preventive measures of frostbite buddies must watch each other for signs of frostbite and provide mutual aid if frostbite occurs frostbite should be identified early and prompt firstaid care should be applied to prevent further damage with proper clothing and equipment properly maintained and used frostbite can be prevented chilblain symptoms chilblain is caused by prolonged exposure of bare skin to cool or cold temperatures 50 c176f 10c176c or lower signs and symptoms of chilblain include acutely red swollen hot tender andor itching skin open sores or bleeding lesions may result from continued exposure treatment apply local warming put bare hands over the affected area on the face put affected hands inside the uniform under the armpits put bare feet against the abdomen of another soldier do not rub or massage the affected area rubbing or massaging the area may cause tissue damage signs and symptoms of tissue damage may be slow to appear apply field dressing to lesions have medical personnel evaluate the casualty when practical immersion syndrome immersion syndrome results from prolonged exposure hours to days to wet conditions at temperatures from 50oft 32of immersion syndrome occurs when cold wet conditions constrict blood vessels immersion foot trench foot and trench hand are types of immersion syndrome injuries reduced blood flow to the extremity deprives cells of needed oxygen and nutrients permanent muscle and nerve damage may result if this cold injury is allowed to develop for the soldier regular attention to his feet drying them and changing to clean dry socks once day or more often if his feet get wet is all that is needed to prevent immersion foot or trench foot symptoms the extremity appears cold swollen and mottled cyanosis blueness of the skin resulting from imperfectly oxygenated blood is usually present tactile sensitivity is reduced as is capillary refill time the extremity may look shiny the patient may describe the affected area as feeling wooden immersion syndrome usually occurs in three stages in the first phase the affected part is cold and without pain there is weak pulse at the site in the second phase the affected limb feels hot as for official use only 97oef handbook iiithough burning and has shooting pains in the third phase the casualty has pale skin cyanosis around the nail beds and lips and decreased pulse strength when the extremity rewarms the skin becomes warm dry and red the pulse bounds and the injury is painful the injured area may itch tingle and exhibit increased sensitivity to cold possibly permanently recovery can last weeks nerve damage may be permanent the development of blisters ulcers and gangrene is possible amputation may also be necessary treatment dry the affected part immediately rewarm the affected area gradually in warm air do not massage the extremity the affected area will probably become swollen red and hot to the touch after it has been rewarmed blisters may form remove wet clothing and replace with dry warm clothing protect the casualty from injury and infection elevate the affected part to reduce edema swelling evacuate to medical treatment facility as soon as practical snow blindness symptoms snow blindness is temporary but often painful condition caused by inadequate eye protection when operating in brilliant sunshine reflecting off snow or lightcolored rock the eyes become bloodshot and feel irritated and full of sand treatment the proper field management technique is to apply clean cool wet compresses to the eyes the patient should then wear dark uvprotective glasses aspirin can be used to control the pain occasionally it may be necessary to cover the patients eyes and lead him by the hand to an area where treatment can be administered recovery may take two or three days sunburn sunburn often associated with summer day at the beach can also become debilitating cold weather injury both first and seconddegree burns are possible in cold weather operations symptoms firstdegree burns involve reddening of the skin seconddegree burns are characterized by the formation of blisters mountain climbers are especially vulnerable to sunburn because they often operate at highaltitude environments covered with highly reflective snow fields the relatively thinner air allows more of the burning rays of the sun to penetrate the atmosphere and reflect off the snow because the air temperature seems relatively cold soldiers may miscalculate the intensity of the sun or simply be too weary to take preventive action treatment sunburn usually is treated on first notice by further applications of sunburn preventive sun screensblocks should be used rather than the more common cosmetic suntan preparations in mild cases sunburned soldiers can continue their duties even though they may suffer significant discomfort for few days in more severe 98 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedcases such as seconddegree sunburn with blister formation soldiers should be treated by medical personnel if there is much swelling cold compresses should be applied aspirin may be taken for pain and warm liquids should be administered to replenish body fluids salty liquids can be administered if prescribed by medical personnel if sunburned soldiers drink salt solutions without medical monitoring they may become nauseated and vomit thus compounding their dehydrated state dehydration symptoms in addition to irritability other signs of dehydration include darkening urine decreased amounts of urine being produced dry mouth tiredness mental sluggishness lack of appetite increased or rapid heartbeat dizziness and even unconsciousness treatment the most important consideration is prevention leaders should ensure that soldiers consume four to six quarts of fluid per day coffee and liquids containing caffeine tea cocoa soft drinks should not be considered adequate sources for replenishing body fluids because they act as diuretic removing fluids from the body drinks containing caffeine should only be consumed in moderation not as the primary means of hydration if the soldier is conscious administer fluids by mouth if improvement is not obvious in an hour evacuate the patient to medical facility in advanced stages of dehydration as in the case of an unconscious soldier immediately evacuate the patient to medical treatment facility constipation symptoms constipation is the difficulty in passing feces caused by deficiency in body fluids dehydration improper nutrition infrequent or irregular defecation or ignoring natures call altogether for extended periods contributing factors include the unavailability of water lack of sites protected from the elements to facilitate normal body functions and not eating the food provided symptoms of constipation include loss of appetite headache cramping and painful defecation treatment treatment involves the consumption of adequate amounts and variety of foods and water four to six quarts per day and responding to natures call to rid the body of waste highfiber foods especially fruits vegetables and whole grain breads are effective in combating constipation if accompanied by regular and adequate amounts of water if constipation is allowed to progress beyond the selfcare stage medical treatment is necessary carbon monoxide co poisoning carbon monoxide poisoning occurs when oxygen in the body is replaced by carbon monoxide for soldiers the main contributing factor is inhalation of fumes produced by fires in areas that lack proper ventilation stoves andor heaters in tents and engines left running in vehicles that allow co to leak into occupied areas are primary sources of carbon monoxide poisoning for official use only 99oef handbook iiisymptoms signs and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning progress slowly at the onset they may go unnoticed because carbon monoxide is colorless tasteless and odorless many of the signs and symptoms are similar to other common illnesses headache tiredness excessive yawning confusion followed by unconsciousness and eventually death cherryred coloring to the tissues of the lips mouth and inside the eyelids occurs very late in carbon monoxide poisoning when the patient is very near death if this condition occurs it may be too late to save the soldier action must be taken when earlier signs and symptoms appear treatment immediately remove the victim from the source of contamination if the soldier is not breathing on his own administer rescue breathing if available give the soldier oxygen then immediately evacuate the soldier to medical facility severe complications can develop even in casualties who appear to have recovered perfectly prevention is the key carbon monoxide poisoning can be prevented if unit leaders enforce few simple rules ºdo not permit soldiers to sleep in vehicles while engines are operating ºensure tent stoves and heaters are regularly serviced and inspected to confirm safe operation ºensure that sleeping tents have proper ventilation tent eye tent eye is caused by fumes emanating from stoves and lanterns operated in poorly ventilated shelter it can be prevented by using properly functioning stoves and lanterns and adequately ventilating the shelter first aid for tent eye is fresh air leadership in cold weather operations the process of developing soldiers into cold weather fighters requires positive leadership leaders must understand the environmental threat and include plans for countering this threat in their operational plans or tsops initially the cold environment may be alarming even frightening to soldiers unaccustomed to operating in wintry conditions especially when deployed to unfamiliar remote areas some soldiers will find themselves confronted with challenges they have not encountered before the cold becomes constant reminder to the soldier of his vulnerability in the extreme environment and the likelihood that he may become casualty should he make mistake as soldiers gain experience they develop confidence in themselves their clothing and their equipment and learn they can fight and win in the winter defeating both the cold and the enemy before them aggressive cheerful leadership is essential in helping soldiers overcome the challenges of the cold environment to defeat the enemy soldiers must first overcome the cold by learning how to live and survive the elements so they can focus on the enemy leaders must maintain positive attitude toward the mission their soldiers and the equipment they have to carry out the tasks at hand 100 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedintense cold affects the mind as well as the body essential tasks take longer to perform and require more effort than in temperate climates this should be considered when planning operations and giving orders even for such routine tasks as vehicle maintenance and making or striking camp the time it takes to accomplish tasks varies with differing conditions state of training and degree of acclimatization of the troops however the extra time required to accomplish tasks should not be used as an excuse for getting troops ready too early or leaving them standing in the open unnecessarily after striking camp not only will they suffer physically but their morale will ebb possibly at times when it should be at high pitch tips for leaders in cold weather operations leaders need to be aware of the symptoms that characterize unit having difficulty coping with the cold environment the following tips will help combat the effects of the cold when it begins to affect the minds of soldiers tip 1 if soldiers find it hard to remember things they have been taught show patience review orders and drills get them to think through the challenges of the environment and the mission encourage them to ask questions keep their minds busy tip 2 be alert for soldiers who tend to withdraw from the groups focus keep them involved soldiers who withdraw into themselves should be paired in buddy system with soldiers who are well acclimatized to the cold environment remind them that everyone is in the same situation including the enemy tip 3 if soldiers get depressed moody or blue and do not want to talk encourage them to chat with each other circulate among the troops in their duty areas keep them talking and interacting tip 4 if soldiers become irritable and get on each others nerves keep in mind that this is likely to happen maintain your sense of humor and show patience vary their duties tip 5 be aware that soldiers may tend to shirk from some tasks to keep themselves warm remind them that their job is to fight and that weapons and equipment must be kept in fighting order during winter training do not let the training become camping trip this is common trap tip 6 do not accept the cold as an excuse for not carrying out orders or routine tasks cold may be the reason for taking longer but it is not reason for letting things slide remember that although the cold may make tasks more difficult to accomplish it does not make them impossible with knowledge equipment and proper training leaders and soldiers can defeat the cold and be successful in combat tip 7 plan the frequent rotation of soldiers into warming tentsareas to provide relief from the cold tip 8 provide warm liquids non caffeine at frequent intervals especially when rotating soldiers into warming tentsareas for official use only 101oef handbook iiitip 9 plan and provide extra insulating material for individuals when available the cold weather clothing system leaders should understand the design principles of the military cold weather clothing system these principles are insulate layer ventilate insulation allows the creation of microclimate around the body through which the amount of body heat lost to the environment can be regulated by varying the amount of insulation soldier can regulate the amount of heat lost or retained several layers of clothing provide more insulation and flexibility than one heavy garment even if the heavy garment is as thick as the combined layers by adding or removing layers of clothing insulation the soldier can regulate the amount of heat lost or retained ventilation helps maintain comfortable microclimate around the body thereby helping control body temperature by ventilating the soldier can release excess heat and minimize sweating which can lower body temperature later as it evaporates there are four ways to apply the principles in the military cold weather clothing system keep clothing clean dirt and grease clog the air spaces in clothing and reduce the insulating effect dirty clothes are cold clothes avoid overheating select the clothing needed to stay comfortable or even little cool leaders should ensure that their soldiers are not overdressed for the job they are performing wear it loose all items of the cold weather uniform are sized to allow wearing of the appropriate number of layers this means for example that the field jacket may appear too large when worn without all of the layers designed to fit under it if the uniform items do not fit loosely the insulation will be substantially reduced keep it dry it is vital that all layers of clothing be kept dry because wet clothing conducts heat away from the body compromising the microclimate around the body and making it difficult to regulate body temperature moisture soaks into clothing from two directions from melting snow and frost that has collected on the outside of the clothing and from perspiration leaders should ensure that soldiers brush snow and frost from clothing before entering heated shelters or vehicles 102 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsection xiii food and water food and waterborne diseases sanitation is extremely poor throughout the country including major urban areas local food and water sources including ice are heavily contaminated with pathogenic bacteria parasites and viruses to which most us service members have little or natural immunity if local food water or ice from unapproved sources is consumed diarrhea diseases can be expected to temporarily incapacitate very high percentage of personnel within days hepatitis typhoid fever and hepatitis are common among the local population these diseases can cause prolonged illness in smaller percentage of us personnel exposed to contaminated food or water sources in addition large cholera outbreaks occur among the local population annually and could pose risk to us personnel us personnel are not allowed to eat any local food eat only food prepared by authorized food service organizations food considerations food can dehydrate and kill if there isnt sufficient water in the body for sweat and digestion the body will give priority to food digestion by robbing the rest of the system of needed moisture soldier should eat only if he can find enough water to replenish his supply regularly if there is choice of food eat carbohydrates they use the least amount of water to digest fats and proteins use the most military emergency rations are mostly carbohydrates for this reason water lakes rivers streams or other surface water in rural areas may be contaminated with leptospirosis regionally large leptospirosis outbreaks have been reported associated with contact with contaminated water sources operations or activities that involve extensive water contact may result in personnel being temporarily debilitated with leptospirosis if unapproved water must be used in an emergency the water may be disinfected by adding calcium hypochlorite at 50 ppm for 30 minutes adding chlorfloc or iodine tablets according to label instructions heating water to rolling boil for 5 to 10 minutes adding 2 to 4 drops of ordinary chlorine bleach per quart of water and waiting 30 minutes before using it either us military preventive medicine or veterinary personnel should inspect bottled water supplies bottled water does not guarantee purity direct sunlight on bottled water supplies may promote bacterial growth water in canals lakes rivers and streams is likely to be contaminated unnecessary bathing swimming and wading should be avoided if the tactical situation requires entering bodies of water all exposed skin should be covered to protect from parasites following exposure it is important to dry vigorously and change clothing water will determine how long soldier can survive in the desert and its usage must be consideration in every decision made all lifeactivity in the desert is linked to the amount of water available and needs vary according to temperature for official use only 103oef handbook iiiand the amount of exertion soldiers should procure and consume as much water as possible at every opportunity conserve body moisture by doing any heavy labor slowly or in the cooler hours before 1000 and after 1800 avoid overheating staying still in the shade and out of the wind when it is hot keeping clothing on and closed to trap the sweat next to the skin and prevent sunburn wearing clothing loose and in layers if necessary improvise additional layers of clothing using whatever is available keeping the mouth closed breathe through the nose you lose one pint of water per day through normal breathing cloth across the mouth and nose will reduce respiration water loss soaking clothes with undrinkable water if it wont cause chemical burn reducing eating if water is not available refraining from smoking tobacco dries out the mouth locating surface water locating water in desert areas requires keen observation surface water is usually found after rare rainstorms in the form of intermittent streams and pools of water or waterfilled cracks in rocks water may take few weeks to couple of months to dry up by looking for logical water collection area indicators soldiers might be able to locate surface source lush green or flowering plants indicate recent rainfall in the area look in low spots between hills or dunes and at the base of cliffs rocky places may hold large pools for long time especially under overhangs or in cracks in the rock pools of water may be standing in dry stream beds fog in the morning could be another indicator of recent rain signs of animals indicate the presence of water the v formed by the intersection of two animal trails usually points toward water flight direction of birds at dusk and dawn can indicate water large quantities of bird dung at the surface of crack in rock may mean water in the crack the sound of frogs at night can guide soldier to water the presence of bees andor other insects may indicate water is nearby brush piles in low spots are sometimes used by local people to slow evaporation and keep animals out of pools of water 104 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedanother surface source of water can be dew if dew is heavy tie cotton rags clothing or bandages to the ankles and walk through the low brush and grass when the rags become soaked wring them out into container shallow lakes have not been mentioned due to the great possibility that such bodies of water will be contaminated with salt alkali magnesium or sulfur if swallowed these could act as dehydrating agent laxative or poison to use water from this source filter it with the survival06manual reverse osmosis water pump fsn 4610013136085 this device is capable of filtering salts alkali sulfur metals bacteria and viruses suspended in water sources the pump can provide up to six gallons of fresh drinking water per day from otherwise unusable sources if equipped with this pump the units evasion plan of action development survival on the ground and recovery should take this capability into consideration the sun may be used along with plastic to obtain water vegetation bag this is large plastic bag in which cut vegetation is placed the bag is then tied shut and left in the sun during the hottest part of the day the plant emits water which is trapped and condensed in the bag this is the preferred method for soldiers because vegetation bag can be left on the ground or in sunny hole in the ground where the risks of it being noticed are reduced transpiration bag this is plastic bag placed over the leafy portion of branch and then tied this is not preferred method to be used in an evasion situation since there is risk the bags will be noticed solar still this is the least preferable choice and should be used only in survival situation and only if expected to be in the area for more than one day the effort to construct this device will expend more water than it produces on the first day ground subsurface water springs and underground rivers sometimes come to the surface and then disappear into the desert these areas are usually inhabited oases the depth of subsurface water can vary widely it may be just under the surface or over 100 feet deep water near the surface might by obtainable by digging in likely spots such as areas with mud or moist sand mud can be wrapped in cloth and wrung out the lowest spot between hills or dunes low spots at the base of cliffs or in narrow rock valleys low spots at the outside curve of dry stream bed low spots with rich green vegetation places where animals have scratched at the surface or flies hover over the ground manmade structures such as wells cisterns and karez irrigation tunnels are another potential source of water for official use only 105oef handbook iiiwells are the major source of water to desert people they may be 10 to over 100 feet deep well users bring their own rope and bucket these wells are usually located in low places such as dry rivers valleys or at the base of dunes or cliffs cisterns catch and hold water from intermittent streams or runoff from storms soldiers encountering ruins can look for old irrigation ditches and follow them uphill from flat places that might have been planted fields at one time cisterns are likely to be at the bottom of dry river bed or canyon and are usually nothing more than brick or rocklined storage tanks all of these manmade subsurface water sources require long line and some form of bucket to get to the water wells in the desert are usually found along trails and can be from 2030 miles apart permanent camps may be 23 miles from wells although nomads sometimes camp very close to well watch for worn paths leading away from camp areas they may lead to well look for old wells uphill from abandoned homes farms or other dwellings if animal dung and remains of old campfires are noticed there may be well nearby some people stack animal dung near the wells to dry for use as fuel at later date well openings may be covered to prevent sand and debris from filling them in look for doughnutshaped mounds brush or sandfilled depressions they may have to be dug out be careful not to allow sand or debris to fall down the hole the water may be very shallow in the bottom of the well finding water is not the only problem facing soldiers once found it must be obtained without being detected scout the area and observe the well from distance if the enemy knows soldier is in the area they may try setting up an ambush at the well they know the soldier needs water look carefully for vehicle tracks carefully scan any high ground for enemy observers or dust water source should be approached during darkness when escape chances are increased if the enemy has set trap when soldier uses well he should get as much water as he can carry and move away from the area as soon as possible the volume of water carried governs the soldiers range of travel and ability to hide for length of time if the enemy is near further the next water source may be dried up or inaccessible fill all water bags canteens and any improvised containers to hold water such as poncho plastic bag lining rucksack or survival kit container condom in helmet or pneumatic life preserver bladders both the approach and departure from the well should be evasive from one point of concealment to the next if in group post lookout tracks should be brushed out when leaving all water should be considered biologically contaminated if water purification tablets are available use them dysentery and other waterborne diseases can cause severe dehydration filtering and aeration might improve the taste and appearance of water if purification tablets are available soldier still needs the water to live if boiling is not an option the smoke flame and odor from fire are very risky in open terrain clean the water as much as possible by other methods allow sediments to settle then filter the 106 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedwater through cloth sand andor charcoal fully aerate pour the water from one container to another or shake up with top open allow contact with direct sunlight water containers need care protect them from thorns grit abrasions or sharp rocks and try to keep them in the shade place them where they will not be damaged or destroyed protect water and containers from freezing on winter nights when expanding ice may burst the containers keep them close to the body be sure rodents cannot gnaw on them section xiv field sanitation and personal hygiene throughout history disease and nonbattle injuries have been the largest cause of military casualties personal hygiene is difficult at best in cold weather operations the role of field sanitation is to aid the unit in protecting the health of troops field sanitation concerns itself with the basic responsibilities of field sanitation establish garbage pits whenever possible dispose of all garbage in pits burn or bury it prior to departure there should be pit for each platoon garbage must be buried at least 100 feet from any water source patrols should never leave behind any evidence of their presence in an area all waste should be carried until it can be disposed of properly to avoid giving away potential intelligence to the enemy about patrol or campsite locations or activities during training bag all trash and garbage and haul it to the rear for disposal establish latrines normally central latrine should be established if dispersion within the camp is not too great one latrine will usually serve the needs of three to four shelters or unit of platoon size chemical toilets are the preferred latrine devices use cathole latrine for marches straddle trench for one to three day bivouac sites deep pit latrine for temporary camps burnout latrines and soakage pits for urinals the latrine must be placed downwind of the campsite but not so far from the shelters that the placement encourages individuals to break sanitary discipline it should be windproofed by branches snow blocks ponchos or other available materials and should be camouflaged for training an empty mre box lined with trash bag can suffice full bags can be sealed left in the box and then hauled to the rearoef handbook iii for official use only 107plan to take lime with you locate latrines at least 100 meters from the unit mess and at least 100 meters from any water source waste management all types of waste are generated each day in the field always bury your waste immediately to prevent flies from spreading germs from waste to your food also burying your waste helps keep unwanted animals out of your bivouac area if waste is not disposed of properly the camp will quickly become an ideal breeding area for flies rats and other vermin diseases such as dysentery typhoid cholera dengue and plague could compromise the integrity of the unit to combat this problem unit medical personnel should provide technical assistance in the fabrication location and maintenance of field wastedisposal facilities they also inspect these facilities before their initial use to ensure their proper construction and location and then reinspect on daily basis personal hygiene the following techniques and procedures can be used to maintain minimal personal hygiene in the field especially if laundry and bath support is not readily available cleanliness shave if necessary at night in the shelter so that facial oils stripped during shaving will be replenished overnight before the face is again exposed to the elements brush teeth daily if toothbrush is not available chew the end of twig into makeshift brush if twig is not available salt on fingertip can suffice if applied gently change underwear as frequently as practical at least twice weekly change socks as often as needed to keep the feet dry use foot powder as dry rub to clean the feet foot care trim toenails straight across at approximately 90degree angle with the edges of the nails this relieves pressure at the edges of the nails permitting the nail to arch in the middle so that the corners wont cutdig into the skin below use foot powder to dry feet apply powder on feet and between toes remove excess do not put foot powder in socks extra powder may cake and hasten the onset of blisters blisters can become problem unless they are treated at the first sign of irritation before blister actually forms tape over developing hot spot the bandage should be sufficiently large enough so that the tape touches only nonirritated skin once blister has formed apply doughnuttype bandage to relieve pressure on the blister again the doughnut and bandage should be large enough to encircle the blister and avoid further irritation of the blistered area use tincture of benzoin to help the tape adhere to the skin it also helps toughen the skin never lance or drain blisters unless they are surrounded by redness or they are oozing purulent 108 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedmaterial indicating infection if this is the case drain the blister clean it with soap and water and cover with clean dry dressing until it can be assessed by medical personnel skin care bathe frequently take full bath at least once every week if showers or baths are not available use washcloth daily to wash genital area armpits feet other areas where you sweat or that become wet such as between thighs or for females under the breasts potable water safe potable water is essential to the army water that is not properly treated can transmit such diseases as typhoid and paratyphoid fevers bacillary dysentery cholera poliomyelitis and common diarrhea in some areas water may also be the means of transmitting infectious hepatitis schistosomiasis and amoebic dysentery lessons from operation desert shield and operation desert storm showed that units should use planning factor of at least seven gallons of water per soldier per 24hour period treat the individual water supply with one iodine tablet per quartsize canteen if the water is clear two tablets if the water is cloudy let stand for five minutes with the cap loosened and shake to permit leakage to rinse the thread around the neck tighten cap and let stand for 20 minutes calcium hypochlorite maybe used add one ampule in onehalf canteen cup of water dissolve then pour one canteen cap of the solution in the canteen shake and let stand for 30 minutes the best containers for small quantities of water five gallons are plastic water cans water in plastic cans will be good up to 72 hours compared to metal that will only be good for 24 hours however you should change the water in your canteen at least every 24 hours water in trailers if kept in the shade will last up to five days if the temperature outside exceeds 100of the temperature of your water must be monitored and when it exceeds 92of it should be changed as bacteria will multiply if not changed you will end up with case of diarrhea ice in containers will keep water cool if ice is put in the water trailers the ice in it must be removed before the trailer is moved as the floating ice may destroy the inner protection of the trailer ice that is not provided by kbr dining facility is nonpotable and should not be consumed when using nonpotable ice to chill canned and bottled beverages the drinking surface should be wiped dry prior to consumptionoef handbook iii for official use only 109chapter 3 an introduction to afghanistan figure 1 section i historical review us in operation enduring freedom osama bin muhammad bin awad bin laden was born in 1955 the youngest of twenty surviving sons of one of saudi arabias wealthiest and most prominent families he is part feudal saudi an aristocrat who from time to time would retreat with his father to the desert and live in tent he came of age during the rise of organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and the extraordinary wealth that accompanied it he is of saudi generation whose religious fervor or political zeal led thousands to fight war in the distant muslim land of afghanistan osama bin laden has been involved in establishing two very important organizations mak maktabu lkhidamat in 1979 and alqaida in 1988 the purpose of mak was to drive the soviet troops out of afghanistan and alqaida grew out of mak bin laden was able to recruit troops from all over the arab world but especially from saudi arabia algeria and egypt more than 10000 are believed to have been trained by mak to participate in the war against the soviet for official use only 111oef handbook iii union large numbers of mak troops lost their lives in the war but the survivors became exceptionally skilled soldiers the ideology of alqaida is to cleanse muslim countries of corrupt and secular leadership and fight against the powers that threaten muslim states and the holy places of islam the powers they believe to be threatening muslim states are principally the us and israel the us for interfering in numerous areas in the muslim world politically and military and israel for occupying palestine the ideology has three goals 1 radicalize existing islamic groups and create islamic groups where none exist 2 advocate destruction of the us which is seen as the chief obstacle to reform in muslim societies and 3 support muslim fighters in afghanistan algeria bosnia chechnya eritera kosovo pakistan somalia tajikistan the philippines and yemen when bin laden arrived in afghanistan the government that had assumed power after the departure of the soviets was being besieged by fundamentalist student faction known as the taliban its leader was mullah muhammad omar who like bin laden had fought in the jihad the two men had similar ideology and complementary needs bin laden needed refuge and the fledgling taliban needed cash bin laden gave the mullah an initial payment of three million dollars for the cause and the taliban was able to capture the key center of jalalabad in september of 1996 ten days later the capital kabul fell sometime after that according to us officials bin laden through the marriage of one of his daughters became mullah omars fatherinlaw the taliban first drew the worlds attention in 1994 when pakistan recruited them to protect their trade convoys they grew in popularity because they fought corruption and lawlessness and because they like most of the afghan people are ethnic pashtuns while the leaders at the time were tajiks and uzbeks by 1998 the taliban had virtually eliminated the opposing northern alliance the talibans popularity with many afghans initially surprised the countrys warring mujahedin factions but it was not purely question of ethnicity ordinary afghans weary of the prevailing lawlessness in many parts of the country were often delighted by taliban successes in stamping out corruption restoring peace and allowing commerce to flourish again their refusal to deal with the existing warlords whose rivalries had caused so much killing and destruction also earned them respect the taliban said their aim was to set up the worlds most pure islamic state banning frivolities like television music and cinema their attempts to eradicate crime were reinforced by the introduction of islamic law including public executions and amputations flurry of regulations forbidding girls from going to school and women from working quickly brought them into conflict with the international community such issues along with restrictions on womens access to health care also caused some resentment among ordinary afghans from the mid1990s the taliban provided sanctuary to osama bin laden and provided base for his and other terrorist organizations bin laden provided both financial and political support to the taliban bin laden and his alqaida group were charged with the bombing of the us embassies in nairobi and dar salaam in 1998 in august 1998 the united states launched cruise missile attack against bin ladens terrorist camp in afghanistan bin laden and alqaida are 112 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedbelieved to be responsible for the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states among other crimes following the talibans repeated refusal to expel bin laden and his group and end its support for international terrorism the us and its antiterrorist coalition began campaign to target terrorist facilities and various taliban military and political assets within afghanistan section ii location and description lying more than 482 kilometers 300 miles from the sea afghanistan is barren mostly mountainous country of about 647500 square kilometers 250000 square miles it is bordered by turkmenistan uzbekistan and tajikistan to the north pakistan to the east and south and iran to the west including long narrow panhandle the wakhan corridor in the northeast afghanistan has northeastsouthwest extent of about 11450 kilometers 900 miles and northwestsoutheast extent of about 804 kilometers 500 miles with peaks up to about 7315 meters 24000 feet the hindu kush forms the spine of the country trending southwestward from the pamir knot to the central afghan province of bamian subsidiary ranges continue to the south and the west with decreasing elevations gradually merging into the plains that continue into iran and pakistan broad plateau stretches from north of the hindu kush to the amu darya river and eventually to the russian steppes in the east the mountains are indistinguishable from those of pakistan afghanistan is approximately the size of texas section iii topography about onethird of afghanistan in the southwest and north is arid plain the southwestern plain is the larger of the two and is barren desert with large areas of drifting sand scattered hill belts and few low mountains small villages along few intermittent streams small settlements and narrow band of cultivation along the helmand river are the only features that break desolation the helmand is one of the few perennial streams in the region the northern plains are actually steppes with seasonal grasslands supporting small nomadic population permanent settlements are located along the margin of the steppes and on the flood plain of the amu darya river the mountains that comprise the other twothirds of the country are the perennially snowcapped hindu kush in the northeast and progressively lower mountains in the west the hindu kush have sharpcrested ridges and towering peaks while the lower western mountains are generally rounded or flattopped afghanistan can be broken down into three military operational zones the northern steppe the afghan highlands and the southwestern desert basins section iv drainage afghanistan has four major river systems that originate in the hindu kush the kabul the helmand the amu darya and the harirud of the four only the eastward flowing kabul ever reaches the ocean the other three eventually disappear into salt marshes or desert wastes only the amu darya also known as the oxus has significant navigable reaches the rest are fordable for the greater part of the year throughout their courses the amu darya also serves as the northern border of afghanistan the helmand is the largest in flow and volume and for official use only 113oef handbook iiiruns southward across the southern desert into the salt marsh wastes found along the afghaniranian border the harirud runs westward past herat then turns northward forming the border between afghanistan and iran all the afghan rivers and their tributaries are used for irrigation supplementing the stream irrigation is the karez system of underground channels with vertical access and maintenance shafts carrying water from the base of the mountain slopes to oases on valley floors the signature of karez qanat in iran particularly noticeable from the air is the row of evenly spaced openings shafts surrounded by mounds of earth that define the course of the underground channels section v vegetation what little natural vegetation there is in afghanistan consists mainly of bunch grasses trees are scarce and mostly limited to planted poplars and willows around settlements because of infertile soils and centuries of seeking fuel and forage even scrub and brush are difficult to find timber is mostly absent any timber laying around the ground or attached to buildings in deserted villages should be suspect for booby traps timber is very scarce and villagers will booby trap their homes to prevent theft and pilferage irrigated areas produce wheat barley corn and rice as well as sugar beets melons grapes cotton almonds and deciduous fruits the two primary afghan cash crops are opium poppy and cannabis afghanistan is the major opium supplier for the european heroin market section vi climate marked seasonal extremes of temperature and scarcity of precipitation characterize afghanistans climate topographic features strongly influence all elements of the climate winters december through february are dominated by constantly changing air masses associated with passing migratory lows and frontal systems winters are cold with nighttime temperatures below freezing common in low elevations and frequent winter snows at higher elevations to the south and southeast the lowlevel temperatures are less severe winter snows are frequent at the higher elevations and there are permanent snow fields in the hindu kush summers june through august are continuously sunny dry and severely hot however intrusions of moist southerly monsoon air occasionally bring rain increased humidity and cloudiness to the extreme eastern portions at elevations below 1220 meters about 4000 feet temperatures rise to over 38oc 100of on daily basis very low humidity is normal during the summer in the other seasons relative humidity is high in the early morning and moderate in the afternoon over most sections in most of afghanistan winter and spring are the cloudiest periods and clear skies are common in summer precipitation is scarce with desert conditions prevailing in the southwestern and northern plains what annual precipitation there is falls mostly in the winter and spring summers are almost uniformly rainless thunderstorms are most frequent during the spring but also occur during summer in extreme eastern portions of the country flash floods sometimes result from severe thundershowers long droughts are not uncommon 114 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsection vii ethnicity and language the population of afghanistan includes many different ethnic groups the pashtuns pushtuns who make up more than half the population have traditionally been the dominant ethnic group their homeland lies south of the hindu kush but pashtun groups live in all parts of the country many pashtuns also live in northwestern pakistan where they are called pathans pashtuns are usually farmers though large number of them are nomads living in tents made of black goat hair male pashtuns live by ancient tribal code called pashtunwali which stresses courage personal honor resolution selfreliance and hospitality the pashtuns speak pashto which is an indoeuropean language and one of the two official languages of afghanistan the tajiks tadzhiks are the second largest ethnic group in afghanistan they live in the valleys north of kabul and in badakhshan they are farmers artisans and merchants the tajiks speak dari afghan persian also an indoeuropean language and the other official language of afghanistan dari is more widely spoken than pashto in most of the cities the tajiks are closely related to the people of tajikistan in the central ranges live the hazaras although their ancestors came from the xinjiang region of northwestern china the hazaras speak an archaic persian most are farmers and sheepherders the hazaras have been discriminated against for long time in part because they are minority shiites followers of shia islam within dominant sunni muslim population in the east north of the kabul river is an isolated wooded mountainous region known as noristan the noristani people who live there speak wide variety of indoeuropean dialects in the far south live the baluchi whose indoeuropean language called baluchi is also spoken in southwestern pakistan and southeastern iran to the north of the hindu kush on the steppes near the amu darya live several groups who speak turkic languages the uzbeks are the largest of these groups which also include turkmen and in the extreme northeast vakhan corridor the kyrgyz people the kyrgyz were mostly driven out by the soviet invasion and largely emigrated to turkey all of these groups are settled farmers merchants and seminomadic sheep herders the nomads live in yurts or round feltcovered tents of the mongolian or central asian type prior to the war important political positions were distributed almost equally among ethnic groups this kept ethnic tensions and violence to minimum though the pashtuns in kabul were always the politically dominant group in the mid1990s attempts have been made to reestablish shared rule however many of the ethnic groups have sought greater share of power than they had before the war and violence is common result of the disputes section viii key cities kandahar is located is southern afghanistan approximately 500 kilometers 310 miles southwest of kabul and 90 kilometers 56 miles northwest of the pakistan border the city lies at the northeast corner of the vast nearly uninhabited dashti margow kandahar is in an area of subtropical steppe sand ridges and dunes alternate with expansive desert plains there are also areas of barren gravel and clay where sparse vegetation and low growth prevail kandahars population is estimated at 329300 us census bureau 2001 for official use only 115oef handbook iiikabul is located in northeastern afghanistan on the banks of the kabul river the city spreads out on the north and south banks of the river and is further separated into northern and southern sections by series of low hills the kabul river flows from southwest to northeast and through the water gap known as lions gate which divides the hills elevations range from 1789 meters above sea level at kabul international airfield to 2219 meters at kohe sher peak near the city center several small streams flow in from the west joining to form the cheltan river which in turn joins the kabul river just south of the lions gate the logar river flows north to join the kabul river in eastern kabul khargz lake about 20 kilometers west of central kabul is the only lake in the region there are however several small marshes scattered across the northeastern half of the city and environs soils on the mostly flat plains around kabul are deep silty sand clayey sand and gravels that are fair to good in overall suitability for construction purposes on hill slopes bedrock outcrops comprise half or more of the surfaces jalalabad is the largest urban center in eastern afghanistan between kabul 125 kilometers 78 miles to the west and the pakistan border at the khyber pass 75 kilometers 47 miles to the east the city has been an important commercial telecommunications and cultural center and has population of 154200 us census bureau 2001 the city dominates the entrances to the laghman and kunar valleys and is leading trading center with india and pakistan oranges rice and sugarcane grow in the fertile surrounding area and the city has cane processing and sugar refining as well as papermaking industries mazare sharif the provincial capital of the balkh province is situated on the main route between kabul and the termiz uzbekistan historically its importance was twofold it was 70 kilometers 43 miles south of the soviet union and it was center for afghanistans

afternoon wind velocity is typically around 50 miles per hour 435 knots with gusts up to 80 miles per hour 695 knots section ix way of life although the afghan population is composed of many distinct ethnic groups certain elements of their way of life are much the same characteristically the family is the mainstay of afghan society extremely close bonds exist within the family which consists of the members of several generations the family is headed by the oldest man or patriarch whose word is law for the whole family family honor pride and respect toward other members are highly prized qualities among both villagers and nomads the family lives together and forms selfsufficient group in the villages each family generally occupies either one mudbrick house or walled compound containing mudbrick or stonewalled houses the same pattern prevails among the nomads except that tents replace the houses 116 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsettlements in afghanistan with less than 100 houses number over 10000 and those with 100 to 250 houses number about 1000 there are 53 urban centers that range in size from 2500 to 25000 people in the smaller villages there are schools stores nor any representative of the government each village has three sources of authority the malik village headman the mirab master of the water distribution and the mullah teacher of islamic laws commonly khan large landowner will control the whole village by assuming the role of both malik and mirab baggy cotton trousers are standard part of the afghan villagers costume the men wear long cotton shirts which hang over their trousers and wide sashes around their waists they also wear skullcap and over that turban which they take off when working in the fields the women wear long loose shirt or highbodice dress with swirling skirt over their trousers they drape wide shawl about their heads many women wear jewelry which is collected as form of family wealth when urban women leave their houses they usually wear burka or shadier long tentlike veil that covers them from head to foot women in villages seldom wear the burka and educated urban women discarded the custom especially under soviet domination where it was regarded as backward the diet of most afghan villagers consists mainly of unleavened flat bread called nan soups kind of yogurt called mast vegetables fruit and occasionally rice and meat tea is the favorite drink village men work in the fields joined by the women during the harvest older children tend the flocks and look after the smaller children the village mosque is the center of religious life and is often used as the village guest house twice year groups of nomads may pass through villages on their routes from summer highland grazing grounds to the lowlands where they camp during the winter the villagers traditionally permit the nomads to graze their animals over the harvested fields which the flocks fertilize by depositing manure the nomads buy supplies such as tea wheat and kerosene from the villagers the villagers buy wool and milk products from the nomads for food and clothing the nomads depend on the milk products meat wool and skins of their flocks for transportation they depend on their camels nomadic women are freer and less secluded than the village women favorite sport in northern afghanistan is game called buzkashi in which teams of horsemen compete to deposit the carcass of large headless calf in goal circle afghans also play polo and ghosai team sport similar to wrestling the most important holiday in afghanistan is eid and nowruz or new years day which is celebrated on the first day of spring for official use only 117oef handbook iiiappendix convoy leader checklist ___

warfare no042 october 2004 introduction in may 2003 i was given remarkable opportunity i had always wanted to take command of an airborne infantry company and subsequently to lead them in combat but what ensued over the next three months went beyond my expectations i took command of unique company team composed of assets that i never thought i would command i conducted numerous civil military operations cmos along with intense combat operations over the next six weeks soldiers under my command engaged in six firefights with qaeda forces and none of my soldiers sustained injury when we left firebase shkin i knew i had just partaken in the experience of lifetime i was given an opportunity that other captain in the army was given to fight his own combinedarms coalition joint multiagency fight in his own area of operations ao but in addition to my own thankfulness for being given this opportunity i realized that what we accomplished could and should be accomplished by young company commanders throughout the world in support of the global war on terrorism gwot after the highintensity warfare is complete and we begin fighting an insurgency operation the best way to find fix and finish an enemy waging guerilla war is to give leaders at the smallunit level enough leeway enough specialized assets and enough firepower to engage their population develop their own intelligence and be able to crush the enemy the enemy we routinely face in the gwot blends into the population he might or might not have the support of the locals but the same can be said for the coalition forces relationships with the locals we need to earn local support on personal level only then will they assist us in fighting insurgency in writing this i have three goals the first is to get our army and national security leaders to recognize that we have within our existing forces remarkable asset for fighting and winning the war on terrorism our companysized elements the way ahead is simple focus some of our doctrine and training to prepare young company commanders to lead combinedarms warfare to conduct cmo operations and to develop and exploit their own intelligence this leads into my second goal to provide short lessons learned to my fellow company commanders who are currently or will soon be in position like mine where they can conduct these types of operations finally i want to share our story the 200 american and coalition soldiers and the 180 afghan militia who served with in the bermel valley risked their lives every day and came out with tremendous sense of accomplishment we took the bermel valley from the enemy and we won our own battles in this global war on terrorism in way do i claim to be an expert in either conventional or unconventional warfare i simply wish to share the experiences of unit that was successful for official use only 135oef handbook iiithe bermel valley in the bermel valley dubbed the evilest place by the xviii airborne corps commander b company 3d battalion 504th parachute infantry regiment 82d airborne division did what had not been done before and did it very successfully we fought joint combinedarms coalition interagency fight at the company level soldiers under my command fought in six smallarms firefights with qaeda in addition to fighting however we conducted numerous cmos we met with elders from every village in the bermel valley drank chai tea and discussed village problems and how to arrive at joint solutions we provided humanitarian assistance and diminimus health care defined as smallscale medical assistance operations using available excess medical supplies to the population we laid the groundwork to build wells hospitals and schools including the first ever girls school in the region we met routinely with the regional governor to discuss security issues we met monthly with the pakistani border guard commander across the border to discuss crossborder issues and cooperation we trained equipped and employed 180 afghan militia fighters and conducted joint operations with the afghan national army ana best of all we did it well not one soldier under my command got scratch from enemy fire intelligence reports claimed that we killed about two dozen seasoned foreign qaeda fighters and the unified effort of engaging the population in cmos led directly to most of the intelligence we collected intelligence that saved my life and my soldiers lives we applied special operations tactics but with the conventionalforce firepower and survivability that special forces operational detachment alpha teams ateams do not possess throughout this lowintensity war with the qaeda and the remaining hostile taliban forces conventional forces routinely had difficulty finding and fixing enemy forces conventional force usually went into an area with so much strength and firepower that the enemy forces would simply blend into the populace and wait for the battalion to leave the region hoping we would not stumble upon their weapons cache ateams had much more success finding the enemy while driving around the countryside in convoys of four government motor vehicles but they did not have the firepower armor or backup to fight their way through an ambush and come out victorious we did have that firepower we were able to provide just enough of signature to lure out the enemy forces but with enough firepower and support to destroy them as an infantry company commander my role my autonomy my distance from my higher headquarters my engagement with the local populace was something that up until then was only done by special forces ateam commanders my task organization and the assets under my command mimicked small battalion task force never had i envisioned that i would be thrown into such situation none of my formal military training focused on such scenarios however with our nation engaged in longterm lowintensity war while trying to conduct stability operations in both afghanistan and iraq and with our special forces spread so thin bravo company proved not only that conventional forces can be ultimately successful in this fight but that we are actually very well adapted to accomplish this mission our operations and our way of doing things should be adapted for the future of lowintensity conflict our approach was to give company commander combinedarms team make them mobile two antitank at platoons and enough 136 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedcargo highmobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles hmmwvs to move and give them enough infantrymen we had six squads local reactive accurate fire support we had two 60mm mortar tubes 2 x 105mm howitzers and q36 fire finder radar system plenty of intelligence assets we had human intelligence humint team signal intelligence sigint team remote battlefield sensor system rembass longrange reconnaissance detachment lrsd and scouts with some access to nationallevel intelligence assets to develop their own intelligence while feeding intelligence to the higher headquarters engineers andor explosive ordnance disposal eod personnel to blow up stuff and to disarm improvised explosive devices ieds when they find them civil affairs ca assets so they can engage the population tactical air control parties tacps medical assets enough to treat masscasualty scenario and also to use for cmo operations psychological operations psyop assets to help convey the coalition message their own cooks and mechanics as well as augmenting them with local hires miniature battalion staff i had fulltime battle captain lieutenant junior captain or e7 an e5 intelligence analyst as my s2 intelligence and s4 logistics i had lieutenant who was serving as the battalions assistant s4 and s5 civil affairs i had ca e5 plenty of interpreters and local militia force to train and utilize field grade officers were used as well in one rifle battalion they could easily split among three locations the battalion commander at one location the executive officer at second location and the s3 operations at third this would allow every firebase to be commanded by field grade officer while each would have company commander as the commander on the ground for any action that took place when we had all that we were allowed to engage the population and to plan our own missions we controlled our own ao and our field grade officer could clear fires we had enough assets to protect the firebase provide quickreaction force qrf and still conduct goodsized operation either cmo or offensive tactics in lowintensity conflict the essence and focus of lowintensity conflict is different from that of highintensity conflict the commanders goal is to find fix and finish the enemy the difference lies in the specific tasks the enemy does not wear uniform he blends into the population often he invokes fear in the local populace sometimes for official use only 137oef handbook iiihe can rally them to his cause in this instance he had pseudohaven across the border in pakistan where we could not pursue him unless we maintained positive identification finding him was the most difficult task we used mixture of scouts snipers lrsd unmanned aerial vehicles uavs rembass motion sensors q36 fire finder radar big brother joint land attack cruise missile defense elevated netted sensor jlens forwardlooking infrared system infantry squads in ambush positions and observation posts ops tactical humint team and humint sources such as village elders pakistanis the bermel police and the regional governor and the least preferred method making accidental direct contact with the enemy sometimes on his terms but sometimes on our own fixing the enemy usually involved indirect fires these are most effective when shot beyond the enemy to seal off their suspected escape route fixing the enemy could also involve maintaining direct contact with him by the force such as mounted antitank patrol that made initial contact finishing the enemy always involved crushing him with an overwhelming qrf defeating him with directfire weapon systems and claiming the ground he once held or engaging him in pursuit these principles of findfixandfinish are what helped us defeat the qaeda and anticoalition militants acms in the bermel valley but what won on the larger and longterm level was getting out and engaging the local population this was done through various cmos and local projects completed by members of the coalition joint civil military task force cjcmotf and other government agencies ogas as well as with the support of some nongovernment organizations ngos you only truly know your ao when you get out and engage the population they only come to trust you when you do so finally we relied mostly on our own intelligence we had numerous intelligencegathering assets the gathering and analysis of intelligence in our ao was the single piece that helped ensure our success only very rarely did we receive nationallevel intelligence leads the intelligence we developed was much more reliable command and control structureunity of command the different regions of afghanistan were divided up into areas of operations each belonging to different task force each task force had different functions eg the coalition joint special operations task force cjsotf conducted special operations missions and the coalition joint civil military task force cjcmotf focused on civil military operations cmo my own task force task force devil focused mainly on offensive combat operations task force might or might not have personnel stationed within another task forces ao for instance task force devil personnel were often stationed at cjsotf and cjcmotf firebases to provide force protection and qrf in support of the cjsotf and cjcmotf missions to streamline operations and make battle tracking easier one group has to own any given ao unity of command is essential when clearing fires ultimately however it is essential in creating unified effort to pacify an area prior to my assumption of command cjsotf controlled firebase shkin and the ao encompassing the bermel valley while task force devil personnel 138 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedwere simply there providing force protection and limited patrolling when cjsotf pulled out of the ao task force devil assumed control of the firebase and the ao the battalion executive officer xo served as the overall firebase and ao commander i was the only company commander even though the lines between what fell under his command and what fell under my command were very blurry this command structure actually worked out perfectly the battalion xo could always be the overall firebase commander while i could always be the commander on the ground he would clear fires in the tactical operations center toc as i requested them he would send reports higher request assets such as army aviation and close air support cas he could coordinate qrfs to reinforce in pinch our lines of command blurred but never clashed we had great working relationship i highly recommend this as model for future firebases combat operations firebase defense defending the firebase is paramount but in lowintensity conflict it is somewhat different because the enemy is very unlikely to conduct full frontal attack or penetration firebase shkin had three main defensive perimeters the outer perimeter the inner perimeter and the wall at any given time one squad rotated on firebase defense this squad would man the inner perimeter gate and the two eastern towers which had the largest fields of fire and most activity since they overlooked the bermel valley and could see all the way to pakistan the squad leader would serve as the firebase sergeant of the guard responsible to the toc for overall firebase defense and conduct of the guards one of the other two towers was manned by at platoons since we had only six uparmored hmmwvs this provided one at section that at any given time was not either patrolling or standing by on qrf and the other was manned as shared responsibility by the other soldiers in the firebase such as the mortars air defense artillery and field artillery we also always maintained qrf the fire support officer fso produced an awesome plan for overall firebase defense integrating direct and indirect fire support and considering the dead space we executed blackjack drills exercises of our battle drill in the event of direct attack on the firebase these drills helped in number of ways first they ironed out problems that we could face if we did receive direct attack second they showed the enemy what our capabilities were should they ever think to launch direct attack and most important they showed the soldiers that they were safe that nothing could penetrate our firebase and that they were part of the defensive plan in each blackjack drill we would exercise all assets whether it was livefire drill or not everyone would don helmets and body armor and seek cover within the protective walls and structures of the twofootthick mudbuilt firebase the squad and section leaders would come to the firebase toc for their briefing and we would reinforce one or two of the walls with soldiers ready to engage with direct fire at times we would even emplace targets in the fields for the soldiers to engage we usually would include mass casualty exercise drills to get the advanced trauma life support atls team involved and prepared along with preparing the squads to exercise buddy aid evacuation and reinforcement of weak section of the wall and we would exercise resupplying all soldiers with ammunition that was prepositioned on the walls and at the base of the towers the firebase was surrounded by wadis that provided avenues of approach about 100 200 meters outside the firebase and in some places right up to the outer for official use only 139oef handbook iiiamf perimeter prior to my arrival the infantry squads conducted routine dismounted patrols of these wadi systems and other dead space such as that on the other side of the hills to our west these patrols could be conducted entirely dismounted entering and leaving the firebase on foot even though they fit in with the standard thought of planning for defense i put stop to these types of patrols for two reasons the first was the drain on resources vs the payoff these patrols usually took one squad per day i had only six rifle squads at the firebase i used my weapons squad as rifle squad and usually left their m204b machine guns mounted on the towers for firebase defense among these six three squads rotated on defense which consisted of qrf guard and compensation time or training time the other three rotated on offense which consisted of all operations outside of the firebase giving up one of these three precious rifle squads for lowpayoff dismounted patrols to clear firebase dead space was not an option instead i used other assets at my disposal avengers and other soldiers the avenger missile trucks were very handy for clearing dead space since there was aerial threat from the enemy we refocused the avengers to provide mobile eyes that could see extremely well any movement in the dead space although much louder than dismounted patrol they were also much quicker and could identify movement at night anywhere in the wadi system the second and more important reason for ending the strictly dismounted patrols around the firebase was recognition of the way the enemy fights in lowintensity conflict the enemy whether qaeda hostile taliban amf or some similar group will not be so bold as to attempt deliberate attack on an established defended structure they fight by conducting indirect fire attacks using mortars and rockets and by ambushing patrols when they are out and exposed during the gwot there have been remarkably few direct smallarms attacks on firebases forward operating bases fobs and larger established structures even in the attacks that are on record many can be attributed to small attack on one remote guard post probably with the intent of killing only those guards rather than penetrating the firebase by looking at the points of origin of the rockets and missiles fired and the locations of the ambushes i determined that the enemy was fighting from between six and 15 kilometers outside the firebase and mostly near the pakistani border rather than close in to the firebase since they were fighting us from there that is where our operations needed to be rather than close in to the firebase i was able to focus my efforts there because we did have strong defense as demonstrated during livefire blackjack drills and could rely on our closein safety one last topic of great importance to firebase defense is operational security opsec opsec must be maintained we knew that the enemy collected intelligence on us we always operated on the assumption that whenever patrol left the firebase it was seen and reported in some fashion even if only by means as primitive as signal fire mirror or flashlight also we had to be careful what was said around the local workers and amf we had to prevent talk about any operations even routine patrols among the locals noncommissioned officers ncos monitored weekly calls home to ensure that information was passed on the satellite phone that might be picked up by the enemy major operations we identified major operation as anything greater than routine patrol these operations could range in size from platoon to company plus 140 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedin every event we used every available asset to plan for every conceivable contingency whether the mission was raid sensitivesite exploitation sse cordonandsearch or cmo the task organization looked pretty much the same we always planned for an outer cordon an inner cordon search team team village with security intelligencegathering assets demolition team medical team and responsive fire support if the operation fell within the standard range of our 105mm howitzers we left it at that with preplanned targets if it fell only within rocketassisted propellant rap range i displaced the 60mm mortars because i did not trust the variance that rap produced if the operation fell outside rap range we displaced howitzer we also always requested deliberate cas on any planned operation even on cmos cas was very helpful our outer cordon usually consisted of afghan militia forces the inner cordon usually consisted of elements of my antitank platoon both were used for the cordon because they were very quick to establish blocking positions occasionally i would also use infantry squads to help establish the inner cordon in locations where using an at vehicle was unnecessary the cordon or team secure would always fall under the command and control of the at platoon leader this ensured that one leader was focused solely on securing the objective they would initially lock down the objective and then at my command would allow both personnel and vehicular traffic to flow in controlled fashion after thorough search inside i would task one platoon with search most of our missions raid sse or otherwise involved major search of the premises in any event we had to be prepared to search anything if we found an intelligence lead one of the infantry platoon leaders was always assigned as the search platoon leader he usually had an engineer or eod team at his disposal to search anything that looked suspicious or to destroy any caches we always took along team village this encompassed all of our squishy elements security force and usually myself squishy term coined by the battalion commander roughly meant forces whose primary mission did not involve killing the enemy it usually applied to civil affairs and psyop forces who went in to meet with the village elders i usually used my weapons squad without their machine guns or javelins as team village personal security detachment team village was always led by the head cmo person either my own s5 or the civil affairs team cata commander falling under the team village for command and control c2 but usually operating independently were the tactical humint team tht they were best at working the outskirts during meeting with village elders the team village leader and i could debrief the s2 on any intelligence that came out of the meeting but the tht had good success working intelligence from the crowd and the younger members of the village who were not invited into the meeting many operations also included team overwatch this was usually simply my fire support officer or nco along with the air force forward air controllers or tacps and sometimes sniper they would take twoman infantry security element also if need be along with the cordon they would establish an op on the highest ground available where they could provide overwatch and coordinate all indirect fire support finally we always took medical team usually full atls team this would consist of medical provider either doctor or physician assistant and two for official use only 141oef handbook iiimedics on call on most major operations for any casualties sustained they were also great cmo asset the main effort in diminimus health care for trying to gain the favor of local elders with children who could use medical attention mounted presence patrols these patrols were some of our most effective every day we conducted two mounted daytime presence patrols and one mounted nighttime presence patrol these could coincide with other patrols or operations but many of them were simply patrols in and of themselves during daylight we ran two at vehicles uparmored hmmwvs with one mk19 automatic grenade launcher and one m2 50caliber machine gun these patrols showed the population that we were present and had control of their valley while also providing plenty of eyes on my ao it also allowed the young at leaders section leaders platoon leaders and platoon sergeants chance to plan and lead their own patrols they planned fires and shifted priority targets stopped and searched suspicious vehicles and provided intelligence in their debriefings that helped us plan future operations we learned at night to roll an entire platoon because two vehicles simply did not provide enough firepower if two vehicles get split in an ambush they become completely ineffective we learned this lesson the hard way on 1 june 2003 one twotruck section of at2 was conducting night presence toward the bermel bazaar when their two vehicles drove into near ambush the enemy initiated with rocketpropelled grenades rpgs and pk machine guns the at section returned fire as each vehicle drove out of the kill zone on the fastest route possible unfortunately the fastest route for the lead vehicle was to drive forward and the fastest route for the trailing vehicle was to back up once out of the kill zone neither vehicle could effectively fire upon the enemy location because they feared stray 50caliber and mk19 rounds might hit the other at truck worse yet one of the trucks had two tires damaged and assistance from anyone else we wound up bringing the damaged truck back to the firebase and marrying up the lead truck with qrf force the strongest lesson we learned that night was to roll minimum of four gun trucks during the hours of darkness so they can provide mutual support this lesson paid huge dividends eight days later on the night of 9 june 2003 the four guntruck patrol by at2 moving out to exfiltrate dismounted ambush identified movement in an area near recent enemy activity one of the gunners identified weapons the platoon formed themselves into an lshape by sending the lead section along the wadi that started route saturn while the trail section remained on route chevy the platoon made simultaneous contact with the qaeda one 50caliber gunner initiated fire at the same time an qaeda operative fired his rpg after the firefight what remained on the battlefield were four dead qaeda who had been camping in listening postobservation post lpop with eyes on the firebase and equipment such as antitank mines and detonation cord to set up an iedinitiated ambush this night we were entirely successful because at2 had enough assets to surround and overwhelm the enemy ambush the ambush is simple standard infantry operation that proved very effective we usually executed these with one rifle squad often augmented with one m240b machine gun and forward observer fo with platoon leader in charge when conducting these patrols we cut corners executing them exactly the way we were taught in ranger school and the infantry officer basic course these patrols would usually take up full night for clandestine infiltration establishment breakdown and exfiltration there are two keys to conducting 142 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedambush patrols during lowintensity conflict the first is the trickiness of the rules of engagement roe and the second is effectively infiltrating without being seen the roe in afghanistan and especially in the bermel valley allowed us to shoot first if we could clearly identify hostile intent therefore ambush patrols were effective the platoon leader would be required to make the call based on his knowledge of the people terrain past enemy activity and traffic patterns platoon leader was used on every squadsized mission such as this because there might be difficult call to be made about whether or not to engage obviously not every vehicle or person moving at night was hostile this was proven by searching numerous vehicles stopped by nighttime at patrols therefore positively identifying vehicles transporting enemy personnel was nearly impossible the only hypothetical situation where permission could be granted to open fire would be if armed qaeda operatives were seen brandishing weapons from the backs of trucks or if highly suspicious highend blackedout sportutility vehicle suv convoy was moving through the area this reinforces the need for unified c2 in the ao so other government agencies special operations forces amf and ana personnel would not move through the valley without squad on an ambush line knowing of their movement to avoid fratricide most qaeda we faced however infiltrated and operated on foot making positive identification at night much easier however depending on terrain enemy activity and ability to positively identify hostile intent an ambush patrol might become nothing more than largesized overnight op clandestine infiltration is extremely difficult for squadplus element in this environment the bermel valley offers limited cover and concealment also given the unconventional warfare waged by the enemy we had to contend with enemy sympathizers identifying our movement and communicating it we always assumed that when patrol rolled out of the firebase gate someone would count the number of vehicles estimate the number of personnel and send the message out to our enemies working under this assumption we planned our infiltrations very meticulously this included rolling with two squads at night along with the at platoon the squad that would actually be conducting the ambush would be spread out among the two cargo hmmwvs and the empty seats of the at vehicles this way enemy sympathizers would only be able to communicate and confirm that four gun trucks and two cargo trucks full of soldiers exited the firebase on patrol and were still patrolling around the valley this also allowed for much more reactive rolling qrf that could act as the finishing force once the ambush squad fixed the enemy rolling insertions false insertions and insertions in concealed terrain were also key to clandestine infiltration specific intelligence from higher that an enemy convoy was moving on specific route at specific time never came these patrols were better for simply keeping eyes and firepower out to deny the enemy freedom of maneuver in the ao even when an ambush was seen by watchful enemy eye it let them know we meant business and probably made them think twice about infiltrating on key routes clearing missions there are two types of clearing systematically clearing group of compounds and simply clearing empty terrain although we cleared number of compounds these were always major operations and usually intelligencedriven clearing empty terrain is very simple to plan but tiresome to execute such operations do however often yield very good intelligence these were dismounted for official use only 143oef handbook iiimissions to walk patch of ground looking for clues of enemy activity as for any mission we had to plan for fire support casualty evacuation and qrf the chance of actually finding any enemy on these missions was slim as we could be easily seen as we entered the area and as we approached however in an attempt to get away quickly the enemy could leave behind equipment or evidence of their presence in addition when we cleared areas that were frequently used by the enemy it familiarized the soldiers and leaders with ground that they might have to fight on one day and like any other show of force it denies the enemy that piece of terrain we quickly learned why nobody lived or trafficked the mountains leading into pakistan one trip up them in body armor was plenty static observation postssnipers these were among the most effective operations we conducted the best way to find the enemy is to physically see them moving when they believe they are not being watched by the end of our tenure at shkin we had largesized scout and lrsd element that we rotated every 72 hours to maintain continuous coverage on our two most used areas around losano ridge and in the vicinity of route saturn we also used infantry squads in 48hour operations on one occasion i even had the privilege of employing an italian target acquisition detachment tad each had its strengths and weaknesses using rifle squad was effective especially when scout or lrs assets are not available but that approach had its weaknesses sustainability was usually more than 48 hours also the squad was cumbersome and had tendency to receive asoft compromise discovery by neutral force such as child villager or farmer they were also difficult to infiltrate clandestinely due to the size of the rifle squad however it could usually cover more ground by splitting up into three separate elements each fire team would occupy its own op and the squad leader fo radiotelephone operator and platoon leader would occupy separate c2 op the individual fire teams would maintain shortrange communications with the squad and platoon leaders while the c2 op would maintain communications with the firebase one of the most effective uses of the squad lpop was the staybehind lpop whenever we conducted major operation in village either cmo mission or clearing operation we would try to leave staybehind it is much easier to infiltrate small force when rolling in with such large fighting force besides many villages say they dont want to accept your help because the qaeda would come after them staybehind ops could find out who if anybody did the qaeda are curious about why we come to the village and they want to gather intelligence about us even if the squad receives soft compromise and everyone knows covert lpop was in place all is not lost because it makes the enemy feel we are always watching and it makes the villagers feel either safe or reluctant to assist the enemy battalion scouts and snipers were smaller more adept element they were able to effectively stay out for 72 hours at time and could infiltrate much better locations additionally in our battalion the sniper teams are intermixed with the battalion scouts so often i could send out team to conduct reconnaissance and they would also have the additional capability to take precision shot using an m24 or barrett 50caliber sniper rifle of course precision shots are crucial during lowintensity conflict due to the requirement to minimize collateral damage scouts and snipers are usually better at planning for the missions and better at backbriefing than the rifle squads the drawback is that they are not an effective fighting force by themselves so we made up for that with responsive indirect fire priority targets and with dedicated qrf 144 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedlrsds effectively able to sustain themselves for 96 120 hours were even better suited than the battalion scouts continuous coverage became necessary in one particularly volatile area so i used my lrsd team much more like scout team they split their sixman team the sixth man was their medic into two threeman teams one led by the team leader and the other by the assistant team leader their planning methods and backbriefs were even better than those of the scouts they were able to send photos back to us using tactical satellite data messages while the team was in the hidesite and they made extensive use of digital camera for backbriefs similar to the scouts however they are not an effective fighting force by themselves the only compromise to either the scout or lrsd teams came on 29 june 2003 when the lrs team received hard compromise they were engaged by the enemy using an automatic weapon from about 600 meters out of course we had priority 105mm artillery target laid on for protection and although it was not accurate the enemy stopped shooting and evacuated back to pakistan once the artillery began landing in their vicinity we were easily able to extract the lrsd team with the qrf and sustained us injuries for short period of time i also had the opportunity to employ an italian target acquisition team very similar to lrsd they were able to sustain themselves for much longer period of time than the assets at our battalion level they also had amazing optics and camera capability their thermal sites were much clearer than ours and with much greater magnification they had digital cameras that could take what looked like closeup photo from over kilometer away we were glad to use to the fullest any advanced reconnaissance asset we were given sensitivesite exploitations many sensitivesite exploitation missions are required some are intelligencedriven others result from contact that requires later search of the surrounding area still others come from need to deny sanctuary or discovery of compound that looks suspicious the sse or cordon and knock as i heard the 4th infantry division call them in operation iraqi freedom has its own art form it must be planned as though it is the last stronghold of the qaeda osama bin ladin is inside and they will fight to the death the compound must be entirely surrounded so one can escape we always used the majoroperation template discussed earlier outer cordon of amf inner cordon using at vehicles and some infantry fotacp team on the highest observation point engineers working for team search and the ca the tht and i ready to do the talking we expected to do soft breach meaning we knock on the door and they let us in but we planned hard or deliberate breach meaning we either break or blow the door off its hinges if necessary we found that the best method was to knock on the door and ask for the man of the house bring him outside and explain to him that we were going to search his quarters we would tell him to bring all of the men outside and move all women and children into one room thus showing respect for the women we made sure he understood that our soldiers would assume the rooms were empty and if child was left in the room he or she risked getting shot we gave him just enough time to accomplish this task and then the search team searched the men first to ensure they were not threat when documenting the mens names we didnt ask an individual just for his own name we took him aside and asked him for the other mens names as well in country like afghanistan where identification is easily forged this is crucial for finding blacklist personnel who are blending into the population then we searched the first empty room and marked it we moved all of for official use only 145oef handbook iiithe women and children from the room where they first gathered into this newly searched room acm sympathizers or anyone with something to hide might attempt to put it into the women and childrens room thinking that room will not be searched when all the women and children were in their new location the search team went back into the room where they gathered first and the female searcher began searching the women and children we always ensured that she had two large men as sentries standing outside the room to give her backup mainly to let everyone know that if they interfered with the female searcher the other two would come in buttstroking or shooting if necessary also if man was attempting to hide in burka womens clothing covering the whole body including the face we dealt harshly with him everything was searched very thoroughly we used the engineers or eods metal detector to search for false walls and floors we searched on the roofs and down wells eod robots are great for this now here is the key piece dealing with this family based on what was found if we found nothing and it was routine search we brought in team village we told the man we wanted to talk to him about things going on in the region and apologized for the search of his compound but reassure him that it is standard us army procedure before sitting down to talk to the head of household if we had ca package such as blankets school supplies psyop radios or halal meals food prepared following muslim religious guidelines to offer now this was great time to distribute them the locals would not mind getting searched and might invite us to search them again if they receive something for it it is best to leave on very good terms making the head of the compound feel he was selected not because we wanted to search his compound but because i who was in effect the local warlord wanted to talk to him and seek his opinion this would place him in position of honor amongst his village rather than one of dishonor for having his compound searched of course if we did find something the situation was different we had to judge based on their cooperation we definitely confiscated any contraband we always allowed one ak47 or enfield rifle and one magazine per man in the compound excess weapons weapons larger than an ak47 and excess ammunition were usually confiscated with nothing further sometimes with promise to return the ak if they brought proper documentation or better yet information about the qaeda to the firebase this is why it was so important to tag all confiscated equipment to ensure that it would get back to its proper owner if that promise was made items such as armorpiercing ammunition routinely used and distributed by the qaeda rpgs and any iedmaking material immediately aroused suspicion and usually meant placing under custody the head of the house and bringing him back for further questioning if they were uncooperative and had contraband team village did not get involved and the village would receive nothing vehicle checkpoints vehicle checkpoints vcps are an excellent way to prevent the acms and qaeda freedom of movement throughout the ao they can be very elaborate with pashtun signs cones and concertina wire but we relied on very simple vcp that could be established and broken down easily locals and acms alike knew what we were doing and respected the rules we established the key to remember is that within 30 minutes of establishing vcp the acms knew it was there and any highvalue targets hvts moving through the ao would find bypass within 90 minutes of our being there everyone would know we were there and would have found bypass we were better off establishing for short periods of time and then moving to an alternate location when we had the assets 146 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedwe established our primary vcp and then established secondary vcp on an alternate route when we had recon assets such as scouts lrs or predator uav we used them to see what was happening on the route prior to vehicles approaching we found that vehicles in the outgoing lane would often warn those approaching of our existence as when conducting an sse we searched every person and every compartment of every vehicle if large commercial truck had big cargo we sometimes went so far as to have them download if we could not determine that nothing was being smuggled here it was crucial that our lowest private knew our blackgrey list and could identify hvts on site or upon hearing their names here also we used the technique of not only asking the males their names but also asking them to identify the others by name to see if someone is trying to hide his identity when we had female searchers we used them acms are more likely to hide in burkas when traveling then when stationary we always planned for pursuit force in case suspicious vehicle saw our vcp and attempted to escape i will elaborate more under the section use of amf why we usually relied on amf for our pursuit force but the bottom line is that if someone is obviously trying to get your attention he might be trying to lure you away so the true hvt whether person or munitions stock can use the route you are blocking or to lure you into an ambush use of quickreaction force qrf is absolutely essential we found that our own qrf force along with aerial qrf and xcas airborne nondedicated cas providing protection in the theater rather than simply being reactionary force in the event of an emergency became our finishing force in the standard scenario finding force locates the enemy they fix them with artillery or direct fires so they can be finished by the qrf force that arrives at any given moment we had one infantry squad one lieutenant one fo and one at section available to launch from the firebase in five minutes we also usually had second qrf force ready to launch within 20 to 30 minutes if lucky enough to have the c2 relationship i enjoyed the company commander should always launch with qrf because the situation could develop so that commander on the ground is needed to make decisions on every mission we calculated the length of time for reaction if contact was made and then prepositioned the qrf or other force in the bermel valley we often prepositioned the qrf force at the amf border checkpoint next to angor adda this not only helped to shorten the amount of time it would take for the qrf to reinforce forwardpositioned troops but it also helped show force forward and support for our amf the position was hard and reinforced with good observation where our soldiers could use their night observation equipment to identify movement use of afghan militia forces i have the utmost respect for the afghan people as fighting force i look forward to future where we can fight alongside the afghan national army as coalition force having grown up knowing nothing but conflict these men have become some of the bravest and most hardened fighters imaginable with stunning sense of pride they took great pride in leading all joint patrols although they wore helmets or body armor and drove softskin vehicles toyota hilux 4x4s they would take other position than the lead earning the joking title from many of my soldiers of afghan mine finders the afghan militia knew the risks they were taking and they took them willingly i once saw my border guard commander stomp his foot on suspected mines and then get in his toyota 4x4 and drive very fast across the suspected mined patch of road for official use only 147oef handbook iiipresumably in the hopes that he would outrun the blast like all other forces we used them for their strengths but knew their limitations amf led every joint mounted patrol and most major operations they did this of course to fulfill their role as mine finders they also knew the ground better and could more easily spot something that was out of place or suspicious having them lead became very tricky at times because to maintain opsec we would give them only brief versions of our operations orders at the last possible moment and the lead driver usually did not know our destination we developed standard operating procedure in which the lead american vehicle maintained communications with the amf lead vehicle through radio and an interpreter also the amf did not have night vision equipment so an amfled night patrol was nightmare as they kept turning on their headlights giving away our position and blinding our night observation devices the amf were raised in society where conquering forces are expected to take loot so when we could help it we did not use amf to search if we had choice we ensured that the search took place under the direct supervision of our own soldiers had we used amf alone the locals would have complained that they stole property disrespected the women and elders etc member of rival tribe could have made claims against our amf of thieving or disrespect and we would have had way to disprove it and even if the amf were to do everything right the locals would rather submit to americans than to what they identify as rival tribe when we rolled into town we used the amf for our outer cordon they would quickly surround the village and stop anyone from escaping our amf were great at climbing mountains quickly we would roll onto group of compounds surrounded by hills and after one word to my amf commander i could look up and see one amf soldier standing on each hilltop i would never dream of sending my own troops up there without communications by themselves with heavy body armor to climb up those hills but the amf were great for it also if we had runner ie if we went into village and saw someone leaving quickly in the other direction i would send amf out to chase them they would chase them down and bring them back from wherever i would not do that with americans without communications supporting fires etc and by the time i put the complex american patrol together for the chase the guy would be long gone and blended into the crowd this alone provided an amazing capability to the battlefield that could not be had with strictly coalition forces training the amf was key task difficult at times but very rewarding my smallunit leaders and young soldiers really enjoyed training these hardened foreign fighters on the rifle range or on smallunit operations the mutual respect and trust forged in training and proven sidebyside in battle was awesome similar to the amf but much better however was the afghan national army in my opinion this is one of the greatest programs going on in afghanistan one issue with the amf or any indigenous militia force that commander needs to recognize is that they have local and tribal loyalties afghanistan in general is conglomeration of tribes and warlords who constantly fight one another in their history they have banded together only to oppose outside invading forces like the russians almost every afghan has much stronger allegiance to family tribe region or warlord than to the country of afghanistan my amf were all tajic or orgune this helped because they were not from my ao and had 148 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedgreat distrust for almost all tribes in the bermel valley especially the wasiris harote and karote prior to my arrival all of the wasiri amf quit at the command of their tribal elder using tajic afm however resulted in many complaints from the locals the ana however were enlisted from all over afghanistan and trained and employed in various regions they had group loyalty to anything but afghanistan and president karzai when they came into town cleanshaven and wellequipped the locals thought they were foreign fighters they could be trusted to search locals and there would not be the complaints we heard about the tajic amf the only difficulty we met was degree of jealousy between the amf and ana when we had chance to employ both forces civil military operations team village concept and operations team village was an expression we learned from our predecessors the red devils of 1504 parachute infantry regiment it usually referred to group of personnel tasked with conducting cmo function within larger operation many times team village was the main effort as many missions were executed solely for cmo purposes often team village was mix of civil affairs and psychological operations at minimum usually the senior infantry commander would also participate in the cmo function of the operation but always focused on the security and the overall operation other assets within team village could be but were not limited to medics with health care provider to administer diminimus health care military intelligence professionals and security personnel classifying forces by function made it easy for everyone to understand their task and purpose and where they fit into the operation we usually had team secure under the leadership of the at platoon leader team clear or team search under the leadership of the rifle platoon leader team overwatch under the fso or fsnco and team village under the c2 of the head civil affairs or psyop personnel also team fires when we displaced mortar although both ca and psyop vehemently claimed to be highly specialized each can do the others jobs and they work well together we really never knew exactly which way mission would take us there were missions where we planned to search suspected acm compound ready to conduct deliberate breach blow the door off and come in shooting but then we found the occupants to be hospitable and friendly and the compound to be clean here shifting the focus from an aggressive mission to cmo opportunity acting as though the purpose of our mission was to seek the counsel of the head of the compound and also to provide humanitarian assistance package helped win us allies in the bermel valley being able to shift focus and win friends ultimately helped us pacify the region also once while we were conducting diminimus health care operation the villagers probably pleased with the health care that they had just received gave us information about an acm we were looking for we searched his compound took him prisoner and sent him up to bagrahm and on to guantanamo in every case having the flexibility to go either way to have friendly mission go hostile or to make friends out of hostile mission was crucial even in strictly friendly cmo operations the combat arms guys always had to set the conditions first the team village commander who often outranked when we had cata at the firebase had to understand that he was waiting in the for official use only 149oef handbook iiiwings for the goahead from the infantry platoon leader that all is secure and he was cleared to proceed with team village operations also depending on the mission an infantry squad might be tasked to provide security for team village if we planned to distribute large humanitarian assistance package or provide diminimus health care we made sure the locals lined up in an orderly fashion and did not become unruly simply throwing box of blankets into crowd could have gotten someone injured or killed and then we would have lost the favor of that persons family by the way it is amazing the respect afghans have for white engineer tape by simply laying out do not cross lines of white engineer tape on the ground we could achieve an orderly line in time meetings with the elders working with foreign culture requires working within that cultures norms in afghanistan the tribal elders are in charge each village and each compound has at least one patriarch who is the recognized head of the household these people have lot of influence within their tribe if they tell the village to aid the qaeda the village will likewise if they tell the village to aid the coalition they will all do that as well when going to the village we always asked to speak to the elders they would usually ask us to sit down to shura or meeting they might offer little food or at least drink of chai but seldom full meal here we had to simply grin and bear the camels milk in our tea afghan chai by the way has so much sugar in it that it is almost like syrup on one occasion the elders even brought out blanket for us to sit on picnic style our snack was provided by boy who climbed up the apricot tree we were sitting under and shook it until apricots landed all around us as with major operations we began by showing force for all we knew village might be hiding osama bin ladin so we were prepared to fight we sealed off the village quickly if our sole purpose is to meet with the elders as new commanderwarlord in the region it is important to take time to go to each village within the ao to get feel for each of the elders there once we had the village secured we simply started asking around for the elders telling them we wished to have meeting and before we knew it they would have meeting room cleared there are chairs in afghanistan outside the firebase so we usually sat on blankets they respected the force we brought to their village and were usually be very happy to learn that we came only to talk to them rather than to search through everybodys home showing that we wished to meet with them reinforced their status as the heads of the village we could further reinforce the elders status by distributing packages through them to the needy members of their village once everything was set we started the introductions letting them know that i was the one in charge of all of the security of the valley while the civil affairs guy was there to find out what projects they needed help with we usually engaged in good dialogue starting off with talk of future cmo projects such as building wells schools and hospitals we found out their concerns and then at the end asked if they have seen any qaeda or if they knew of any qaeda movement through the ao we made them understand that ngos and other humanitarian assistance would not arrive if they deemed the area to be unsafe if we had asked those questions first they would have initially denied everything we first had to earn their trust we seldom gathered much intelligence from the elders at first meeting but when we followed through they were likely to come at later date to the firebase to give us information oneonone we were always careful to extend them that invitation 150 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedduring the meetings it did help to show our muscle we had security personnel waiting either behind us or just outside the room where they can be seen or at least make their presence felt they do not let anyone in unless they had searched them and then looked to for nod of approval other acts of both strength and kindness were helpful once during meeting my at platoon leader called in on the radio that they had stopped vehicle that had two men with two ak47s attempting to enter the village while we were there i asked the village elders whether the men should be allowed in or seized this showed the elders that i had strong hand but that i would trust their judgment help their friends and hurt their enemies also i usually used preplanned cas for major operations having the cas conduct low pass usually scared the hell out of everyone in the village the elders would beg not to let them continue i would then call my tacp on the radio and tell him not to let the cas conduct any more low passes once again this showed that i had the power to command the airplanes but also that i would heed the elders request and call them off while the meeting was going on one squad with some engineers would roam around looking simply for anything suspicious or anything that looked like it was recently dug in when the village received early warning of our arrival the infantry platoon leader would conduct some minor winning hearts and minds outside the big meeting by passing out candy and other small things to the kids the best presents we could ever give afghan children were polaroid photo of themselves they had probably never seen their own pictures let alone owned one while he was working the crowd outside the humint guys were working right alongside him all the intelligence that came out of the elders meeting would be provided later to the firebase officerincharge in the backbrief the team village commander and i would attend the professional humint guys were much better used outside talking to the younger men who were not important enough to go to the village elders meeting but wanted to make themselves feel important by talking to the americans while the elders were not watching often the picture painted by them was much different from the story we got from the elders meetings with the regional governors we usually had sitdown meeting once month with the regional governor this reinforced his status as the legitimate head of the region working under president karzai these were often tricky because to meet with him we had to go into the bermel bazaar where we would be surrounded not only by my men but also by his bermel police the regional governor managed and controlled his own police force all of them appeared to be about 17 years old and all were very thin although we didnt feel very safe with them around carrying ak47s we knew they would never challenge our forces in the valley and they looked to us to be their ally so we showed we had the power we would seal off the place and have our security personnel stop anyone who entered the room and look for nod of approval from we could then show good faith by letting the young bermel policeman serve us chai and peanuts with his ak47 strapped to him showing that we trusted the governor and his men but could disarm his police force with only word often the focus of these meetings was request from the governor for arms ammunition and other assistance i was very limited in my ability to provide anything to him the governor saw as his direct link to the us military command in afghanistan but most of his concerns were with matters that involved the support he received from the afghan central government for official use only 151oef handbook iiione issue with this regional governor is that although his region included the entire bermel valley his only secure stronghold was at the bermel bazaar this was not to say he could not exert influence throughout the valley as much of the commerce of the region centered around the bermel bazaar and many tribal and village elders often went to the bermel bazaar to meet and discuss issues hosting shura our overall cmo operation within the valley depended on coordination among all villages and tribes since many of the benefits of us or ngo assistance would go to aid the entire population of the valley this could become very difficult when the karote dont trust the wasiris and vice versa our repeated theme was that ngos were afraid to work in the bermel valley because there was too much qaeda activity one of the best methods of pacifying the entire valley was to host shura meeting of all the tribal elders we conducted these both at the governors headquarters and at our own firebase conducting shura at the governors quarters helped to establish the hierarchy from the regional governor to the tribal elders the biggest problem was that we would get more participation from the governors tribe than from the other tribes we were more successful hosting the event at our own firebase because it represented neutral ground for all elders involved another technique was to host the shura with all the elders and not invite the governor that way we were likely to get much more candid talk from the various elders it was also good technique for finding out if the governors actions matched his talk or if there were problems with corruption among the governors police force shuras were always dicey as the rival tribes would want to begin by sending accusations back and forth against one another sometimes it was hard to remember that my team village commander and i were in charge of the meeting and that working together for the mutual benefit of all was the goal shuras were always necessary step because the last thing we wanted in our cmo campaign was to make one tribe or village feel that we favored their rivals we had to use such rivalry to our advantage making each tribe or village feel that they would receive the most humanitarian assistance by working the most with us and by providing us with the best information leading to captured or more likely killed qaeda meetings with the pakistanis in the bermel valley the greatest threat came from qaeda who seemed to have both sanctuary in pakistan and freedom of movement along the borders there were actually three different borders identified the nima line the durrand line and the line the pakistanis claimed all of them were within one or two hundred meters of one another in general the border was not clearly marked with anything manmade but was distinguished by large mountainous region the pakistanis of course claimed the high ground of the border and manned outposts along key overwatch positions many of the locals actually had little concept of either afghanistan or pakistan or of borders they believed they all lived in wasiristan since wasiris lived on both sides of the border and if they were willing to hike the mountains could move back and forth freely within the entire valley the only major crossing not blocked by natural mountain barrier was at the main pakistani bazaar in angor adda angor adda was so well known for its qaeda activity that time magazine published story about it entitled qaeda town prior to my arrival the pakis left security of the entire region to their frontier troops the local southwasiri scouts sws like many of the amf and 152 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedother regional militia forces these troops had more loyalty to the local leaders than to pakistan as country we always assumed that many members of the sws were openly supporting the qaeda when i was in afghanistan in december 2002 learning the ropes under our sister brigade the 505 pir panther brigade lost their first paratrooper to qaeda right there in the bermel valley shortly after that incident another american soldier was shot in the head by south wasiri scout after meeting with them the sws had excellent observation throughout the bermel valley advanced optics including night vision and communications gear it seemed that whenever one of our night patrols left the firebase fires would spring up along the border at the sws outposts my first formal meeting with the pakistani border guard commanders occurred within minutes of my arrival to assume command the battalion xo rushed up to and began cutting off my name tapes you will be known as captain dave i wont let you make the same mistake your predecessor and i made and let them know your full name apparently after the first few of these meetings nationallevel intelligence assets reported that the qaeda knew the names of the xo and the previous bravo company commander and the xo didnt want to live in fear of retaliation against my family back home arriving at the angor adda border checkpoint was always very checkpoint charleyish as we pulled up with plenty of us military and amf to assume security overwatching the pakistani positions as our small delegation walked the demilitarized zone up to the gates of pakistan and only we walked in apparently before my arrival these meetings had been very tense as was the relationship with the sws luckily things started to change from within pakistan starting near the time of my arrival the sws commander was removed we were told at first he was unable to attend the meeting and later that he was transferred pakistani regular army commanders arrived to take over operations and many paki regular troops began to assist the sws with manning the border checkpoints meetings were always cordial it was obvious that the pakistanis were more advanced and westernized as we sat on chairs and ate excellent food especially the curry the key is to work together but not to share too much information we always talked about our mortars as we didnt want them to know that we had replaced them with artillery our mortars came up frequently as many outposts claimed that we shot harassing fires into pakistan we exchanged maps so they could identify what we recognized as the nima line for the border and they would share the locations of their new border outposts so we would not bump into them with patrol we also had specific thurya cell phones that we would use to contact each other to give cordial alert when we were in firefight or if we were shooting artillery near the border as much as i did not trust the sws i did trust the pakistani regulars their arrival was much needed very recently they have proven their resolve against the qaeda by conducting numerous raids in the area against qaeda strongholds and capturing hvts such as nik mohammed unfortunately as in other cases of unconventional warfare and lowintensity conflict we never knew if we were being watched by an outpost manned by pakistani regulars who were loyal to general musharrif or by the sws who might have other loyalties but pakistan is definitely moving in the right direction in the bermel valley for official use only 153oef handbook iiiconducting diminimus health care operations these operations were awesome for winning the hearts and minds of the locals the doctors medics and physician assistants enjoyed the contribution they made to the locals like other cmo operations these were always accomplished first by securing the village and then telling the village elders of our intent we always had line of patients for everything from mild bumps bruises and stuffy noses to more serious injuries and illnesses these could be treated from the backs of the hmmwvs but they were better done in secure compound arranged by the elders also it was key to have female medic available to treat the women and children otherwise they would be either reluctant or forbidden to seek medical help and they were usually the ones who needed it most as always we respected the local pecking order ie an elder with minor injury would expect to be seen before child with malaria if we did set up station for females and children we ensured that it was behind closed doors for their privacy also we always made sure our security squad was present and that all patients were kept orderly and were searched prior to entering although i believe the villagers would be able to spot terrorist act long before we could and would either tell us about it or act very scared and suspicious and then leave these operations were great for generating intelligence for later use many people were so happy to receive health care from us that they became very willing to assist in our fight against the qaeda also we had oneonone private opportunities to communicate with people who were very grateful for our helping them or literally saving their lives running firebase clinic this proved very effective as well and was not nearly as difficult or as dangerous as going out to conduct diminimus health care operations we ran clinic twice week in the mornings inside the amf perimeter but not within the firebase this also proved to demonstrate our help and support for the local population and helped bring us intelligence as people could come under the guise of seeking health care also they felt that having come to us for help information was their only means to pay us back using civil military operations to help gather intelligence anyone who is strictly combat arms soldier and doesnt see or feel the need for cmo or how cmo can help is unbelievably mistaken even those not convinced of the mantra of winning the hearts and minds must appreciate the most effective use of cmo intelligence gathering many ca psyop and intelligence soldier will contend that cmo personnel are not intelligence gatherers that intelligence gathering is not their mission and they are 100 percent correct but tactical commander can greatly benefit by gathering intelligence while helping cmo soldiers accomplish their mission while tactical humint team or an intelligence analyst must not be confused with cmo personnel cmo operations do greatly assist in commanders intelligencegathering campaign by providing allies ca and psyop personnel do their respective jobs and humint folks and analysts do theirs if the combatarms commander secures the cmo operations works with the team village commander toward the overall cmo campaign and works with analysts to help develop the intelligence preparation of the battlefield he can arrive at the same success we achieved at firebase shkin and the bermel valley cmo helps develop intelligence in various ways first and foremost cmo operations are ripe with opportunity for intelligence gathering whether the intelligence comes in the form of humint sigint or clandestine observation whenever we conducted major operation into village the enemy and the local 154center for army lessons learnedpopulation were interested during our movement and operation sigint could spike while in the village once we had secured it and established the friendly operation many villagers were willing to provide humint the team village commander and i would simply take notes and provide debrief to the analyst afterwards on the content of the village elders meeting our tactical humint team tht would work the crowd outside to gather intelligence from the young men who were not invited to the elders meeting during diminimus health care operations locals would be willing to provide intelligence in private during or after receiving care also during our early operations we received the line that the village would not want any humanitarian assistance because the qaeda would retaliate if they accepted help from the americans here hidden staybehind observation post would prove effective for seeing exactly who went into the village after our departure the second and more longterm impact of cmo on intelligence gathering is that of developing friendly relations with all the inhabitants of the region so they would come to the firebase and provide unsolicited information setting up venue for them to come or an excuse as was sometimes needed if someone wanted to provide intelligence without letting his acquaintances know provided an excellent source of humint collection this is why elders and others were always welcome to come to the firebase to discuss current and potential future cmo operations and also why we ran firebase clinic the dividends of our combined combat arms and cmo campaign in the bermel valley were obvious on 22 june 2003 when local who had come to the firebase for shura told us about qaedaemplaced mines in the road we followed him to the location dismounting before we reached the suspected mine site we found the qaeda ambush unprepared and initiated an attack killing or wounding the entire patrol gathering more intelligence about the qaedas techniques and walking away with friendly casualties instead of driving into coordinated iedrpg ambush as qaeda had intended conclusion the conclusion of this paper is simple we broke the mold and proved effective i hope others can learn from our success our special forces have done an amazing job in the global war on terrorism i dont know if anyone truly appreciates exactly what the 5th special forces group sfg actually accomplished during the liberation of afghanistan the afghans are fierce violent warring people who fight amongst themselves and their tribes and band together only to oppose an outside invader like the russians in 10 years the russians were unable to defeat afghanistan the 5th special forces group was able to take afghanistan in matter of weeks because they gave the victory to the people rather that being seen as an outside invader they were seen as big brother liberating force helping the northern alliance building on past assistance given to the mujahadden during the russian resistance and showing our support for them had we gone in with lot of strength rather than with the finesse shown by the 5th sfg we would have taken many more casualtiesoef handbook iii for official use only 155however our special forces are small element and they are spread thin their traditional role of foreign internal defense has been assumed by conventional forces throughout iraq training the iraqi civil defense corps now it is time to move lowintensity conflict and unconventional warfare over to the conventional side not only because there are not enough special forces to go around but also because conventional forces have more assets to find fix and finish the enemy fighting lowintensity conflict at the smallunitcompanysized level has proved to be very effective company commander much like an ateam commander can really get to know personalities terrain and enemy in an area he can engage the population and have much better lasting effect than that of battalion that air assaults in clears compounds for few days and then leaves what i have provided is only brief and very rough lessons learned for future company operations such as these by refocusing our efforts at the company level with these types of assets and these types of operations we can make tremendous impact in the global war on terror as an epilogue note my company was later tasked with securing the enormous 15000man logistical supply area anaconda in iraq here on numerous occasions soldiers under my command while guarding the entry control points ecps watched and recorded on our forward looking infra red or big brother system enemy forces conducting operations launching rockets or mortars or setting up ieds it burned us that we did not have the assets or availability to engage these forces our mission was to guard the ecps the tank unit colocated with us owned the ground outside if that area were the bermel valley we could have fixed them with our artillery and finished them with our qrf cas and aerial qrf we could have engaged the elders of the villages and the compounds surrounding the enemy activity to help us stop the militants we could have done so much but there was not one company commander with that kind of responsibility and those kinds of assets to deal with that kind of situation there on the ground in iraq the overall mission was so cumbersome that it was ineffective usually the outcome was report higher passing off of the dvd recording of the enemy activity and report of compound clearing with nothing found later the tactics that we b3504 pir employed at firebase shkin should be the model for winning this war in afghanistan iraq and wherever else we may go once the conflict reaches the lowintensity phase 156 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedannex ii introduction tragically and all too often soldiers die or are critically injured as result of the negligent discharge of weapons compounding this tragedy is the fact that many of these deaths and injuries are preventible invariably the unintentional or negligent discharge is result of failure to exercise the degree of care considered reasonable under the circumstances soldiers who know and are trained to standard fail to follow the standard because of attitude overconfidence andor haste leaders who know the standard do not enforce it deficiencies in direct unit command and higher command supervision techniques all contribute to the problem leaders must be ready willing and able to enforce army standards training shortcomings also add to the problem soldiers are often not trained to standard because of insufficient incorrect or nonexistent training on given task unclear impractical or nonexistent standards and procedures can be blamed for many negligent discharge incidents as the following article points out there is simple solution to this problem except through direct involvement of the chain of command starting at the first line supervisor leaders must ensure strict adherence to the proper unloading and clearing procedures lawrence h saul col fa director center for army lessons learned accidental or negligent discharge by sergeant first class raymond hamilton ground accident investigator us army safety center thousands of our soldiers have been and continue to be deployed to iraq afghanistan bosnia and kosovo not to mention korea and other locations throughout the world this being said i wonder how we as fighting force have missed out on combat soldiering combat soldiering is defined as using or developing skills peculiar to combat including receiving instructions or training in such skills this excludes classroom training i am taking great leap of faith and placing weapons handling procedures to include loading unloading weapons firing muzzle awareness and weapons maintenance all under combat soldiering in 17 years of combat arms training and deployments i have been bombarded with training on weapons handling from the moment you sign your weapon out of the unit arms room until you sign it back in youthe individual soldierare responsible for your weapon and its proper use the first thing i was taught andoef handbook iii for official use only 157which i now pass on to others is that when you receive weapon you ensure the weapon is unloaded ie cleared you pay attention to where the muzzle is pointed situational awareness and make sure the selector is always set on safe what sets the standard for cleared weapon you guessed itthe technical manual 10 for that particular type of weapon clearing procedures are nothing more than the weapons unloading procedures why then do soldiers inadvertently discharge weapons damaging equipment and injuring or killing others i have heard the following comments concerning this issue since my return from operation iraqi freedom soldiers dont handle loaded weapons enough in training to be comfortable with ammunition on deployments the experience level and maturity of individual soldiers and leaders is at its lowest at the section and squadron levelssometimes even the platoon levelbecause of rapid promotions we do not train as we fight lack of leadership in both the commissioned and noncommissioned officer corps soldiers are put into qualificationrange mentality as far as weapons safety these are few of the comments that stand out in my mind not excuses mind you but concerns expressed by deployed soldiers and their leadersleaders who are responsible for bringing them home safely as an army how do we address these issues remember that todays army is based on the total force concept which hinges on combining activeduty soldiers and army reservists and guardsmen to provide complete combat package while soldier mentality might be the key leadership experience is the cornerstone and selfdiscipline is must the moment you are issued ammunition you instantly assume higher level of personal responsibility i have noticed the change in my own mentality and the mentality of others you suddenly realize the outcome of any mistake could mean death to yourself or those around you or perhaps you are concerned only with being able to account for all of your ammunition come turnin time either way there is usually some change in your thinking ammunition then can be equated to an emotional stress inducer training is factor in this because you have more confidence in your ability if you actually have learned and used the proper procedures for your weapon different units have different levels of training and weapons unique to their mission ncos must be trained thoroughly on all weapons under their control or those their unit has in its inventory ncos are taught to educate themselves through research and selfmotivation lack of leader supervision often shows lack of knowledge on the subject leaders who are knowledgeable are always ready and willing to correct soldier or peer who is improperly performing certain task reviewing the appropriate technical and field manuals will provide the knowledge to train soldiers and rigidly enforce standards as leader can you properly function check load and unload all of your soldiers weapons officers 158 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedncos and soldiers must be familiar with weapons handling to spot check and ensure compliance with orders and guidance maturity and experience are not always one and the same we have young leaders in positions of responsibility who are technically and tactically proficient yet still lack maturity it is hard for soldiers to take these ncos seriously when they do not take their own positions seriously the army also is running into leaders who through fault of their own are promoted in their career fields while performing additional duty requirements such as recruiter or drill sergeant these individuals are then placed in leadership positions without having the needed practical experience when they go back to working in their primary mos they are often tasksaturated with the current optempo and have to learn some hard lessons our training centers do not provide realistic training for current base camp operations we dress the part in miles gear put magazine of blanks in our weapons and roll into the box we do not address weapons clearing procedures when entering base camps or unit tactical operations centers tocs to include clearing areas and procedures for crewserved weapons mounted on vehicles our units are left to come up with standard solution based on their leaderships experience level the qualificationrange mentality says that most personnel handle ammunition and weapons only well enough to meet military qualification requirementsand even then only under strict supervision because of that they have more mishaps in realworld scenarios is weapons discharge an act of negligence or an accident i guess the answer depends on whether youre on the muzzle end or the trigger end when the weapon fires i have looked at all of these hypotheses and can see two sides to each story yet as an nco i cannot ride the fence and point fingers i have to give advice and direction when and if required i request your input and suggestions to help solve one of the leading safety issues in our army today contact the
