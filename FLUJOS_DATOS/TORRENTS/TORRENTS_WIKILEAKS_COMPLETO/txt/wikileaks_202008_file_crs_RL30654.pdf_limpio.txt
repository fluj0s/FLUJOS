is scheduled to decide by fall 2000 whether the united states should begin deploying national missile defense nmd system this system could achieve initial operational capability by 2005 and would be designed to protect the united states from limited attack by intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms as currently envisioned the nmd system would operate as an integrated system that would rely on variety of sensors to detect and track incoming missiles one key program element is to upgrade the existing early warning radars ewr so that they can detect and track the incoming missiles sooner these upgrades include both hardware and software modifications to the existing radars the earlier detection and tracking allows shootlookshoot strategy ie sequential launching of multiple interceptors at each incoming missile to increase the probability of intercept this report provides background information and technical details of these planned upgrades as well as their cost and schedule nmd remains one of the most controversial national security issues an indepth analysis of the nmd program and the debate on it can be found in crs issue brief ib10034 although the ewr have not yet generated much discussion their upgrades may also become controversial members of congress could focus on the cost and technical capability of the upgrades on the legality of these upgrades under the 1972 antiballistic missile abm treaty or on the international implications of the radars that are located outside the united states this report will address the issues associated with the planned radar upgrades and the related options for congress the early warning radars planned for the nmd system include the three pave paws radars at cape cod massachusetts clear alaska and beale california and the two ballistic missile early warning system bmews radars at thule greenland denmark and fylingdales uk the current mission of these five radars is to provide the north american aerospace defense command norad with early warning and assessment of incoming icbms and slbms the upgraded radars will be designed to support the new nmd requirements without impacting their current norad mission the administration argues that upgrading current radars provides effective low cost sensors for the nmd mission by reusing about 80 of the equipment at the existing radar sites due to the radar operating frequency the upgraded radars could only provide accurate tracking information for few warheads accompanied by simple decoys thus the administration argues that these radar upgrades are for limited defense against limited attacks not total defense against more advanced icbm attackshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30654contents introduction 1 background 1 issues 2 early warning

sheet jn0005 january 2000 national missile defense and early warning radars background and issues introduction background the clinton administration is scheduled to decide by fall 2000 whether the united states should begin deploying national missile defense nmd system the system under consideration would likely include 100 landbased interceptor missiles currently planned for site in alaska according to the administration this system could achieve initial operational capability by 2005 and would be designed to protect the united states from limited attack by intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms the system is intended to protect the united states from emerging threats from nations such as north korea which according to intelligence reports is seeking to develop an icbm capability the current plan also envisions the possible deployment of more extensive systems around the end of the decade for protection against more advanced icbm threats at the present time the prospective nmd system architecture would operate as an integrat ed system that would rely on variety of sensors to detect and track incoming missiles this concept is shown in figure 1 space based sensors defense support program dsp satellites at first and eventually the spacebased infrared system sbirs high would detect the launch alert the ballistic missile commandcontrol center bmc3 of potential ballistic missile attack and then cue an upgraded early warning radar uewr to the incoming missile when the incoming missile comes within range the uewr would begin tracking the target missile to determine if it is threat upon threat confirmation the command center would direct the launch of groundbased interceptor and cue the xband radar the xband radar would then provide tracking data to the interceptor through inflight targeting updates iftu this tracking data would be used by the interceptor to maneuver close enough to the target so that the intercepto rs sensor could discriminate the warhead from possible decoys the interceptors sensors would provide the final course corrections so the interceptor could destroy the target1 launching multiple interceptors at each incoming missile shootlookshoot strategy is designed to increase the probability of successful intercept because the uewr could provide earlier detection track and classification these upgrades would

being replaced with pave paws system for increased reliability4 the pave paws equipment came from nonoperational site at eldorado texas the pave paws and the bmews radars perform similar tasks longrange early detection of ballistic missiles originally the bmews were for longer range icbm detection while the pave paws were for shorter range sea launched ballistic missile slbm detection however the 1980 bmews reliability modifications used pave paws type transmitreceive tr modules and antenna elements so that now both radars have similar performance5 the bmews radar still has slightly longer range due to its larger size and therefore more tr modules and antenna elements in each array face the current mission of these five radars is to provide the north american aerospace

discussions with the raytheon business development office june 2000planned upgrades the planned nmd system architec ture relies on earlier radar detection track and classification of targets to enable an earlier launch of its interceptors for the shootlookshoot strategy upgrades to the existing early warning radars are designed to improve the detection and track range by detecting objects closer to the radar horizon tracking them with improved accuracy and then sending the target position and velocity directly to the nmd command system the upgrades are designed to improve the radar performance in the following specific areas7 acquisition acquire warhead sized objects at longer range tracking provide precise track estimates to allow earlier interceptor launch object classification identify and distinguish between threatening and nonthreatening objects multiple missions perform the new nmd missions without degrading the current early warning and surveillance missions command and control provide realtime communications to the nmd command system in addition to current communication channels the major hardware modifications planned for the uewr include replacing the existing computers displays and communication equipment with offtheshelf equipment and developing new radar exciter receiver the radars exciter receiver provides the basic radar transmission signal and then receives and decodes the return signal the new exciter receiver would provide wider instantaneous bandwidth that allows improved signal processing this improved signal processing enables the finer range resolution required for improved tracking and object classification8 fortunately the increased instantaneous bandwidth still lies within the current allocated uhf bandwidth so that additional frequency allocation is not required the radar software would be rewritten to include the improved acquisition tracking and classification algorithms for small objects near the horizon the existing software is modular and would be rewritten in seven phases or builds9 the upgraded radar would then be able to search for different types of missiles distinguish hostile objects such as warheads from other objects and provide this data to the nmd control system using an improved communications system the administration argues that upgrading current radars provides effective low cost sensors for the nmd mission by reusing approximately 80 of the equipment at the existing radar sites the radiated peak and average power radar patterns and operating bandwidth of the upgraded radars remain unchanged from the current radars also there would be increase in the number of personnel operating the equipmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30654crs7 10 countermeasures union of concerned scientists mit security

are considered relatively low risk both technical risk and cost risk raytheon built the original pave paws radars and performed the phased array modifications to the bmews radars in the 1980s they have developed similar hardware and software upgrades raytheon is under contract for the initial hardware and software development if the upgrades are approved followon uewr contract funding would be required in april 2001 to meet the planned schedule the only major cost risk is break in contract funding which could delay the program and therefore increase the program cost one technical risk area is the available timeline to accomplish both the nmd target tracking requirements and at the same time maintain the current early warning and assessment surveillance for other possible incoming icbms current analysis shows that both these tasks can be accomplished in the available timeline but this is an area for continual monitoring abm treaty issues the plans to upgrade the existing early warning radars and to integrate these into the nmd system could raise questions about compliance with the 1972 abm treaty15 this treaty draws sharp distinction between abm radars which arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30654crs11 treaty neither the executive branch nor the senate have determined otherwise this report examines the planned radar upgrades in the context of the treaty 16 treaty between the united states of america and the union of soviet socialist republics on the limitation of antiballistic missile systems abm treaty article ii 1c reprinted in united states arms control and disarmament agency arms control and disarmament agreements texts and histories of the negotiations washington dc 1990 p 157 17 abm treaty article iii 18 abm treaty article vi 19 abm treaty article viradars constructed and deployed for an abm role or of type tested in an abm mode16 and early warning radars which simply provide warning of strategic ballistic missile attack the treaty states that abm radars or abm radar complexes must be located within the abm system deployment area which must have radius of more than 150 kilometers17 it also states that the parties are not to give radars other than abm radars capabilities to counter strategic offensive ballistic missiles and not to test radars other than abm radars in an abm mode18 essentially this means that nonabm radars ie those located outside the 150km radius of the permitted abm site cannot provide tracking and intercept information to the battle management network for the abm system and they cannot be tested in conjunction with the other components of the abm system but this is precisely what the united states intends to do with the upgraded early warning radars this issue will have to be resolved at some point if the abm treaty remains in force second treaty issue that might come up as the united states upgrades the radars in greenland and great britain is the treatys provision that future early warning radars must be deployed on the periphery of the nations territory and must be oriented outwards19 because the radars at thule and fylingdales were in place prior to the signing of the abm treaty they were grandfathered into the treaty and are not considered to be treaty violation when the united states modified the radars in the late 1980s the soviet union objected on the grounds that the modifications and new construction altered the facilities enough to create new radars that according to the treaty could not be located anywhere except on the periphery of the united states however because the modifications were intended to improve the reliability and operations of the radars and did not alter their capabilities the united states argued that the radars remained consistent with the terms of the abm treaty the two nations addressed and resolved this issue in the standing consultative commission scc body established by the abm treaty to address compliance issues the united states could take similar position this time and argue that even though the upgrades alter the capabilities of the radars arguably prohibited by the treaty the facilities remain where they were prior to the signing of the abm treaty and therefore remain consistent with the treaty russia is likely to question whether the upgrades are enough to create future early warning radars and the two nations could again address this issue in the scc third abm treaty issue raised by the plans to upgrade the early warning radars comes from the treatys provision stating that each party undertakes not tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30654crs12 20 abm treaty article ix 21 this document was obtained by the bulletin of the atomic scientists from sources in moscow the text of the protocol along with us analysis and talking points for the discussions were published in the bulletin of the atomic scientists and posted on the magazines internet site see httpwwwbullatomsciorg 22 it is not clear that the upgrades alone would violate the treaty if the united states continued to use these radars only in an early warning roletransfer to other states and not to deploy outside its national territory abm systems or their components limited by this treaty20 if the radars at thule and fyingdales are upgraded and integrated into the us nmd system then the united states will have deployed abm systems or components outside of its national territory the clinton administration has recognized that its plans to upgrade the early warning radars so that they can be integrated into the nmd system would be inconsistent with the current terms of the abm treaty it has raised this issue in its discussions with russia on possible modifications to the treaty in the protocol that the administration presented to the russians in january 2000 the united states reportedl proposed that the united states and russia be permitted to enable strategic ballistic missile attack warning radars in existence on december 1 1999 to perform abm radar functions to support the limited territorial missile defense system21 in other words the united states realizes that it would need to alter the treatys ban on giving nonabm radars abm roles and its ban on deploying these components outside its national territory to accommodate the upgrades to the early warning radars russia has thus far refused to discuss specific proposals for modifications to the abm treaty either to permit the united states to deploy an nmd system in alaska or to include its early warning radars in the architect ure for that nmd system if russia does not agree to these modifications then the united states would violate the abm treaty if it completed the upgrades to the early warning radars and tested these radars in conjunction with tests of other components of the nmd system22 because other elements of the us nmd program could lead to conflicts with the abm treaty at an earlier date than the upgrades to the early warning radars it is possible that the united states and russia would have resolved their differences or that the united states would have decided to withdraw from the treaty prior to the date on which the radar upgrades violated the treaty on the other hand it is possible that russia might eventually agree to permit the deployment of limited nmd site in alaska without agreeing to alter the treatys ban on the use of early warning radars in an abm mode in that case the united states would have to decide whether to proceed with the upgrades and violate the treaty or to cancel the upgrades and accept less capable nmd system international issues the upgrades planned for the early warning radars at fylingdales and thule not only raise abm treaty compliance issues but may also

denmark and great britain before it modified the early warning radars on their territories and included the radars in the us nmd system23 some officials in both nations have voiced opposition to the us nmd system in early august the house of commons foreign affairs committee issued report that outlined british concerns with the us plans the report stated that the united states cannot necessarily assume unqualified cooperation from great britain the report specifically noted that the committee was concerned about the negative effect that nmd deployment might have on arms control efforts24 officials in denmark have expressed similar concerns they issued statement in february stating the government continues to desire that the use of the thule radar does not contravene international agreements in force25 the challenge in both countries with regard to the radar upgrades will be to balance domestic concerns with their us partnership the united states continues to press this issue

until other alternative early warning systems can be developed options for congress at present cost and technical challenges for the radar upgrades appear less controversial than abm treaty issues and international issues the latter two issues could spark more detailed and complex public discussion on the planned radar upgrades congress has not directly addressed the radar upgrades and their

treaty issues should not affect plans to upgrade the radars either because they believe the united states should withdraw from the abm treaty or because they believe that the abm treaty lapsed after the demise of the soviet union if the governments in great britain and denmark remain skeptical about us plans for nmd and continue to question the implications of the upgrades to the radars on their territories the issues raised by the radar upgrade effort could receive more attention in congress and could generate discussion in the next administration on altering the plans for both the radar upgrades and the nmd program however the united states could operate the limited nmd system without the radars at thule and fylingdales many analysts believe that the three uewrs in the united states would provide adequate coverage for missile attacks from east asia although these three radars would not be sufficient to track and identify possible missile attacks from the middle east another option for the end of the decade would be spacebased infraredradar system sbirslow which would provide spaced based early warning track and identify capability while some analysts may believe the
