security agency nsa program designed to collect and analyze information on telephone calling patterns within the united states have raised interest in the means by which the governme nt may collect such information the factual information available in the public domain with respect to any such alleged program is limited and in some instances inconsistent and the application if at all of any possibly relevant statutory provisions to any such program is likely to be very fact specific inquiry it is possible that any information provided to the nsa from the telephone service providers was provided in response to request for information not founded on statutory basis if this were the case such request would not necessarily be limited by the statutory structures discussed below but in some instances depending upon the facts involved might expose the telephone companies to some civil remedies or criminal sanctions in additi on request not founded upon statutory scheme would appear to lack means of compelling pr oduction of the information requested this would seem to be consistent with the statement in the usa today article of may 11 2006 that one of the companies refused to comply with nsas request for calling detail records while at least one other company appears to have complied numerous lawsuits have been filed by civil liberties groups against several telecommunications companies on behalf of their customers and subscr ibers for their alleged cooperation with the nsa program that have harmed the plaintiffs constitutional and statutory rights one case hepting v att corp was filed in january 2006 and is based in part on evidence of participation in the nsa program by the defendant provided by former tt employee whereas all the other lawsuits were filed after the publication of the usa today article and are based largely on the factual allegations made therein these cases originally filed throughout the country have since been transferred to the northern district of california and assigned to us district judge vaughn r walker for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in re national security agency telecommunications records litigation mdl1791 in may 2006 the united states government moved to intervene as defendant in the hepting case and moved to dismiss the action based on the state secrets privilege in july 2006 judge walker allowed hepting to proceed by rejecting the governments state secrets claim the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit heard arguments in the interl ocutory appeal of the district courts ruling on august 15 2007 in which the government again requested that the case be dismissed on the basis that litigating the case would reveal highly classified information that would cause the nation grievous injury as of august 20 2007 decision by the appellate court has been announced this report summarizes statutory authorities regarding access by the government for either foreign intelligence

regarding an alleged national security agency nsa program designed to collect and analyze information on telephone calling patterns within the united states have raised interest in the means by which the government may collect such information according to the information in the usa today news story from may 11 2006 the nsa is alleged to have sought and obtained records of telephone numbers called and received from millions of telephones within the united states from three telephone rvice providers while fourth had refused to provide such records 1 several days after the publication of that news article two of the three service providers originally reported to have provided calling records denied that they provided such records2 the usa toda article indicated that names or addresses were obtained in connection with these telephone calls nor were the contents of these telephone calls sought or obtained the usa today story also stated that one telephone service provider had refused to provide the nsa access to such information because of concerns about the legality of such disclosures the usa today story indicated that this information was being compiled in database and being used for pattern analysis the president in his weekly radio address on may 13 2006 while discussing his nomination of general michael v hayden to head the central intelligence agency has responded to the news reports of nsas alleged data mining activities this week new claims have been made about other ways we are tracking down qaeda to prevent attacks on america it is important for americans to understand that our activities strictly target qaeda and its known affiliates qaeda is our enemy and we want to know their plans the intelligence activities i have authorized are lawful and have been briefed to appropriate members of congress both republican and democrat the privacy of all americans is fiercely protected in all our activities the government does not listen to domestic phone calls without court approval we are not trolling through the personal lives of millions of innocent americans our efforts are focused on links to qaeda terrorists and its affiliates who want to harm the american people americans expect their government to do everything in its power under our laws and constitution to protect them and their civil liberties that is exactly what we are doing and so far we have been successful in preventing another attack on our soil the factual information available in the public do main with respect to any such alleged program is limited and in some instances inconsistent and the application if at all of any possibly relevant statutory provisions to any such program is likely to be very fact specific inquiry it is possible that any information provided to the nsa from the telephone service providers was provided in response to request for information not founded on statutory basis if this were the case such request would not necessarily be limited by the statutory structures discussed below but in some instances depending upon the facts involved might expose the telephone companies to some civil remedies or criminal sanctions in addition request not founded upon statutory scheme would appear to lack means of compelling production of the information 1 leslie cauley nsa has massive database of americans phone calls 3 telecoms help government

employee whereas all the other lawsuits were filed after the publication of the usa today article and are based largely on the factual allegations made therein on august 9 2006 pursuant to 28 usc 1407 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred 17 civil actions that were pending throughout the country including hepting to the northern district of california and assigned them to judge walker for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in re national security agency telecommunications records litigation mdl1791 another 26 cases were treated as potential tagalong actions under the multidistrict litigation rules 4 the panel of five federal trial and appellate court judges found that all these class actions share factual and legal questions regarding alleged government surveillance of telecommunications activity and the participation in or cooperation with that surveillance by individual telecommunications companies and thus centralization of the cases is necessary in order to eliminate duplicative discovery prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings particularly with respect to matters involving national security and conserve the resources of the parties their counsel and the judiciary 5 on may 13 2006 the united states government moved to intervene as defendant in the hepting case and moved to dismiss the action or in the alternative for summary judgment

purposes to information related to telephone calling patterns or practices where pertinent it also discusses statutory prohibitions against accessing or disclosing such information along with re levant exceptions to those prohibitions g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the supreme court in smith v maryland 442 us 735 1979 in pen register case has held that there is fourth amendment protected reasonable expectation of privacy in records of telephone calls in the hands of third party providers where contents of those calls is not intercepted the fourth amendment to the united states constitution guarantees the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the pl ace to be searched and the persons or things to be seized 10 whether the use of pen register is search and seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment determines if the government in compliance with the constitution must secure warrant or court order prior to its installation in 1979 the united states supreme court decided this question in smith v maryland11 holding that the fourth amendment does not prohibit the use of pen registers without warrant writing the majority opinion joined by four other justices justice harry blackmun drew distinction between the acquisition of contents of telephone communications using electronic listening devices which the court in katz v united states12 had deemed to be search under the fourth amendment and the capture of electronic impulses that identify the numbers dialed on telephone using pen register device according to the majority in smith it is constitutionally significant difference that pen registers do not record the contents of communications in contrast to the listening devices employed in katz 13 the court explained that the fourth amendment does not apply to the use of pen registers because individuals do not have legitimate expectation of privacy against invasion by government action concerning the numbers dialed into telephone system all telephone users realize that they must convey phone numbers to the telephone company since it is through telephone company switching equipment that their calls are completed all subscribers realize moreover that the phone company has facilities for making permanent records of the numbers they dial for they see list of their longdistance toll calls on their monthly bills in fact pen registers and similar devices are routinely used 9 karl vick judges skeptical of statesecrets claim wash post august 16 2007 at a04 10 us const amend iv 11 442 us 735 1979 12 389 us 347 1967

detecting fraud and preventing violations of law14 the court stated that telephone customers by voluntarily conveying phone numbers to the telephone company and exposing that information to its equipment in the ordinary course of business assume the risk that the company may disclose such information to law enforcement 15 because there is actual or legitimate expectation of privacy in the numbers dialed from telephone the installation and use of pen register is not search requiring warrant under the fourth amendment the court ruled16 the dissenting opinions in smith believed that telephone numbers dialed from phone are entitled to the same constitutional protection that telephone conversations receive under katz because such numbers are not without content they reveal the identities of the persons and the places called and thus reveal the most intimate details of persons life 17 furthermore the dissenters objected to the majoritys characterization that the use of telephone involves an assumption of risk on the part of the customer that telephone dialing information might be disclosed to the government assumption of risk generally requires there to have been choice to engage in the activity and as practical matter individuals have realistic alternative to the use of telephone 18 there are however number of statutes enacted since 1979 which both permit access by the government for foreign intelligence or law enforcement purposes to information relating to telephone numbers dialed from or received by particular telephone number as well as duration and usage and which impose limitations as to how such information may be accessed and under what circumstances it may be used some of these statutes also provide criminal penalties for violations of their provisions and provide civil remedies to those adversely impacted by such violations in addition the communications act of 1934 as amended addresses protections to customer proprietary network information and provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions or implementing regulations g21g157g138g157g158g157g152g155g162g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561
