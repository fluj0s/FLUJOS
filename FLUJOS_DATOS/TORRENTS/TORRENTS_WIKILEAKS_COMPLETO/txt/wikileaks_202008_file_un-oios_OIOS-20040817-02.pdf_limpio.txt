received the offices accepted most of the recommendations made and are in the process of implementing them overall assessment oios assessed the unhcr operation in afghanistan as above average overall it was well run and although weaknesses in the application of internal controls at implementing partners were identified and performance monitoring should f urther improve the weaknesses concerned were not sufficiently critical to comprom ise the overall system of internal control programme management in afghanistans undocumented and cash economy the use of money traders and authenticity of supporting documentation still poses major fin ancial risk to unhcr unhcr offices should direct capacity building initi atives to improve the quality of project records at implementing partners accountability at the ministry of repatriation mor r offices remains weak funding of material and cash assistances with this partner sho uld be limited to the maximum extent possible icmc left afghanistan and the project records for t he 2003 subprojects totalling us 19 million are longer available locally performance monitoring should improve and matched w ith financial monitoring oios

introduction 1 between july 2003 and may 2004 the oios re sident audit team based in islamabad pakistan conducted second cycle of audits of the unhcr afghan operation the audits were conducted in accordance with the standards for the professional practice of internal auditing promulgated by the institute of internal auditors and adopted by the internal audit services of the united nations organizations oios reviewed the activities of 28 of its implementing partners and the activities of the unh cr office of the chief of mission ocm in kabul and its suboffices so in jalalaba d mazarisharif kandahar kabul herat and gardez 2 the first cycle of audits and reviews of th unhcr afghan operation was conducted between april 2002 and june 2003 the audits focus ed on 2002 projects covering expenditure of us 876 million at various stages f implementation in its 2003 audit report oios had assessed the unhcr operation in afghanista n as average it was adequately run but key controls were lacking at partners and in pa rticular in the procurement functions and financial systems unhcrs procurement procedures also needed to be improved and considerable work was still required to track and r ecord assets 3 since the beginning of the 2002 over 3 mil lion afghans returned to afghanistan whereas 2002 was marked as the year of massive repa triation the main focus in 2003 was on reintegration activities such as shelter water nd income generation 4 more than 90000 beneficiaries received she lter assistance and 6000 water points 8000 baths and 22000 latrines completed in the af ghan operation in 2002 and 2003 under income generation activities focused on smallscal irrigation projects rehabilitation of access roads canal and karez cleaning and micro in come generation and cash for work activities the latter included poultry in the nor th tailoring and carpentry in the east peanut oil and wool spinning for idps in the south vocati onal training for woman in the west and welding workshops in the central region 5 seven audit observations detailing the audi t findings and recommendations were issued directly to the heads of office the replie s received are reflected as appropriate in this report ocm and its suboffices have accepted and implement ed most of the audit recommendations ii audit objectives 6 the main objectives of the audits were to valuate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of

cm kabul and its sos in jalalabad mazarisharif kandahar kabul herat and gardez w ith administrative budgets totalling us 225 million for 2002 us 95 million was disb ursed since oios previous audits conducted during 2002 and us 217 million for 200 3 us 17 million was disbursed at the time of oios various audits and assets with an acquisition value of us 18 million and current value of us 10 million the number of sta ff working for the unhcr operation in afghanistan was 870 in 2003 this included staff on regular posts national professional officers and united nations volunteers 11 the auditors also reviewed the activities of the government implementing partner morr to assist with the capacity building initiativ that included an assessment of the functional areas at selected offices responsible fo r the implementation of subprojects 12 external audit firms were engaged to audit the 2002 subprojects and most of the audit certificates of partners reviewed by oios included qualified audit opinions the qualifications were scope limitations that prevente d the external auditors to obtain adequate audit evidence in an undocumented and cash economy at the date of oios audits most of the independent external auditors submitted externa l audit certificates and management letters to unhcr and the partners unhcr was awaiting comments from the partners on the issues raised in management letters iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners unhcr funds with money traders 13 local partners continue keeping their inst alments received from unhcr with money traders who are persons and not legal entities and in most cases unknown to unhcr there are audit trails of transactions and traders are not accountable for unhcr funds in their custody in the absence of an adequate banking sys tem in afghanistan unhcr and the partners accepted the associated risks as given there are developments and improvements in the banking system and oios is of the opinion th at partners should be encouraged to make use of the afghanistan bank or other commercial b anks such as standard chartered bank recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission in afghani stan and its suboffices should request local implementi ng partners to consider opening bank accounts with ban ks in afghanistan rec 01 b capacity building and engagement of partners 14 due to unhcr afghanistans continued capac ity building initiatives the financial accounting and reporting of most local partners imp roved unhcr engaged more than one hundred partners and in most regions sos were rest ricted to partners that operated within specific areas and engaged as many partners as poss ible to ensure that programme targets are met 15 notwithstanding the efforts of unhcr some partners continued with rudimentary accounting systems and did not improve their intern controls the afghan programme is reducing and suboffices are now in better positi on to select partners on more concrete information past experiences and findings of exter nal and internal auditors from 2005 the selection of partners should include an assessment of partners financial systems procedures and internal controls prior to engagement recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission in afghani stan and its suboffices should assess partners financi systems procedures and internal controls prior to entering into sub agreements in 2005 rec 02 c authenticity of supporting documentation 16 oios found instances where partners submit ted questionable quotations for contracts supplies and vehicle rentals of which some had not able financial implications to unhcr sro entered into two contracts with company to dr ill hundred and seven wells in the herat province at the cost of us 126000 through q uotations the quotations were us 35 us 38 and us 40 per meter of drilling for both exercises the same vendors quoted the same prices with the unsuccessful vendors quoting the same for gravelling blaking and apron these quotations were further questionable as sro paid 40 per cent more per meter than what the other partners in the province did t he additional cost to unhcr was estimated at us 50000 17 vehicle rent by partners was positive ternative to the high cost if unhcr provided the vehicles but there is risk that par tners or their staff could rent from related parties in the absence of registration or other d ocumentation that provide proof of ownership it is impossible to ascertain the regula rity of the transactions but oios noted substantial differences in rates intersos paid us 1500 per month double the us 750 paid by icmc according to icmc drivers salary is us 250 and running costs us 300 in the case of intersos it leaves profit margin of us 950 which is more than double the amount provided for as salary to national progr amme manager under unhcr sub projects 18 in generally undocumented and cash econo my it is understandably difficult for sos to ascertain the adequacy of supporting evidence to substantiate the validity of transactions especially contracts in areas where contractors are limited sos undertook to benchmark costs when assessing proposals to act as ceiling am ounts in an effort to reduce the risk of being overcharged such benchmarking of prices to act as ceiling am ounts in subproject budgets could substantially reduce financial implic ations to unhcr d record keeping in projects 19 oios found the lack of project records as the main weakness at partners especially in the water and sanitation and incomegeneration sectors most partners did not record actual data of wells baths latrines and income ge neration activities such as road works karezes and constructions without actual data on projects unhcr cannot ascertain as to whether partners completed projects in accordance w ith plans or proposals andor compare the cost with bill of quantities to determine i f unhcr obtained value for money recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission in afghani stan and its suboffices should focus its capacity build ing initiatives at partners on record keeping in projec ts especially the recording of actual data in income g eneration projects rec 03 staff costs in subprojects 20 partners keep records of payments to staff but do not maintain consolidated payroll data neither do they submit the required schedule s to unhcr that indicate the staff members involved in the subprojects and the remune ration paid to each of the staff members that ties up with staff costs reported in their fin ancial reports some partners have many staff members in unhcr subprojects but did not submit s taff lists to unhcr and do not have consolidated data on numbers positions and remuner ation paid and therefore the expenditures charged to unhcr cannot be related to the provisions in subproject budgets 21 oios noted discrepancies in the staff cost s charged to unhcr subprojects that indicate need for consolidated information from p artners irc charged unhcr sub project with remuneration to staff members that wer not engaged in the subproject and care charged staff costs to unhcr on shared cost basis that was not in accordance with the subproject budget thus far unhcr afghanist ans efforts to obtain the schedules from partners were not successful recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission in afghani stan and its suboffices should request all partners to submit list of staff engaged in future subprojects that should be attached to subagreements and submit schedules with their f inal 2004 financial spmrs that indicate per staff member th amount of salaries and other entitlements paid the total amount of staff costs as per the schedule should tieup with the amount reported in the financial spmrs rec 04 f oios audit of morr 22 in an effort to assist the capacity buildi ng initiatives oios reviewed financial and administrative areas at selected morr offices respo nsible for implementation the financial management of the transport component that accounte d for more than 60 per cent of the total subprojects was well managed by so herat and comm ended by oios 23 notwithstanding unhcrs initiatives to str engthen accountability morr offices made limited progress in record keeping including financial the offices lacked internal controls and asset management remained weak cash instalments from unhcr were kept at private houses or at locations unknown to unhcr in kabul the morr office could not present supporting documents for most of the select ed expenditures of its 2003 subproject with reported expenditures at the date of the audit totalling us 123000 there was in general lack of internal controls to ensure that transactions are properly authorised recorded and reported also and although purchases were limited morr offices did not follow basic procurement procedures that resulted i n uneconomical purchases 24 furthermore morrs office in herat entere d into construction contract for new office of us 48000 without informing unhcr and ex hausting the subproject budget provision of us 20000 for rehabilitation work at the existing office the office in farah also started the construction of new office premise s with an estimated cost of us 30000 oios noted limited construction work but the us 5 000 was utilised that unhcr provided for rehabilitation work at their existing office the management of both offices could not indicate how morr will fund the remainder of the co nstruction work but there was an expectation that unhcr will fund the constructions 25 so herat duly followedup on each finding that oio s reported and was in the process to take corrective steps especially by inc reasing financial monitoring ocm kabul is in the process to engage an external firm to pro vide training in financial management and record keeping oios supports this initiative but remain of the op inion that an improvement in record keeping and the strengthening of internal controls is not enough to ensure accountability over unhcr funds ocm kabul should match subproject budget provisions with upfront agreed activities and increase financ ial monitoring the subproject budget for 2003 was us 250000 against which morr only report ed expenditures of us 123000 by may 2004 whereas ocm kabul paid us 172000 in in stalments recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission in afghani stan should limit provisions in morr subproject budgets to provide only for upfront agreed activities and inc rease financial monitoring to enhance accountability over unhcr funds rec 05 g review of partners completed activities for 20 02 26 from july to october 2003 oios reviewed t wentyone 2002 subprojects with expenditures totalling us 13 million that were imp lemented by 16 partners with the exception of icmc guardians and vara reasonable ssurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disburs ed in accordance with sub agreements 27 icmcs records were unorganised and the pporting documentation not properly filed for subproject with reported expenditures of us 200000 so kandahar informed oios that icmc reorganised its records and that th reported expenditures were verified by its programme section guardians and vara could not present supporting documentation for reported expenditures totalling u s 220000 and us 179000 respectively the supporting documentation was eventually submitt ed to so kandahar that found it adequate h review of partners completed activities for 20 03 28 irc implemented subprojects in three regi ons ie gardez jalalabad and mazari sharif the kabul office performed the accounting function and prepared the financial reports oios found the general ledger and final subproject monitoring report of at least one location gardez inaccurate and incomplete t here were missallocations unauthorised charges and distortions in the recording of transac tions the discrepancies were of such an extent that oios suggested the resubmission of the final subproject monitoring report 29 two locations ie gardez and jalalabad included agency operational support costs totalling us 700000 that represents 38 per cent of the total subproject budgets according to ircs funding structure at the date of the audit unhcrs subprojects accounted for 25 per cent of the total funding of i rc substantially less than 38 per cent unhcr suboffices negotiated the subproject budget s separately and each provided for overhead costs with related risk of double fundin g ircs overhead costs 30 also and as umbrella ngo irc charged u nhcr with additional overhead costs for coordinating partners in the shelter secto r for example irc paid an administrative fee of us 40 per shelter to the partners and charg ed the costs to unhcr cm kabul will coordinate the negotiations of subproject budgets between sos and irc to avoid double funding of ircs overhead costs 31 icmc left afghanistan in early 2004 for t he 2003 subproject icmc reported expenditures totalling us 19 million to unhcr ho wever project records are longer available in afghanistan for verification given th amount involved unhcr should arrange for an external audit of these subprojects recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname in consultation wit h dfsm should arrange an independent external audit of sub projects 03sbafgrp334 h and 03sbafgrp331 g total ling us 19 million implemented by the international catholic m igration commission for which project records are availa ble locally rec 06 b other programme issues water points 32 dacaar unhcr afghanistans main partner in the water sector completed more than 30000 water points in afghanistan over t he years of which 2700 were under unhcr subprojects in 2002 and 2003 33 the provisions in the subproject budgets were per well method when contractors are used whereas costing was per category of expenditu re method when partner does not use contractors therefore the provisions in subproje ct budgets could not be related to actual costs incurred dacaar overspent its 2003 unhcr bproject budget of us 117 million by us 163000 of which us 121000 74 pe r cent on wells ocm kabul disallowed the overspending 34 until mid 2003 dacaar followed its own st rategies and unhcrs participation was limited in the site selection process in ja lalabad and until unhcr participated in the selection process in august 2002 dacaar drilled an d deepened 160 wells under unhcr subproject in districts where there were return ees and reported 32 wells as completed that were not completed when unhcr queried this dacaar merely installed hand pumps on existing wells to account for the discrepancy so jalalabad took action by more actively participating in the site selection processes 35 dacaar maintains database on wells and h as maintenance program in place this database is also available to the ministry of rural and rehabilitation development mrrd that is managing national water programs 36 since 2002 other partners completed 3300 of the total 6000 wells 55 per cent they did not record technical data and therefore the dat is not available for future planning exercises of the mrrd or for maintenance purposes 37 some partners were costly acf completed only 17 out of 70 planned water points in sarepul and mazar in 2002 the total reported an d verified expenditure to complete the water points was us 103000 that is five times the estimated cost 38 the salaries paid by araa in the western r egion to make rings for shallow wells were triple the cost of rings if purchased according to araa the produced rings were of better quality than purchased ones araa also paid us 58000 on drilling contracts for the drilling of fiftyfive wells in ghor the lowest q uote was us 175 per meter for 30 meters of drilling that is reasonable price but the cts entered into for the drilling of 60 meters thereby doubling the contract price questionable was the us 40 per meter paid by sro in the same region 39 suboffices undertook to benchmark drilling costs nd in particular so herat established benchmark of us 15 to 18 per meter u p to 35 meters using unicefs expertise but there are obvious factors to take int consideration especially the strata noted however is that in both cases araa and sro the procedures followed to enter into the contracts could be irregular sro presented qu estionable quotations and araa doubled the drill meters in the contracts b shelter programme 40 unhcr provided good guidance to partners ngaged in the shelter programme the number of beneficiaries to be assisted was mainly d etermined by returnee numbers and considering the high return rate to afghanistan the allocation of units was naturally not an easy task that was further complicated by unhcrs l imited programme capacity to effectively participate in all beneficiary selectio ns 41 oios could not base its results of site vi sits on representative samples of selected shelters because of the difficulty to locate the sh elters some shelters are also not numbered the shelters visited in the south western norther n and south eastern regions were generally better occupied than those in the eastern and central regions oios did not find cases where the partners did not provide the shelte r materials and cash assistance to the beneficiaries and the assistance except for sro w as well documented cases were noted where the cash assistance was paid but the shelters andor latrines were not completed also and except for the kuskirabat sangi district in t he western region and mir bacha kot district in the central region the beneficiaries in general used all the shelter materials provided to them 42 sros records of shelter and cash assistan ce were incomplete sro also provided further seven additional beams per beneficiary as i t reckoned that the unhcr procured beams were of bad quality and could break durin g field visit to kuskirabat sangi oios noted that sro provided the additional beams nly after the construction of the shelters was completed they were therefore not used by the beneficiaries 43 in nutshell and as per oioss findings the programme sections gave good guidance to the partners were adequately involved in the be neficiary selection processes and ensured that materials and cash assistance are provided bu t were understaffed to visit enough of the more than 90000 constructed shelters ocm kabul engaged the services of shelter monitor to improve shelter monitoring from 2004 this will contribute towards more structured and effective monitoring strategy but t he question of capacity at suboffices to obtain the desired coverage during visits remains recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission in afghani stan should match future monitoring strategies with capa city at programme sections at suboffices to ensure adequat coverage during shelter visits rec 07 c incomegeneration and cash for work projects 44 in october 2003 oios questioned the feasi bility of several incomegeneration projects in which unhcr invested significant funds such as the peanut oil factory in the zhare dasht settlement and the wool spinning revolv ing projects in the southern region the direct costs only for the peanut oil production amo unted to more than us 600000 the monthly labour cost to shell the peanuts was us 24 000 per month it is revolving fund and oios calculated that the minimum selling price as us 316 per litre if the project is to be feasible cadg sold oil so kandahar undertook to determine the sustainabil ity of the revolving project and the possibility to transf er ownership to the beneficiary population zhare dasht is temporary settlement and therefore the possible transfer to beneficiaries is questionable considering the cost of the project ocm kabul should address the matter recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission in afghani stan should decide on the future of the peanut factory p roject in zhare dasht that cost more than us 600000 as of november 2003 with return on investment so far rec 08 45 the cost of wool purchased in wool spinnin g revolving projects totalled us 500000 in the southern region but partners sold spin w ool as suggested by oios so kandahar assessed the feasibility of the project as revolving project and subsequently discontinued it from 2004 46 isra implemented crop production project in eastern afghanistan in 2002 totalling us 385000 in which it provided 12000 beneficiari with maize and wheat seeds fertilisers toolkits and training there were inc onsistencies in the distribution of maize seeds in the first phase of the project including allega tions that the seeds did not reach the intended beneficiaries 47 distribution was better controlled during the second phase but oios assessed so jalalabads overall monitoring of the project as in adequate isra was also not in position to provide adequate explanations during the audit i n july 2003 with its agriculture engineers finding it difficult to locate the villages in whic h the beneficiaries were located upon oioss request isra did submit report on wheat producti on that included statistics on production that so jalalabad undertook to verify until such time the outcome and sustainability f the project is unknown 48 brrardu made 1500 windows and 750 doors in the central region for the shelter programme the cost of the materials only totalled us 89000 that was 50 per cent more than the purchase price of the items in kabul sar s paid us 43000 for materials to make 500 doors and 1000 windows the material cost alo ne was twelve per cent more than the purchase cost of door and window with glass so kabul undertook to review and suggested central purchasing by ocm kabul oios supports this suggestion d financial and performance monitoring 49 financial monitoring except for so mazar isharif was adequate but not adequately matched with performance monitoring project control at ocm kabul assisted national staff at so mazarisharif to improve financial mo nitoring 50 given the security constraints large numb er of projects in remote areas and limited capacity of the programme sections performance mon itoring was in most cases based on ad hoc missions that were inadequate to obtain the nec essary coverage of activities measure performance and link performance to financial monit oring noted however was that quick impact projects qips under the short format suba greements used in the central so kabul and eastern so jalalabad regions were be tter monitored than projects under the long format subagreements it is difficult to link the expenditures reported i n financial subproject monitoring report to an individual proj ect because the actual bill of quantities ie staff costs materials transport costs etc incurred cannot be related to an individual project 51 oios found that the short format agreement and contracts as legal instruments address the major concerns of qips especially in r espect of bill of quantities better control over actual delivery within specified per iod reduced paper work and facilitate better financial and performance monitoring process from 2004 unhcr ceased the use of the short format although this is unfortunate u nhcr afghanistan substantially reduced qips in 2004 c supply management procurement 52 oios noted substantial improvement in th procurement processes of the supply chain at ocm kabul in particular entering into frame agreements that resulted in better and faster procurement process and purchases were m ore economical 53 compared to 2002 when partners were not pplying appropriate procurement procedures and monitoring by unhcr suboffices was limited oios noted positive development delegation of procurement to partners has been significantly reduced especially for shelter materials throughout the audits of 20 02 subprojects oios had noted the difficulties that partners experienced with supplie rs and the noncompliance of partners with unhcr procurement procedures that resulted in uneco nomical purchases intersos purchased windows and doors totalling us 900000 f rom an importexport firm after the originally selected suppliers failed to deliver an d paid us 50000 more than local procurement according to so jalalabad prices 54 there are activities such as construction activities in which partners were still required to procure materials in 2003 for these ctivities oios found it difficult to obtain benchmark amounts but noted substantial difference s in prices paid by partners for some items differences as much as double for construct ion stone 16 per cent for cement and 10 per cent for steel bars more problematic is the f ailure of partners to keep proper stock records for construction activities sro purchased construction materials totalling us 168000 in 2003 without keeping stock records or ven procurement register 55 further weakness noted is the tracking of procured shelter materials gtz transported the materials to the partners the pa rtners recorded distribution to individual beneficiaries but did not keep stock records and t herefore consolidated account of items distributed by the partners and materials on hand i s not available recommendation head2right the unhcr suboffices in afghanistan should reques t its implementing partners in the shelter programme to k eep stock records for shelter materials received distr ibuted and on hand starting 2004 rec 09 b logistics 56 the main logistical activity remains the t ransport of shelter materials and nfis across afghanistan and in 2003 gtz transported more than 30000 metric tons across afghanistan at the cost of us 700000 and engaged transporters th rough bidding exercises that were carried out on sixmonthly basis and resulted in commendable reductions in transport prices since the beginning of the operation 57 the rates paid to contractors engaged by the partners to distribute shelter materials to beneficiaries differed substantially as much as 6 times between the regions and as much as 4 times between partners within the regions in some provinces us 10 per shelter was paid whereas as high as us 70 were paid in others quo tations obtained by partners were in some cases exactly the amount provided for in the subpr oject budget 58 oios is of the opinion that suboffices sh ould have obtained advice from gtz on reasonable transport rates assuming that gtz truc ks transported materials for only 15 shelters per truck and disregarding the distance gtz transp orted mainly long haul whereas implementing partners transported only within distr icts in most cases short distances ie 40 km oios calculated the average transportation co st at us 30 per shelter given that some implementing partners paid as much as us 70 per sh elter it appears that there is potential for significant cost savings so herat noted the observation but cautioned that gtz rates were not comparable with that of partners other sos men tioned that road conditions and other factors should be considered nevertheless they r ecognised the need for more costeffective transport ocm kabul undertook to find solution c warehousing 59 oios assessed the warehouse management of gtz in the afghan operation to be adequate total of 57 warehouses and subwarehou ses including 28 rubb halls were functional in 2003 and assets and nfis stored at th date of the audit in may 2004 totalled more than us 9 million 60 towards the end of 2003 ocm kabul entere d into memorandum of understanding with unama to use part of the unama compound for wa rehousing the cost to unhcr for four prefabricated warehouses gravelling of the l and for rubb halls and access road was us 350000 from march 2004 unhcr discontinued nfi d istributions to returnees as of may 2004 comprehensive plan as to the movement of st ock distributions contingency stock and future utilisation of the warehousing at the unama compound was not yet prepared ocm kabul will compile distribution plan taking into account the various factors d fleet management 61 unhcr deployed 378 vehicles in afghanistan of which 163 43 per cent under the custody of partners gtzs workshop in kabul servi ces only vehicles under the custody of unhcr currently the workshop is only utilized at 2 5 per cent of its capacity the situation is rather unfortunate because unhcr provides for r epair and maintenance in the partners subproject budgets whereas gtzs workshop is unde rutilised thereby risking double funding maintenance costs the feasibility of using gtz or other workshops is in the process at ocm kabul following ocm kabuls decision to move the worksho p thereby reducing the rental cost of second compound gtz recently build new workshop in its main compound at considerable cost ocm kabul should c onsider this cost in such feasibility study recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission in afghani stan should consider the costs already invested by gtz i n building new vehicle workshop when deciding on concept for servicing unhcr vehicles under the custody of implementing partners rec 10 assets 62 the afghan operation has 8500 assets with an acquisition value of us 18 million current value us 10 million the assettrak reco rds remain centralized at ocm kabul and supply chain completed the updates of assets at suboffices ocm kabul did not perform physical verifications of some 4000 assets under its custody or that of its partners oios suggested that ocm kabul engage gtz 63 ocm kabul is of the opinion that most assets are w ith partners and verified during verifications the relevant forms are part of the p roject closure and the function is difficult to delegate to gtz the comments are noted but without physical verifi cations carried out thus far it is rather questionable that the programme s ection and the supply chain at ocm kabul have adequate capacity with the necessary expertise to perform the physical verifications especially of such large number of assets d security and safety 64 unhcrs security arrangements are in accor dance with the minimum operating security standards moss for afghanistan based on risk assessment of unsecoord for afghanistan staff and restrictions enforced by ocm kabul on movements within afghanistan unhcr determine areas of access or access taking into account the monthly risk classification high medium or low ri sk of unsecoord and inputs from its suboffices and indicate the areas on unhcr sta ff access map unhcr suspended all activities in areas that unsecoord classified as h igh risk areas movements are restricted in most districts within the southern s outheastern and eastern regions currently all encashment centres are accessible 65 as rule all road missions are with arme d security escorts provided by the ministry of interior unhcr is improving escort arrangement s mainly the engagement of better quality and trained armed personnel and the provisi on of equipment and vehicles to the ministry unhcr also allocated us 14 million for security equipment and subsequently ocm kabul ordered 6 hard skin light vehicles at the cost of us 160000 each and ballistic blankets for 70 vehicles unhcr is thro ugh these steps and regular update of the unhcr staff access map actively improving staff safety during road missions partners follow their own security arrangements but unhcr p rovides some security materials under subagreements 66 there is uncertainty as to the whether the official security phase 3 for afghanistan is appropriate in the current security situation ocm kabul informed oios that the security team recommended phase 4 for the southern southeastern and eastern regions in june 2004 but that was not discussed at following security management team smt meetings according to ocm kabul unhcrs security measures in place responded to the security situation in security phases 4 or 5 in the regions oios supports this conservative approach 67 as of july 2004 the field safety advisors fsas posts at all suboffices were vacant sos mazarisharif jalalabad and kandaha r had fsas on mission sos herat and gardez were without fsas the recruitment of fsas is in process 68 security and evacuation plans and daytod ay security measures such as security clearances briefings and communication procedures are in place ocm kabul conducted its first evacuation exercise on 3 july 2004 but subo ffices did not conduct any such exercises ocm kabul will arrange the exercises and the fsa t ocm kabul will attend the exercises at sos herat and gardez that are without fsas 69 unhcr uses the united nations humanitarian air services unhas under the umbrella of the world food programme for air trave l there are coordination between unhcr and unhas regarding security arrangements or security of staff using the services there are circumstances in which security arrangeme nts are required especially in the case of flight diversions that occurred in the past furth ermore and according to the latest member list unhas is not member of the smt recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission in afghani stan should in consultation with unhas establish secur ity procedures for situationsincidents related to the use of unhas flights in which unhcr staff members could be involved rec11 administration 70 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr offices in afghanistan generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review medical insurance plan mip 71 ocm kabul did not properly supervise and operate the mip in afghanistan the data in the system is not accurate and not complete wi th the exception of islamabad the claims were not processed throughout 2003 merely b ecause of minor technical problem in the electronic system it was not until the last qu arter of 2003 that ocm kabul settled the 2003 claims 514 claims totalling us 40000 the claims included vouchers that dated as far back as january 2002 some claims were settled alm ost year after submission 72 benchmark amounts were not set for the cla ims and treatments of which there are many that include treatments incurred in pakistan t hat were recorded as not outside country even treatment in india in august 2003 was reco rded as not outside country because there are prevailing patterns of charges for med ical services in afghanistan the amounts claimed were paid after consultation with the joint medical service i n may 2004 ocm kabul decided that medical expenses incurred in pak istan and iran can be in exceptional cases considered as reasonable and customary in af ghanistan ocm kabul is also in the process to obtain prices from hospitals and physici ans to determine reasonable prices in such cases 73 the mip was decentralised early 2004 and ios was concerned that the weaknesses in the system will prevail especially when abuses found in other large operations are considered the decentralisation was decided by dhrm and regi onal workshop was held in sri lanka and software already installed there fore it will be difficult to recentralise and not in the interest of staff ocm kabul will ensu re that sos manage the mip properly b overtime 74 ocm kabul paid us 95000 for overtime wo rk in 2003 oios found the overtime arrangements at ocm kabul not to comply with the u nhcr rules staff members were in general paid overtime without obtaining approval b efore the overtime was undertaken ocm kabul took corrective steps v acknowledgement 75 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of unhcr and implementing par tners in afghanistan
