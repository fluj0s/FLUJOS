revenue code irc were prominent players in the 2004 presidential election raising and spending approximately 435 million and being widely seen as having an impact on the outcome of the race yet some socalle d 527 organizations remain outside the purview of federal election law section 527 added to the irc in 1975 provides tax exempt status to federal state and local political organizations at first it was generally thought that with resp ect to federal election activities political organizations correlated directly with political committees as defined under the federal election campaign ac t feca it became clear by 2000 however that this was not necessarily true becau prevailing judicial inte rpretation of supreme court precedent has permitted feca regulation of only those communications containing express advocacy ie explicitly urging the electi on or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates by avoiding such terms groups could arguably promote issue positions in reference to particular federal elected officials wit hout triggering fecas disclosure contribution limits and source restrictions s till the groups qualified for the favorable tax treatment of 527 organizations because that benefit is not limited to groups that conduct express advocacy in 2002 the bipartisan campaign re form act bcra addressed express advocacy but regulated only messages broadcast within 30 days of primary or 60 days of general election that referred to federal office candidate bcra left unregulated such areas as broadcasts aire d before elections and voter mobilization efforts groups wishing to engage in thes activities and still ava il themselves of the unlimited funding sources longer availabl to political partie s generally qualify for taxexempt status under irc 527 suppor ters of bcra have led the effort to extend federal election law re gulation to these types of 527 organizations seeing the enormous amounts of money raised and spent in recent years as result of the fecs failure to enforce existing law bcra critics however insist that what occurred since 2004 was the predictable result of th ban on soft money activity by national parties thus redirecting massive amounts of unregulated money to outside groups that are less accountable to the political syst em they insist that many of these groups not engaging in express advocacy cannot be constituti onally regulated in the 109th congress the house twice passed similar bills to add 527 organizations to fecas political committee definiti on unless involved solely in state and local elections the senate rules and administration committee reported similar measure but the senate di d not act on it similar bills hr 420 and s 463 have been offered in the 110th

background and issues for federal election and tax laws introduction1 in recent years the terms 527 organi zations 527 groups and 527s have been used interchangeably to describe groups that intend to influence federal elections in ways that may be outside the scope of federal elec tion law the terms stem from the fact that these organizati ons are provided taxexempt status under section 527 of the internal revenue code irc2 these groups have become the subject of controversy due to the different definitions used in federal election law and tax law as to what constitutes political or electionrelated activity and the lack of uniform opinion as to what election law itself regulates or may permissibly regulate strictly speaking irc 527 provides taxexempt status to many more organizations than just those that are co lloquially referred to as 527s the section applies not only to organizations that ar active in federal elections but also to organizations involved in state and local elections and certain nonelectoral activities while irc 527 applies to broad ra nge of organizations only the groups colloquially referred to as 527s ie thos groups that intend to influence federal elections in ways that may be outside the scope of federal election law are the focus of current controversy this report discusses this limited subset of organizations exempt under irc 527 and uses the terms 527 organizations 527 groups and 527s interchangeably to refer to them section 527 was added to the irc in 1975 to provide taxexempt status to political organizations as defined in that statute at that time it was generally thought that with respect to groups participating in federal elections political organizations correlated directly with political committees as labeled by and operating under federal elec tion law indeed political committees whether political parties political action committees pacs or candidate committees have taxexempt status under irc 527 in 2000 however it came to light that some groups engaged in federalelecti onrelated issue advocacy were claiming exempt status under irc 527 while not be ing regulated under th federal election campaign act feca these groups were shrouded in mystery because disclosure was required unde r either the tax or elec tion laws at that time httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33888crs2 3 buckley v valeo 424 us 1 1976 4 although

the federal election campaign act feca of 1971 as amended 2 usc 431 et seq as well as by certain court rulings generally feca imposes limitations and prohibitions on money from certain sources nd requires public disclosure of money raised and spent in federal elections due to the supreme court striking down spending limits as unconstitutional in its landmark 1976 buckley v valeo ruling3 federal law does not impose mandatory limits on campaign sp ending by candidates or groups4 key provisions of feca key features of federal election law regulation include the following source

election for federal office such funds are often referred to as hard money feca defines both contribution nd expenditure as monies or anything of value for the purpose of influenc ing any election for federal office6 in order to preserve the laws regulation of contributions and expenditures against invalidation for constitutional vagueness the supreme court in buckley v valeo construed the terms contribution nd expenditure to encompass only funds donated for or spent for express advocacy that is voter communications using explicit phrases and words such as vote fo r vote against elect and defeat7 likewise the court construed the rm political committee to include only organizations that are under the control of candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or ection of candidate8 in so doing the buckley court established the major purpose test which determines whether or not an organization if it raises more than 1000 in contributions or makes more than 1000 in expenditures is subject to regulation under feca as political committee9 neither feca nor the supreme court however has yet defined precisely how to ascertain the major purpose of an or ganization indeed how the major purpose test works and to what groups it applies ar at the heart of debate concerning the circumstances under which nonparty organizations including 527s can constitutionally be considered feca regulated political committees for example some observers proffer that it is relevant to examine an organizations activities beyond express advocacy to ascertain its ma jor purpose while others maintain that supreme court precedent still limits feca regulation through the designation of political committee status to only those organizations engaging in express advocacy10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33888crs4 11 see irs notice of opportunity to submit written comments and to request public hearing with respect to the tax treatment of contributions of appreciated

code prior to 1975 the internal revenue code was silent as to the tax treatment of organizations whose primary purpose is infl uencing elections the internal revenue service irs did not generally require these organizations to file tax returns or pay taxes it appears this was because the irs treated contributions to political organizations as gifts11 which meant that the organizations did not have taxable income by the early 1970s it became appare nt that these organizations had sources of income other than contributions such as investment income and gain from the sale of donated property in 1973 the irs nnounced it would begin requiring political committees and parties with investment and other types of income to file tax returns and pay taxes12 parties and committees were taxed as corporations trusts or partnerships depending on th surrounding circumstances13 in 1975 congress responded to the irs action by adding section 527 to the internal revenue code pl 93625 88 stat 210814 section 527 as enacted by pl 93625 is similar to the current versi on with the exception of the reporting requirements that currently exist these are discussed below in the section on pl 106230 and pl 107276 and in the appendix section 527 applies to political organi zations which are those organizations including party committee association or fund that are organized and operated primarily to directly or indirectly accept contributions andor make expenditures for an exempt function an exempt func tion is the influencing or attempting to influence the selection nomin ation electi on or appointment of an individual to federal state or local public office to an office in political organization or as presidential or vicepresidential elector section 527 political organizations ar subject to tax only on political organization taxable income this is the organizations gross income excluding exempt function income less 100 and any allowable deductions exempt function income is any amount received to the extent that it is segregated to use for an exempt function as contributions of mone or other property membership dues f ees or assessments proceeds which are not received in the ordinary course of business from political fundraising and entert ainment events or from the sale of campaign materials and proceeds from conducting bingo gamehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33888crs5 15 see

congressional candidate is taxed using the graduated corporate tax rate schedule this special rule does not apply for campaign committees of candidates for state or local office under pl 93625 political organizations only had contact with the irs if they were required to file tax return because they had taxable income thus the law was properly thought of as addre ssing the tax treatment of th organizations rather than regulating them the lack of reporting requirements may have been because at the time of the laws enactment political organizations were generally thought of as candidate funds and politi cal parties and committees15 ie the same types of entities that when involved in federal ections are regulated by feca emergence of issue advocacy campaigns during the 1996 election cycle new phenomenon was seen in campaigns for president and congress that marked turning point both in the way in which campaigns for federal office are conducted nd in efforts to regulate the flow of money in federal elections political parties and intere st groups had in 1995 and 1996 made broadcast communications that disc ussed candidates merits in conjunction with particular issue positions which while technically not meeting federal election law criteria for electionrelated activity were widely viewed as intending to influence federal races as public policy messages without expr ess advocacy language such activities were labeled issue advocacy by not explicitly urging the defeat or election of clearly identified candidate s entities coul d present information to the public which encouraged more positive or negative vi ews of public officials who also were candidates not only could these communica tions be paid for with funds from any source and in any amount ie soft money but they were not uniformly disclosed either while issue advocacy caught much of th political world by surprise in 1996 it quickly caught on as the new growth area of money in politics while the lack of disclosure made it impossible to know for sure the extent of such activity the annenberg public policy center estimated that be tween 135 and 150 million was spent on broadcast issue advocacy in 1996 rising to between 250 and 341 million in 1998 and some 509 million in 200016 effect on campaign fi nance reform debate the highly visible and increasing levels of issue spendi ng in the 19962000

trend was established proponents of campaign finance reform r ecognized the potential for such growth and responded quickly by redi recting their efforts toward addressing issue advocacy during the 1980s and early 1990s pressu re had been building in congress to address concerns about the role of money in politics primarily involving the high costs of seeking office and the concomitant need for private sources of campaign funds those interested in campaign fina nce reform generally characterized by favoring greater regulation had focused their efforts during much of this time on two issues the rising costs of elections to federal office and the growing funding role played therein by political action committees the most prominent legislative proposals came to feature provi sions to curb if not liminate pac money as funding source in federal elections nd to impose voluntary spending limits in congressional elections in exchange for ca ndidates receiving either public funding or some form of costreducing public be nefit such as posta l or broadcast rate reductions these provisions were key elements in comprehensive reform bills passed by the house and senate in the 101st 102nd and 103rd congresses17 while other aspects of campaign finance law were included in these measures such as ones dealing with party soft money18 the major point of contention was the insistence of the reform advocates on spending limits and public funding or benefits the dynamics of the debate over pacs shifted over time and even that provision eventually became relatively less point of contention on september 7 1995 during the 104th congress senators john mccain and russell feingold introduced their first campaign finance reform bill establishing themselves as the leading re form advocates in the senate that bill s 1219 was the successor to the reform bills that had passed in the previous three congresses and it reflected the same pre 1996 consen among advocates of campaign finance reform that prioritized curbing the high cost of congressional elections and replacing the need for private funds especially pa cs with other funding sources s 1219 also expanded on the earlier bills treatment of party soft money with inclusion of stricter curbs on the raising and spending of soft money by national and state and local political parties following the watershed election of 1996 in which unregulated campaign activity appeared to overshadow the regulated activity the leading reform advocates in congress responded with significant chan ges in their proposed legislation at the

and on pacs the key elements of reformers objectives for at least the previous 10 years were eliminated from the bill entirely thus in one years time the very nature of the campaign finance debate had shifted from an attempt to improve the existing regulatory system to saving it from becoming meaningless in the face of newly emerging campaign practices this debate started in the wake of the 1996 elections would continue until the enactment of the bipartisan campaign reform act bcra in 2002 emergence of the 527 issue not only was 1996 the year in which issue advocacy emerged but it was also the year in which the irs began issuing several private rulings on the types of activities that qualify as influencing an election for purposes of irc 52719 under these rulings it became apparent that some of the issue advocacy activities described above could qualify as elec tioninfluencing activities unde r irc 527 thus these rulings helped create an awareness that groups participating in these issue advocacy activities while arguably not required to report to the fec could still qualify for the benefit of taxexempt status under irc 527 after the 1996 election media and congressi onal attention turned to groups with 527 status that were engaging in activitie s aimed at influenc ing federal elections without conforming to feca rules spor adic news accounts of their activities tended

same terms as section 52723 during this time period 527s were establishe d by such groups as the sierra club and naacp and as new entities such as citizen s for better medicare all to engage in electionrelated issue advocacy campaigns 527 activity in 2000 by 2000 issue advocacy had emerged as the thorniest issue of the ongoing campaign finance debate owing to th conundrum based on prevailing

debate on regula ting nonexpress advocacy activ ity and begin yet another on the alsocomplicated issue of differing definitions of political organization under the irc and political committee under

report to the fec as political committee pl 107276 amended the requirement by adding an exemption for political committees of state and local candidates and state and local committees of political parties in addition to the initial notification requirement pl 106230 also included provision that requires the periodic disclosu re of contributions and expenditures to the irs29 under this provision any organi zation that accepts contribution or makes an expenditure for section 527 exem pt function during the year is required to file disclosure report with the irs on either quarterly or monthly basis periodic report must include 1 the name address occupation nd employer of any contributor who made cont ribution during the reporting period and gave at least 200 during the year along with the

state or local committee of political party or political committee of nonfederal candidate or expects to have gross r eceipts of less than 25000 they also do not apply to independent expend itures which are expenditures that expressly advocate for candidate but are made without th candidates involve ment or cooperation additionally pl 107276 added an ex emption for state and local political committees if they are required to report similar information to state pl 106230 and pl 107276 also changed the rules for when political organizations must file tax and information returns under prior law political organization only filed tax return if it had political organization taxable income and never had to file an info rmation return pl 106230 required any organization with at least 25000 in gross receipts to file tax return regardle ss of whether it had political organization taxable income and required that any organization that filed tax return also file an information return pl 107276 amended both of these provisions with respect to tax returns pl 107276 reversed the change made by pl 106230 so that currently only organiza tions with taxable income are required to file tax return with respect to information returns pl 107276 requires that political organization file return if it has gross receipts of at least 25000 100000 if qualified state or local political organization

disclosure reports on the internet and also required the irs to improve its online database while pl 106230 had required that the tax returns be made public this was eliminated by pl 107276 finally pl

mcconnell v fec30 largely upheld the entire law including title ii31 in upholding title ii the court determined that its decision in buckley v valeo construed fecas disclosure and reporting requirements as well as its expenditure limitations to apply only to funds used for communications that cont ain express advocacy of the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate32 the mcconnell court held that neither the first amendment nor buckley however prohibits bcras regulation of electioneering communicati ons even though electi oneering communications by definition do not necessarily contain expr ess advocacy the court determined that when the buckley court distinguished between express and issue advocacy it did so as matter of statutory interpretation not constitutional command moreover the court announced that by narrowly reading the feca provisions in buckley to avoid problems of vagueness and overbreadth it d id not suggest that statute that was neither vague nor overbroad would be re quired to toe the same express advocacy line33 the presence or absence of magi c words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech from true issue ad the court observed34 the supreme court in mcconnell also specifically noted that even with the electioneering provisions of bcra intact irc sec tion 501c and 527 organizations would continue to be

to the political parties in 2000 or 200246 the same study however found that these donors gave three times more to the 527s in 2004 than they had to the parties in 2000 and 2002 combin ed indicating that soft money donations had not merely tr ansferred to 527s47 of the 405 million in 527 receipts found by the campaign finance institute 256 million was from individual donors 112 million was from labor unions and 30 million was from businesses including co rporations trade associations and unincorporated entities the business vel actually dropped slightly from 2002 but the union level doubled

527s had substantial impact on the 2004 campaign ground and air wars49 it found that major democraticleaning groups the media fund aflcio and moveon kept the presidential race close in the spring and summer of 2004 but that republicanleaning groups notably swift bo at veterans for truth and progress for america organized later in the election had substantial impact in the fall campaign noting that 527s placed much great er emphasis on voter mobilization and registration ie the ground war than they had before the findings stated that the big story of 2004 in addition to the tremendous ground

insisting that existing federal election law requires that groups working for the election or feat of candidates for federal office must register as political committees and comply with all aspects of that law regardless of the nature of the specific activities in which they engage these bcra advocates have expressed dismay over the fecs failu re to issue regulations to enforce that view of the law and have filed court challenges to the activities of prominent 527 groups on that basis concerns about this issue have by means been limited to bcra supporters the bushcheney campaign filed its own

office55 in interpreting the definition of political committee the supreme court in its 1976 decision buckley v valeo cautioned that the phrase for the pur pose of influencing an election or nomination has the potential for encomp assing both issue discussion and advocacy of political result56 therefore in order to avoi d overbreadth the court found that it need only encompass

election65 those opposing the proposed regulations ar gue that they risk subjecting too many organizations for example 501c nonprofit groups to the status of political committee and thus erroneously and unconstitutionally subjecting them to feca regulation furthermore they argue such regulation will threaten grassroots advocacy on the other hand those favoring greater regulation by the fec reject the argument that it will chill speech by non profit groups because 501c organizations cannot by definition have major purpose of influencing federal elections hence proponents maintain non profits would not fall within the proposed definition and accordingly would not be subject to feca regulation66 proposal to redefi ne expenditure in addition to proposing options for redefining what constitutes political committee the nprm presented options for amending feca regulations to redefine the term expenditure the definition of expenditure is also critical for determining which organizations and activities are subject to the feca regulation of contribution limits source restrictions and disclosure requirements67 in buckley the supreme court found that the ambiguity of the

that expressly advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate69 over time many in the campaign finance reform community observed that the courts express advocacy test articulated in buckley failed to provide meaningful distinction between true issue ads and cam paign ads indeed when the supreme court considered the constitutiona lity of bcra in its 2003 decision mcconnell v fec 70 it concluded that certain communicati ons can have the purpose or effect of influencing elections regardless of whether they contain express advocacy clarifying the express advocacy standard the court determined that it is not constitutional barrier in ascertaining whether an expenditure is for the purpose of influencing any federal election that is according to the court in narrowly reading the feca provisions in buckley to avoid problems of vagueness and overbreadth we nowhere suggested that statute that was neither vague nor overbroad would be required to toe the same express advocacy line71 in view of the supreme courts jurisprude nce in this area in its nprm the fec also proposed to amend the definition of expenditure to include payment distribution loan advance or deposit of money or anything of value made by or on behalf of any person for public communication as defined in 11 cfr 10026 is an expenditure if the public communication refers to clearly identified candidate for federal office and promotes or supports or attacks or opposes an candidate for federal office or b promotes or opposes any political party72 those opposing the proposed amended definition of expenditure argue that the importation of the promote support att ack or oppose standard risks categorizing as political committees many nonparty gro ups that make public communications thereby potentially creating problem of overbreadth on the other hand those favoring the change to the definition maintain that it is sufficiently narrowly tailored and would pass constitutional

and re lated litigation while the fec was unable to adopt new re gulations central to the issues of 527 regulation as compromise in octobe r 2004 it adopted new regulation relevant to political committees74 accordingly this new rule was in effect during the november 2004 presidential election entitled funds received in response to solicitations the new rule provides that political gr oups are regulated under feca based on whether they conduct fundraising w ith solicitations that include appeals to support or oppose the election of federal ca ndidate funds or anything of value collected as result of such solicitations are considered contribution under feca therefore any organization with 1000 or mo re in such contributions is subject to feca regulation75 notably it has been reporte d that the fec acknowledged that the new rule failed to address the key question of if and when based on their solicitation messages nonparty groups are re quired to register with the fec as political committees76 the new rule also revised its allocation regulations requiring that such regulated organizations pay at least 50 of their expenses for federal election related activities such as

stat us under the internal revenue code is insufficient evidence alone to determine whether an organization is political committee under feca it found that an or ganizations tax status under section 527 does not necessarily satisfy feca and s upreme court contribution expenditure and major purpose requirements81 in addition the commission determined that the irss requirements for granting tax exem ption under section 527 are based on different and broader set of criteria than is used by the fec in determining political committee status82 pursuant to feca and supreme court precedent the fec stated that it will continue to determine political committee status based on whether an organization received contributions or made expend itures over 1000 in calendar year and whether the organizations major purpose was campaign activity to that end the fec specifically noted that it will consider whether any of the organizations solicitations resulted in contributions because the solicitations indicated that any portion of the funds received would be us ed to support or oppose the election of clearly identified federal candidate and will analyze whether any of the organizations expenditures for communicati ons made independently of candidate constituted express advocacy under its regulations83 in concluding the fec announced that its recent enforcement actions

an oversight hearing on the fec the initial legislative re sponse to the pe rceived 527 problems came from the sponsors of the bcra sena tors mccain and feingold and representatives shays and meehan who offered identical bills in september 2004 at the end of the 108th congress the 527 reform act of 2004 s 2828 and hr 5127 sought to bridge the differences in how federal election w and tax law defined who is covered under the respective statutes by specifically d eclaring that 527 organizations under the irc have the major purpose of influencing elec tions unless they ve annual receipts of less than 25000 or are exclusively devoted to nonfederal elections by thus adding 527 organizations to the feca definition of political committee such entities would have to fully comply with that

approach to the perceived 527 problem as was taken by sponsors of the 527 reform act of 2005 ie to loosen restrictions on ot her players in the political process so that they could assume greater role and hen ce offset the perceived undue role played by the 527s by so doing proponents expected that there would be less of an incentive for political money to flow to 527 groups ope rating outside the

subject to taxconclusion if the 110th congress chooses to address 527s key question will be whether additional regulation should occur via legi slation new fec or other regulation or enforcement of existing regulations regardless of how policy change occurs perhaps most importantly it remains unc lear whether the courts would uphold additional attempts to re gulate 527 activity indeed whether regulation of 527 activity needs to be limited to only those or ganizations engaging in express advocacy is topic of much controversy and deba nevertheless there is likely to be continued criticism that activity by 527s in the manner seen in recent elections threatens to undermine the effectiveness of regulation under fe deral election law another issue that has received attention is whether in the event that congress does require further regulati on of 527 organizations money might flow to other types of taxexempt organizations such as i rc 501c4 social welfare organizations and 501c6 trade associations98 these types of organizations may engage in political campaign activity so long as it is consistent with the organizations exempt purpose there are however two limitati ons in the irc that would make these organizations less efficient than secti on 527 political organizations for carrying on electionrelated activities first the i rc implicitly restricts the amount of political campaign activity that these organizations may conduct specifi cally participating in political campaign activity cannot be the organization s primary activity99 second under irc 527f irc 501c orga nizations are subject to tax if they make an expenditure for an irc 527 ex empt function as discussed above an exempt function is influenc ing or attempting to influe nce the selection nomination election or appointment of an individual to federal stat or local public office to an office in political organization or as presidential or vicepresidential elector under irc 527f the organization is taxe d at the highest corporate rate on the lesser of the organizations net investment income or its total amount of exempt function expenditures100 finally it should be noted that taxexempt organizations must also abide by any applicable election laws for example since campaign finance laws ban unions and corpora tions from making any contribution or expenditure in connection w ith
