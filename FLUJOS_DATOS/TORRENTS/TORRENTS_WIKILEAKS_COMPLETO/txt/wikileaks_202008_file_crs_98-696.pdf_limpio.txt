aﬀecting each stagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696 order code 98696 gov resolving legislative differences in congress conference committees and amendments between the houses updated november 26 2008 elizabeth rybicki analyst on the congress and legislative process government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696resolving legislative differences in congress conference committees and amendments between the houses summary the constitution requires that the house and senate approve the same bill or joint resolution in precisely the same form before it is presented to the president for his approval or veto to this end both houses must pass the same measure and then attempt to reach agreement about its provisions the house and senate may be able to reach agreement by an exchange of amendments between the houses each house has one opportunity to amend the amendments from the other house so ther can be senate amendments to house amendments to senate amendments to house bill house amendments to senate bills or amendments are privileged for consideration on the senate floor senate amendments to house bills or amendm ents generally are not privileged for consideration on the house floor in practice the house often disposes of amendments between the houses under the rms of special rule reported by the rules committee the senate sometimes disposes of house amendments by unanimous consent but the procedures asso ciated with the exchange of amendments can become complicated alternatively the house and senate ca n disagree to each others positions on bill and then agree to create c onference committee to propose package settlement of all their disagreements most conferees are drawn from the standing committees that had considered the bill initially the house or senate may vote to instruct its conferees before they are appoi nted but such instructions are not binding conferees generally are free to negotiate in whatever ways they choose but eventually their agreement must be approved by majority of the house conferees and majority of the senate conferees the conferees are expected to address only the matters on which the house and senate have disagreed they also are expected to resolve each disagreement within the scope of the differences between the house and senate positions if the conferees ca nnot reach agreement on an amendment or if their agreement exceeds their authority they may report that amendment as an amendment in true or technical disagreement on the house and senate floors conference reports are privileged and debatable but they are not amendable the senate has procedure to strike out portions of the conference agreement that are considered under nate rules to be out of scope material or new directed spending provisions the house also has special procedure for voting to reject conference report provisions that would not have been germane to the bill in the house after agreeing to conference report the house or senate can dispose of any remaining amendments in disagreement only when the house and senate have reached agreement on all provisions of the bill can it be enrolled for presentation to the presidenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696contents introduction 1 t h n d f r r s l u t i n 2s l c t i n f t h m s u r 2two methods of resolutio n6 m n d m n t s b t w n t h h u s s7c n s i d r t i n f s n

report was written by stanley bach formerly senior specialist in the legislative process at crs dr bach has retired but the listed author updated the report and is available to answer questions concerning c onference committees and amendments between the housesresolving legislative differences in congress conference committees and amendments between the houses introduction the process of resolving the legislative differences that arise between the house of representatives and the sena is one of the most critical stages of the legislative process it is also potentially one of the most complicated each chamber continues to be governed by its own rules preceden ts and practices but at this stage each house also must take into account the prefer ences and to some extent the procedures of the other this report1 summarizes the procedures the two houses of congress use most frequently to resolve their legislative diffe rences it is based upon an interpretation of the rules and published precedents of the house and senate and an analysis of the application of these rules and precedents in recent practice it bears emphasizing that this report is not exhaustive nor is it in any way an official statement of house or senate procedures it may serve as us eful introduction or general guide but it should not be considered an adequate substitu for study of house and senate rules and precedents themselves or for consultations with the parliamentarians of the house and senate on the meaning and po ssible application of the rules and precedents readers may wish to study the provisions of the rules especially house rule xxii and examine the applicable precedents as explained in house practice guide to the rules precedents and procedures of the house especially pp 307342 on conferences between the houses and pp 813839 on senate bills amendments between the houses and in riddicks senate procedure senate document 10128 esp ecially pp 126143 on amendments between houses and pp 449493 on conferences and conference reportshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs2 2 each house may interpret the same legisla tive language differently these differences sometimes emerge from comparison of house and senate committee reports and floor debates deliberate ambiguity in the language of legislation can be used to promote agreement between the two chambers 3 this requirement also applies to joint resolutions proposing constitutional amendments and to concurrent resolutions even though neith er are sent to the white house for the presidents signature or vet house and senate resolutions on the other hand do not require action by the other body throughout this report the terms bill and measure are used interchangeably to refer to all bills and resolutions on which house and senate differences are to be resolved 4 in this report terms such as first chamber and second house are used to refer only to the order in which the house and senate complete initial floor action on measurethe need for resolution before congress can submit bill or joint resolution to the president for his approval or disapproval the senate and the house of representatives must agree on each and every provision of that measure2 it is not enough for both houses to pass ve rsions of the same measure that are comparable in purpose but that differ in certain technical or even minor details the house and senate must agree on identical gislative language nor is it enough for the two chambers to approve separate bills with exactly the same text the house and senate both must pass the same bill in sum both chambers of congress must pass precisely the same measure in precisely the same form before it can become law3 each of these requirements agreement on the identity of the measure eg hr 1 or s 1 and agreement on the text of that measure is considered in turn in the following sections of this report selection of the measure because both chambers must pass the same measure before it can become law at some point during the legislative process the house must act on senate bill or the senate must act on house bill congre ss usually meets this requirement without difficulty or controversy in some cases however selecting the measure may require some parliamentary ingenuity and can have policy and political consequences after either house debates and passes measure it nds or messages that bill to the other chamber if the second house passes the first houses bill without any amendments the legislative process is co mpleted both houses have passed the same measure in the same form4 if the second house passes the bill with one or more amendments both chambers have acted on th same measure now they must resolve the differences between their respective vers ions of the text if the measure is to become lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs3 5 from time to time senate committees and even the senate as whole may take some action on senate appropriations or tax meas ure however on the infrequent occasions when the senate has passed such bill and sent it to the house the house often has returned it to the senate on the ground that the bill infringed on the houses cons titutional prerogatives as interpreted by the house the resolutions that the house has adopted for this purpose often are called blue slip resolutions 6 this may occur for strategic or institutional as well as procedural reasons as when the house refuses to consider senate bill that the house finds to be in violation of its constitutional prerogative to originate revenue measures also the two houses may prefer to retain the house or senate bill number if one is more familiar than the other to the bills supporters outside of congressin most cases either the house or the senate can be the first chamber to act however the constitution requires that all revenue measures originate in the house and the house traditionally has insisted that this prerogative extends to appropriations as well as tax measures5 thus the house normally acts first on such measure and consequently it is h ousenumbered bill or joint resolution that congress ultimately presents to the presiden t for enacting appropriations or tax laws in some cases the proponents of meas ure may decide that one house or the other should act first for example bills supporters ma first press for floor action in the chamber where they think the meas ure enjoys greater support they may hope that success in one house may generate political momentum that will help the measure overcome the greater opposition th ey expect in the second chamber alternatively one house may defer floor action on bill unless and until it is passed by the other where the meas ure is expected to encount er stiff opposition the house leadership for example may decide that it is pointless for the house to invest considerable time and for representa tives to cast possibly unnecessary and politically difficult votes on controversial bill until after an expected senate filibuster on comparable senate bill has been avoided or overcome as these considerations imply majo r legislative proposals frequently are introduced in both houses either identical companion bills or bills that address the same subject in rather different ways if so the appropriate subcommittees and committees of the house and senate may consider and report their own measures on the same subject at roughly the same time thus when one house passes and sends bill to the other the second chamber may have its own bill on the same subject that has been or is soon to be reporte d from committee and available for floor consideration in such cases the second chamber often acts initially on its own bill rather than the bill received from the other house6 this is particularly likely to happe n when the committee of the s econd house reports bill that differs significantly in approach from the measure passed by the first chamber the text selected for floor consideration generally sets the frame of reference within which debate occurs and amendments ar proposed in most cases the house or senate modifies but does not wholly replace the legislative approach embodied in the bill it considers it is usually advantageous therefore for committee to press for floor consideration of its approach rather than the approach proposed by the other househttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs4 7 third reading and engrossment is technical and noncontroversial stage in both houses that marks the conclusion of the amending process and precedes the vote on final passagein large part for this reason the house or the senate often acts on its own bill even though it has already r eceived the other chambers bill on the same subject under these circumstances however it woul d not be constructive for the house to pass its bill and then send it to the senate if the house were to do so then each chamber would have in its possession bill passed by the other but both chambers would not yet have acted on the same measur to avoid this potential problem the second house often acts initially on its own b ill and then it also acts on the other chambers bill on the same subject the usual practices of the house and senate for doing so differ slightly the house customarily debates amends and passes the house bill and immediately thereafter takes up the counterpart senate b ill the floor manager then moves to strike out all after the enacting clause of the senate bill the opening lines of every bill be it enacted by the sena and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled and replace the stricken text with the full text of the house bill as just passed the house often agrees by unanimous consent to consider the senate bill and approves the house substitute routinely the senate bill as amended th is passed by voice vote or without objection and the house lays its own bill on the table which disposes of it adversely in some cases the special rule under which house bill is considered also includes provisions for such action on the senate bill for instance special rule may state after the passage of hr 1 it shall be in order to take from the speakers table the bill s l and to move to strike out all after the enacting clause of the said senate bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions contained in hr 1 as passed by the house in this way the house actually passes two bills on the same subject and with identical provisions but it is the senate bill which both chambers now have passed that is the subject of further action the senate acts in comparable fashion although it usually does not pass its own bill instead the senate debates and amends its bill and agrees to third reading and engrossment of the bill as amended7 the senate then takes up the house bill by unanimous consent strikes out all afte r the enacting clause inserts the amended text of the senate bill and passes the house bill as it has been amended by the senates amendment in the nature of substitute the senate bill that was debated and amended is never actually passed after passing the house bill the senate indefinitely postpones further proceedings on its own bill if the first houses bill has been referred to committee in the second chamber and is still there it is first necessary to discharge the committee from further consideration of the bill this also is normally accomplished routinely either by unanimous consent or in the house pursuan t to the provisions of special rule tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs5 8 senate rules require floor amendments to be germane only when offered to general appropriations bills or budget measures or after the senate has invoked clotureavoid the need for this action the speaker often leaves senate bill on the speakers table instead of referring it to the appropriate house committee if there is reason to expect that the house will soon act on companion house bill similarly house bill may be taken up on the senate floor without first being referred to committee when companion senate bill has been reported from committee and is on the senates legislative calendar by these devices the house and senate arrange to act on the same bill even if they have passed that measure with fundame ntally different texts in most cases these arrangements are noncontroversial nd routine under some circumstances however complications and difficulties can arise the house operates under rule which re quires that all amendments must be germane to the measure being considered the senate does not8 unless the senate imposes germaneness requirement on itsel f by unanimous consent which it often does most measures are subject to whatever nongermane floor amendments senators wish to offer consequently the senate may select house bill on one subject as convenient vehicle and am end it to include provisions on other unrelated subjects sometimes the use of unrelated legislative vehicles is accepted by both the house and the senate as usef ul or even necessary device to cope with different political and par liamentary conditions preva iling in the two chambers although such situations are relatively unusual problems some times arise that make neutral vehicles useful for resolving them during the 95th congress for example president carter submitted massive proposal for major new national energy legi slation the democratic leadership of the house chose to consider the presidents entire program in single bill and eventually the house passed hr 8444 in the senate on the other hand the democratic majority leadership concluded that an omnibus bill would inspire filibuster that probably coul d not be broken consequen tly the senate debated and amended five separate bills that collectively dealt with the same subjects as hr 8444 dilemma now arose if the senate passed its five bills and sent them to the house the house would face different bills on different aspects of the presidents program which was precisely the situa tion the house had sought to avoid by consolidating the various proposals in hr 8444 yet if the senate attempted to pass the house bill the feared filibuster was lik ely to develop to resolve the dilemma the senate selected four neutral vehicles minor house bills that had been awaiting senate action to each of these bills the nate added the texts of one or more of its energy bills as well as provisions of the single house bill hr 8444 it was on these bills that the house and senate eventually resolved their differences over national energy legislation even though the four bills originally had been for the relief of jack r misner and joe cortina and to suspend import duties on competition bobsleds and luges for the lake placid wi nter olympic games and on certain doxo rubicin hydrochloride antibiotics in this instance then selecting the measure washttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs6 9 once the conferees completed their work th house agreed to an unusual special rule under which it cast one vote to approve all four conference reportscomplicated by the differing situations in the two houses and was arranged through the use of four unrelated vehicles9 resorting to such convoluted procedures is unusual normally the selection of the measure is arranged routinely as th house and senate proceed toward the more difficult task of resolving their differen ces over the substance not the form of legislation two methods of resolution once the house and senate ve passed different versi ons of the same measure there are basically two methods they can us to resolve the differences between their versions one method involves conference committee panel of members representing each house that attempts to negotiate version acceptable to both chambers historically congress has sent most major bills to conference committees the other method makes conference committee unnecessary by relying instead on amendments between the houses sena amendments to the house position or house amendments to the senate position or both the two houses shuttle the measure back and forth betw een them each chamber proposing an alternative to the position of the other or insisting on its own position in the hope that both houses eventually will agree on the same position the essential nature of each method can be described relatively simply however potential complications abound occasionally some combination of the two methods may be used for example the house and senate may begin the process of resolving their differences by amending each others amendments then they may decide to go to conference if th first method is not totally or even par tially successful alternativ ely the two houses may deci immediately to create conference committee that is able to resolve some but not all of the differences between their two versions if so the two chambers may accept whatever agreements the conferees have reached and then attempt to deal with the remaining disagreements through an exchange of amendments between the houses under some circumstances the process can become even more complicated certain patterns of action are most comm on but the possible variations make the procedures at this stage of the legislativ process the most difficult to predict with any assurance moreover either house may re fuse to act at any time and at any stage of this process and if that chamber remains adamant in its refusal to act the measure dieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs7 10 note that at this point both houses have agreed to everything in the text except the portion amended by the second chamber thereafter neither chamber should propose changes in portions of the text to which both have agreed 11 measure normally can be amended in two degrees on the house or senate floor an amendment offered to the text of the measur itself is an amendment in the first degree while first degree amendment is pending that is after it has been offered but before it has been voted on an amendment may be offered to the amendment such an amendment to pending amendment is an amendment in the second degree although more complicated situations may arise both chambers generally prohibit third degree amendments in the house however substitute for first degree amendment is amendable roughly the same principles apply to amendments between the hous for more detailed descriptions of these procedures see crs report 98853 the amending process in the senate by betsy palmer and crs report 98995 the amending process in the house of representatives christopher m davisin general the house or senate cannot take any action by either method unless it is in formal possession of the papers the official copies of the measure and whatever amendments motions and acco mpanying messages have been approved by the house and senate in attempting to resolve their differences the two chambers act sequentia lly not simultaneously amendments between the houses the need to resolve differe nces arises when one house passes measure that the second chamber subsequently passes with one or more amendments10 it is these amendments that create the differences between the two houses the differences may be resolved by one chamber accepting the am endments of the other or by proposing new amendments that the other house agrees to accept within limits to be discussed the measure may be sent back and forth between the house and senate each house amending th amendments of the other in the hope that one chamber will agree to the propos als from the other when the amending opportunities are exhausted one house must accept the position of the other or the bill can die for lack of agreement alternatively at any stage during this process either house can request conference ther eby proposing to use the other method for resolving their differences then if the conference is not totally successful it may be necessary to return once again to amendments between the houses the second chambers amendm ents to the bill are the text that is subject to amendments between the houses and that text may be amended in two degrees11 assume that the house has passed hr 1 and the senate has passed the same bill with an amendment when the senate sends the bill back to the house the house may amend the senate amendment techni cally the house concurs in the senate amendment with house amendment this house amendment to the senate amendment is firstdegree amendment when the senate receives from the hous the bill with the house amendment to the senate amendment the senate may concur in the house amendment to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs8 12 the house or senate may consider third degree amendment by unanimous consent in the house it also may be considered under spension of the rules or pursuant to special rule 13 the terms recede insist and adhere have technical meanings in the legislative process when the house or senate rec edes it withdraws from previous position or action to insist and to adhere have essentially the same meaning but are terms used at different stages of the processsenate amendment if the senate does so the differences between the chambers have been resolved alternatively the senate may amend the house amendment technically the senate conc urs in the house amendment to the senate amendment with further senate amendment this further senate amendm ent is seconddegree amendment when the bill and the accompanying pape rs that is the various house and senate amendments and messages are now returned to the house that chamber may not propose further amendment that would be prohibited amendment in the third degree12 the house may concur in the fina l senate amendment in which case the differences are resolved or it may disagree to the senate amendment note that this is the first point at which disagreement has been expressed later section of this report discusses the importance of reaching the stage of disagreement if the house disagrees to the final senate amendment or to any senate amendment at some earlier stage the senate may recede from its amendment and concur in the last position offered by the h ouse thereby achieving agreement or the senate may insist on its amendment in turn if both chambers are adamant the house may insist on its disagreement the senate may adhere to its amendment and the house finally may adhere to its disagreement13 if this stage is reached the bill is almost certain to die unless one house or the other recedes from its last position this same sequence of events can begin in the senate with th subsequent actions of the chambers reversed the two houses may reach agreement at any stage of this process if one chamber concurs in the amendment of the other or recedes from its own amendment alternatively stalemate could be reached more quickly for instance if the chambers refuse to alter their original positions and proceed directly through the stages of disagreement insistence and adherence bypassing the intermediate stages at which they could offer new proposals in the form of first and seconddegree amendments between the houses fortunately the house and senate rarely reach the point of insistence and then adherence consideration of senate amendments by the house the house may consider on the floor housepassed measure with senate amendments under several circumstances 1 instead of sending the bill to conference committee 2 in the process of sending it to conference or 3 after the measure has been considered by conferen ce this section discusses house action on senate amendments either instead of or before consideration in conferencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs9 14 the same applies to senate bill with senate amendments to house amendments and to house bill with senate amendments to house amendments to senate amendmentshouse actions on senate ame ndments after conference are discussed in later sections of this report on amendments in true and technical disagreement bill that the house has passed and that the senate has amended and returned to the house usually remains at the speakers table until it is taken up again on the house floor it may be referred to house committee at the discretion of the speaker but referral to committee is not mandatory and rarely occurs the speaker is most likely to refer the bill to committee if the senate amendments are major in scope and nongermane in char acter and especially if th senate amendments would fall within the jurisdiction of house committee that had not considered the bill originally14 at this stage of the legislative process the bill and the senate amendments to it are not privileged for floor consideration by the house in other words it is not in order for the house to consider the senate amendments to the bill unless the senate amendments do not include any authorization appr opriation or revenue provisions that house rules require to be considered in committee of the whole the bill and senate amendments become privileged for house floor consideration only after the house has reached the stage of disagreement the only motion that can be made on the house floor at this stage is motion to go to conference with the senate this motion can take two forms if the senate has passed house bill with senate amendments the motion proposes that the house disagree to the senate amendments and request or agree to conference with the senate if the senate has disagreed to house amendments to senate bill and returned the bill to the house the motion proposes instead that the house insist on its amendments and request or agree to conference in either case the motion is entertained at the speakers discretion and may be made only at the direction of the committee or committees with jurisdiction over the subject of the measure the same result is achieved far more often by unanimous consent if the senate amendments require consideration in committee of the whole it is not in order to move to concur in the senate amendments thereby reaching agreement or to move to concur in th senate amendments with house amendments thereby proposing new house pos ition to the senate however such actions frequently are taken by unanimous consen t the house floor manager may ask unanimous consent for instance to take the bill hr 1 with senate amendments thereto from the speakers table and concur in the senate amendments another member generally minorityparty member of the committee of jurisdiction often reserves the right to object usually only fo r the purpose of asking the floor manager to explain the purpose of the request and the content of the senate amendments their discussion usually establishes that th senate amendments are either desirable or minor and in any case are acceptable to the representatives who know and care the most about the measure the reserva tion of objection then is withdrawn the unanimous consent request is accepted and the differences between the house and senate are thereby resolved in s imilar fashion the house may again byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs10 unanimous consent concur in some or all of the senate amendments with house amendments it bears repeating that if there is obj ection to unanimous consent request to concur in senate amendmen ts with or without house amendments motion to that effect can be made if the amendments require consideration in committee of the whole however at least two alternatives are available first the speaker may recognize the floor manager to move to spend the rules and c oncur in the senate amendments again with or without hous amendments motions to suspend the rules may be considered at the discretion of the speaker on monday or tuesday or wednesday the speaker also may entert ain motions to suspend the rules on other days by unanimous consent or pursuant to special rule such motion is debatable for forty minutes it is not amendable nd it requires support from twothirds of the members present and votin g second the rules co mmittee may report and the house may agree to special rule making in order motion to concur with or without amendments in f act the special rule even may be drafted in such way that the vote to agree to the rule is also the vote to concur in the senate amendments such resolution is known as selfexecutin g rule and may take the following form resolved that immediately upon the adoption of this resolution the bill hr 1 together with the senate amendments thereto is taken from the speakers table to the end that the senate amendments be and the same are hereby agreed to there are additional rules and precedents concerning the consideration of certain senate amendments in committee of the whole the germaneness of house amendments to senate amendments and the relative precedence of the motion to concur and the motion to concur with amendments however these rules and precedents are not often invoked at this stage of house proceedings because the measure and the senate amendments are either sent directly to conference or they are disposed of by means that waives th rules and precedents unanimous consent suspension of the rules or special rules some of these possibilities are far more likely to arise during house floor action on senate amendments in true or technical disagreement and they are discussed in later sections on those subjects consideration of house amendments by the senate when the senate receives bill with h ouse amendments it normally is held at the desk the motion to proceed to consideration of the amendments is privileged and therefore not debatable the mo tion to proceed normally is debatable moreover the consideration of these am endments suspends but does not displace the pending or unfinished business paragraph 3 of rule vii provides the presiding officer may at any time lay and it shall be in order for senator to move to lay before the sena any bill or other matter sent to the senate by the president or the house of representatives for appropriate action allowed under the rules and any question pending at that time shall be suspended for this purpose any motion so made shall be determined without debatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs11 15 for full list of available motions and their relative precedence see riddicks senate procedure pp 127130 normally the majority leader asks the presiding officer to lay before the senate the house message on bill such message may state that the house has passed certain senate bill with amendments that are stated in the message the message also may inform the senate that the house has requested conference it usually is not necessary to call up the house amendments by use of nondebatable motion they usually are considered by unanimous cons ent but unanimous consent probably is made easier to obtain by the knowledge that the nondebatable motion is in order and therefore that extended debate is not possible in many situations house amendments are not called up on the senate floor until after process of consultations and negotiations as is characteristic of the senate the majority and nority floor managers can be expected to consult with each other and to decide if the house amendments are acceptable or if the two senators can agree on amendments to those house amendments whatever agreement the floor managers reach also is discussed with other interested senators in the hope of achieving general concurrence if such concurrence is r eached it is reflected in an expeditious floor decision to agree to the house amendments with or without further senate amendments if such an agreement is not reached then variety of parliamentary options are available for acting on house amendments15 if the goal is to return the amendments to the house to further the legislative process then the basic choices before the senate are to propose change to the house amendments agree to the house amendments or to disagree to the house amendments more formally the three central motions to dispose of house amendments prior to the stage of disagreement are 1 that the senate concur in the house amendments with senate amendments 2 that the nate concur in the house am endments or 3 that the senate disagree to the house amendments any of these motions are debatable and therefore subject to being filibustered it is possible for multiple motions to dispose of house amendment to be pending at the same time the motions ar listed above in their order of precedence motion can be understood to have preced ence over another if it may be offered while the other is pending and it is disposed of first thus with motion to disagree pending motion to concur and motion to concur with an amendment could be offered and would be voted on first if motion to concur with an amendment were pending however neither motion to c oncur nor motion to disagree could be offered until the senate disposed of the motion to concur with an amendment furthermore if the house has proposed several amendments to the senate bill or senate amendment then the senate c ould take different actions on each of the house amendments when the senate receives multiple amendments from the house it considers them in the order that they affect the senate text single motion can be made to dispose of several amendm ents as long as it is the same form of disposition for example to concur but ch motion would be subject to divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs12 16 in the 110th congress many congressional observers reported an increase in the number of major bills on which differences were resolved through informal negotiations and amendments between the houses for more information on this trend see crs report rl34611 whither the role of conference committees an analysis by walter j oleszekat least in part due to the potential for procedural complexity in relation to consideration of house amendments in recent congresses the majority leader has used his right of preferential recognition to offer motion to concur in house amendments as well as all the other available amendatory motions related to it this process has been referred to as filling the tree the procedural effect of filling the tree or offering all of the amendatory motions available in particular parliamentary situation is that nator can propose an alternative method of acting on the house amendments until the senate disposes of or lays aside by unanimous consent one of the pending motions filling the tree does not affect the right of senators to debate the motions regarding house amendments at length it does not therefore bring the senate any closer to final disposition of the house am endments if however the majority leader can build coalition of at least 60 senato rs assuming vacancies in the senate in order to invoke cloture then he can fill the tree to block other senators from having an opportunity to propose other ways of disposing of house amendments including perhaps the opportunity to propose senate amendments to the house amendments prior to senate disposition of the house amendments in recent congresses the majority leader has filled the tree and then filed cloture motion in order to end consideration of an underlying question if the senate agrees to invoke cloture on motion to dispose of the house amendments such as motion to concur then all other pending motions of higher precedence fall the motion on which cloture was invoked can then be considered fo r maximum of 30 additional hours the informal alternative to conference if the house and senate versions of measure are submitted to conference the conference committee must meet formally nd if it resolves some or all of the differences between the houses prepare both conference report and joint explanatory statement to avoid these and other requirements the two chambers may use the process of sending amendmen ts between the houses as an informal alternative that achieves much the same purpose and result as would conference committee16 the purpose of conference committee is to negotiate settlement of the legislative differences between the two ch ambers but these negotiations do not have to take place in the official setting of conference committee meeting they also can occur through informal discussions among the most interested representatives and senators and their staffs if such informal discussions are successful their results can be embodied in an amendment between the houses as the second house nears or reaches co mpletion of floor action on measure the staffs of the respective house and senate committees are likely to be comparinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs13 the two versions of the bill and seekin g grounds for ttling whatever differences exist after initial staff discussions the house and senate committee leaders themselves may become involved if th informal and fficial conversations appear productive they may continue until tentative agreement is reached even though conference committee has yet been created if the tentative agreement proves acceptable to other interested representatives and senators conference committee may be unnecessary instead when the bill with the second houses amendments has been returned to the first chamber the majority floor manager may under the appropriate rules or practices of that house call up the bill and propose that the house or senate as the case may be concur in the second chambe rs amendments with some amendments he or she then describes the differences between the house and senate versions of the measure and explains th at the proposed amendments represent compromise that is agreeable to the interested members of both houses the floor managers may express their confidence that if the firs t house accepts the amendments the other chamber also will accept them if the first house does agree to th amendments the second chamber then considers and agrees to them as well under its procedures for considering amend ments of the other body in this way the differences between the house and senate are resolved through the kind of negotiations for which conference com mittees are created but without reso rt to formal conference committee the stage of disagreement since the purpose of conference committees is to resolve legislative dis agreements between the house and senate it follows that there can be conference committee until there is disagreement until the house and senate formally state their disagreement to each others positions chamber reaches this stage either by formally insisting on its own position or by disagreeing to the position of the other house and so informing the other house on ce the house or senate reaches the stage of disagreement it cannot then agree to concur in position of the other chamber or agree with an amendment without first receding from its disagreement the stage of disagreement is an important threshold before this threshold is reached the two chambers presumably are still in the process of reaching agreement thus amendments between the houses as an alternative to conference are couched in terms of one chamber concurring in the others amendments or concurring in the others amendments with amendments for example when the house concurs in senate amendments with house amendments the house does so because it does not accept the senate amendments in fact it disagrees with them but the house does not state its disagreement explicitly and form ally at this stage because crossing the threshold of disagreement has significant pr ocedural consequences especially in the househttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs14 17 in the senate there are three procedural steps the senate must take to send bill to conference the steps are usually taken by unanimous consent and without this consent they have to potential to be timeconsuming for more information see crs report continuedwhereas house amendments are always privileged in the senate most senate amendments are not privileged in the house before the house has reached the stage of disagreement moreover the order of precedence among certain motions is reversed in the house but not in the senate after the stage of disagreement has been reached before the stage of disagreement the order of precedence among motions in both chambers favors motions that tend to perfect the measure further after the stage of disagreement in the house the order of precedence is reversed with precedence being given to motions that tend to promote agreement between the chambers before the stage of disagreement for example motion to concur with an amendment has precedence over motion to concur after the stage of disagreement in the house motion to recede and concur has preceden ce over motion to recede and concur with an amendment the precedence among motions before and after the stage of disagreement can become important during the process of exchanging amendments between the houses it is most likely to matter after conference committee has reported and the house and senate are considering amendments in true or technical disagreement for this reason more detailed discussi on of the subject is reserv ed to the sections on such amendments arranging for conference if the differences between the house and senate cannot be re solved through the exchange of amendments between the houses two po ssibilities remain first stalemate can lead to the death of the legislation if both chambers remain adamant or second the two houses can agree to cr eate conference committee to discuss their differences and seek mutually satisfactor resolution historically major bills have been sent to conference committee either after an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the differences through amendments between the houses or more often without such an attempt having even being made the process of arranging for conferen ce can begin as soon as the second house passes the bill at issue either with one or more amendments to parts of the measure or with single amendment in the nature of substitute that replaces the entire text approved by the first chamber the sec ond house then may simply return the bill with its amendments to the first chamber if there is reason to believe that the first house might accept the amendments or that amendments between the houses can be used successfully as an informal alternative to conference it also may do so if the second house wishes to act first on an ev entual conference report because the chamber that asks for conference normally acts last on the conference report alternatively and more commonly the second house may pass the bill and immediately insist on its amendments and also request conference with the first chamber17 by insisting on its amendments th second chamber reaches the stage ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs15 17 continued rs20454 going to conference in the senate by elizabeth rybicki 18 this possibility is discussed in the secti on on floor consideration of conference reportsdisagreement the bill the second house s amendments and th message requesting conference then are returned to the fi rst house the first house is not obliged to disagree to the second chambe rs amendments and agree to the requested conference the first house also has the options for ex ample of refusing to act at all or concurring in the second ch amber amendments with or without amendments when one chamber requests conference however the other house normally agrees to the request if the second chamber just returns the b ill and its amendments to the first house without insisting on its amendments the first house may disagree to the amendments and request conference the bill the amendments and the message requesting the conference then are returned to the s econd chamber which usually insists on its amendments thereby reaching the stage of disagreement and agrees to the conference thus there are essentially two direct routes to conference there are more indirect routes of course if an attemp t is first made to resolve the differences through an exchange of amendments the second house may begin the process by insisting on its amendments and requesting the conference if this does not occur the first house then may begin the process by disagreeing to the second chambers amendments and requesting the conference itself the first route is likely to be followed when the need for conference is foregone conclusion however strategic considerations also may influence how the senate and house agree to go to conference especially in view of the convention that the chamber which asks for the conference normally acts last on the conference report with this in mind proponents of the legi slation may prefer one route to the other for example house or senate conferees can avoid the possibility of facing motion in one house to recommit the conference report w ith or without instructions if they have arranged for the other house to act first on the report18 by the same token if senate opponents are expected to filibus ter the conference report proponents may prefer for the senate to agree to house request for conference so that the senate will act first on the report this arrangement avoids compelling representatives to cast difficult votes for or against conference report that may not reach vote in the senate on the other hand bills supporters could prefer that the house agree to the conference and then vote first on the repor t with the hope that successful house vote might improve the prospects fo r later success on the senate floor selection of conferees after either house requests or agrees to conference it usually proceeds immediately to select conferees or managers as they also may be called the selection of conferees can be critically important because it is this group httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs16 sometimes small group of representatives and senato rs who usually determine the final form and conten t of major legislation in the house clause 11 of rule i author izes the speaker to appoint all members of conference committees and gives him certain guidelines to follow the speaker shall appoint all select joint and conference committees ordered by the house at any time after an original appointment the speaker may remove members delegates or the resident commissioner from or appoint additional members delegates or th resident commissioner to select or conference committee in appointing members delegates or the resident commissioner to conference committees the speaker shall appoint less than majority who generally supported the house position as determined by the speaker shall name members who are primarily responsible for the legislation and shall to the fullest extent feasib include the principal proponents of the major provisions of the bill or resolution passed or adopted by the house these guidelines carry weight as admoniti ons but they necessarily give the speaker considerable discretion and he r exercise of this discre tion cannot be challenged on the floor through point of order in the senate the presiding officer is lmost always authorized to appoint the managers on the part of the senate s hould the senate fail to give the presiding officer this authority however senators would elect their conferees motion to elect certain senators as conferees is both debatable and amendable before the formal announcement of conf erees in each chamber process of consultation takes place that vests great influence with the chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee and sometimes the subcommittee that had considered the bill originally these representatives and senators almost always serve as conferees furthermore they us ually play an influe ntial and often controlling role in deciding the number of conferees from their respective chambers the party ratio among these conferees and which of their committee colleagues shall be appointed to the conference committee in the house the speaker often accepts without change the list developed by th house committee leaders the presiding officer in the senate always does so if the bill at issue had been considered by more than one committee in either house all the involved chairmen and ranki ng minority members from that chamber normally participate in determining its rost er of conferees and the conferees usually are drawn from both or all of those committees in such cases the party leaders in each house are more likely to become i nvolved in the selection process in determining the total number of house or senate conferees and the division of conferees between or among the committees of jurisdiction as well as in choosing individual members to serve from time to time th speaker also exercises the authority granted in the rule to appoint representative who offered key successful floor amendment even if he or she is not on the committees that reported the legislation in some cases and especially in cases of multiple committee jurisdiction house or senate conferees may be appointed for limited purposes for example onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs17 19 because the motion to instruct may be made only before the conferees are named it is less likely to be viewed as challe nge to the intentions of the members appointed as managersfor the consideration of title i of the h ouse version or only for the consideration of particular and possibly n ongermane senate amendment such conferees are expected to limit their participation in the conference to consideration of the matters for which they are appointed this prac tice protects the preponderant influence in conference of the appropriate house and senate standing committees each house determines for itself the size of its delegation to the conference committee the house and senate need not select equal numbers of conferees and they frequently do not however unequal numbers of house nd senate managers do not affect the formal power of eith er house in conference decisions the conference report requires pproval by majority of the house conferees and majority of the senate conferees rather than major ity of all conferees each house usually appoints an odd number of conferees to avoid tie votes instructing conferees after the house or senate decides to go to conference either by requesting the conference or agreeing to request from the other house its conferees usually are appointed immediately between these two steps however both houses have an opportunity although usually only momentar opportunity to move to instruct the conferees19 for example the managers may be instructed to insist on the position of their house on certain matter or even to recede to the position of the other house instructions are not binding in either house they are only admonitions or advisory expressions of position or preferen ce point of order lies in either the house or the senate against conferen ce report on the ground that conferees did not adhere to the instructions they received in the senate motion to instruct is debatable and amendable in the house such motion is debated under the onehour rule and germane amendment to the instructions is in order only if the hous does not order the previous question during or at the end of the first hour of debate in neither house can conferees be instructed to take some action that exceeds their authority in the house clause 7 of rule xxii also bars instructions that include argument only one valid motion to instruct is in order in the house before its confer ees are named whether or not the motion is agreed to but if motion to instruct is ruled out of order another motion to instruct may be made under the precedents of the house mber of the minority party is entitled to recognition to move to instruct the speaker normally looks first to senior minority party members of the committee that reported the measure at issue this recognition practice can be used to try to control the instructions that are proposedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs18 20 however the house may amend the instructi ons if it has not already ordered the previous question on the motion such an amendment must be germane to either the house or senate versions of the bill but not necessarily to the instructions to which the amendment is proposed 21 it is possible for senate conferees to be instructed by resolution while bill is in conferencefor example instructions on one subject may be precluded if the ranking minority member seeks recognition to offer mo tion to instruct on another subject20 in the house but not in the senate motions to instruct also are in order after house conferees have been appointed bu t have failed to report an agreement21 clause 7c1 of house ru xxii provides in part motion to instruct managers on the part of the house or motion to discharge all managers on the part of the house and to appoint new conferees shall be privileged after conference committee has been appointed for 20 calendar days and 10 legislative days without making report by precedent more than one proper motion to instruct is in order when made pursuant to this clause and the minority party does not enjoy preferential recognition in offering such motions according to cl ause 7c2 the speaker may designate time in the legislative schedule on that legislative day for consideration of the motion to instruct restrictions on the authority of conferees in principle there are significant restrictions on the kinds of policy agreements that house conferees can accept in practice however these restrictions are not as stringent as they might seem at first because conference committees are created to resolv disagreements between the house and senate the authority of house conferees is limited to the matters in disagreement between the two houses hous conferees have authority to change matters that are not in disagreement that is either matters that appear in the house and senate versions of the measure in identical form or matters that were not submitted to the conference in either the house or the senate version furthermore as house conferees consid er each matter in disagreement their authority is limited by the scope of the differences between the house and senate positions on that matter the houses managers may agree on the house position the senate position or some middle ground but they may not include provision in conference report that does not fall with in the range of options defined by the house position at one extreme and the senate position at the other if for example the house proposes to appropriate 1 b illion for certain purpose and the senate proposes 2 billion instead the house conf erees may agree on 1 billion or 2 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs19 22 clause 5 of house rule xxii also restrict s the authority of house conferees to include certain kinds of senate amendments in conf erence reports on general appropriations bills these restrictions are discussed in the sec tion on amendments in technical disagreementor any intermediate figure but they may not agree on figure that is less than 1 billion or more than 2 billion to do so would exceed the scope of the differences between the house and senate positi ons on that matter in disagreement the concept of scope relates to speci fic differences between the house and senate versions of the same measure not to the impli cations or consequences of these differences thus house conferees on general appropriations bill may agree on the higher or lower of the house and senate positions on each appropriation item even though the sum of their agreements is higher or lower than the total sum proposed in either the house or the senate version of the bill unless the two versions explicitly state such total also if one house proposes to amend some existing law and the other chamber does not the scope of the differences over this matter generally is bounded by the proposed amendm ents on the one hand and the pertinent provisions of existing law on the other thus the house conferees may agree on the proposed amendments or on alternatives that are closer to existing law thus there are significant restrictions on the authority of house conferees their authority is restricted by the scope of the differences between the house and senate over the matters in disagreement between them22 however it is far easier to make this statement than to apply it in all cases it becomes much more difficult to define the scope of the differences when the differences are qualitative not quantitative as in the example above moreover how diffi cult it is to define the scope of the differences also depends on how the sec ond chamber to act on the measure has cast the matters in disagreement if one house takes up measure from the other and passes the measure with series of amendments to the first chambers text then the matters in disagreement in conference are cast in terms of two or mo re discrete amendments approved by the second house to pass the bill these amendments usually are numbered for convenient reference the two versions of the measure can be compared side by side to identify the provisions that are identical in both versions and those that are the subject of disagreements therefore it is possible to identify both the matters in disagreement and the house and senate positions on each of them however the second chamber that acts on measure typically casts its version in the form of an amendment in the nature of substitute for the entire text passed by the first house in such cases only one amendment is submitted to conference even though that single amendment may encompass any number of specific differences between the house and senate vers ions of the measure in fact the text of the bill as passed by one house and the xt of the other houses amendment in the nature of substitute may embody wholly di fferent approaches to the subject of the measure the two versions may be orga nized differently and may address the same subject in fundamenta lly different wayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs20 23 conference reports also are subject to points of order if they violate certain provisions of the budget act second house substitutes make it much hard er if not impractical to specifically identify each matter in disagreement and the scope of the differences over that matter when second chamber substitute is in c onference therefore the conferees must have somewhat greater room for maneuver technically the house and senate are in disagreement over the entire text of the measure substantively the policy disagreements may be almost as profound in such cases the conferees resolve the differences between the house and senate by creating third version of the measure conference substitute for both the vers ion originally passed by the first house and the amendment in the nature of substitute approved by the second house this latitude may be necessary but it also means that the conference substitute could take the form of th ird and new approach to the subject at hand an approach that had not been considered on the floor of either house to inhibit such result clause 9 of house rule xxii states that whenever disagreement to an amendment has been committed to conference committee the managers on the part of the house may propose substitute that is germane modification of the matter in disagreement the introduction of any language presenting specific additiona l matter not committed to the conference committee by either house does not constitute germane modification of the matter in disagreement moreover conference report may not include matter not committed to the conference committee by either house and may not include modification of specific matter committed to the conference committee by either or both houses if that modifica tion is beyond the scope of that specific matter as committed to the conference committee notwithstanding this specificity determining whether conference substitute includes some new matter is far more difficult than determining whether the conferees agreement on an appropriation for program falls within the scope of the differences between the funding levels orig inally proposed by the house and senate if the house conferees have exceeded their authority in any one respect in agreeing to conference report that report as whole is tainted and so is subject to point of order on the house floor23 however there are at least three reasons why it is relatively unusual for point of orde r to be made and sustained against conference report first house conferees are aware of the limits within which they are to negotiate and they us ually try not to exceed their authority second conferees frequently are presented with second cham ber substitutes and in those cases they have somewhat greater discretion in the agreements they can reach third even if the house managers propose conference report that exceeds their authority there are several ways in which they can protect their report against being subject to point of order on th house floor if the conferees were negotiating over separate numbered amendmen ts and their agreement concerning one or more of the amendments is beyond their authority they can report those amendments back to the house and senate as amendments in technical disagreement however conferees may not report back in disagreement on part of an amendmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs21 24 riddicks senate procedure p 484in the nature of substitute alterna tively the house can approve conference report by twothirds vote under suspension of the rules procedure which does not allow points of order to be made on the floor finally and perhaps most important in current practice the house rules committee may propose that the house approve special rule waiving any or all points of order against conference report and against its consideration even if conference report is ruled out of order it may then be possible to propose precisely the same agreements that were contained in the report in the form of amendments between the houses if the amendments are not in the third degree and do not contain nongermane matter the senates rules and precedents embody roughly the same principles regarding restrictions on the authority of its conferees paragra phs 2 and 3 of senate rule xxviii state in part that 2 conferees shall not insert in th eir report matter not committed to them by either house nor shall they strike from the bill matter agreed to by both houses b if matter which was agreed to by both houses is stricken from the bill point of order may be made against the report nd if the point of order is sustained the report is rejected or shall be recommitte d to the committee of conference if the house of representatives has not already acted thereon c if new matter is inserted in the report point of order may be made against the conference report and it shall be disposed of as provided under paragraph 4 3 in any case in which disagreement to an amendment in the nature of substitute has been referred to conferees 1 it shall be in order for the conferees to report substitute on the same subject matter 2 the conferees may not include in th report matter not committed to them by either house and 3 the conferees may include in their re port in any such case matter which is germane modification of subjects in disagreement historically the senate has interprete d its rules and precedents affecting the content of conference reports in ways that grant conferees considerable latitude in reaching agreements with the house according to riddicks senate procedure for example conference report may not include new matter entirely irrelevant to the subject matter not contained in the house or senatepassed ve rsions of measure as distinct from substitute therefor24 and regarding conference substitutes senate precedents state that in such cases they the conferees have the entire subject before them with little limitation placed on their discretion except as tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs22 25 ibid p 463 26 for more information on the applicability of paragraph 8 of rule xliv see letter from the

deciding whet her new matter is sufficiently relevant to constitute germane modification of subjects in disagreement the authority of senate conferees is further limited by paragraph 8 of senate rule xliv senator can raise point of order against provisions of conference report if they constitute new directed spending provisions paragraph 8 defines new directed spending provision as any item that consists of specific provision containing specific level of funding for any specific account specific program specific project or specific activity when specific funding was provided for such specific account specific program specific project or specific activity in the measure originally committed to the conferees by either house paragraph 8 of sena rule xliv applies only to provisions of conference reports that would provide for actual spe nding in other words it applies only to discretionary and mandatory spending pr ovisions and not to authorizations of appropriations26 discretionary spending is pr ovided in appropriations acts and generally funds many of the programs agen cies and routine opera tions of the federal government mandatory spending also refe rred to as direct spending is provided in or controlled by authorizin g law and generally funds entitlement programs such as social security and medicare27 the senate can waive both of these restrictions on the content of conference reports by threefifths vote of sena tors duly chosen and sworn 60 senators assuming vacancies the process for waiving point of order as well as the effect of successful point of order raised under either of these rules are discussed in later section of this report on fl oor consideration of conference reports conference procedures and reports rules of procedure guide and constrain the legislative activities of both the house and senate so it is striking th at there are almost rules governing procedure in conference the member s of each conference committee can select their own chairman they so can decide for themselves whether they wish to adopt any formal rules governing such matters as debate quorums proxy voting or amendments but usually they do not the only rules imposed by the two houses governing conference committee meetings concern approval of the conference report and the openness of meetings to all conferees and to the publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs23 28 the sense of the senate on conference committee protocols was included in the honest leadership and open governme nt act of 2007 pl 11081 sec 515 majority of the house managers and majority of the senate managers must approve and sign the conference report decisions are never made by vote among all the conferees combined all votes take place within the house delegation and within the senate delegation this is why there is requirement or necessity for the two houses to appoint the same number of conferees five nate conferees for example enjoy the same formal collective power in conference as 25 house conferees until the mid1970s conference meetings were almost always closed to the public now they are open unless specific deci sion is made to close part or all of meeting paragraph 8 of senate rule xxviii states that each conference committee between the senate and the house of representatives shall be open to the public except when managers of either the senate or the house of representatives in open session determine by rollcall vote of majority of those managers present that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on the day of the vote shall be closed to the public the comparable house rule is even more stringent clause 12 of house rule xxii requires majority vote on the house floor to close part or all of conference meeting in other words house conferees cannot vote to close conference committee meeting unless they have been authorized to do so by specific rollcall vote of the house this difference between house and senate ru has not been source of public contention because efforts to close conferences normally are made only when they must deal with national security matters when house managers want the authority to close part or all of formal conference meeting they usually offer motion to this effect at the time the house arranges to go to conference house rules place additional requireme nts on conference committee meetings according to clause 12 of house rule xxii managers should endeavor to ensure that meetings only occur if every house manager has been given notice and an opportunity to attend the house rule also explicitly states that all matters in disagreement are open to discussion at an c onference meeting if point of order is made and sustained on the house floor that conferees met in viol ation of clause 12 or that they never met at all the conference report is rejected and the house is considered to have requested fu rther conference with the senate similarly the senate has agreed that it is sense of the senate that conferees should hold regular formal meetings of all conferees that are open to the public that conferees should be given adequate notice of such meetings and that all conferees should be given an opportunity to participate in full and complete debates of the matters before the conference28 few other rules govern conference proceedings nor do conference committees often vote to establish their own rules in stead they generally manage without them this absence of rules reflects the basic nature of the conference committee as ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs24 29 the preparation of such documents is not requi red but they are particularly useful to help conferees identify and compare the corresponding house and senate provisions of large and complex bills these sidebysides as they often are called sometimes are available from the house or senate committee of jurisdiction however they are not generally available for public distribution to the same extent as house and senate reports and documents for example negotiating forum in which the negotiators should be free to decide for themselves how to proceed most effectively in some cases conferences are rather formal one delegation puts proposal on the table the other delegation consider s it and responds with counter proposal in other cases conferences resemble freefo rm discussions in which the issues and the matters in disagreement are discussed w ithout any apparent ag enda or direction until the outlines of compromise begin to emerge in recent years conferences on massive omnibus bills have even created subconferences to seek agreements which then can be combined into single conference report sometimes customary practices develop among members of house and senate committees who meet with each other regula rly in conference for example they may alternate the chairmanship from one conference to the next between the committee or subcommittee chairmen from each house conference bargaining also can be facilitated by preliminary staff work staff may prepare sidebyside comparisons of the house and senate vers ions so that the conferees can understand more easily how the two houses dealt with the same issues or problems29 furthermore senior staff may engage in preliminary negotiations among themselvesseeking agreements acceptable to their principals so that the members themselves can concentrate on the more intractable disagreements when the conferees reach full agreement staff prepare conference report which indicates how each amendment in disagreement has been resolved for example the report may propose that the senate recede from certain of its amendments to the house bill that the house recede from its disagreement to certain other senate amendments and that the house recede from its disagreement to the remaining senate amendments and concur in each with house amendment the text of which is made part of the report when the conferees have considered single amendment in the nature of substitute the report proposes that the house which originated the bill recede from its disagr eement to the other houses substitute and concur in that amendment in the nature of substitute with substitute amendment that is the new version of the bill on which the conference committee has agreed two copies of the conference report must be signed by majority of house conferees and majority of senate conferees add itional or minority views may be included in the report from time to time managers signature may be accompanied by an indication that he or she does not concur in the conference agreement on certain numbered amendment this does not make the report subject to point of order in the house so long as majority of house conferees have agreed on each numbered amendment house rules require that house conferees be given an opportunity to sign the conference agreem ent at set time and place at least onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs25 30 this practice is stated in section xlvi of jeffersons manual 31 rather than violate the customary order fo r considering conference reports the same end can be achieved by arranging for one house to request the conference instead of agreeing to request by the othercopy of the final conference agreement must be made available for review by house managers with the signature sheets the conference report itself is not the most informative document because it does not describe the nature of the disagreements that confronted the conferees therefore the rules of both houses require that conference report be accompanied by joint explanatory statement according to paragraph 6 of senate rule xxviii this statement is to be sufficiently detailed and explicit to inform the senate as to the effect which the amendments or propositions contained in such report will have upon the measure to which those amendments or propositions re late clause 7e of house rule xxii contains comparable requirement normally this joint explanatory statement summarizes the house senate and conference positions on each amendment in disagreement or each provision in the case of second chamber and conference substitutes the statement also is prepared in duplicate and signed by majorities of both house and senate conferees the house that agreed to the conference normally acts first on the conference report30 because this is an established prac tice not requirement of either house or senate rules the order of consideration can be reversed if that is strategically advantageous for example the house may wish to delay acting on report until after the senate has voted on it because of the possibility that the report may fall victim to senate filibuster alternatively senate conferees may agree that the house should act first if the report is likel to enjoy greater support in the house in the belief or hope that the house vote will increase the prospects for approving the report in the senate31 also the first house to consider conf erence report has the option of voting to recommit the report to conference if and wh either house agrees to the report the effect of that vote is to discharge that houses conferees so there longer is conference committee to which the report can be recommitted therefore the second house to consider the report does not have the option of recommitting it it only may accept or reject the report sometimes ther efore the supporters of bill arrange for one house or the other to act first on the conference report in order to avoid the possibility of successful recommittal mo tion whatever the case may be the conferees must see to it that the house they want to act first takes the papers out of the conference if conferees cannot agree on any of the amendments before them or if they cannot agree on all matters encompasse d by one houses bill and the others substitute they may report back in disagreement the house and senate then can seek resolution of the differences either through second conference or through an exchange of amendments and motions be tween the houses conferees also may report in total disagreement if they have reached an agreement on bill and second chamber substitute which in some respect violates their authority in such casehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs26 32 in contemporary practice adjournment reso lutions usually are not approved until very shortly before the adjournment takes place this often makes it impossible to know when the last six days begin to achieve the same end the house may adopt as the end of the session approaches resolution reported from the rules committee that triggers certain provisions of house rules and waives others for the duration of the session 33 such resolution always is in order notw ithstanding the usual requirement that two thirds vote is necessary for the house to consider resolution from the rules committee on the same day the resolution is reportedtheir disagreement is technical not substantive after the house receives or the senate agrees to the report in disagreement the conferees actual agreement is presented as floor amendment to the amendment in disagreement at which point considerations of the conferees authority longer apply alternatively the conferees may submit their report to the house and senate even though it violates their authority in one or more respects and then in the house the rules committee can propose and the house can adopt reso lution protecting the report against points of order floor consideration of conference reports conference report may be presented or filed at almost any time the house or senate is in session but not when the senate is in executive session or when the house has resolved into committee of the whole conference report is unlikely to be considered immediately because both the house and senate have layover and availability requirements that apply to conference reports in the house conference reports are subject to three day layover requirement clause 8a of rule xxii prohibits consider ation of conference report until the third day usually excluding weekends and legal holidays after the report and joint explanatory statement has been available in the congressional record these requirements do not apply durin g the last six days of session32 in addition copies of the report and the statement must be available for at least two hours before consideration of the report be gins clause 2b applies the same requirements and conditions to amendments reported from conf erence in disagreement however the house may waive these restrictions by adopting resolution reported from the rules committee for that purpose33 conference report that meets the availability requirements is considered as having been read when called up for consid eration in the house if report does not meet one or more of the requirements but is called up by unanimous consent it must be read however the house normally ag rees by unanimous consent to have the joint explanatory statement read instead of the report and then it also agrees to dispense with the reading of the statement conference reports are highly privileged in the house and may be called up at almost any time that anothe r matter is not pending when called up the report is considered in the house not in committ ee of the whole under the onehour rule clause 8d of rule xxii requires that this hour be equally divided between thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs27 34 several exceptions for example while the journal is being read or quorum call is in progress are listed in paragraph 1 of rule xxviiimajority and minority par ties not necessarily betw een proponents and opponents the two floor managers normally explain the agreements reached in conference and then yield time to other members who wish to speak on the report if both floor managers support the report member w ho opposes it is entitled to claim control of onethird of the time for debate before second hour of bate can begin the majority floor manager moves the previous question if agreed to as it invariably is this motion shuts off further debate and the house immediately votes on agreeing to the conference report any points of order against conference report in the house must be made or reserved before debate on th report begins or before the joint explanatory statement is read conference report can be protect ed against one or more points of order if the rules committee reports and the h ouse adopts resolution waiving the applicable rules or if the report is considered under suspension of the rules in the senate paragraph 1 of senate rule xxviii requires that conference report must be available on each senators desk before the senate may consider it in addition under paragraph 9 of that same rule it is not in order to vote on the adoption of conference re port unless it has been available to members and the general public for at least 48 hours before th vote this availability requirement can be waived by threefifths of senators duly chosen and sworn 60 nators if there are vacancies it can also be waived by joint agreement of the majority and minority leader in the case of significant disrupti on to senate facilities or to the availability of the internet under the rule report is considered to be available to the general public if it is posted on c ongressional website or on website controlled by the library of congress or the governme nt printing office the report and accompanying statement normally are not printed in the senate section of the record if they have been printed in the house s ection conference reports also normally are printed only as house documents conference reports are privileged in the nate the motion to consider report on the senate floor is in order at most times34 and it is not debata ble the senates usual practice is to take up conference reports by unanimous consent at times arranged in advance among the floor and committee leaders under standing order the senate adopted at the close of the 106th congress in december 2000 the reading of conference report longer is required if the report is available in the senate when considered on the senate floor conference report is debatable under normal senate procedures it is subject to extended debate unless the time for debate is limited by unanimous consent or cloture or if the senate is considering the report under an expedited procedures establishe d by law such as the procedures for considering budget resolutions and budget reconciliation measures under the budget act paragraph 7 of senate rule xxviii states that if time for debating conference report is limited presumably by unanimous consent that time shall be equally divided between the majority and minority parties not necessarily between proponents and opponents of the re port consideration of conference report by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs28 35 for more information see crs report rs22733 senate rules changes in the 110th congress affecting restrictions on the content of conference reports by elizabeth rybicki 36 the form of the motion depends on what the house and senate sent to conference very often house bill and senate amendment are sent to conference the motion in that case would be for the senate to recede from its am endment and concur in the house bill with further senate amendment consisting of the conference committee compromise without the new matter or new directed spending provision if senate bill and house amendment were sent to conference the motion would be that the senate recede from its disagreement to the house amendment and concur in the house amendment with further amendment 37 paragraph 4b2 of rule xxviii paragraph 8b2 of rule xlivsenate suspends but does not displace an pending or unfinished business after disposition of the report that busin ess again is before the senate point of order may be made against conference report at any time that it is pending on the senate floor or after all time for debate has expired or has been yielded back if the report is considered unde r time agreement if point of order is sustained against conference report on the grounds that conferees exceeded their authority either by including new matter rule xxviii or new directed spending provisionsparagraph 8 of rule xliv in the conference report then there is special procedure to strike out the offending portions of the conference recommendation and continue consider ation of the rest of the proposed compromise35 under the new procedure nator can make point of order against one or more provisions of confer ence report if the point of order is not waived see below the presiding officer rules whether or not the provision is in violation of the rule if point of order is raised against more than one provision the presiding officer may ma ke separate decisions regarding each provision senate rules provide furthe r that when the presiding officer sustains point of order against conference report on the grounds that it violates either the prohibition of new matter or new directed spending provisions the matter is to be stricken from the conference recommendation after all points of order raised under this procedure are disposed of the senate proceeds to consider motion to send to the house in place of the original conference agreement proposal consisting of the text of the conference agreement minus the new matter or new directed spending provision that was stricken36 amendments to this motion are not in order the motion is debatable under the same debate limitation as the conference report37 in short the terms for consideration of the motion to send to the house the proposal without the offending provisions are the same as those that would have applied to the conference report itself if the senate agrees to the motion th conference recommendation as altered by the deletion of the new matter or new directed spending provision would be returned to the house in the form of an amendment between the houses the house would then have an opportunity to act on the amendment under the regular house procedures for considering nate amendments discussed in earlier sections of this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs29 senate rules also create mechanism for waiving these restrictions on conference reports senators can move to wa ive points of order ag ainst one or several provisions or they can make one motion to waive all possible points of order under either rule xxviii or rule xliv paragraph 8 motion to waive all points of order is not amendable but motion to waive points of order against specific provisions is time for debate on mo tion to waive is limited to one hour and is divided equally between the majority l eader and the minority leader or their designees if the motion to waive garn ers the necessary support the senate is effectively agreeing to keep the matter that is potentially in violation of either rule in the conference report the rules further require th reefifths vote to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair and limit debate on an appeal to one hour equally divided between the party leaders or their designees the purpose of these requirements is to ensure that either method by which the senate could choos to apply these rules through motion to waive or through an appeal of th ruling of the chair requires threefifths vote of the senate usually 60 senators simple majority 51 senators if there are vacancies and all senators are votin g cannot achieve the same outcome conference reports may not be amended on the floor of either house conferees are appointed to negotiate over the differen ces between the versions of the same bill that the two houses have passed the dele gations return to their respective chambers with identical recommendations in the fo rm of report that proposes package settlement of all these differences the house and senate may accept or reject the settlement but they may not amend it directly if conference reports were amendable the process of resolving bicameral diffe rences would be far more tortuous and possibly interminable as noted in previous sections the hous that agrees to the request for conference normally acts first on the report the first chamber to act may vote to agree or not agree to the report or it ma agree to preferential motion to recommit the report to conference with or wit hout nonbinding instructions successful recommittal motions are quite unusual in part b ecause such an action implies that the conferees should and could have reached more desirable compromise if the first house agrees to the report the s econd house only has the options of approving or disapproving the report at this st age the report cannot be recommitted vote by either house to agree to conferen ce report has the effect of automatically discharging its conferees and disbanding the conference committee thus there is conference committee to which the s econd house could recommit the report the defeat of conference report in either house may kill the legislation but only if further action is taken such as requesting second conference or proposing new pos ition through an amendment between the houses for lack of time second conference may not be practi cal near the end of congress when many conference reports are considered the vote to agree to conference repor t normally completes that houses action on the measure assuming the other house so approves the report however some conference reports especially those on general appropriations bills may be accompanied by one or more amendments in either true or technical disagreementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs30 furthermore house rules include special procedures for coping with conference report provisions originating in the senate that would not have been germane floor amendments to the bill in the house these possibilities are discussed in separate sections that follow amendments in true disagreement it is generally in the interests of both the house and senate managers and their parent chambers for the conf erees to reach full agreemen t each house already has passed version of the legi slation and has entrusted th responsibility for resolving its differences with the other house to mbers who usually we re actively involved in developing and promoting the measure nonetheless c onferees sometimes cannot reach agreement on all the amendments in disagreement in such case the conferees may return to the house and senate with partial conference report dealing with the amendments on which they have reached agreement but excluding one or more amendments that remain in disagreement the result is complicated and potentially confusing procedural possibilities that fortunately do not often arise in current practice the house that agreed to the conference first debates and vot on the partial conference report after the report is approved the reading clerk reads or designates the first amendment in disagreement and the majority floor manager offers motion to dispose of the amendment when this process begins in the house for example the floor manager may move that the house insist on its disagreement to senate amendment agreeing to this motion implies that the house adamantly supports its original position and that the house wishes the senate to recede from its amendment alternatively the floor manager may move that the house either 1 recede from its disagreement to the senate amendment and concur in that amendment or 2 recede and concur with house amendment in the latter case this house amendment which must be germane to the senate amendment may be the position that the house managers had been advocating in c onference or it may be new compromise position they have developed by agreeing to this mo tion the h ouse supports the negotiating position of its confer ees and asks the senate to concur in this new house amendment after the house disposes of the first amendment in disagreement it acts in similar fashion on each of the other amendments that were not resolved in conference the house then sends all the papers to the senate with message describing its actions if the senate agrees to the partial conference report and to the house position on all the amendments in disagreement on whic h senate action is required the legislative process is completed and the bill may be enrolled for presidential action however the senate may agree to the partial conference report which is rarely controversial but not accept the house pos ition on one or more of the amendments in disagreement instead the senate may vote to insist on its original position support the negotiating position of its ma nagers or propose new bargaining position to the house if the house has insisted on its disagreement to senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs31 amendment the senate may continue to in sist on its amendment if the house has receded from its disagreement to senate amendment and concurred in that amendment with house amendment the senate may disagree to the house amendment or it may concur in the house amendment with further senate amendment if such senate amendment w ould not be an amendment in the third degree if one or more amendments remain in disagreement at the end of this process either method of resoluti on may be pursued again the amendments may be messaged back and forth between the houses until one chamber accepts the position of the other or until stalemate is reached alternatively either house may request further conference to consider the amendments that remain in disagreement the same or new conferees may be appointed only the amendments in disagreement are submitted to the new conference the managers may not reopen matters that were resolved in the partial conference re port that both houses approved because these matters are longer in disagreement but the partial conference report cannot become law until all the remaining disagreemen ts have been resolved if the second conference is successful the managers submit second report for action on the house and senate floor if not the legislation including the partial conference report probably is dead for that congress amendments in true disagreement rarely arise when conferees are presented with second chamber substitute in such situation there is only one amendment before the conference the conferees either reach agreement or they do not they may not report only part of the substitute as an amendment in disagreement if the conferees report back in total disagreement the house and senate then can vote to insist on their original positions or propose new versions of the legislation this hardly ever occurs but when it does the bill may die for lack of further action or the two houses may agree to new conference to consider the same issues once again instead amendments in true disagreem ent generally have arisen when the second chamber has passed bill with seri of separate amendments since this has happened most often to general appropriations bills that originate in the house and on which the senate reque sts conferences the house usually has acted first on partial conference reports and amendments in disagreement the possibility of amendments in disagreement can make it ex ceedingly difficult to anticipate what will happen to measure that is sent to conference it is not simply question of whether or not the conferees will be able to resolve all the amendments in disagreement by reaching compromises that fall within the scope of the differences between the house and senate versions if number of amendments are considered in conference the managers may reach agreement on some but not on others and what then happens to the amendments reported in disagreement depends on the motions that are made and agreed to by the house and senate furthermore the recourse to amendments in disagreement creates new possibilities that were not available in conference in conference the managers options are defined and limited by the scope of the differences between the house and senate positions be fore them however when the house and senate act on an amendment in disagreement they are not s ubject to this restriction the concept ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs32 38 however floor amendments to amendments in disagreement still must meet normal requirements for floor amendments for example house amendment to senate amendment in disagreement to general appropriations bill still must be germane and may not propose new unauthorized appropriati on even though the senate amendment in disagreement may itself provide an unauthorized appropriation 39 such motions are not likely to be made in pr actice for reasons discussed in the section on house consideration of senate amendmentsthe scope of the differences is rest riction on the authority of managers in conference it is not restricti on on amendments between the houses38 so for example the house may amend senate amendment in disagreement with new house position or technically the house may recede from its disagreement to the senate amendment nd concur in the senate ame ndment with house amendment that goes beyond the scope of either houses original position thus it is possible though not very lik ely in practice that 1 the conferees could report an amendment in disagreement 2 the first chamber to act could propose new position in the form of an amendment to the amendment in disagreement 3 the second chamber coul d respond with further amendment that constitutes new position of its own and 4 conferees could be appointed for second time to attempt to resolve the differences between these two new positions on the same subject in this second conf erence the same general policy question would be at issue but the scope of th differences between the house and senate versions and consequently th options open to the conferees would not be the same to add to the uncertainties several other complications can occur in the house as it acts on each amendment in disagreement these options arise from the different order of precedence among certain motions in the house but not in the senate that prevails before and after the house reaches the stage of disagreement and the opportunities for crossing and recrossing th at threshold these complications have arisen most often during action on ame ndments in disagreement to general appropriations bills before the house reaches the stage of disagreement the order of precedence favors motions that tend to perfect the measure further after the stage of disagreement the order of precedence is reversed and favors motions that tend to promote agreement between the houses t hus if motion to concur in senate amendment is made on the house floor befo re the stage of disagreement motion to concur with an amendment has preced ence and may be offered and voted on while the motion to concur is pending the mo tion to concur with an amendment has precedence because it tends to perfect the meas ure if the house agrees to the motion to concur with an amendment the straight motion to concur automatically falls without vote even though it had been offered first39 after the house has reached the stage of disagreement however motion that the house recede from its disagreement and concur in senate amendment has precedence over motion to recede and concur with an amendment the motion to recede and concur tends to promote agreement more directly than the motion to recede and concur with an amendment if preferential motion to recede and concurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs33 is made and carries vote occurs on the motion to recede and concur with an amendment even if that motion already had been made as if this were not complicated nough the motion to recede and concur is divisible in the house as is the motion to recede and concur with an amendment any representative may demand th at it be divided into two proposals first that the house recede from its disagreement to the senate amendment and second that the house then concur in the senate amendment or concur in it with an amendment depending on which motion s been made following demand for the division of the moti on the h ouse first considers whether it should r ecede from its disagreement but if the house votes to recede it crosses back over the threshold of disagreement consequently the preceden ce of motions reverses and motion to concur with an amendment takes precedence over motion to concur as result the possibilities that may arise on the house floor as the house considers each amendment in disagreement depend first on which motion is made by the floor manager second on what motions have precedence over that motion and third on whether an attempt is made to change the order of precedence by demanding division of the first motion suppose that the clerk r eads an amendment in disagreement and the floor manager moves that the house recede from its disagreement to that amendment and concur therein because the house and senate reached the stage of disagreement before they appointed their conferees motion to recede and concur with house amendment does not have precedence howe ver if any member demands division of the motion to recede and concur the h ouse first debates and votes on whether to recede normally the house does vote to recede because rejecting this motion would imply that the house is unwilling to consider either the senate amendment or any compromise version but when the house recedes from its disagreement it crosses back over the threshold of disagreement and the order of precedence among motions is reversed when the house then consid ers the second half of the divided motion to concur in the sena amendment another memb er may move instead that the house concur in the senate amendment with an amendment because the motion to concur with an amendment now has precedence over the motion to concur only if the house rejects the motion to concur with an amendment would it then vote on the original proposal to conc ur in the senate amendment suppose instead that after an amendment in disagreement has been read the floor manager moves that the house recede and concur with an amendment the stage of disagreement having been reached simple motion to recede and concur has precedence and may be offered but if this motion is divided the house votes first on whether to recede and if the house does recede the threshold of disagreement again is recrossed and the motion to conc ur with an amendment has precedence over the second half of the divided motion that the house concur thus the amendment originally proposed in the motion to recede and concur with an amendment may be offered again as moti on to concur with an amendment afterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs34 40 additional complications are possible if motion to concur with an amendment or to recede and concur with an amendment is ma and rejected another such motion could be made proposing different germane amendment alternatively if the previous question is not ordered on motion to concur with an amendment or motion to recede and concur with an amendment germane second degree amendment could be offered to the amendment 41 as discussed earlier however the senate interprets its rules in way that gives its conferees considerable latitude and the hous can waive points of order by adopting special rule for that purposea preferential motion to recede and concur has been offered after that motion has been divided and after the house has voted to recede40 the array of possible complications on the senate floor is more limited first the order of precedence of motions in the senate is not reversed after the stage of disagreement has been reached second senators may not demand the division of motion to recede and concur or of motion to recede and concur with an amendment even in the house representatives seldom use the opportunities available to them amendments in true disagreement rarely arise and when they do the house usually accepts the floor managers motions to dispose of them the sheer complexity of some of the parliamentary maneuvers described above probably discourages members from attempting them for fear that they are more likely to create confusion than achieve some strategic advantage nonetheless the possibility of amendments in true disagreement and the various options for dealing with each of them on the floor make it dangerous to predict with confidence exactly what will happen to measure once it has been submitted to conference amendments in technical disagreement as discussed in earlier sections of this report there are important restrictions on the content of conference reports conferees may deal only with the matters that are in disagreement between the house and senate and they must resolve each of these matters by reaching an agreement that is within the scope of the differences between the house and senate positions if confer ence report violates these restrictions in any one respect the entire report is subject to point of order41 yet conferees sometimes find it desirable or necessary to exceed their authority for example changing circumstances may make it imperative for congress to appropriate more money for some program than either the house or the senate initially approved or the c onferees may decide that bill should include provisions on subject that was not included in the version passed by either house in such cases the conferees may be able to achieve their purpose without subjecting their report to point of order by using the device of amendments in disagreement in doing so they take advantage of the fact th at the restrictions th at apply to provisions of conference reports do not govern amendments between the houseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs35 42 the house usually acts first on partial conference reports and amendments in technical disagreement because they arise most often on general appropriations bills which originate in the house and on which the senate usually requests conferencesif the conferees wish to exceed their authority in resolving one of the amendments in disagreement they can exclude this amendment from the conference report instead they present to the house and senate partial conference report and an amendment in disagreement this is called an amendment in technical disagreement there is substantive disagreement between the house and senate conferees they report the amendment in disagreement only for technical reasons to avoid the restrictions that apply to conference reports the first house considers the partial c onference report and then the amendment in technical disagreement42 when that amendment is presented in the house for example the floor manager moves that the house recede from its disagreement to the senate amendment and concur therein with an amendment that is the decision made in conference because this conference r ecommendation is considered outside of the conference report as part of motion to dispose of an amendment in technical disagreement point of order lies agai nst the motion or the proposed amendment on the grounds that the amendment exceeds th scope of the differences or proposes subject not committed to conference by either house however the proposed amendment still must be germane in the house if the first house votes for the moti on the second chamber acts on the partial conference report and then on the first houses amendment to the amendment in technical disagreement when the amendment is presented the floor manager moves that the senate concur in the house amendment assuming that the house acted first if the senate agrees to this motion the process of resolution is completed until recently conferees used this vice regularly although for somewhat different purpose to complete congressional action on general appropriations bills the rules of the house generally prohibit such bills from carrying unauthorized appropriations and changes in existing law legislation the procedures of the senate however are not as strict unde r number of conditions the senate may consider floor amendments to general appropriations bills that would not have been in order in the house if approved by the senate these amendments are sent to conference and constitute amendments in disagreement with the house they are properly before the conference and the c onferees may accept them without violating the restrictions on their authority that have been mentioned so far this situation could create significan t problem for the house on general appropriations bill conferees could presen t the house with conference report that is not amendable but that includes matter th at could not even have been considered much less approved by the house when it first acted on the bill on the floor the remedy for the house can lie in the use of amendments in technical disagreement clause 5 of house rule xxii states that house conferees may not agree to senate amendment to general appropriations bill if the amendment would violate the prohibitions in the houses rules against unauthorized appropriations andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs36 legislation on such bills in clause 2 of rule xxi unless specific authority to agree to the amendment first is given by the house by separate vote with respect thereto otherwise the same clause provides th senate amendment in question shall be reported in disagreement by the conference committee back to the two houses for disposition by separate motion the same two options ar available to conferees in the case of senate amendment proposing to appropriate funds in any bill that is not general appropriations bill in practice house conferees never seek separate house floor votes in advance instead the conferees report any amendments to which rule xxii clause 5a applies as amendments in technical disagreement after the house agrees to the partial conference report it considers these amendments as each of the senate amendments is presented to the house the majority floor manager offers motion that the house recede from its disagreement and either concur in the senate amendment or concur in it with house amendment in either case the floor managers motion incorporates the agreem ent reached in conference after the house agrees to these motions the senate approves the partial re port and then agrees to corresponding motions to dispose of th amendments that re quire senate action whereas the house has dealt with most or all of the amendments separately the senate usually has disposed of most or all of them bloc by unanimous consent the house may dispose of number of such amendments bloc also by unanimous consent when they are noncont roversial and when the floor manager proposes that the house recede and concur in each of them by this means the house could res pond on casebycase basis to senate amendments to general appropriations bills that would not have been in order in the house this procedure enabled the house to protect itself against having simply to vote for or against conference report c ontaining such senate amendments or modifications of them and therefore ving to choose between rejecting the report and jeopardizing the bill or violating the pr inciples of its own rules by voting on the motions made by the house floor manager the house could decide in each instance whether to accept the judgment of its conferees that wisdom or necessity dictated an exception to strict separati on of appropriations fro m both authorizations and changes in existing law moreover th house and senate ve the same options for dealing with amendments in technical disagreement that are available for disposing of amendments in true disagreement thus amendments in technical disagreement have been useful device to deal with the differences between house and senate rules governing matters that may be included in general appropriations b ills this device was convenient for appropriations conferees because the sena typically passed house appropriations bills with many separate numbered amendments consequently the conferees could report as many of these amendments as necessary as amendments in technical disagreement in the last several congre sses however there have been far fewer amendments in technical disagreement accompanying appropriations conference reports in many instances the senate has passed house appropriations bills with amendments in the nature of substitutes and it is not possible to report back from conference with part of such an amendment in disagreement also the house ruleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs37 committee has reported and the house has dopted special rules waiving points of order against many of the appropriations c onference reports anticipating that their reports would receive this pr otection appropriations confer ees could include all their agreements within their reports without re gard for considerations of scope or the matters in disagreement and without f ear that they would make their reports vulnerable to points of order on the house floor house consideration of nongermane senate amendments the contrast between house and senate rules and procedures governing general appropriations bills poses one problem for bicameral relations that arises during the process of resolving legislative differences remedy has been the use of amendments in technical disagreement another and similar problem results from the contrast between house and senate rules concerning the germaneness of amendments problem for which the house has devised somewhat different remedy house rules require amendments to be germane unless this requirement is waived by special rule by contrast senate rules require that amendments be germane only when offered to general ppropriations measures or budget measures both budget resolutions and r econciliation bills or when ffered after the senate has invoked cloture in addition the nate sometimes imposes germaneness requirement on itself as part of unan imous consent agreements governing consideration of individual measures although such agreements may include exceptions that make specific nong ermane amendments in order consider the potential consequences of this difference for the house the senate may pass house bill with one or more nongerma ne amendments each of these amendments is confer enceable an unoffici term that is used from time to time by participants in the legislative process as an amendment in disagreement between the house and senate the conf erees may include it or modification of it in their conference report without vi olating their authority however this situation could force the house into an upordown vote on conference report including nongermane matters that were not debated on the house floor that would have been subject to points of order if offered as house floor amendments and that might not even have been considered by the appropriate house committees the remedy for the house appears in clause 10 of house rule xxii this clause creates an opportunity for the hous to identify nongermane matter originating in the senate and to consid er it separately of course the house can adopt special rule reported from the rules committee that waives the point of order this clause creates clause 10 states that when the house begins consideration of conference report or motion to dispose of sena amendment to which the house has disagreed member may make point of order before bate begins against matter contained in the report or the motion on th grounds that the matter in question wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98696crs38 43 the speaker first entertains any points of order against the report as whole on grounds of scope for example before entertaining points of order concerning germaneness 44 if the house rejects nongermane matter in conference report accompanying senate measure that the house had amended the hous votes instead on insisting further on the house amendment to the senate bill not have been germane if it had been ffered as house floor amendment to the measure in the form the measure passed the house43 if the speaker sustains the point of order thereby establishing that the matter in question is nongermane the member then may move that the house re ject the nongermane matter this motion is debatable for 40 minutes to be qually divided between and controlled by proponents and opponents after the house votes on the motion another such point of order may be made agains t different nongermane matter and if it is sustained another motion to reject is in order if the house defeats any and all motions to reject the house thereby decides to retain the nongermane matter the h ouse may vote not to reject nongermane language for at least two reasons first majority of repr esentatives may support the nongermane matter on its merits or second the hous may conclude that the senate is so insistent on its nongermane language that rejecting it could seriously jeopardize enactment of the entire bill if the house does vote to reject any nongermane matter in conference report the report is considered as having been reject ed this is consistent with the principle that conference reports are not amendable clause 10d2 states that in most cases the house then proceeds automatically to d ecide whether the house shall recede and concur in the senate amendment with an amendment consisting of so much of the conference report as was not rejected in other words the house votes to amend the senate amendment with house amendment that consists of the remainder of the conference agreement without the nongermane matter44 if the senate accepts this new house amendment resolution is reached if not the senate may disagree to the house amendment and request new conference with the house in this way the house can isolate nongermane sena matter for separate consideration but neither chambe r can impose its will on the other clause 10d3 makes in order three po ssible motions in an established order of precedence that members may make if the house votes to reject nongermane matter contained not in conference report but in motion that the house recede and concur in senate amendmen t with or without amendment in brief these motions allow the house to amend the senate amendment or to again disagree to it perhaps also requesting new conference with the senate to resolve this disagreement
