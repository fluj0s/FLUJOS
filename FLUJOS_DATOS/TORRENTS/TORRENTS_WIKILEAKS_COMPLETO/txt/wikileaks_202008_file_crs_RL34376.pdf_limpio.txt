amanda k sarata analyst in genetics domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34376genetic exceptionalism genetic information and public policy summary the human genome project from incepti on through completion has generated great deal of debate over the appropria uses as well as potential misuses of genetic information legislation that is specific to genetics is predicated on the concept of genetic exceptionalism or the premise that genetic information is unique and therefore merits both special and different or exceptional treatment as applied to public policy this translates into geneticsspecific legislative approaches to various health policy issues such as privacy and discrimination in health insurance amidst great concern over the potential fo r the misuse of genetic information most states passed genetics legislation during the past decade and half in areas such as genetic privacy genetic discrimination in health insurance and genetic discrimination in employment genetic exceptionalist approach is now being pursued at the federal level as the 110th congress debates the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2007 hr 493s 358 this report

httpwwwnuffieldbioethicsorgfileli brarypdfpharmacogenetics_reportpdfgenetic exceptionalism genetic information and public policy introduction advances in human genetics and especially the completion of the human genome project have focused attenti on on the potentially numerous ways that genetic information may be used to impr ove and benefit health and health care despite excitement about the anticipated be nefits that the use of such information may generate lawmakers have raised concern about the potential for misuse of this information as well genetic information can be defined in many ways but for the purposes of this report it means informati on about genes gene products or inherited characteristics generated through either genetic testing or analysis of family history1 the term genetic exceptionalism refers to the concept that genetic information is inherently unique should receive sp ecial consideration and should be treated differently in law this idea is based on the supposition that genetic information itself embodies several charact eristics that may make it sp ecial and differentiate it from other medical or even personal information according to the perspective of genetic exceptionalism the characteristics of genetic information that make it different include the following it can be predictive of future disease it is unique identifier it can reveal information about family members it is vertically transmitted passed from parent to child it can impact communities it can be used to discriminate and stigmatize and it can cause serious psychological harm in addition although not specific to genetic information the following characteristics also describe genetic inform ation it can be obtained from small samples possibly without consent it may be used for pur poses other than those for which it was collected it is of interest to third parties such as employers and insurers it may be important for determining susceptibility to disease and effectiveness of treatment and it can be recovered from stor ed specimens after many years2 t h s characteristics are not unique to genetic in formation other medi cal information may also have some of these characteristics in common with genetic information however it may be argued that there is little medical or personal information that shares all of these characteristics with genetic informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34376crs2 3 roche pa and gj annas protecting genetic privacy nature reviews genetics 2392 396 2001 4 ncsl genetic technologies project at

sarata and erin d williams and crs report rl30006 genetic information legal issues relating to discrimination and privacy by nancy lee jones and amanda k sarata genetic information is viewed as powerfu l perhaps uniquely so by society and has been regarded with some degree of aw and respect not afforded other types of health or personal information3 this may be due to the sense that genetic information is immutable and therefore th at its use merits more caution than might the use of other information this he ightened caution may be warranted simply because of the perception that genetic info rmation cannot be modi fied or altered and that it is not chosen by the individual who bears it the differential regard for genetic information may also be related to the idea of genetic determinism or the concept that our genes exclusively predict or forete ll our fate including health behavior and physical characteristics although efforts ve been made by re sponsible scientists to disabuse the public of this notion by stre ssing the role of nvironmental factors in disease it is still fairly persistent as seen in overly glowing portrayals of genetic discoveries and technologies by the media it is difficult to specifically determine what gave rise to the concept of genetic exceptionalism however it does appear that broadly the public regards genetic information as particularly sensitive and perhaps even as unique the influence of the concept of genetic exceptionalism is reflected in genetics specific public policy at the state level and proposed legislation at the federal level as of 2007 the national conference of state legislatures reports that 48 states and the district of columbia have passed genetic nondiscrimination legislation that places various restrictions on health insure rs use collection or acquisition of genetic information to restrict or deny health insurance coverage similarly majority of states have passed gislation to protect the privacy of genetic information or to prohibit employers from using such information to discriminate against employees4 at the federal level cong ress has debated ge netic nondiscriminati on legislation in every congress since the 104th in the 109th congress the sena passed the genetic information nondiscriminati on act of 2005 s 306 the house did not bring its version to vote hr 1227 in the 110th congress the house passed the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2007 h r 493 however the senate has not yet voted on its version s 3585 because the idea of genetic exceptionalism has had significant influence on public policy to date congress ma want to consider how to treat genetic information in future legislative effortshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34376crs3 6 for more information about genetic testing see crs report rl33832 genetic testing scientific background for policymakers by amanda k saratathis report provides an overview of the implications of genetic information for individuals family and society examines public opinion about genetic information and summarizes the main policy arguments for and against incorporating genetic exceptionalism into public policy genetic information vs other medical information the differences between genetic info rmation and other types of medical information have important implications for the individual for families and for society as whole6 the discussion below provides broad overview of these implications but recognizes that there may be specific examples of nongenetic tests that have the same implications as genetic tests however the discussion below is meant to provide general comparison acr oss the two categories of tests genetic versus nongenetic and the information they generate implications for individuals genetic tests are similar to many other medical tests in that they are often used to diagnose disease or condition most of these diagnostic tests both genetic and nongenetic provide informati on about treatable maladies unlike most other medical tests however genetic tests may be used to determine that currently healthy individual is susceptible to at increased risk of developing particular illness or condition susceptibility genetic testing genetic tests may also be used to predict that currently healthy person will develop an illness or condition in the future with certainty predictive genetic testing it is often the case that many of the illnesses and conditions tested for using predictive or susceptibility testing cannot be cured or prevented by any currently available medi cal intervention for example genetic test is available for huntingtons disease disease for which prevention or cure or even effective treatment currently exists because of this general lack of cu rative measures sometimes the only options for reducing ones risk of future diseas rely on modification of personal health related behaviors for example undergoing frequent screening eating healthy foods and exercising regularly it is unclear how knowledge of genetic risk factors will influence the modification of such behavi ors while some individuals may modify their behavior because of knowledge of their genetic risk factors some may have the perception that because they cannot chan ge their genetic makeup modifying their behavior will have little effect on decreasing their risk for disease it is possible that these individuals may even increase unhealthy behaviors out of sense of hopelessness if preventive or curative op tions exist predictive genetic test results may increase patients anxiety level if they are positive or provide false sense of reassurance if they are negative susceptibility genetic test results may also increase anxiety if they indicate an increased risk of disease while offering options for mitigating this risk for example certain allele the apoe4 llele has been found to increase an individuals risk of developi ng alzheimers disease however testinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34376crs4 7 microarray technology is defined as new way of studying how large numbers of genes interact with each other and how cells regulato ry networks control vast batteries of genes simultaneously accessed at httpwwwgenomegovglossarycfmkeymicroarray20 technology for this particular allele has been di scouraged by health professionals because alzheimers disease cannot be prevented or cured and therefore knowing ones risk status may simply increase anxiety furt hermore the actual increase in risk is not absolute in any sense one may carry two copies of the apoe4 allele and still not develop alzheimers disease while one may carry copies of the apoe4 allele and still develop the disease unlike most other medical testing genetic testing may unintentionally reveal information about an individual or may reveal information with unknown significance given current sc ientific knowledge for example genetic testing may reveal unanticipated instances of nonpate rnity where it is revealed that the purported father is in fact not the father the development of microarray technology provides an increasingly costeffective mechanism for testing hundreds or even thousands of genetic hea lth indicators at one time7 genetic testing on this scale could likely lead not only to the revela tion of an enormous amount of health information about individuals but also to large amount of unexpected health information this raises concerns about informed consent as obtaining truly voluntary informed consent for each individual test might be prohibitively time consuming banking and storage of this vast amount of information along with personal identifiers provide s unique challenges to existing privacy protections consumer advocates caution that although economic incentives favor testing for large number of genetic characteristics at one time testing shoul d be limited to allow for thorough informed consent before and genetic counseling both prior to and after testing genetic information can be used not only in the clinical setting but also by forensic experts and the criminal justice system to identify individuals with high degree of certainty genetic information has been used to help convict and exonerate individuals accused of co mmitting crimes it has been used to help identify the remains of war and accident victims becau of these potential applications tissue samples and certain types of genetic info rmation collected for health care purposes may later be used in law enforcement and vice versa the fact that genetic information collected for health care may have forensic appli cations may increase lawmakers concern with the increasingly widespread availability and use of genetic information concern about use of genetic information in nonhealth settings may also decrease uptake of new genetic t echnologies in health care and decrease participation in genetic research implications for the family genetic tests for acquired markers genetic changes that an individual does not receive from his or her parents but rather acquires some time postconception httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34376crs5 8 for example the onco type dx test offered by genomic health profiles tumors gene expression patterns to determine whether the tumo r is likely to spread or respond to different types of treatment expression patterns in mors are largely due to acquired mutationshave direct medical implications only for the individuals taking the tests8 most other medical tests also have direct medical imp lications only for the individual taking the test however unlike most other medical tests genetic tests for inherited markers markers that are transmitted from parents to their offspring have implications for biological relatives of the individual parents si blings and children have predictable risk of sharing certain inherited genetic markers furthermore the generally unchanging nature of inher ited dna means that genetic testing for inherited markers can be performed at any stage of human development on most tissue types this offers the possibility of testing before implantation or prenatally and may possibly allow for fetal intervention some genetic tests cannot be interpreted for an indi vidual unless other members of her family are also tested for example breast cancer genetic testing on the brca1 and brca2 genes re lies on sequencing the entire gene in an affected individual to pinpoint the specific familia l mutation then other family members may be tested for that specific mutation to help accurately determine if they are at increased risk of developing breast and or ovarian cancer and if so the magnitude of that risk in those cases all family members may or may not want to know their test results sometimes sting family members can also provide unwelcome information about sensitive issues such as paternity implications for society unlike most other medical informa tion genetic information challenges traditional medical perceptions of health and disease what is normal or abnormal and raises questions about wh at constitutes manifested dis ease for exam ple lactose intolerance was long thought to be an abnormal state research in different populations elucidated that in fact it is the normal state and the ability to digest lactose was the result of mutations that we re under strong selective pressure in areas of the world where domestication of animals led to increased consumption of dairy products these concepts are becoming in creasingly blurred as genetic advances uncover the true range of normal and bnormal in many human traits many experts predict that genetics ma soon provide the opportunity to test large groups of people for disease suscep tibilities however fear caused by the possibility that job may be lost or insurance may be cancelled whether real or perceived affects individua ls decisions regarding seeking potentially beneficial genetic testing in clinical or research settings if people decline to participate in genetic research in large numbers the ability of scientists to gather the data that are necessary to determine the utility or u ltimately the value of genetic testing may be compromised this may delay realization of the potential benefits of genetic advances for the larger population genetic information may be used in order to link person to distinct group or heritage this type of information ma have consequences particularly forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34376crs6 9 diergaarde b et genetic information special or not responses from focus groups with members of health maintenance organization american journal of genetics part 143a 564569 2007individuals who have rights based upon heritage such as native americans advocates of these groups are wary of the potential effect that genetic testing and information could have on their current ri ghts and protections others argue that definitions of race and heredity are irrele vant or that genetic information will not supplant current nongenetic determinants of ancestry finally because the prevalence of diseasecausing genes often varies by ethnicity there is potential for discrimination against groups of people that share similar genetic information the meaning of genetic information evolves with scientific progress which has special implications both for privacy and for equity in the privacy arena person could grant others access to genetic data that is benign by todays standards however with scientific advancements these same data may in time reveal more sensitive information in the equity arena those with health conditions for which genetic tests currently exist may suffer discrimination in the near future while those with similarly debilitating hea lth conditions for which ther is genetic test may escape the same discrimination simply by virtue of the current state of science certain initiatives in genetic research such as largescale banking of genetic information could raise both privacy and quity concerns even though they may also have widespread public health benefit such as facilitating characterization of genetic markers associated with rare adverse drug events public opinion about genetic information although there has been an ongoing academic debate about the concept of genetic exceptionalism it is perhaps more relevant in terms of public policy to examine how the public views genetic in formation several studies have been undertaken in an attempt to elucidate wh ether the public views genetic information as inherently different from other in formation whether it deserves special protections and who s hould have access to it to address the question of whether genetic information merits special protections 2 007 st udy examined opinions about genetic information through series of focus groups with members of health maintenance organization n46 focus groups conducted with these members found that broadly participants did not feel that genetic information is special or inherently different from other medical information in addition the participants generally felt that all sensitive medical information including but not limited to ge netic information should be protected sensitive medical information was agreed to be that information that has the potential to be used to discriminate against or stigmatize an individual9 second study compared the experiences attitudes and beliefs of persons with genetic conditions cystic fibr osis and sickle

committee on genetics health and society march 28 2006 accessed at httpwww4odnihgovobasacghs meetingsmarch2006whitepdfthe authors found that in most instances patients felt strongly that their health information needed to be protected regard less of whether it was genetic in fact respondents indicated that information about nongenetic stigmatizing conditions such as abortion history mental health hist ory drug and alcohol history hiv status and sexually transmitted di sease needed special protection based on their findings the authors concluded that parate privacy policies for genetic and nongenetic health informa tion would be unwarranted10 other studies and public opinion polls sugge st that patients and members of the community desire and may benefit from additional protections for their genetic information 2003 study of 470 people with family history of colorectal cancer showed that 39 rated their level of concern about gene tic discrimination in health insurance as the most significant reason to forego testing those individuals with high levels of concern indicated that they would be significantly less likely to consider meeting with health care professional to discuss genetic testing or to undergo testing11 2007 survey by the center fo r genetics and p ublic policy found that 93 of survey respondents t hought employ ers should not have access to their genetic test results and 93 opposed letting insurance companies have access to results12 2006 survey conducted by cogent research found that 72 of survey respondents believe that laws are need ed to protect the privacy of genetic information and 85 believe that if protec tions are not established employers would use genetic information discriminate13 findings from these selected studies suggest that people view genetic information as particularly sensitive but not more so than other sensitive medical information such as hiv status these st udies also found that people believe that genetic information needs to be kept pr ivate from employers or insurers and that special protections are requi red to achieve this goal policy issues when considering public policy to legislate the treatment of genetic

exceptionalist approach meaning they may chose to treat genetic information differently from other medical informa tion for example hr 493s 358 110th the genetic information n ondiscrimination act of 2 007 takes this approach conversely policy makers may wish to take nonexceptionalist approach meaning they may wish to treat genetic information the same way as they treat other medical information for example the hipaa priv acy rule treats genetic information in nonexceptional way some of the policy i ssues congress may want to consider are outlined below if genetic exceptionalist approach to public policy at the federal level were to be employed several policy considerations may be rais ed experts highlight the challenge of effectively fining genetic versus nongen etic information for public policy purposes14 all disease is now thought to have genetic component hence the term genetic disease is slowly growing more obsolete nearly all medical information might arguably be defined as being in part genetic in nature creating challenges for making such distinction in addition physically separating ge netic from nongenetic information in medical records may pose real practical challenge requirements regarding the physical separation of differe nt types of medical information may be so complicated and costly as to actually interfere with the delivery of effective and highquality care these requirements may further frustrate attempts by physicians to provide optimal care to their patients and may impede the sharing of relevant medical information importantly adoption of electronic medical records may facilitate such separation both for purposes of maintaining the information and releasing the information15 several experts have voiced concern that genetic exceptionalist laws may result in unintended disparities16 for example they argue that such laws may create situation where individua ls affected by disease or condition with known genetic basis ie breast cancer in the presence of brca1 mutation would be protected from discrimination while those with breast cancer with known genetic basis would not be protected experts often assert that without geneticspecific legislation in pl ace individuals would not utilize and therefore may lose out on the clinical and other benefits of new genetic technologies out of concern about misuse of their genetic information in addition these experts maintain that w ithout protections in place genetic research will be stifled17 it is possible however that genetic exceptionalist laws might reinforce perceptions among the public that genetic information is special uniquehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34376crs9 18 hadley dw et genetic counseling and testing in families with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer arch intern med 1635 57382 2003or deterministic although many argue th at protections are n eeded to encourage participation in gene tic research and the uptake of genetic medical technologies and tests it is possible that reinforcing the notion that genetic information is uniquely powerful ie has such high potential fo r misuse that it requires its own special protections might have the unintended c onsequence of decreas ing participation in genetic research or decreasing utilization of important genetic tests that could guide treatment this is especially concern if genetic exceptionalist legislation were to be passed that is perceived by the public to be weak or lacking thoroughness in the protection it offers in an environment where special pr otections are not extended to genetic information patients may be hesitant to share relevant genetic information because of concerns about possible misuse and health care providers may have difficulty providing the best care to their patients18 with nonexceptionalist policy approach it may be challenging to ad equately safeguard genetic information broader law may be more unwieldy and therefore ma provide challenges to providing the appropriate protections for medical information with varying degrees of sensitivity as there is some evidence that the public views genetic information as deserving of special protections if not of being special itself treating genetic information the same as other medical information may not resonate with the public see public opinion about genetic information
