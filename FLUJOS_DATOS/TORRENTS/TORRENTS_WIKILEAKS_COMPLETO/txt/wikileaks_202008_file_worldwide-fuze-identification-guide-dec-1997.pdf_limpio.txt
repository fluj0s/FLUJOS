development agencies in their missions some of the fuzes covered in this document are quite old and would have been thought to have become obsolete recent military operations in several third world countries however have encountered these fuzes because of their age documented coverage has often been withdrawn making identiﬁcation difﬁcult they appear in this document based of their recent encountersnot because they are thought to be ﬁrst seen ordnance while document can provide an allencompassing coverage of foreign fuzes this publication will be updated as often as possible to include newer fuzes as they are encountered to assist the user of this document the fuzes covered have been grouped by function base detonating point detonating proxim ity etc within each of these categories they are arranged alpha betically by country of origin and within these countries further arranged by designator preﬁx attempts have been made to show clearly the markings present body materials surface appearances and colors to aid in posi tive identiﬁcation color photographs are used to show more pre cise details to aid in the proper identiﬁcation of each fuze where possible photographs of the same fuze with and without safety caps safety pins andor rotated to show different physical char acteristics or markings may be provided if they provide informa tion to assist in better examination of the fuze some embossed markings shown on the fuze bodies have been highlighted in white to provide better photographic clarity one primary method to identify countryoforigin for fuzes is through the markings found on them indepth coverage of the markings practices of the various countries would be impractical in this document one comment however should be made cerning chinese fuzes early chinese fuzes normally used at least one chinese character in the markings thus making identiﬁcation2easier recently however the chinese have changed their mark ings and designator practices on fuzes destined for export for those fuzes designed and produced by china new roman alpha betic codes have been assigned in lieu of the previous chinese characters the new designator codes use the same preﬁx letters to describe the combination of the ordnance the fuze is associated with and the type by function of the fuze some of these charac ters and their meanings are listed below fuzes copied by the chinese from other countries normally do not carry these new designations instead the chinese practice is to carry forward the designator assigned by the developing coun try for example the chinese use the v90 and m739 designators generated originally by the former soviet union and the united states respectively on two fuzes of current chinese production the preﬁxes for these designators are also expressed in alphabetic codes fuze designators have been listed in this document in english many countries of the world use the cyrillic alphabet and accord ingly mark their fuzes with cyrillic letters to assist the reader in transliteration of the actual fuze markings to english the follow ing table may be usedtable 1 chinese fuze designators designator use md proximity and
