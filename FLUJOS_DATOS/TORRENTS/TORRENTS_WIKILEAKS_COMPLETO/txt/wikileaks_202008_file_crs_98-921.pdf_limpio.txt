disabilities act ada 42 usc 12101 et seq has often been described as the most sweeping nondiscrimination legislation since the civil rights act of 1964 it provides broad nondiscrimination protection in employment public services public accommodations and services operated by private entities transportation and telecommunications for individuals with disabilities1 as stated in the act its purpose is to provide clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities enacted on july 26 1990 the majority of the adas provisions took effect in 19922 the ada amendments act pl 110325 was enacted on september 25 2008 to respond to series of supreme court decisions that had interpreted the definition of disability narrowly3 the supreme court has decided 20 ada cases4 including one in the 20052006 supreme court term united states v georgia 5 and one case was decided in the 20042005 term spector v norwegian cruise line ltd6 two ada cases were decided in the 20032004 supreme court term raytheon co v hernandez7 and tennessee v lane 8 and one ada case was decided in the 20022003 supreme court term clackamas gastroenterology associates v wells 9 in the most recent supreme court decision united states v georgia10 the court held that title ii of the ada created private cause of action for damages against the states for conduct that actually violated the fourteenth amendment however the court did not reach the issue of whether the eleventh amendment permits prisoner to secure money damages from state for state actions that violate the ada but not the constitution in addition the supreme court 1 the ada and section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 however have not been found to cover medical treatment

rights act of 1964 which has implications for the adas prohibition of discrimination where employers employ 15 or more employees on december 7 2007 the supreme court granted certiorari in huber v walmart stores12 to determine whether an individual with disability who cannot perform her current job must be reassigned to vacant equivalent position wit hout competing with other workers however the court dismissed the petition since the case was settled prior to oral argument currently there is split in the circuits on this accommodation issue and in light of the courts dismissal of the case there will continue to be divergent views13 before examining the provisions of the ada and these cases it is important to briefly note the adas historical antecedents federal statutory provision which existed prior to the ada section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 prohibits discrimination against an otherwise qualified individual with disability solely on the basis of the disability in any program or activity that receives federal financial assistance the executive agencies or the us postal service 14 many of the concepts used in the ada originated in section 504 and its interpretations however there is one major difference while section 504s prohibition against discrimination is tied to the receipt of federal financial assistance the ada also covers entities not receiving such funds in addition the federal executive agencies and the us postal service are covered under section 504 not the ada the ada contains specific provision stating that except as otherwise provided in the act nothing in the act shall be construed to apply lesser standard than the standards applied under title v of the rehabilitation act which includes section 504 or the regulations issued by federal agencies pursuant to such title 15 the ada is civil rights statute it does not provide grant funds to help entities comply with its requirements it does include section on technical assistance which authorizes grants and awards for the purpose of technical assistance such as the dissemination of information about rights under the ada and techniques for effective compliance16 however there are tax code provisions which may assist certain businesses or individuals17 11 arbaugh v h corp 546 us 500 2006 12 486 f3d 480 8th cir 2007 cert granted 128 sct 742 169 led 2d 579 2007 cert dismissed 128 sct

provided by the law18 the term disability with respect to an individual is defined as physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment as described in paragraph 319 the definition of disability was the subject of numerous cases brought under the ada including major supreme court decisions which generally interpreted the definition narrowly due to these interpretations congress enacted the ada amendments act which kept essentially the same statutory language but contains new rules of construction regarding the definition of disability these rules of construction provide that the definition of disability shall be construed in favor of broad coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the act the term substantially limits shall be interpreted consistently with the findings and purposes of the ada amendments act an impairment that substantially limits one major life activity need not limit other major life activities to be considered disability an impairment that is episodic or in remission is disability if it would have substantially limited major life activity when active the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures except that the ameliorative effects of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses shall be considered 20

what was intended by congress pl 110325 specifically states that the current eeoc regulations defining the term substantially limits as significantly restricted are inconsistent with congressional intent by expressing too high standard the codified findings in the original ada are also amended to delete the finding that 43000000 americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities this finding was used in sutton to support limiting the reach of the definition of disability the ada amendments act states that the purposes of the legislation are to carry out the adas objectives of the elimination of discrimination nd the provision of clear strong consistent enforceable standards addressing discrimination by reinstating broad scope of protection available under the ada pl 110325

oneself performing manual tasks seeing hearing eating sleeping walking standing lifting bending speaking breathing learning reading concentrating thinking communicating and working the act also states that major life activity includes the operation of major bodily function the house judiciary committee report indicates that this clarification was needed to ensure that the impact of an impairment on the operation of major bodily functions is not overlooked or wrongly dismissed as falling outside the definition of major life activities under the ada 23 there had been judicial decisions which found that certain bodily functions had not been covered by the definition of disability for example in furnish v svi sys inc24 the seventh circuit held that an individual with cirrhosis of the liver due to

engaging in the illegal use of drugs when the covered entity acts on the basis of such use26 an individual who has been rehabilitated would be covered however the conference report language clarifies that the provision does not permit individuals to invoke coverage simply by showing they are participating in drug rehabilitation program they must refrain from using drugs 27 the conference report also indicates that the limitation in coverage is not intended to be narrowly construed to only persons who use drugs on the day of or within matter of weeks before the action in question28 the definitional section of the rehabilitation act was also amended to create uniformity with this definition section 508 provides that an individual shall not be considered to have disability solely because that individual is transvestite29 section 511 similarly provides that homosexuality and bisexuality are not disabilities under the act and that the term disability does not include transvestism transsexualism pedophilia exhibitionism voyeurism gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments or other sexual behavior disorders compulsive gambling kleptomania or

under the ada the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc has issued regulations discussing the requirements of the definition which it amended following the supreme courts decision in sutton and murphy31 the eeoc also issued detailed guidance on the definition on march 15 1995 which was also amended following the supreme courts decisions32 this guidance states that the following conditions would not constitute impairments environmental cultural and economic disadvantages age pregnancy common personality traits and normal deviations in height weight and strength however certain aspects of these conditions could give rise to an impairment for example complications arising from pregnancy or conditions associated with age such as hearing loss could be considered to be disabilities the regulations and guidance issued with regard to the definition of disability are in state of flux since the passage of the ada amendments act of 2008 the acts provisions regarding the definition of

complaint and prevailed at the district court courts of appeals and the supreme court on the issue of whether she was an individual with disability but the case was remanded for further consideration regarding the issue of direct threat in arriving at its holding justice kennedy writing for the majority first looked to whether ms abbotts hiv infection was physical impairment noting the immediacy with which the hiv virus begins to damage an individuals white blood cells the court found that asymptomatic hiv infection was physical impairment second the court examined whether this physical impairment affected major life activity and concluded that the hiv infection placed substantial limitation on her ability to reproduce and to bear children and that reproduction was major life activity finally the court examined whether the physical impairment was substantial limitation on the major life activity of reproduc tion after evaluating the medical evidence the court concluded that ms abbotts ability to reproduce was substantially limited in two ways 1 an attempt to conceive would impose significant risk on ms abbotts partner and 2 an hiv infected woman risks infecting her child during gestation and childbirth 39

definition of disability and specifically discussed the concept of mitigating measures sutton v united air lines involved sisters who were rejected from employment as pilots with united air lines because they wore eyeglasses the supreme court in sutton examined the definition of disability used in the original ada and found that the determination of whether an individual has disability should be made with reference to measures that mitigate the individuals impairment the sutton court stated disability exists only where an impairment substantially limits major life activity not where it might could or would be substantially limiting if mitigating measures were not taken the court also emphasized that the statement of findings in the ada that some 43000000 americans have one or more physical or mental disability requires the conclusion that congress did not intend to bring under the statutes protection all those whose uncorrected conditions amount to disabilities similarly in murphy v united parcel service inc the court held that the fact that an individual with high blood pressure was unable to meet the department of transportation dot safety standards was not sufficient to create an issue of fact regarding whether an individual is regarded as unable to utilize class of jobs the court in murphy found that an employee is regarded as having disability if the covered entity mistakenly believes that the employees actual nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities and in the last of this trilogy of 1999 cases the court in albertsons v kirkingburg held that trucker with monocular vision who was able to compensate for this impairment was not person with disability 39 another major issue addressed in bragdon involved the interpretation of the adas direct threat exemption which will be discussed in the section on public acco mmodations for more detailed discussion of bragdon see crs report 98599 the americans with

in the 2002 case of toyota motor manufacturing v williams the meaning of substantially limits was examined and justice oconnor writing for the unanimous court determined that the word substantial clearly precluded impairments that interfere in only minor way with the performance of manual tasks the court also found that the term major life activity refers to those activities that are of central importance to daily life finding that these terms are to be interpreted strictlythe court held that to be substantially limited in performing manual tasks an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most peoples daily lives

damages against the states for conduct that actually violates the fourteenth amendment however the court did not reach the issue of whether the eleventh amendment permits prisoner to secure money

georgia47 raised the issue of whether congress has validly abrogated state immunity from damage suits under title ii of the ada in situations involving accommodations for prisoners with disabilities the supreme court addressed issues involving prisoners under the ada in pennsylvania department of corrections v yeskey48 in yeskey the court held that state prisons are within the ada s statutory definition of public entity but did not address the constitutional issues united states v georgia involved the claims of georgia prisoner who is paraplegic and uses wheelchair the inmate claimed that he was confined for 2324 hours day to cell so small that he was unable to maneuver his wheelchair in addition he argued that he was deprived of access to toilet and shower and was forced to sit in his own bodily waste because prison officials refused to provide assistance these conditions he argued violated the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment and the ada the eleventh circuit court of appeals did not address the suffic iency of the claim under title ii of the ada but found that the title ii claims for monetary damages against the state were barred by sovereign immunity the supreme court in an unanimous opinion written by justice scalia held that title ii of the ada created private cause of action for damages against the states for conduct that actually violates the fourteenth amendment in arriving at this holding the court noted that the plaintiffs claims for money damages under the ada were based in large part on violations of section 1 of the fourteenth amendment and observed that this differed from other cases regarding the eleventh amendment such as tennessee v lane justice scalia recognized that the supreme court has been split regarding the scope of c ongresss prophylactic enforcement powers under 5 of the fourteenth amendment but found common ground in the recognition of section 5 powers to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment by creating private remedies against actual violations of these provisions thus justice scalia concluded for the court 43 42 usc 12101b4 the commerce clause would not be

damages against the states for conduct that actually violated the fourteenth amendment title ii validly abrogates state sovereign immunity united states v georgia is limited decision which does not address the split in the supreme court regarding when there is abrogation of the eleventh amendment under the ada g22g142g151g151g142g156g156g142g142g561g159g495g561g14g138g151g142g561 in tennessee v lane 49 the supreme court retreated somewhat from its previous approaches to the application of the eleventh amendment holding that title ii of the ada as it applies to the fundamental right of access to the courts constitutes valid exercise of congressional authority under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment lane was an action brought by george lane and beverly jones both paraplegics who use wheelchairs for mobility against tennessee mr lane alleged that he was compelled to appear in court to answer criminal charges and had to crawl up two flights of stairs to get to the court room ms jones certified court reporter alleged that she was been unable to gain access to number of county courthouses thus losing employment opportunities in 54 decision with the opinion written by justice stevens the court noted that when analyzing an eleventh amendment immunity issue two questions must be resolved 1 whether congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate and 2 if so whether it acted pursuant to valid grant of congressional authority the ada specifically provides for abrogation 50 so the court then applied the test set out in city of boerne v flores 51 which found that legislation enacted pursuant to section 5 of the fourteenth amendment is valid if it had congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end52 justice stevens opinion found that title ii of the ada like title i sought to prohibit irrational discrimination but noted that title ii also soug ht to enforce variety of basic constitutional guarantees including the right of access to the courts noting the pattern of disability discrimination that led to the enactment of the ada and the sheer volume of evidence demonstrating the nature and extent of unconstitutional discrimination against persons with disabilities in the provision of public services the court held that the inadequate provisions of public services and access to public facilities was an appropriate subject for remedial prophylactic legislation the final issue was whether title ii was an appropriate response to this history and pattern of discrimination although the court had been urged to consider the entire sweep of title ii justice stevens declined to broaden the ruling beyond the issue of the accessibility of judicial services the court held that the remedies were congruent and proportional to the goal of enforcing the right of access to the courts and emphasized that title ii of the ada requires only reasonable modifications that would not fundamentally alter the nature of the service provided and that do not impose an undue financial or administrative burden or threaten historic preservation interests thus the court concluded title ii as it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts constitutes valid exercise of congress 5 authority to enforce the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment

and dissenting opinion written by then chief justice rehnquist it is also limited in its scope although the chief justice argued in his dissenting opinion that title ii of the ada ought to be considered as whole not on case bycase basis the majority disagreed and reached finding of constitutionality on the specific issue of the accessibility of judicial services the majoritys emphasis on detailed fact finding in the legislative history and its statement in the adas findings and purposes53 indicates how crucial these facts are to proper abrogation of the eleventh amendment in addition the courts emphasis on the constitutional rights involved in the access to courts indicates that cases which do not involve such rights may not pass constitutional muster in subsequent decisions

reached different conclusion regarding abrogation in garrett v university of alabama 54 another 54 decision the court held that the eleventh amendment bars suits to recover monetary damages by state employees under title i of the americans with disabilities act ada although the ruling is narrowly focused concerning title i of the ada it has broad implications regarding federalstate power55 and emphasizes the difficulty of drafting federal legislation under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment that will withstand eleventh amendment scrutiny56 garrett involved two consolidated cases brought by separate alabama employees one of the employees patricia garrett had been undergoing treatment for breast cancer when she alleged she was transferred to lesser position after having been told that her supervisor did not like sick people the second plaintiff milton ash alleged that the alabama department of human services did not enforce its nonsmoking policy and that therefore he was not able to control his asthma the eleventh circuit held that the st ate was not immune from suits for damages the supreme court reversed writing for the majority chief justice rehnquist briefly examined the adas statutory language and the general principles of the eleventh amendment immunity he observed that the first step in applying these principles was to identify the sc ope of the constitutional right at issue in other words to identify constitutional rights that indi viduals with disabilities have to be free from discrimination discussing cleburne v cleburne living center 57 chief justice rehnquist emphasized that discrimination against individuals wi th disabilities is entitled to only minimum rationalbasis review and stated thus the result of cleburne is that states are not required by the fourteenth amendment to make special accommodations for the disabled so long as their 53 42 usc 12101a3 54 531 us 356 2001 for more detailed discussion of garrett see crs report rs20828

hard headedlyand perhaps hardheartedlyhold to job qualification requirements which do not make allowance for the disabled if special accommodations for the disabled are to be required they have to come from positive law and not through the equal protection clause58 after examining the constitutional rights of individuals with disabilities the majority opinion in garrett examined whether congress had identified history and pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the states against individuals with disabilities chief justice rehnquist observed that the authority of congress under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment is appropriately exercised only in response to state transgressions59 he found that the legislative history of the ada did not identify such pattern although the record was replete with examples of discrimination chief justice rehnquist noted that most of these examples were drawn from units of local government and not the states and that the eleventh amendment does not extend its immunity to units of local government 60 the garrett majority observed that even if pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by states was found issues relating to whether there was congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented and the means adopted would raise concerns chief justice rehnquist observed that it would be entirely rational and therefore constitutional for state employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who are able to use existing facilities but that the ada requires that existing facilities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities 61 the adas accommodation requirements were seen as far exceeding what is constitutionally required62 the adas requirements forbidding standards criteria or methods of administration that disparately impact individuals with disabilities were also seen as inconsistent with the requirements for legislation under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment in conclusion the majority opinion stated that congress is the final authority as to desirable public policy but in order to authorize private individuals to recover money damages against the states there must be pattern of discriminati on by the states which violates the fourteenth amendment and the remedy imposed by congress must be congruent and proportional to the targeted violation those requirements are not met here 63 however after reaching this holding the garrett majority went on to note that it does not mean that individuals with disabilities have federal recourse the opinion was limited to the recovery of monetary damages and the standards of title i of the ada were seen as still applicable to the states in addition the court noted that the federal government could enforce those rights in actions for monetary damages and that state law would offer some means of redress in concurring opinion justices kennedy and oconnor emphasized the limited nature of the opinion stating that what is in question is not whether the congress acting pursuant to power granted to it by the constitution can compel the states to act what is involved is only the question whether the states can be subjected to liability in suits brought not by the federal 58 531 us 356 367368 59 id at 368 60 id at 369 61 id at 372 62 id 63 id at 374

from the state treasury without the consent of the state64 justice breyer joined by justices stevens souter and ginsburg strongly disagreed with the majoritys opinion and stated that congress could have reasonably concluded that the title i remedies of the ada were appropriate legislation under the fourteenth amendment the emphasis in the majority opinion on the limited legislative history was described as ignoring the powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general which implicates state governments as well for state agencies form part of that same larger society 65 the rules the majority used to find the legislative record inadequate were seen as flawed using standards more appropriately applied to judges than to congress in the view of the dissenters congress has broad authority to remedy violations of the fourteenth amendment there is simply reason to require congress seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its 5 authority to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect courts institutional limitations unlike courts congress can readily gather facts from across the nation assess the magnitude of problem and more easily find an appropriate remedy 66 university of alabama v garrett is major decision further emphasizing the courts federalism theories and raising separation of powers issues as well67 although the majority in garrett did not rule out all legislation enacted pursuant to 5 of the fourteenth amendment it made the enactment of such legislation significantly less likely to withstand eleventh amendment scrutiny in addition the courts comments on disparate impact discrimination could signal challenge to other uses of this approach and some commentators have stated this could have implications for other statutes including title vii of the civil rights act which prohibits racial discrimination68 more specifically with regard to the ada the majority took pains to describe the limited nature of the holding it is limited to title i of the ada deals only with monetary damages and leaves open other avenues of relief such as enforcement by the equal employment opportunities commission and state laws however the absenc of monetary damages does make individual suits against states much less likely and has been described as significant blow to ada enforcement although the courts federalism doctrine has been somewhat reined in by tennessee v lane discussed above and nevada dept of human resources v hibbs 69 which upheld the family and medical leave act70 as valid exercise of congressional power pursuant to section 5 of the fourteenth amendment the limited nature of these holdings renders their application to other as yet untried aspects of the ada regarding the eleventh amendment unclear in other words the reasoning in garrett was not refuted by tennessee v lane and it remains for future decisions to determine what result will be reached in cases involving access to facilities such as

amendments act of 2008 provides that covered entity shall discriminate against qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures the hiring advancem ent or discharge of employees employee compensation job training and other terms conditions and privileges of employment 72 the term employer is defined as person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees73 therefore the employment section of the ada unlike the section on public accommodations which will be discussed subsequently is limited in scope to employers with 15 or more employees this parallels the coverage provided in the civil rights act of 1964 as noted previously the supreme court in arbaugh v h corp 74 held that the 15employee limitation in title vii of the civil rights act75 was not jurisdictional but rather was related to the substantive adequacy of claim thus if the defense that the employer employs fewer than 15 employees is not raised in timely manner court is not obligated to dismiss the case because the adas 15employee limitation language parallels that of title vii it is likely that court would interpret the adas requirement in the same manner the term employee with respect to employment in foreign country includes an individual who is citizen of the united states however it is not unlawful for covered entity to take action that constitutes discrimination with respect to an employee in workplace in foreign country if compliance would cause the covered entity to violate the law of the foreign country76 if the issue raised under the ada is employment related and the threshold issues of meeting the definition of an individual with disability nd involving an employer employing more than 15 individuals are met the next step is to determine whether the individual is qualified individual continued immunity regarding the age discrimination in employment act the fair labor standards act and the family and medical leave

can perform the essential functions of the job title i defines qualified individual with disability such an individual is an individual with disability who with or without reasonable accommodation can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such person holds or desires77 the ada incorporates many of the concepts set forth in the regulations promulgated pursuant to section 504 including the requirement to provide reasonable accommodation unless the accommodation would pose an undue hardship on the operation of the business 78 reasonable accommodation is defined in the ada as including making existing facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities and job restructuring parttime or modified work schedules reassignment to vacant position acquisition or modification of equipment or devices adjustment of examinations or training materials or policies provision of qualified readers or interpreters or other similar accommodations 79 undue hardship is defined as an action requiring significant difficulty or expense80 factors to be considered in determining whether an action would create an undue hardship include the nature and cost of the accommodation the overall financial resources of the facility the overall financial resources of the covered entity and the type of operation or operations of the covered entity reasonable accommodation and the related concept of undue hardship are significant concepts under the ada and are one of the major ways in which the ada is distinguishable from title vii jurisprudence the statutory language paraphrased above provides some guidance for employers but the details of the requirements have been the subject of numerous judicial decisions in addition the eeoc issued detailed

is entitled to return to his or her same position unless this imposes an undue hardship and an employer is limited in the ability to question the employees documentation of disability an employer cannot ask for documentation when 1 both the disability and the need for reasonable accommodation are obvious or 2 the individual has already provided the empl oyer with sufficient information to substantiate that she has an ada disability and needs the reasonable accommodation requested issues regarding the amount of money that must be spent on reasonable accommodations have also arisen the eeoc regulations 84 and guidance provide that an employer does not have to provide reasonable accommodation that would cau an undue hardship to the employer85 however the seventh circuit in vande zande v state of wisconsin department of administration86 found that the cost of the accommodation cannot be disproportionate to the benefit even if an employer is so large or wealthyor like the principal defendant in this case is state which can raise taxes in order to finance any accommodations that it must make to disabled employees that it may not be able to plead undue hardship it would not be required to expend enormous sums in order to bring about trivial improvement in the life of disabled employee 87

the supreme court examined the definition of the term employee under the ada in clackamas gastroenterology associates p c v wells88 in clackamas the court held in 72 decision written by justice stevens that the eeocs guidelines concerning whether shareholderdirector is an employee were the correct standard to use since the evidence was not clear the case was remanded for further proceedings clackamas gastroenterology associates is medical clinic in oregon that employed ms wells as bookkeeper from 19861997 after her termination from employment ms wells brought an action alleging unlawful discrimination on the basis of discrimination under title i of the ada the clinic denied that it was covered by the ada since it argued that it did not have 15 or more employees for the 20 weeks per year required by the statute the determination of coverage was dependent on whether the four physician shareholders who owned the professional corporation were counted as employees the court first looked to the definition of employee in the ada which states that an employee is an individual employed by an employer 89 this definition was described as one which is completely circular and explains nothing the majority then looked to common law specifically the common law element of control this is the position advocated by the eeoc the eeoc has issued guidelines which list six factor s to be considered in determining whether the continued follow the guidance although some courts do defer to agency expertise 84 29 cfr 16309 85 httpwwweeocgovpolicydocsaccommodationhtml 86 44 f3d 538 7th cir

considered in light of the eeocs standard appeared to favor the conclusion that the four physicians were not employees of the clinic however since there was some evidence that might support the opposite conclusion the court remanded the case for further proceedings justice ginsburg joined by justice breyer dissented from the majoritys opinion the dissenters argued that the courts opinion used only one of the commonlaw aspects of masterservant relationship in addition justice ginsburg noted that the physicianshareholders argued they were employees for the purposes of other statutes

employment claim was the issue in cleveland v policy management systems corp supra the supreme court unanimously held that pursuit and receipt of ssdi benefits does not automatically stop recipient from pursuing an ada claim or even create strong presumption against success under the ada observing that the social security act and the ada both help individuals with disabilities but in different ways the court found that despite the appearance of conflict that arises from the language of the two st atutes the two claims do not inherently conflict to the point where courts should apply special negative presumption like the one applied by the court of appeals here the fact that the ada defines qualified individual as one who can perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation was seen as key distinction between the ada and the social security act in addition the court observed that ssdi benefits are sometimes granted to individuals who are working

supreme courts analysis in cleveland and distinguished the factual situations in cleveland the plaintiff had argued that she had made consistent statements in her ada claim and in the ssdi application however in johnson the seventh circuit found that the plaintiff had merely argued that he was mistaken in his ssdi application the court of appeals concluded that cleveland does not stand for the proposition that defendants should be allowed to explain why they gave false statements on their ssdi applications which is essentially what johnson seeks to do here 92

supreme court held that an employer need not adopt an experimental vision waiver program title i of the ada prohibits discrimination in employment against qualified individual with disability in finding that the plaintiffs inability to comply with the general regulatory vision requirements rendered him unqualified the court framed the question in the following manner is it reasonable to read the ada as requiring an employer like albertsons to shoulder the general statutory burden to justify job qualification that would tend to exclude the disabled whenever the employer chooses to abide by the otherwise clearly applicable unamended substantive regulatory standard despite the governments willingness to waive it experimentally and without any finding of its being inappropriate answering this question in the negative the court observed that employers should not be required to reinvent the governments own wheel and stated that it is simply not credible that congress enacted the ada before there was any waiver program with the understanding that employers choosing to respect the governments sole substantive visual acuity regulation in the face of an experimental waiver might be burdened with an obligation to defend the regulations application according to its own terms in chevron usa inc v echazabal 94 the supreme court held unanimously that the ada does not require an employer to hire an individual with disability if the job in question would endanger the individuals health the adas statutory language provides for defense to an allegation of discrimination that qualification standard is job related and consistent with business necessity95 the act also allows an employer to impose as qualification standard that the individual shall not pose direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace 96 but does not discuss threat to the individuals health or safety the ninth circuit in echazabal had determined that an employer violated the ada by refusing to hire an applicant with serious liver condition whose illness wo uld be aggravated through exposure to the chemicals in the workplace97 the supreme court rejected the ninth circuit decision and upheld regulation by the eeoc that allows an employer to assert direct threat defense to an allegation of employment discrimination where the threat is posed only to the health or safety of the individual making the allegation 98 justice souter found that the eeoc regulations were not the 91 426 f3d 887 7th cir 2005 92 id at 892 93 527 us 555 1999 94 536 us 73 2002 95 42 usc

eeoc was certainly acting within the reasonable zone when it saw differ ence between rejecting workplace paternalism and ignoring specific and documented risks to the employee himself even if the employee would take his chances for the sake of getting job the court emphasized that direct threat defense must be based on medical judgment that uses the most current medical knowledge the supreme court had examined an analogous issue in uaw v johnson controls inc 99 which held that under the civil rights act of 1964 em ployers could not enforce fetal protection policies that kept women whether pregnant or wi th the potential to become pregnant from jobs that might endanger developing fetus although this case was raised by the plaintiff the supreme court distinguished the decision there from that in echazabal the johnson controls decision was described as concerned with paternalistic judgments based on the broad category of gender while the eeoc has required that judgments based on the direct threat provision be made on the basis of individualized risk assessments echazabal has been hailed by employers as major victory for the business community 100 however andrew imparato the president of the american association of people with disabilities stated that the united states supreme court today once again demonstrated its fundamental hostility to disability rights in the workplace todays decision invites paternalism and represents major step backward for the more than 35 million working age americans with disabilities 101

agreements was the subject of the supreme courts decision in wright v universal maritime service corp supra the court held there that the general arbitration clause in collective bargaining agreement does not require plaintiff to use the arbitration procedure for an alleged violation of the ada however the courts decision was limited since the court did not find it necessary to reach the issue of the validity of unionnegotiated waiver in other words the court found that general arbitration agreement in collective bargaining agreement is not sufficient to waive rights under civil rights

justice breyer observed that seniority system provides important employee benefits by creating and fulfilling employee expectations of fair uniform treatment and that to require typical employer to show more than the existence of seniority system might undermine the employees expectations of consistent uniform treatment thus in most ada cases the ex istence of seniority system would entitle an employer to summary judgment in its favor the court found language in the ada which would change this presumption if the seniority system was imposed by management and not by collective bargaining however justice breyer found that there were some exceptions to this rule for special circumstances and gave as examples situations where 1 the employer fairly frequently changes the seniority system unilaterally and thereby diminishes employee expectations to the point where one more departure would not likely make difference or 2 the seniority system contains so many exceptions that one more exception is unlikely to matter although the majority in barnett garnered five votes the courts views were splintered there were strong dissents and two concurring opinions in her concurrence justice oconnor stated that she would prefer to say that the effect of seniority system on the ada depends on whether the seniority system is legally enforceable but that since the result would be the same in most cases as under the majoritys reasoning she joined with the majority to prevent stalemate the dissents took vigorous exception to the majoritys decision with justice scalia joined by justice thomas arguing that the ada does not permit any seniority system to be overridden the dissent by justice souter joined by justice ginsberg argued that nothing in the ada insulated seniority rules from reasonable accommodation requirement and that the legislative history of the ada clearly indicated congressional intent that seniority systems be factor in reasonable accommodations determinations but not the major factor

in raytheon co v hernandez 104 the supreme court was presented with the issue of whether the ada confers preferential rehiring rights on empl oyees who have been lawfully terminated for misconduct in

treatment case and remanding the case the court observed that it has consistently recognized distinction betwee n claims of discrimination based on disparate treatment and claims of discrimination

during the enactment of the ada regarding employment concerned the application of the act to drug addi cts and alcoholics the ada provides that with regard to employment current illegal drug users are not considered to be qualified individuals with disabilities however former drug users and alcoholics would be covered by the act if they are able to perform the essential functions of the job exactly what is current use of illegal drugs has been the subject of some discussion the eeoc has defined current to mean that the illegal drug use occurred recently enough to justify an employers reasonable belief that drug use is an ongoing problem 116 the courts that have examined this issue have generally found that to be covered by the ada the individual must be free of drugs for considerable period of time certainly longer than weeks117 in the appendix to its regulations eeoc further notes that an employer such as law enforcement agency may also be able to impose qualification standard that excludes individuals with history of illegal use of drugs if it can show that the standard is jobrelated and consistent with business necessity118 title i of the ada also provides that covered entity may prohibit the illegal use of drugs and the use of alcohol in the workplace119 similarly employers may hold all employees regardless of whether or not they have disability to the same performance and conduct standards 120 however if the misconduct results from disability the employer must be able to demonstrate that the rule is jobrelated and consistent with business necessity121

employment practice that is discriminatory because of its disparate impact may recover compensatory and punitive damages in order to receive punitive damages the plaintiff must show that there was discriminatory practice engaged in with malice or with reckless indifference to the rights of the aggrieved individuals the amount that can be awarded in punitive and compensatory damages is capped with the amounts varying from 50000 to 300000 depending upon the size of the business123 similarly there is also good faith exception to the award of damages with regard to reasonable accommodation it should also be noted that the supreme court addressed the issue of punitive damages in title vii sex discrimination case kolstad v american dental association124 the court held in kolstad that plaintiffs are not required to prove egregious conduct to be awarded punitive damages however the effect of this holding is limited by the courts determination that certain steps taken by an employer may immunize them from punitive damages since the ada incorporates the title vii provisions the holding in kolstad may be applicable to ada employment cases as well125 in equal employment opportunity commi ssion v walmart stores inc126 the tenth circuit applied kolstad and affirmed an award of punitive damages under the ada this case involved hearing impaired employee of walmart who sometim required the assistance of an interpreter after being employed for about two years in the receiving department the employee was required to attend training session but left when the video tape shown was not close captioned and interpreter was provided after refusing to attend in the absence of an interpreter the employee was transferred to the maintenance department to perform janitorial duties when he questioned the transfer and asked for an interpreter he was again denied after threatening to file complaint with the eeoc the employee was suspended and later terminated from employment he then sued and won compensatory damages and 75000 in punitive damages on appeal the tenth circuit examined the reasoning in kolstad and concluded that the record in walmart is sufficient to resolve the questions of intent and agency laid out in kolstad with regard to intent the court reiterated the facts and further noted that the store manager who ultimately approved the employees suspension had testified that he was familiar with the ada and its provisions regarding accommodation discrimination and retaliation this was seen as sufficient for reasonable jury to conclude that walmart intentionally discriminated walmart had also made an agency argument stating that liability for punitive damages was improper because the employees who discriminated against the employee did not occupy positions of managerial control looking again to the reasoning in kolstad the tenth circuit noted that the walmart employees had authority regarding hiring and firing decisions and observed that such authority is an indicium of supervisory or managerial capacity 123 in gagliardo v connaught laboratories 311 f3d 565 3d cir 2002 an employee who claimed that she was discriminated against due to her multiple sclerosis won an award of 23 million despite the ada caps the court found that the judge had properly proportioned the claims between the federal and state causes of action and found that the fact that the state law did not contain cap indicated that it was intended to provide remedy beyond the federal remedies 124 527 us 526 1999 125 but see barnes v gorman 536 us 181 2002

denied the benefits of the services programs or activities of public entity or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity127 public entity is defined as state and local governments any department or other instrumental ity of state or local government and certain transportation authorities the ada does not apply to the executive branch of the federal government the executive branch and the us postal service are covered by section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973128 the department of justice regulations for title ii contain specific section on program accessibility each service program or activity conducted by public entity when viewed in its entirety must be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities however public entity is not required to make each of its existing facilities accessible 129 program accessibility is limited in certain situations involving historic preservation in addition in meeting the program accessibility requirement public entity is not required to take any action that would result in fundamental alteration in the nature of its service program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens 130 the department of justice has proposed new regulations for both titles ii and iii of the ada131 the proposed regulations include safe harbor provision detailed requirements regarding service animals and requirements regarding power driven mobility devices the proposed title ii regulations have provisions on program accessibility including play areas and swimming pools title ii of the ada would also apply to state and local government emergency preparedness and response programs the department of justice has issued an ada guide for local governments noting that one of the most important roles of cal government is to protect their citizenry from harm including helping people prepare for and respond to emergencies making local government emergency preparedness and response programs accessible to people with disabilities is critical part of this responsibility making these programs accessible is also required by the ada 132 127 42 usc 1213112133 128 29 usc 794 129 28 cfr 35150 130 id the

the supreme court have involved title ii the most significant of these to date is tennessee v lane 133 in lane which was discussed previously under the application of the eleventh amendment section the supreme court held that title ii of the ada as it applies to the fundamental right of access to the courts constitutes valid exercise of congressional authority under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment in addition as discussed previously regarding the eleventh amendment the supreme court in united states v georgia 134 held that title ii of the ada created private cause of action for damages against the states for conduct that actually violates the fourteenth amendment in the first ada case to reach the supreme court pennsylvania department of corrections v yeskey supra the court found in unanimous decision that state prisons fall squarely within the statutory definition of public entity for title ii yeskey involved prisoner who was sentenced to 18 to 36 months in pennsylvania correctional facility but was recommended for placement in motivational boot camp for first time offenders if the boot camp was successfully completed the prisoner would have been eligible for parole in six months the prisoner was denied admission to the program due to his medical history of hypertension and sued under the ada the state argued that state prisoners were not covered under the ada since such coverage would alter the usual constitutional balance between the states and the federal government the supreme court rejected this argument observing th at the ada plainly covers state institutions without any exception that could cast the coverage of prisons into doubt the court noted that prisoners receive many services including medical services educational and vocational programs and recreational activities so that the ada language applying the benefits of the services programs or activities of public entity is applicable to state prisons 135 however the court in yeskey did not address the constitutional issues in olmstead v georgia supra the supreme court examined issues raised by state mental health institutions and held that title ii of the ada re quires states to place individuals with mental disabilities in community settings rather than inst itutions when the states treatment professionals have determined that community placement is appropriate community placement is not opposed by the individual with disability and the placement can be reasonably accommodated136 unjustified isolation is properly regarded as discrimination based on disability the olmstead case had been closely watched by both disability groups and state governments although disability groups have applauded the holding that undue institutionalization qualifies as discrimination by reason of disability the supreme court did place certain limitations on this right in addition to the agreement of the individual affected the court also dealt with the issue of what is reasonable modification of an existi ng program and stated sensibly construed the fundamentalalteration component of the reasonablemodifications regulation would allow the 133 541 us 509 2004 134 546 us 151 2006 135 the supreme court had remanded this cas for consideration of whether yeskey was an individual with disability on remand the district court held that he was not covered by the ada since he was not substantially limited in major life activity yeskey v pennsylvania department of corrections 76 fsupp 2d 572 md pa1999 136 olmstead has focused federal and state attention on the

iii does not re quire that an entity permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the services of public accommodation where such an individual poses direct threat to the health or safety of others169 this issue was discussed by the supreme court in bragdon v abbott supra where the court stated that the existence or nonexistence of significant risk must be determined from the standpoint of the person who refuses the treatment or accommodation and the risk assessment must be based on medical or other objective evidence dr bragdon had the duty to assess the risk of infection based on the objective scientific information available to him and others in his profession his belief that significant risk existed even if maintained in good faith would not relieve him from liability the supreme court remanded the case for further consideration of the direct threat issue on remand the first circuit court of appeals held that summary judgment was warranted finding that dr bragdons

the adas requirements for equal access gave golfer with mobility impairment the right to use golf cart in professional competitions172 the ninth circuit had ruled that the use of the cart was permissible since it did not fundamentally alter the nature of the competition173 title iii of the ada defines the term public accommodation specifically listing golf courses174 the majority opinion looked at this definition and th general intent of the ada to find that golf tours and their qualifying rounds fit comfortably within the coverage of title iii the court then discussed whether there was violation of the substantive nondiscrimination provision of title iii the ada states that discrimination includes failure to make reasonable modifications in policies practices or procedures when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods services facilities privileges advantages or accommodations to individuals with disabilities unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods services facilities privileges advantages or accommodations 175 in theory the court opined there might be funda mental alteration of golf tournament in two ways 1 an alteration in an essential aspect of the game such as changing the diameter of the hole might be unacceptable even if it affected all players equally or 2 less significant change that has only peripheral impact on the game might give golfer with disability an advantage 171 167 f3d 873 4th cir 1999 cert denied 528 us 813 1999 172 532 us 661 2001 173 204 f3d

may refer an individual with disability to another provider if that individual is seeking or requires treatment or services outside of the referring providers area of specialization and if the referring provider would make similar referral for an individual without disability who seeks or requires the same treatment or services 28 cf r 36302 the concept of fundamental alteration did not originate in the statutory language of the ada but was derived from supreme court interpretation of section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 29 usc 794 which in part prohibits discrimination against an individual with disability in any program or activity that receives federa l financial assistance and was the model on which the ada was based in southeastern community college v davis 442 us 397 1979 the supreme court addressed suit by hearing impaired woman who wished to attend college nursing program the college rejected her application because it believed her hearing disability made it impossible for her to pa rticipate safely in the normal clinical training program and to provide safe patient care the supreme court found violation of section 504 and held that it did not encompass the kind of curricular changes that would be necessary to accommodate res pondent in the nursing program since davis could not function in clinical courses without close supervision the court noted that the college would have had to limit her to academic courses the court further observed that whatever benefits res pondent might realize from such course of study she would not receive even rough equivalent of the training nursing program normally gives such fundamental alteration in the nature of program is far more than the modification the regulation requires at 409410 in conclusion the court found that nothing in the language or history of 504 reflects an intention to limit the freedom of an educational institution to require reasonable physical qualifications for admission to clinical training program at 414

competition looking at both these types of situations justice stevens found that waiver of the walking rule for casey martin did not amount to fundamental alteration he noted that the essence of the game was shotmaking and that the walking rule was not an indispensable feature of tournament golf as golf carts are allowed on the senior pga tour as well as certain qualifying events in addition justice stevens found that the fatigue from walking the approximately five miles over five hours was not significant regarding the question of whether allowing casey martin to use cart would give him an advantage the majority observed that an individualized inquiry must be made concerning whether specific modification for particular persons disability would be reasonable under the circumstances and yet not be fundamental alteration in examining the situation presented the majority found that casey martin endured greater fatigue even with cart than other contenders do by walking justice scalia joined by justice thomas wrote scathing dissent describing the majoritys opinion as distorting the text of title iii th structure of the ada and common sense the dissenters contended that title

spector v norwegian cruise line ltd held in decision written by justice kennedy that the ada applies to companies that operate foreign cruise ships in us waters176 prior to this decision there had been split in the circuits with the eleventh circuit holding in stevens v premier cruises inc177 that title iii of the ada does apply to foreign cruise ships and the fifth circuit in spector v norwegian cruise lines178 holding that the ada would not be applicable since applicability would impose us law on foreign nations the supreme courts decision specifically held that the statute is applicable to foreign ships in the united states waters to the same extent that it is applicable to american ships in those waters the majority concurred that cruise ships need not comply with the ada if modifications would conflict with international legal obligations since the ada only requires readily achievable accommodations the 54 decision however was fragmented with various justices joining for various aspects of the opinion it is difficult therefore to determine exactly what type of accommodations would be required by the application of the ada since the case below had been dismissed without trial it was remanded to determine the statutory requirements in this particular situation the question of whether title iii requires any permanent and significant structural modifications that interfere with the international affairs of any cruise ship foreign flag or domestic was specifically left undecided justice scalia in his dissenting opinion argued that the ada should not be

advantages or accommodations of an place of public accommodation by any person who owns leases or leases to or operates place of public accommodation179 the statutory language which was enacted in 1990 prior to widespread internet use does not specifically cover internet sites the question is then whether the statute can be interpreted to include internet sites180 one of the relevant issues in resolving this novel problem is whether place of public accommodation is limited to actual physical structures the courts have split on this issue with the first circuit in carparts distribution center v automotive wholesalers association of new england inc finding that public accommodations are not limited to actual physical structures the court reasoned that to exclude this broad category of businesses from the reach of title iii and limit the application of title iii to physical structures which persons must enter to obtain goods and rvices would run afoul of the purposes of the ada 181 the seventh circuit in doe v mutual of omaha insurance company182 agreed with the first circuit in doe judge posner discussed the nondiscrimination requirements of title iii in the context of case involving cap on insurance policies for aids and aids related complications and found that the core meaning of this provision plainly enough is that the owner or operator of store hotel restaurant dentists office travel agency theater website or other facility whether in physical space or in electronic space that is open to the public cannot exclude disabled persons from entering the facility and once in from using the facility in the same way that the nondisabled do 183 the court reasoned that the owner or operator of say camera store can neither bar the door to the disabled nor let them in but then refuse to sell its cameras to them on the same terms as to other customers184 however judge posner found violation of the ada in this case and concluded that section 302a does not require seller to alter his product to make it equally valuable to the disabled and nondisabled 185 the second circuit joined the first and seventh circuits in finding that the ada is not limited to physical access the court in pallozzi v allstate life insurance co186 stated that title iiis mandate that the disabled be accorded full and equal enjoyment of goods and services of any place of public accommodation suggests to us that the statute was meant to guarantee them more than mere physical access on the other hand the third sixth and ninth circuits apparently restrict the concept of public accommodations to physical places in stoutenborough v national football league inc 187 the sixth circuit dealt with case brought by an asso ciation of individuals with hearing impairments 179 42 usc

several television stations under title iii alleging that the nfls blackout rule discriminated against them since they had other way of accessing football games when live telecasts are prohibited the sixth circuit rejected this allegation holding that the prohibitions of title iii are restricted to places of public accommodations similarly in parker v metropolitan life insurance co188 the sixth circuit held that the adas nondiscrimination prohibition relating to public accommodations did not prohibit an employer from providing employees disabil ity plan that provided longer benefits for employees disabled by physical illness than those di sabled by mental illness in arriving at this holding the sixth circuit found that benefit plan offered by an employer is not good offered by place of public accommodation public accommodation is physical place 189 the precise issue of the adas application to the internet arose in access now inc v southwest airlines co190 where the court held that southwest airlines website was not place of public accommodation and therefore was not covered by the ada the district court examined the adas statutory language noting that all of the listed categories were concrete places and that to expand the ada to cover virtual spaces would be to create new rights previously on november 2 1999 the national federation of the blind nfb filed complaint against america online aol in federal district c ourt alleging that aol violated title iii of the ada nfb and other blind plaintiffs stated that they could only independe ntly use computers by concurrently running screen access software programs for the blind that convert visual information into synthesized speech or braille they alleged that aol had designed its service so that it is incompatible with screen access software programs for the blind failing to remove communications barriers presented by its designs thus denying the blind independent access to this service in

of bills in the last several congresses involves the filing of multiple law suits by an individual w ith disability based on deminimus violations and seeking money for settlement 196 although these cases are seldom tried in court molski v mandarin touch restaurant197 did result in an opinion finding that the plaintiff was vexatious litigant who filed hundreds of law suits designed to harass and intimidate business owners into agreeing to cash settlements the district court ordered the plaintiff to obtain the leave of the court prior to filing any other claims under the ada in related suit the california district court also found against the counsel in the molski case holding that the counsel was required to seek leave of the court before filing any additional ada claims 198 the exact effect of these decisions is uncertain in molski v arby s huntington beach199 mr molski again claimed that restaurant was inaccessible and discriminated against him under the ada the court issued an order to show cause as to why the complaint should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in light of the previous ruling declaring the plaintiff vexatious litigant the court discharged the show cause order finding that while the filing of hundreds of lawsuits may impact mr molskis credibility and the believability of his assertions that he intends to and will return to

addition the ada amendm ents act of 2008 contained some additions to title v section 501 concerns the relationship of the ada to other statutes and bodies of law subpart states that except as otherwise provided in this act nothing in the act shall be construed to apply lesser standard than the standards applied under title v of the rehabilitation act or the regulations issued by federal agencies pursuant to such title subpart b provides that nothing in the act shall be construed to invalidate or limit the remedies rights and procedures of any federal state or local law that provides greater or equal protection nothing in the act is to be construed to preclude the prohibition of or restrictions on smoking subpart d provides that the act does not require an individual with disability to accept an accommodation which that individual chooses not to accept 208 subpart c of section 501 limits the application of the act with respect to the coverage of insurance however the subsection may not be used as subterfuge to evade the purposes of titles i and iii the exact parameters of insurance coverage under the ada are somewhat uncertain as the eeoc has stated the interplay between the nondiscrimination principles of the ada and employer provided health insurance whic h is predicated on the ability to make health related distinctions is both unique and complex 209 the eighth circuit court of appeals in henderson v bodine aluminum inc issued preliminary injunction compelling the plaintiffs employer to pay for chemotherapy that required an autologous bone marrow transplant210 the plaintiff was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer and her oncologist recommended entry into clinical trial that randomly assigns half of its participants to high dose chemotherapy that necessitates an autologous bone marrow transplant because of the possibility that the plaintiff might have the more expensive bone marrow treatment the employers health plan refused to precertify the placement noting that the policy covered high dose chemotherapy only for certain types of cancer not breast cancer the court concluded that if the evidence shows that given treatment is nonexperimentalthat is if it is widespread safe and significant improvement on traditional therapiesand the plan provides the treatment for other conditions directly comparable to the one at issue the denial of treatment violates the ada 211 208 29 usc 790 et seq 209 eeoc interim policy guidance on ada and health insu rance bnas americans with disabilities act manual 701051 june 8 1993 this

the act states that the ada does not alter eligibility standards for benefits under state workers compensation laws or under state or federal disability benefit programs pl 110325 also states that nothing in the act alters the provision of section 302b2aii212 specifying that reasonable modifications in policies practices or procedures shall be required unless an entity can demonstrate that making such modifications in policies practices or procedures including academic requirements in postsecondary education would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods services facilities privileges advantages or accommodations involved the senate statement of managers notes that this provision was added at the request of the higher education community and is included solely to provide assurances that the bill does t alter current law with regard to the obligations of academic institutions under the ada which we believe is already demonstrated in case law on this topic 213 the managers statement also noted that this provision is unrelated to the purpose of this legislation and should be given meaning in interpreting the definition of disability214 the ada amendments act specifically prohibits reverse discrimination claims and states that nothing in the act shall provide the basis for claim by person without disability that he or she was subject to discrimination because of lack of disability the rules of construction provide that covered entity under title i public entity under title ii or person who operates place of public accommodation under title iii need not provide reasonable accommodation or reasonable modification to policies practices or procedures to an individual who meets the definition of disability solely under the regarded as prong of the

section 507 provides for technical assistance to help entities covered by the act in understanding their responsibilities section 508 provides for study by the national council on disability regarding

individual whose disability requires the use of wheelchair section 514 provides that where appropriate and to the extent authorized by law the use of alternative means of dispute resolution is encouraged 215 section 515 provides for severability of any provision of the act that is found to be unconstitutional the coverage of congress was major controversy during the housesenate conference

section was the subject of supreme court decision in buckhannon board and care home inc v west virginia department of human resources217 in buckhannon the supreme court addressed the catalyst theory of attorneys fees which posits that plaintiff is prevailing party if the lawsuit brings about voluntary change in the defendants conduct the court rejected this theory finding that attorneys fees are only available where there is judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties statutes providing for the award of attorneys fees allow courts to make the awards to the prevailing party the question presented in buckhannon was whether the term prevailing party includes party who did not secure judg ment on the merits or courtordered consent decree but has nonetheless achieved the desired result because the lawsuit has brought about voluntary change in the defendants conduct the court in an opinion by then chief justice rehnquist examined the ada and the fair housing amendments act fhaa218 and held that the term prevailing party cannot be interpreted in this manner thus rejecting the concept of catalyst theory four other members of the court justices oconnor scalia kennedy and thomas joined with the chief justice while justices ginsburg stevens souter and breyer dissented the court first noted that in the united states parties are ordinarily required to bear their own attorneys fees but that congress has authorized the award of attorneys fees in numerous statutes in addition to the ones at issue in buckhannon these feeshifting provisions have been interpreted in the same manner and the court noted citing to hensley v eckerhart 219 that it approached the attorneys fees provisions of the ada and the fhaa in this manner examining prior supreme court cases chief justice rehnquist found that party receiving judgment on the merits would clearly have basis on which attorneys fees might be awarded similarly the court found that settlement agreements enforced through consent decree may serve as the basis for an award of attorneys fees the catalyst theory was seen as dissimilar from these examples since it allows an award where there is judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties 220 voluntary change even if it accomplished what the plaintiff sought the court found lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change221 216 congress has also applied the employment and public accommodation provisions of the ada to the executive office of the president pl 104331 october 26 1996 217 532 us 598 2001 218 42

the ada bills were introduced in both the house and senate to amend the ada to broaden the definition of disability the supreme courts interpretation of the definition of disability in various cases including sutton v united air lines inc 222 and toyota motor manufacturing v williams223 was strongly criticized as limiting the reach of the ada224 the bills s 1881 110th cong 1st sess and hr 3195 110th cong 1st sess responded to supreme court decisions which narrowly interpreted the class of individuals who are protected by the adas nondiscrimination provisions in his introductory remarks on s 1881 senator harkin stated in recent years the courts have ignored congresss clear intent as to who should be protected under the ada and the courts have narrowed the definition of who qualifies as an individual with disability as consequence millions of people we intended to be protected under the ada including people wi th epilepsy diabetes and cancer are not protected any more 225 s 1881 introduced by senator harkin was referred to the senate health education labor and pensions committee and hearings were held on november 15 2007226 hr 3195 introduced by representative hoyer was
