individuals are not required to enroll in the dental plan offered by their fehb plan for example an indi vidual whose health insurance is provided by geha may enroll in metlifes dental plan and in

family members and by residency for dental plans only unlike nationwide fehb plans individuals enrolled in fedvip dental plan pay different premiums depending on where they live in the country or overseas active employees pay fedvip premiums on pretax basis called premium conversion however unlike fehb plans empl oyees may not opt out of premium conversion pretax premiums are not available to annuitants survivor annuitants or compensationers while there are preexisting condition exclusions for this coverage there are waiting periods for orthodontia individuals must be in the same plan for the entire waiting period and switching to new plan may require beginning the waiting period over again there are waiting periods for vision services while the statutes allow for more stringent waiting periods for individuals who do not enroll at their first enrollment opportunity the brochures for 2008 do not indicate that plans have imposed additional restrictions enrollees will pay less outofpocket costs if they use innetwork services g6g142g151g157g138g149g561g18g149g138g151g156g561 for 2008 the four nationwide dental plans are aetna geha metlife and united concordia both geha and metlife have two optionsa high and standard option there are also three regional plans triples covering puerto rico ghi covering new york and parts of pennsylvania connecticut and new jersey and compbenefits covering 19 states4 washington dc and parts of maryland only the nationwide plans also provide coverage overseas the benefits provided by these plans include but are not limited to the following 1 class basic servicesoral examinations prophylaxis diagnostic evaluations sealants and xrays 2 class b intermediate servicesrestorative procedures such as fillings prefabricated stainless steel crowns periodontal scaling tooth extractions and denture adjustments 3 class c major servicesendodontic services such as root canals periodontal services such as gingivectomy major restorative services such as crowns oral surgery and bridges and prosthodontic services such as complete dentures and 4 class d orthodontic service premiums for these plans vary by geographic area for example an aetna enrollee in washington dc will pay monthly premiu m of 2897 for selfonly coverage monthly premiums for aetnas plan range from 2635 to 3683 depending on where the enrollee resides for all dental plans self 1 premiums are approximately twice the plans selfonly premium and family premiums are about three times the plans selfonly premium thus comparing plan premiums is slightly more complex than comparing nationwide fehb plan premiums for which everyone in the same selfonly plan pays the same premium regardless of where they live and for which there is self 1 option similar to the fehb program premiums also vary by high or standard options table 1 below compares the national dental plans including the monthly premiums for the washington dc area 5 monthly selfonly premiums range from 2271 for metlifes standard plan to 3790 for gehas high option plan only aetna had premium increase over last year with other plans increasing selfonly premiu ms from about 1 per month geha high option

vision plans are fep bluevision blue cross and blue shield spectera and vision service plans vsp each of these plans has both high and standard option and also provides both nationwide and overseas coverage annual premiums for the three plans are similar annual selfonly coverage is 7176 for spectera 9936 for vsp and 10320 for fep bluevisions plan the highoption plans cost about 20 to 40 more per year premiums for self 1 plans are about double the costs of selfonly plans and premiums for family plans are about triple the costs for 2008 spectera had very small premium increase for selfonly standard coverage premiums increased by 020 per month and high plan premiums increased by 039 per month each about 5 increase the other vision plans premiums remained the same the more significant differences are found in benefits and network limitations for example under the fep bluevision plan enrollees must stay innetwork for covered services with two exceptions those who living in limited access area or those who receive services overseas enrollees are responsible for any difference between the amount billed by the provider and the actual plan payment spectera and vsp both allow for reimbursement for visits to outofnetwork providers generally covered services are limited to eye exams choice between lenses for glasses or contacts and extra discounts and savings on noncovered services such as progressive lenses and additional glasses the services are provided according to schedule such as eye exams every 12 months and new frames every 24 months additionally plans cover low vision coverage on limited basis as shown in table 2 an individual enrolled in either of specteras plans could have an exam and new lenses and frames once during the course of year the copayment would be 10 for the exam and 10 for the lenses or 25 for both lenses and frames if new frames were purchased specteras standard option includes scratchresistant coating and polycarbonate lenses and the high option also covers basic progressive lenses tinted lenses and uv coating plan brochures provide more detail on the differences between the standard and high options the choice of covered frames is also limited for those using services outside the network the plans provide schedule of payments enrollees may opt for contact lenses in lieu of glasses subject to each plans limits ie generally limit

deciding whether or not to enroll in fedvip including 1 coverage of these services in fehb pla nmore likely for those enrolled in health maintenance organization hmo 2 likelihood of using services covered by the plans and 3 placing the same dollar amount that would be used toward dental andor vision benefits premiums in an fsa available to employees and not annuitants each prospective enrollee must weigh these considerations and others against his or her own level of risk aversion as well as the fact that the individual pays 100 of the premium

plan is primary and the fedvip plans are the secondary payers however generally the nationally available fehb plans have limited dental and vision coverage this year geha added limited vision coverage under its plans offering an annual eye exam with 25 copayment geha similar to some of the other national plans has an arrangement with certain providers for discounted eyewear but the enrollee would still be responsible for 100 of the discounted cost in contrast some of the fehb hmotype plans offer more comprehensive dental and vision benefits some highdeductible plans also provide some coverage it is important to compare fehb coverage to determine if also enrolling in fedvip is beneficial

they will use services such an individual who wears glasses or dependent who will need orthodontics some services cannot be as easily predicted such as an individual needing root canal individuals mu st weigh their expected benefits against the premiums for example an individual who wears glasses has yearly eye exam and uses provider innetwork may find that paying the prem ium will result in lower costs than paying for each of these services separately even with pretax fsa funds for employees on the other hand an individual who does not wear glasses may not benefit from vision supplemental insurance there is not however onetoone correlation between buying any insurance and the expectation of using the services there is still large share of unknown risk that any insurance protects

so that they may decide to enroll in one none or both annuitants can not contribute to an fsa or pay premiums with pretax dollars enrollees who choose both can use funds in the fsa for any copayments coinsurance amounts deductibles amounts exceeding annual or lifetime maximums or amounts above the plans payment for outofnetwork services some individuals may decide that they prefer to only contribute to an fsa and not enroll in either the dental or vision plan and instead use their fsa funds to pay for any dental or vision expenditures while using fsa funds provides the most flexibility it may be that the dental and vision premiums cover more than the same dollars in the fsa individuals who are not sure they will use the services provided under fedvip can wait and see and if they do not use dental or vision services they can use the fsa dollars for other qualified medical expenses others may choose to enroll only in fedvip and minimize their outofpocket expenditures by staying innetwork decisions about fedvip and fsa can be revisited every year during open season g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 hinda
