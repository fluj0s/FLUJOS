environmental activists strongly oppose ep as actions arguing that fifra does not protect water quality from harmful pollutant discharges as the cwa is intended to do other stakeholders such as

1999 pp 39pesticide use and water quality are the laws complementary or in conflict introduction it has been noted that the potential for overlapping and potentially conflicting regulatory scope between fe deral statutes is common especially in the heavily regulated area of envi ronmental protection1 this potential is receiving attention today in connection with implementation of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra2 and the federal water pollution control act clean water act cwa3 fifra requires the environmental protection agency epa to regulate the sale and use of pesticides in the united states through registration and labeling the cwa is the principal federal law governing pollution in the nations surface waters pesticides used to control weeds insects and other pests receive public attention because of potential impacts on humans and the environment depending on the chemical possible health effects from overexposure to pesticides include cancer reproductive or ne rvoussystem disorders and acute toxicity similar effects are possible in the aquatic environment recent studies suggest that some pesticides can disrupt endocrine systems and affect re production by interferi ng with natural hormones however many pesticides and their br eakdown pr oducts do not have standards or guidelines and current sta ndards and guidelines do not yet account for exposure to mixtures and seasonal pulses of high concentrations effects of pesticides on aquatic life ar concern because intensive surveys done by the us geological survey found that more th an onehalf of streams sampled had concentrations of at least one pesticid that exceeded an epa guideline for the protection of aquatic life whereas most toxicity and exposure assessments of pesticides are based on cont rolled experiments with single contaminant the us geological survey sampling found that most contamination of waterbodies occurred as pesticide mixtures4 for the more than 30 years since congress enacted fifra and the clean water act there has been little apparent direct conflict between them epas operating principle during that time has been that pe sticides used according to the requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32884crs2 of fifra do not require regulatory cons ideration under the cwa epa has never required cwa permits for use of fifraapproved materials and epa rules currently do not specifically address the i ssue however epas interpretation and operating practice regarding the relationship between the two laws have recently been challenged in several arenas federal courts have b een one of two battlegrounds so far where the potential conflict between the regulatory scope of these two laws has been waged epa regulatory proceedin gs have been the second battleground area congressional action could add third testing of the issues at issue is how fifraapproved pestic ides that are sprayed over and into waters are regulated and specifically whether the fifra regulatory regime is sufficient alone to ensure protection of water quality or whether such pesticide application requires approva l under cwa permit the issue arose initially over challenges to some routine practices in the west weed control in irrigation ditches and spraying for silvicultu ral pest control on us fo rest service lands it subsequently drew more attention in connec tion with efforts by public health officials throughout the country to combat mosquito borne illnesses such as west nile virus the litigation created uncertainty over whether application of pesticides and herbicides to waterbodies requires wa ter discharge permit epa has tried to promulgate policy to clarify the relationshi p of the two laws nd to address conflicts resulting from several judicial rulings ultimately in regulation issued in november 2006 related issue of intere st to many pesticide appli cators but not yet addressed by epa policy or rule cerns pesticides that unint entionally impact waterbodies through drift or migration from nearby land such as field of crops this report provides background on th conflict over interpretation and implementation of fifra and the clean water act brief discussion of the two laws is followed by review of the major litigation of interest epas efforts to clarify its policy in this area and the nove mber 2006 final rule are discussed as well as possible options for epa and congress to further address the fifracwa issues the laws fifra is regulatory statute governing the licensing distribution sale and use of pesticides including ins ecticides fungicides roden ticides and other designated classes of chemicals its objective is to protect human health and the environment from unreasonable adverse effects of pestic ides to that end it establishes nationally uniform pesticide labeling syst em requiring the registration of all pesticides and herbicides sold in the united states and requiring users to comply with conditions of use included on the nati onal label fifra label encompasses the terms on which chemical is register ed and its requireme nts become part of fifras regulatory scheme in registering the chemical epa makes finding that the chemical when used in accordance w ith widespread and commonly recognized practice will not generally cause unreasona ble adverse effects on the environment 7 usc 136ac5d epa reviews

the direct supervision of person w ho has been trained nd certified or for general use fifra preempts state local and tribal regulations stricter than or different from epa rules with respect to labeling requirements but allows states and localities to adopt more re strictive conditions with regard to sale and use use of pesticide product in manner not consistent with its label is prohibited and the law provides civil and criminal penalties for violations under fifra epa generally enforces the laws requirements however the law also gives states with adequate enforcement procedures laws and regulations primary authority for enforcing fifra provisions related to pesticide use the objective of the cwa is to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nation s waters to that end it creates comprehensive regulatory scheme to cont rol the discharge of waste and pollutants the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states without permit violates the act the permit requirement is at the heart of the acts compliance and enforcement strategy several aspects of these core requirements in the law are important to evaluating whether the cwa applies to specific activities including whether there is discharg from point source disc rete conveyance such as pipe ditch container vessel or other floating craft whether the discharge is made into waters of the united states and whether the material discharged is pollutant all of these terms are defined in the act especially key in the current context is whether pesticides are pollutants under the act this issue has been central to much of the judicial and regulatory debate over whether the two laws cwa and fifra are complementary or in conflict cwa section 502 6 33 usc 13626 defines pollutant thus the term pollutant means dredged spo il solid waste incinerator residue sewage garbage sewage sludge m unitions chemical wastes biological materials radioactive materials heat wrecked or discarded equipment rock sand cellar dirt and industrial municipal and agricultural waste discharged into water section 402 of the act establishes the national pollutant di scharge elimination system npdes permitting requirement which regulates the lawful discharge of pollutants the act defines discharge of pollutant to mean any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from an point source cwa section 50212 33 usc 136212 discharges are permitted if they are author ized under npdes permit that meets cwa requirements incl uding protecting the receiving waters npdes permits specify limits on what pollutants may be discharged and in what amounts they also include monitoring nd reporting requirements they are either individual casebycase permits or general permits applicable to

reporter news analysis january 2005 p 10055the npdes permit is the acts principal enforcement tool epa may issue compliance order or bring civil suit in us district court against persons who violate the terms of permit and stiffer penalties are authorized for criminal violations of the act as practical matter the majority of actions taken to enforce the law are undertaken by states both because states issue the majority of permits to dischargers and because the federal govern ment lacks the resources for daytoday monitoring and enforcement in addition individuals may bring citizen suit in us district court against persons who violat the terms of cwaauthorized permit or who discharge without valid permit fifra does not authorize citizen suits throughout the united states pesticides often are applied in onto or near waterbodies to control weeds and insects whether those pesticides are adversely affecting water quality has not been disputed issue til recently it has been epas longstanding practice and interpretation of the laws that cwa permit is not required when pesticide application is done in manner consistent with fifra and its regulations but that interpretation has been challenged in several lawsuits brought since the late 1990s that have been decided since 2001 the litigation five federal court cases testing the relationship between fifra and the cwa have drawn the most attention three in the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit in the west concerning pesticide applications by agricultural and natural resource managers and two in the second circuit court of appeals in the east involving the use of pesticides by gove rnment and public health authorities for mosquito control these cases have been brought principally under the citizen suit provisions of the cwa so far two of the ninth circuit decisions have held that cwa permits are required for at least so activity involving the point source discharge of fifraregulated pesticides over or into waters of the united states and the third held that permit was not requi red because the specific pesticide was not chemical waste the s econd circuit while not yet holding that permit is not required appears to some observers to be less willing to interpret the cwa to require npdes permits for application of fifraregulated chemicals5 thus far this appeals court has remanded two cases to district courts for further proceedings involving related issues it has not yet speci fically addressed whet her the application of fifraapproved pesticides requires cwa discharge permit as the ninth circuit has the ninth circuit cases the first of the major cases on these issues involved application of herbicides in irrigation ditches in the case major issue was whether the application of pesticides constitutes the discharge of pollutant environmental groups challenged appli cation of an aquatic herbicide called magnicide h to kill weeds and algae and sought to require that the applicator municipal corporation that operates system of irriga tion canals in oregon obtain an npdes permit httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32884crs5 6 in view of the supreme courts june 2006 decision in

specific reference to headwaters inc v ta lent irrigation district for additional information see crs report rl33263 the wetlands coverage of the clean water act is revisited by the supreme court rapanos v united states by robert meltz and claudia copelandthe ninth circuit court of appeals endor sed the lower courts ruling that the pesticide was pollutant under the cwa nd that the irrigation canals into which the pesticide was being sprayed are waters of the united states6 but it rejected the lower courts holding that cwa permit wa s not required because the pesticide was properly regulated by fifra and had an epaapproved fifra label the appeals court ruled that fifra and cwa have diffe rent purposes and that as such neither could be controlling on the application of the other the court said that fifra creates comprehensive regulatory scheme for the labeling of pesticides requiring that all insecticides and herbicides sold in the united states be registered with the epa it and the cwa have different lthough complementary purposes the court said and using pesticide with fifr aapproved label does not obviate the need to obtain cwa permit the fifra label is the same nationwide the cwa permit considers local envi ronmental conditions which the fifra label does not thus nationwide label on fifraregulated chemical could not be controlling on whether cwa permit is required because it does not account for locationspecific requirements the court reversed the dist rict courts grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants headwaters inc v talent irrigation

that the forest service had failed to obtain cwa permit which they argued is required for this type of aerial spraying the appeals court reversed the district courts grant of summary judgment for the

apparatus thus meeting all of the elements of the cwas finition of point source pollutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32884crs6 7 robert fabricant epa general counsel i nterpretive statement and guidance addressing effect of ninth ci rcuit decision in league of wilderness defenders v forsgren on application of pesticides and fire re tardants memorandum september 3 2003 7 ppin september 2003 the epa general c ounsel issued legal memorandum to officials in states located in th ninth circuit responding to the forsgren case the memorandum said that epa disagreed with the courts holding in the case and that outside the ninth circuit epa would tinue its longstanding interpretation of fifra and the cwa within the ninth circuit the memo said epa would not acquiesce to the ruling in the case of materi als other than pesticides such as those used for fire control or in circumstances where pesticides are not applied directly over and into waters of the united states7 the third and most recent ninth circuit case involved an effo rt by the montana department of fish wildlife and parks to intentionally apply the pesticide antimycin to river in order to rem ove nonnative trout species and thus to allow reintroducing threatened fish species into the river the director of the department was sued under the citizen suit provision of the cwa by citizen who sought to require the department to obtain an npdes permit before applying the pesticide the court held in this instance that npdes permit was re quired because the facts of the case demonstrated that following application as intended the antimycin dissipated rapidly leaving excess porti ons or residual chemical that should be characterized as chemical waste and thus is not pollutant under the act fairhurst v hagener 422 f3d 1146 9th cir 2005 intentionally applied and properly performing pesticides are not pollutants the court said the court distinguished this case from its ruling in headwaters saying that the factual scenarios differ because in that case the chemical waste for which npdes permit was required was not pesticide serving beneficial purpose and intentionally applied to water but was chemical that remained in the water after the magnicide h performed its intended benefici function id at 1150 further the court stated that its analysis accords with epas construction of the cwas definition of chemical waste in the context of intentionally applied pesticides and that the agencys 2003 interim statemen t and guidance addressing the issue discussed below is entitled to some deference epas interpretation as presented in that interim statement is reasonable nd not in conflict with the expressed intent of congress the court said the second circuit cases two cases in the second circuit involve the use of pesticides for mosquito control in the first case several residents of the town of amherst ny sought to halt aerial application of pesticides without cwa permit the district court initially dismissed the case stating that spray drift is not chemical waste under the cwa and that th pesticide use was best regulated under fifra but the appeals court remanded the case to the district court for further development of the record altman v town of amherst ny 47 fed appx 62 2d cir 2002 although this ruling may not be cited as precedent it is notable in that while epa had filed an amicus curiae brief providing its views on this particularhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32884crs7 8 47 fed appx at 67case the court invited epa to offer its views broadly on the policy and legal questions the court stated until the epa articulates clear interpretation of current law among other things whether properly used pesticides released into or over waters of the united states can trigger the requirement for npdes permits the question of whether properly used pesticides can become pollutants that violate the cwa will remain open participation by the epa in this litigation in any way that permits articulation of the epas interpreta tion of the law in this situation would be of great assistance to the courts8 the second pertinent case in the sec ond circuit also involved the use of pesticides for control of mosquitoes pl aintiffs in the case citizens group sought an injunction to halt the aerial and gr ound spraying arguing that although the pesticides were properly re gulated under fifra the spra ying program involved the discharge of pollutant without cwa per mit and thus was violation of that law while the federal district court ruled that fifras refusal to allow enforcement by citizen suit should prevail over the cwas llowance of such suits unless the alleged violation of the cwa also constitutes substantial violation of fifra the appeals court disagreed it held that the cwa authorizes any citizen to bring suit to enforce its requirements regardless of whether the claimed cw violation also violated fifra spray coalition v city of new york 351 f3d 602 2d cir 2003 the second circuit remanded the case to the dist rict court for further proceedings on the cwa claims in june 2005 the district c ourt rejected summary judgment motions by the parties saying that disputed issues of material fact exist as to whether the city has discharged pollutant into navigabl waters without permit 2005 westlaw 1354041 other litigation other lawsuits have followed these cases for example private citizens who operate an organic fru it farm in gem county idaho brought suit against the local mosquito abatement distri ct there seeking to require cwa permit for pesticide spraying finding itself in the proverbial spot between rock and hard place the mosquito ab atement district applied fo r permit from epa which the agency declined to issue base d on its longstanding policy and legal interpretation thereafter the mosquito ab atement district filed lawsuit against epa in an attempt to obtain declaration that cwa permit is not needed and to avoid the citizen suit litigation which is pending in federal c ourt in idaho the mosquito abatement district asked the federal court either for judgment saying that permit is required or if the court were to determine otherwise an order directing epa to process its cwa pe rmit application in janua ry 2005 the federal district court in the district of columbia dismissed the case because the mosquito abatement district and epa were in agreement that cwa permit is required for pesticide applications that are consistent with fifra gem county mosquito abatement district v epa 398 f supp 2d 1 ddc 2005

aerial spraying and instead rely on ground spraying until such time as government or the courts clarify the law epas regulatory responses the rulings by the ninth circuit in the headwaters and forsgren cases and possible endorsement by other courts greatly alarmed rang of stakeholders in the regulated community including forestry ag riculture and pesticide applicators as well as municipal and public health offici als concerned with the need to control mosquitos and other vectors associated with diseases such as west nile virus and malaria they feared that cwa permit requirements would be extended to agricultural and other activitie s that have not traditionally been regulated under the cwa they argue that if permits tailore d to particular circumstances are deemed necessary such requirements would present significant costs operational difficulties and delays to applicators they also would put pressure on limited federal and state cwa permitting resources in their view requiring permits will not be environmentally helpful but the expense and long delays of permitting proceedings will hamper programs that are needed for controlling pests that threaten public health and crops in response epa has issued two interpretive guidance documents in 2003 and 2005 and in 2005 proposed rulema king to formalize its longstanding position on cwafifra issues final ru was promulgate d in november 2006 epas 2003 interim guidance since the altman v town of amherst ruling in 2002 industry states and others includi ng some in congress have pressed epa to clarify the emerging conflicts over th two laws epa responded in july 2003 with an interim statement and guidance memorandum9 in it epa presented its interpretation of whether an npdes permit is required for the application of pesticides that comply with fifra epas position was that application of pesticides either directly in us waters or aerially above or near the waters to control pests does not require cwa permit so long as the use is done in compliance with relevant fifra requirement s the memorandum acknowle dged the federal courts holding to the contrary in the headwaters v talent case but then described why epa concludes otherwise under the agencys evaluation pesticides applied in manner consistent with fifra do not constitute either chemical wastes or biological materials under the definition of pollutant in section 5026 of the cwa the rationale for this position is that it is consistent with over 30 years of cwa administration10 the memorandum noted that pestic ide applications in violation of fifra that is when not used or applied according to applicable labeling requirements would be subject to all relevant statutes including the clean water act epa invited public comments on the interim guidance statement throughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32884crs9 11 ibid p 48388 12 ibidoctober 14 2003 but the position stated in the memorandum took effect immediately and would apply until epa issues final position on the matter the interim statement addressed in detail the question of whether in epas view pesticides are pollutants within th meaning of cwa section 5026 since the discharge of pollutants is regulated under the act in the memorandum epa argued that chemical pesticides are not wastes and therefore are not pollutants because they are epaevaluated products designed purchased and applied to perform their intended purpose of controlling target organisms in the environment11 neither does epa believe that biological pesticides eg products derived from plants fungi bacteria or other nonmanma synthesis and which can be used for pest control that usually do not have toxic effects on animals and people compared with many chemical pesticides are pollutants both chemical and biological pesticides are intended to perform essentially similar functions and it would be nonsensical to treat chemical and biologi cal pesticides differently12 responses to the 2003 interim guidance the 2003 guidance was issued in part to clarify the agencys interpretations of legal rulings on the issue and to remove any uncertainty regarding application of herbicides and pesticides to combat vectorborne diseases that are tr ansported by mosquitoes however epas guidance satisfied few stakehol ders for differing reasons environmental activists strongly object ed to epas position which they argue is contrary to the recent judicial rulings these groups reiterated points made by the ninth circuit court in the headwaters and forsgren rulings namely that chemical and biological pesticides are pollutants within the meaning of the cwa as the law defines pollutants broadly nd includes among other subs tances chemical wastes biological materials and agricultural wastes as that court has declared environmentalists said fifra does not overri the cwa and the two statutes must work in tandem to prevent injury to aquatic life they also argued that epa is wrongly deciding that materials with be neficial uses should not be construed as pollutants under the cwa environmentalists objections also went to the policy problems of relying on fifra to protect water quality from pesticide applications as that would be the result of epas position that position critic s said turns on whether the pesticide application conforms procedur ally with fifra requirements not what is the water quality impact of that pesticide other concerns raised by critics included the fact that while the fifra registration process calls for ecological risk assessment that may be adequate for producing nationally pplicable labels it does not ensure that local water quality standards are mainta ined and does not account for additive or synergistic effects of multip pollutants discharged to particular waterbody environmentalists argued that the cwa provides the means to determine whether and under what conditions it is safe to di scharge particular pesticide into particular body of water and that fifras nationally uniform labeling system cannot do that fifra is not specifically charged with ensuring the chemical physical andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32884crs10 13 us

february 1 2005biological integrity of us waterways and satisfaction of pesticides fifra labeling criteria does not automatically satisfy water quality concerns as the npdes permit process is intended to do they also maintained that fifra fails to consider the lasting effects that pesticide residues have on local ecosystem and that localized analysis of the environmental impact of pollutant discharges under the cwa is necessary due to the toxic residues that remain after pesticid application which fifra does not address additionally activists said fifra has provisions for publicly accessible compliance information and means of citizen enforcement in case of violations as does the cwa fifra essentially assumes users compliance with restrictions on pesticides label industry welcomed the thrust of the 2003 interim statement but also urged that it be broadened agricultura l groups requested that ep include other classes of applications under the guidance such as aquaculture and crop production beyond the types of uses described in the propos ed rule some argued that epa should additionally clarify that cwa permits are not required in the case of pesticides that are applied over land and then inadvertently impact waterbodies through drift and migration many of these commenters re quested that epa address the issues definitively in rulemaking rather than in nonbinding guidance in their view without clear regulatory language s upporting epas interp retation pesticide applicators would still face the prospect of citizen lawsuits and npdes permit requirements many states and local governments including agriculture agencies irrigation districts and mosquito abatement dist ricts strongly endorsed epas proposed clarification of its interpretation of the two laws however few especially states located in the jurisdiction of the federal ninth circuit expressed different view the oregon department of environmenta l quality and california state water resources control board commented that the interim statement conflicted with legal precedent in the headwaters case they urged epa if it wishes to create an exemption for pesticide applications conduc ted in compliance with fifra to ask congress to amend the clean water act and fifra accordingly final guidance and proposed rulemaking in january 2005 18 months after issuing the interim guidance memo randum and considering public comments on it epa issued final guidance in the form of an interpretive statement and guidance and simultaneously proposed formal rulemaking to codify the substance of the guidance in cwa regulations13 the 2005 interpretive statement closely mirrored the 2003 interim statement and guidance epa modified the 2003 guidance in several minor ways such as clarifying that compliance with relev ant requirements under fifra refers to requirements relevant to protection of water quality and clarifying that the exclusionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32884crs11

of pests on or above us waters and pests near water as well the final interpretive statement did not endorse the expansion sought by some to clarify that cwa permits also are not required for pesticide applications to land and crops that may drif t to nearby waterbodies press reports indicated that epa termed the final policy an interpretive statement rather than guidance in an effort to get more deference from the courts when agency policies face legal challenge epa also hoped that because the agency solicited public comments on the 2003 inte rim statement courts would give deference to the final policy14 in public comments on the 2003 interim guidance number of critics argued that epas interpretation of the two laws represented reversal of positions the agency had taken in the forsgren case when it supported environmentalists appeal of the district courts original ruling as well as its position in amicus curiae briefs in other litigation in its amicus brief in forsgren epa stated that the regulatory review required by each of the statutes is different and considers different factors and that fifra does not take into account all f actors needed to judg whether particular pesticide discharge should be permitted under the cwa responding to those points the epa general counsel i ssued memorandum in january 2005 to explain some of those prior statements the memorandum acknowledged that there could seemingly be inconsistencies in prev ious government positions but argued that on detailed examination differences ar based on the specific facts of the litigation not the general policies now being addressed mo reover in the current context the interpretive statement fully reflects the exercise of the agencys legal and policy judgment after considering public comment s and the evolution in the agencys thinking in certain respects since the brief was filed in that case15 rulemaking proposal simultaneously with issuance of the interpretive statement and guidance in january 2005 epa also proposed rulemaking to codify the interpretive statement the proposed rule would modify epa regulations 40 cfr 1223 to specify that npdes permits are not required for the application of pesticides to us waters consistent with ll relevant require ments under fifra in order to control pests that are present over waters of the united states including near such waters

quality policies and ru more stringent than epa requires as noted above some st akeholders feared that so long as epas policy was articulated just as guidance states could choose to require cwa permits for pesticide application t hus one rationale for formaliz ing the epa policy in rule was presumably to restrict that possibility in the 2005 interpretive statement the agency said that under

activity is not also subject to the distinct npdes permitting requirements of the cwa16 however epa also noted that the polic does not preclude states from further limiting the use of particular pesticide in order to address local water quality concerns some may see these two statements as being somewhat inconsistent final rule the 2005 guidance and proposed rule allowed second opportunity for the public to comment on epas policy after reviewing those comments epa promulgated final ru in november 2006 to formalize its interpretation of the cwafifra issues17 the final rule which became effective january 26 2007 substantially tracked the 2005 proposal to revise the npdes program rules to add two specific circumstances that are excluded from npdes permit requirements when the application complies with relevant requirements of fifra the application of pesticides directly to waters of the united states in order to control pests eg to control mosquito larvae or aquatic weeds and the application of pesticides to control pests that are present over waters of the united states including near such waters where portion of the pesticides will unavoidably be deposited to waters of the united states in order to target the pests effectively epa modified the 2005 proposal only to clar ify the types of pe sticide applications covered in the second circumstance to be those where the pesticide necessarily must enter the water to achieve its intended purpose for example mosquito adulticide applications can result in some pesticide product enteri ng the water because adult mosquitoes generally live over and adjacent to waterbodies18 in the final rule epa provided leng thy discussion of its rationale that pesticides when applied pursuant to fifra are not chemical wastes or biological materials and thus are not what the cwa defines as pollutants see discussion page 3 above however epa also acknowle dged that application of pesticides may leave residual materials in us waters after the product has rved its beneficial purpose and that these residual materials ma be pollutants under the act at that later time nonetheless even in such cases epa said the initial application of the pesticide does not require an npdes permit because epa does not consider it to be pollutant at the time of its discharge into water19 the agency also responded to some public comments on the proposal that d criticized the adequacy of the fifra registration process for cons ideration of water quality cal conditions etc epa said that the regulatory and nonregula tory tools

congressional interest in these issues became apparent after the first federal appeals court ruling in one of the key fifracwa cases the 2001 headwaters v talent ruling two congressional hearings held since then focused on implications of the cases for pesticide use generally and for local governments efforts to control mosquitoborne illnesses such as west nile virus hearing also was held on legislation introduced in the 109th congress to clarify the scope of the cwa regarding the use of fifraapproved pes ticides fire retardants and biological control organisms in october 2002 house transportati on and infrastructure subcommittee held factfinding hearing on the issues21 the subcommittees particular concern derived in part from the fact that one of the key practices used to manage stormwater runoff which is regulated under the cl ean water act is to collect and hold it in retention ponds basins drainage ditches etc such practices can be at odds with the public health objective of controlling insectbreeding habitat by eliminating or draining sources of standing water stormwater management practices typically allow collected water to drain slowly while public health efforts would prefer that it be removed quickly another way to address the public health concerns is to spray pesticides on stormwater management struct ures and other areas of standing waters the question for this subcommittee was the uncertainty raised by the litigation over the cwafifra issues for communities indus tries and others needing to maintain stormwater control systems an epa offi cial while acknowledging that the issue of cwa jurisdiction over pesticide spraying is new territory for the agency said that epa believes there is i nherent conflict between pr otecting water quality and

hearing held by house governme nt reform subcommittee in october 2004 examined challenges to controlling west nile virus22 the hearing was an opportunity for some members and witnesse s to express the view that epas july 2003 interim guidance while helpful in cl arifying epas position failed to resolve all legal uncertainty since it would not bind nonfederal entities or bar citizen lawsuits witnesses said that epas guidance is nonbinding legal document that would not deter filing of citizen lawsuits seeking to impose permit requirement supporters of this view urged epa to ttle the legal questions through formal rulemaking to revise cwa rules an epa official said that even if epa were to promulgate rule as it subsequently did states will still have the discretion to continue to require nonnpde s permits and formal rule would not preclude citizen lawsuits from seeking to force localities to file for permits epa made these same points in the january 2005 interpretive statem ent as noted above others at this hearing agreed on the need for formal rulemaking but recommended that in doing so epa should reverse the interpretation detailed in the guidance not codify it in the 108th congress senate appr opriators included langua ge in their report on epas fy2005 budget calling on epa to fina lize the interim guidance by december 2004 and to clarify the longstanding distin ction between agriculture and silviculture activities that do and do not require cwa permits23 in 2003 number of house and senate members urged the bush administration to support supreme court review of the forsgren case but ultimately the administration did not endorse industry s request for review and the court did not grant certiorari some members of congress also submitted comments in support of the july 2003 interim guidance doc ument and the january 2005 regulatory proposal24 options for epa and congress as described bove in november 2006 epa issued final rule consistent with its longstanding view amending cwa regulations to specify two circumstances in which pesticides applied to waters of the united states consistent with all releva nt requirements of fifra do not require npdes permits judicial challenges to the rule can be anticipated and would presumably address many issues previously addressed by the courts in litigation discussed in this report epa has additional administrative options as well beyond its actions to date in the final rule epa declined to address the issue of pesticid drift although many stakeholders had urged the agency to do so the federal register notice accompanying the rule noted that epa is awaiting advice from workgroup of itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32884crs15 25 for information see http wwwepagovpes ticidesppdcpesticide program dialogue committee which could recommend further actions this committee was established in 1995 as forum to provide feedback to epa on various pesticide regulatory policy and program implementation issues it is authorized pursuant to the federal advisory committee act faca which details requirements for the management and oversight of federal advisory committees to ensure impartial and relevant expertise nd advice to epa and other agencies in march 2006 the committee convened spra drift workgroup charged with studying the issue of pesticide drift across water and its accompanying impact on water quality and wildlife in april 2007 the workgroup finalized report that focused on issues related to product labeling applicator training and practices and equipment to mitigate drift and adverse effects25 other options for epa relate to impleme ntation of fifra and procedures used to evaluate the risks of pesticides during the registration process environmentalists have argued for some time that epas risk review procedures are inadequate because they fail to account for synergistic and add itive effects as well as sublethal and indirect effects of pollutants on the environment in 2003 epa convened task force of officials from its pesticide and water quality offices to explore among other things whether the agencys pesticide review processes are protective enough to meet water quality standard limits one outcome of the task forces review could be changes to implementation of fifra in or der to address some of these concerns congress has several opti ons too beginning with conducting further oversight of the issues another option could invol ve legislation to revise the cwa and or fifra and some have urged epa to ask c ongress to legislate resolution of these possible conflicts many nvironmental activists howev er would favor clarifying that permits are required since they believe that epas approach in the previous guidance and now in the final rule is unlawful alternatively congress could enact legislation to clarify that permits are not required for some or all pesticide spraying activity as favored by members of the pesticide application industr and others since many of these stakeholders believe that the earlier epa guidance and possi bly even the november 2006 rule do not provide adequate protection from citizen suits legislation intended to do so was introduced in the 109th congress hr 1749 and s 1269 the pest management and fire suppression flexibility act but it wa s not enacted these bills would have provided that npdes permits are not required for the use of fifraapproved pesticides chemicals fire retardants or water used fo r fire suppression biological organisms used for plant pest or weed control or silviculture activities such as timber harvesting that are not currently regulated as point source activities as discussed above epas fi nal rule addresses situa tions in which pesticides are put directly in waters to control pests eg controlling mosquito larvae or aquatic weeds or cases of pesticides that are pr esent over water and tion of the pesticide is deposited in the water eg aerial application to fo rest canopy

users state foresters western irrigation districts and farmers testified in support of the legislation saying that it would resolve existing legal uncertainties about permitting an epa w itness said that the agencys thenproposed rulemaking would reduce current uncertainty about the relationship between fifra and the cwa the legislation similarly would clarify the interaction between the two laws this witness said noting the other types of uses addressed in the legislation but not in the rulemaking such as spray drift the epa official di d not expressly endorse the legislation but he said that epa ppreciates congressional efforts to reduce potential confusion over these issues th ere was further action on either hr 1749 or s 1269 legislation that would re verse epas policy and affirm that cwa permits are required for pesticide applications that impact the nations waters was not introduced many environmental advocates believe that legislation is not needed because in their view the cwa is clear enough th at permits are required for discharge of pesticides from point sources what is need ed in their view is for epa to revise its interpretation of the laws in accordance w ith judicial rulings at the same time many who would favor gislation supporting narrow view of the cwas jurisdiction on this issue acknowledge th at any legislative effort would be controversial and coul d be seen as representing not clarification but rather an environmental rollback whether these i ssues will receive attention in the 110th congress is unclear
