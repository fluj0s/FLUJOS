representatives modern reform efforts introduction the house standing committee system began in 1789 with the creation of the committee on enrolled bills by 1810 the house had 10 standing committees by the time of the civil war the standing committee system was entrenched the house had 39 standing panels when woodrow wilson wrote his doctoral dissertation in 1885 he characterized congress as govern ment by the chairmen of the standing committees of congress1 in the years following many new sta nding committees were created although very few were abolished2 by 1913 there were 61 standing committees in the house in 1927 the house combined 11 expenditure committees into one committee on expenditures in the executive departments by the early 1940s there was extensive criticism of congress by scholars and members themselves in response congress created joint committee on the organization of congress thereby mark ing the beginning of numerous efforts to reorganize congress including the houses committee system3 since the 1946 effort congress created two more joint committees the house also created two select committees and two commissions to review its internal organization and operations the democr atic caucus and re publican conference have studied various aspects of house organization and the committee system the minority party alternatives offered to the majority party resolutions adopting the rules for new congress have containe d recommendations for congressional reorganizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31835crs2 4paul s rundquist the legislative

79th congress 1945 1946 creation membership and funding creation on february 19 1945 the house concurred in nate amendments to hconres 18 and established the joint committee on the organization of congress the joint committee was composed of 12 members six from each chamber equally divided by party the joint committee could take testimony and make recommendations concerning the st ructure of congress the panel was authorized for the 2 years of the 79th congress the resolution called on the joint committee to make full and complete study of the organization and operation of th congress and recommend improvements in such organization and operation with view toward strengthening the congress simplifying its operations improving its rela tionships with the other branches of the united states government and enabling it better to meet its responsibilities under the constitution members had been considering reorgani zation of congress for several years before the creation of the joint committee the joint committee was created in part in response to the new environment in which lawmakers found themselves during and after the presidency of franklin delano roosevelt much larger federal government involved in far more areas of national life as one scholar noted it was becoming apparent that the role of the federal government was irrevocably changedconsequently institutions such as the congress would be required to change to accommodate themselves to new domestic and international demands4 members also wanted to respond to public perception that congress had become too insular in 1942 for example there was public outcry when the house passed bill to bring members under the ci vil service retirement system letters poured into congressional offices criticiz ing members for voting their personal concerns in time of national emergency5 membership the committee was chaired by senator robert m lafollette jr progressive from wisconsin who caucuse d with the

those re sponsibilities transferred to the house administration committee unamerican activities formed by the existing merican activities committee the claims panel and the war claims panel we re abolished6 the committee also recommended that house members be limited to one major committee assignment jurisdiction and oversight the joint committee called on the house and senate to spell out the jurisdictions of each standing committee clearly and to incorporate the redrawn jurisdictions in the house and senate rules the definitions should enumerate the activities covered and describe their scope in terms of subject matter of legislation as well as the administrative organization of the federal government so that disputes over jurisdiction will be minimized or eliminated7 the joint committee recommended that each standing committee have authority to investigate the executive branch partments under their jurisdiction this authority would include the ability to issu subpoenas and to ope n investigations on their own this recommendation was in res ponse to the existing practice of creating special committee to investigate problems as they arose for example the house select committee to investigate acts of executive agencies which exceed their authority because the standing committees would now have the authority they needed to conduct oversight the committee recommended that there be ban on creation of any new special committees par ticularly those charged with conducting investigationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31835crs5 staffing the joint committee recommended that each standing committee have professional sta ff who were well paid and who would be available to members to help them make policy decisions each standing committee would be able to employ up to four

the third year the joint committee recommended that each member be allowed to hire well paid administrative assistant whose job it would be to free up the member from having to take care of much constituent service so that the member could focus more on legislation administrative assistan ts would handle most correspondence and requests for assistance from the public the joint committee recommended that this employee be paid up to 8000 year the joint committee also called for the creation of congressional secretarial pool to help overloaded offi ces with clerical work administrative proposals the committee made series of proposals designed to update congress in variety of ways the key recommendations were raising pay for members of c ongress to 15000 from 10000 and allowing members to join the federal retirement system and raising pay for top congressional staff such as the clerk of the house and the secretary of the senate by some 50 creating matching sets of party

that re presentatives of groups with an interest in legislation register and disclose their funding sources and the names of groups they represented creating legislative budget process that would

the 1946 act members eventually felt the law had not gone far enough complaints soon surfaced about some of its deficiencies omissions and outright failures new grievances about congressiona l conditions were added in the years that followed calls for reform were increasingly voiced not only in the press among students of the place and in congress itself but also among elements of the informed public wrote congressional sc holar walter kravitz11 during the 5 years it took for the reorganization effort to wend its way to enactment from 1965 to 1970 institutional tens ions between

appropriated funds congress moved to reassert its role with passage over the presidents veto of the 1973 war po wers resolution pl 93148 the budget fights led to passage of the 1974 cong ressional budget control and impoundment act pl 93344 which created the hous and senate budget committees and the congressional budget office and set up budget process for congress to follow separate from the executive branch the 1970 act was part of broad effort to by congress to assert its authority over the executive branch and to increase its access to information membership the original 1965 joint

compiling draft of bill the special subcommittee instructed its staff to hold series of briefings for members to explain the meas ure to them those briefings were held october 16 17 20 and 21 and we re attended by some 80 house members and staff through october november and december the special subcommittee held series of hearings on its draft bill at which 44 people testified and 44 more submitted their views for the record these hearings we re published in 453page volume in early 1970 the special subcommittee revised its dr aft and reported measure to the full house rules committee

measure president nixon signed the bill into law on october 26 1970 pl 91510 house committee system unlike the 1946 act the 1970 act focused more on rules governing committees not the committee structure itself one of the complaints heard most frequently from members was that committee chairs wielded too much power many of the changes in the process were designed to give greater voice to the minority members on committees and to make sure that chair could not always override the wishes of majority of the committee also the special subcommittee had recommended that the house clarify that the rules of the house apply to its committees and that committee rules apply to its subcommittees the recommendations of the 1965 joint committee formed the backbone of the house special committees work so while the specific legislation that led to the 1970 legislative reorganization act can be traced back to legislation coming out of the special committees work many of those recommendations particularly those dealing with the senate originated several years earlier with the joint committee to improve the functioning of committees the special subcommittee recommended that each committee dopt written ru which could not be inconsistent with house rules and select regular meeting day to conduct its business though additional meetings could be added at the discretion of the chair it recommended that majority of co mmittee could call special meeting without the assent of committee chair and the ranking majority member should preside over the committee in the absence of the chair majority of the minority party should be allowed to call witnesses during at leas t one day of hearingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31835crs10 dates and times of hearings should be announced at least one week in advance the subcommittee recommended unless the committee determined it could not meet this deadline in which case it was to be noticed as soon as possible in the daily digest of the congressional record the house rules committee was exempted the special subcommittee said that committee reports should be filed within seven days of request to do so by majority of the committee this recommendation was intended to get around ch air who when opposed to bill declined to report it to the full house despite the action of the committee this recommendation was matched by new policy to allow the speaker to recognize member of committee to call up bill on the floor if the rules committee had made it in order even if the member was not the chair of the committee the special subcommittee recommended that the minority should be given three days in which to file their opinions for committee report if they noticed their intent at the time of the committee markup reports must be available at least three calendar days before house consideration of bill and for appropriations bills printed committee hearings were also to be available at least three days in advance of the floor action the house rules co mmittee was exempted from many of these proposals to provide greater public scrutiny of congresss business the special subcommittee recommended that committee business meetings and hearings be open to the public unless majority vote of committee closed hearing on each motion to report the committee must record the votes for and against the motion and include the votes in its report the special subcommittee recommended that committees allow their hearings to be broadcast when authorized by majority vote of committee this recommendation included radio televisi on and still photography while committees were to determine the rules governing such broadcasts the special subcommittee recommended that at minimum committee rules require that broadcast be uninterrupted and not comme rcially sponsored subpoen aed witness be depicted without his or her permi ssion cameras be limited to four fixed locations and broadcasting not interfere with conduct of hearing the special subcommittee also recommended some administrative changes in the way committees functioned it recommended that proxy voting be barred in committees unless the committees rules permitted it in which case proxy must be in writing designate who was to cast it and be limited to specific measure or amendments to measure the special subcommittee recommended that committees be allowed to meet when the house wa s in session unless the house was debating bill under the fiveminute rule even then five specific committees rules appropriations government op erations internal security and standards of official conduct could meet it also recommended that witnesses be required to provide their written statements in advance of their testimony when it would be possible to do so and it called on committees to provide an annual report of their activities of the previous year except for the appropr iations rules house administration and standards of official conduct committeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31835crs11 the special subcommittee recommended funding process for all committees each committee was to file single annual funding request for itself which had to be available to members for at least one day before the chamber acted on it if the committee exceeded its approved spending it w ould have to come back to the house with an explanation of why it needed additional funding staff the special subcommittee made series of recommendations to allow more information to flow to members bout legislation it recommended an increase in the number of professional staff aut horized for each committee to six from four and authorized committees to hire consultants subject to the approval of the house administration committee the special subcommittee recommended that majority of committees minority members could hire two of the six professional employees and one of the six clerical positions subject to approval of majority vote of committee any staff member could be fired by majority vote of the committee the committees on standards of official conduct and ppropriations were exempt from many of these proposed rules the special subcommittee recommended that each house member be authorized to hire an administrative assistant at pay not to exceed 8955 per year this recommendation was designed to match the structure in the senate which already authorized top office staff member budget matters the special subcommittee recommended that the appropriations committees in both chambers hold hearing within 30 days of submission on the entire budget proposed by the president the special subcommittee called on the treasury department and the office of management and budget to come up with uniform fiscal measurements for programs and to supply committees upon request detaile d program information on government agencies the special subcommittee envisioned bigger role for the comptroller general the head of the general accounting office that office was to provide analysis of existing programs and provide to committees staff expert in doing costbenefit analysis the special subcommittee also called on the president to provide 5 years worth of detailed program information for each program the current fiscal year and four succeeding ones it also recommended that each house report be required to include cost estimate for the bill it accompanied administrative proposals the special subcommittee recommended creation of joint committee on data processing to help coordinate the acquisition and use of computers and technology the committee was to consist of 12 members six from each chamber equally divided be tween the majority and minority parties the special subcommittee also recommended that the legislative reference

congressional research to make clear that this pa nel was to oversee the operations of crs the special subcommittee recommended the abolition of the joint committee on immigration and nationality policy the special subcommittee recommended that in the house the reading of the journal12 be dispensed with and that vote on the journal be nondebatable this recommendation came in response to the use of the reading of the journal and votes on its approval as dilatory tactics by the minority the special subcommittee recommended codifying the practice that conference agreements be prepared jointly by conferees of the two houses and that time for debate on conference report be divided equally between the majority and minority the special subcommittee recommended that when house members raised points of order against bill because it included nongermane amendments the house debate the motion for 40 minutes and that twothirds vote be required to permit the amendments to stand the house parliamentarian the sp ecial subcommittee recommended should prepare and have printed new compilations of house precedents every 5 years condensed and uptodate version should be printed at the beginning of each congress the special subcommittee recommended the creation of the capitol guide service to provide free organized tours of the capitol for the public senate provisions the senate agreed to make it easier for majority of committee members to call meeting it so adopted series of changes designed to give more power to members not chairs of committees those included requirement that committee reports be filed within seven days of committee action that committees minority party be allowed to call witnesses during at least one day of hearings and that members have three days

conferen ce reports that conferees of both chambers jointly prepare an explanatory statement to accompany conference report and that debate time on conference report be equally divided between the

make recommendations about improve ments the committee was also to oversee the new office of placement and office of management which were created to assist members in finding staff and pr ovide help

sense of zeal congressional quarterly weekly jan 24 1998 pp 160161these reforms were generally advocat ed by more junior reformminded members of both parties w ho were influenced by the changes underway in society as whole during this period and soug ht to have the house reflect these developments the broad changes in american society included the civil rights movement growing opposition to american military involvement in southeast asia and the widespread questioning of author ity engendered by the watergate scandal that caused president richard m nixon to resign under threat of congressional impeachment junior democratic members joined forces with other reformers in congress to push for institutional reforms in house they viewed as largely dominated by senior and conservative southern members w ho often sided with republicans some members may have c oncluded that the organization and membership of congress had not kept pace with societal changes as one member noted of new members we were the children of vietnam not world war ii we were products of television not of print we were produc ts of computer politics not courthouse politics and we were reflections of jfk as president not fdr13 among the key impacts of the democra tic caucus and republican conference reforms were decrease in the power of committee chairs weakening of the seniority system and strengthening of the hand of house leadership over scheduling and committee assignments the reforms also gave junior members additional mechanisms to influence the workings of the chamber including procedures to bypass closed rules on ma jor legislation sepa rate votes on committee chairs giving role for members in tablishing subcommittee jurisdiction as well as place on the panel making standing committee assignments 1971democratic caucus many reformminded members of the house expressed the view that the 1970 legisla tive reorganization act did not go far enough and that additional reforms needed to be made toward that end the democratic study group an organization of progressive democr ats was successful in convincing the democr atic caucus to create special caucus com mittee the committee on organization study and review osr to examine proposals for reform on january 20 1971 the democratic caucus adopted the first set of proposals put forth by the osr under this plan the democratic committee on committees made up of the democratic members of the house ways and means committee would recommend nominees for the chairmanship and mbership of each committee these nominations were longer requi red to be based on seniority httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31835crs15 the committee on committees would recommend committee chairmanships separately rather than as slate at the request of 10 caucus members nomination for chair could be separately deba ted and voted upon democratic house members would be limited to one subcommittee chairmanship and each subc ommittee chair would be entitled to hire one staff aide in addition the chair of co mmittee could not simultaneously serve as chair of more than one subcommittee of that co mmittee these changes opened approximately 40 subcommittee chairmanships to junior members not all attempts at change made by junior members were successful an effort to unseat the chair of the house district of columbia committee and replace him with more junior committee member was rejected another effort to seat the outgoing chair of the democratic st udy group on the ways and means committee failed finally even after reforms were adopted by the demo cratic caucus two committee chairs were able to implement procedural changes on their individual panels which lessened the effect of the new rules 1971republican conference on january 20 house republicans agreed to allow all of their members to vote on nominations for ranking minority members on committees in doing so the republican conference approved the recommendations of republican task for ce on seniority chaired by rep barber b conable jr rny the recommendations eliminated the requirement that ranking membership on committees be in effect automatically based on seniority under these new procedures the republican committee on committees made up of one representative from each state th at had republican members in the house would nominate member to be ranking on each committee the conference would then vote separately and by secret ballot on each nomination if the nomination was rejected the committee on committees would nominate another member the members also agreed that when republicans won majority in the house the same procedures would apply toward the selection of committee chairs 1973democratic caucus in 1973 some members in the democratic study group as well as outside lobbying groups such as common cause and americans for democratic action waged near ly 2month effort to institute further reforms in the house democr atic caucus on february 21 the democratic caucus adopted series of procedural changes including changes to require that all house committee hearings be open unless they dealt with matters of national secur ity or could injure pe rsonal reputations markups could only be closed by majority vote at the beginning of committee session the house later adopted these provisions in slightly modified version as amendments to the house rules adopt change that would allow 50 members to secure caucus vote on directing the house rules committee to make an amendment in order on the house floor this change was intended to halt the practice of committee chairs bringing major legislation to the floor without an opportunity for floor amendmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31835crs16 permit secretballot vote on the nomination of any committee chair at the demand of 20 of the caucus strip the chair of the ways and means committee of the role of chair of thecommittee on committees and replacing that person with the speaker the house majority leader and caucus ch air were added to the panel and create new committee the democratic steering and policy committee to promote party policy and unity member ship would include the caucus chair four deputy whips three members appoi nted by the speaker and 12 members elected by vote of the democratic caucus finally the caucus approved socalled subcommittee bill of rights that authorized each subcommittee to meet hold hearings and act it empowered the caucus of democrats on each committee to tablish subcommittee jurisdictions set party ratios on subcommittees and c hoose subcommittee members and chairs guaranteeing all democratic members of committee major subcommittee assignment subcommittees were guaran teed independent budgets and committee chairs were required to re fer measures to subcommittees in accordance with the committees written jurisdictions 1974 and 1975 democratic caucus additional changes to assignment procedures and seniority we re made in meetings in december 1974 and january 1975 in the house democratic caucus these changes were supported by reformers in congress with the assistance of large class of democratic freshman who were elected to the 94th congress the authority to make democratic committee assignments was transferred from the house committee on committees which consisted of the democratic members of the house ways and means committee to the steering and policy committee democrats required automatic secretballot votes on committee chairs and allowed for additional nominations for committee chair if the first nominee was rejected within two weeks of making these procedural changes regarding the selection of committee chairs house democrats through series of votes in the democratic steering committee and in the democratic caucus ended in practice the strict operation of the seniority system by removing three standing committee chairs additional changes were made in the december and january meetings of the caucus including requiring nominati ons for the chairs of appropriations subcommittees to be approved by the caucus the speaker was allowed to nominate all democratic members of the rules committee the caucus recommended changing house rules to require open conference committee meetings the house also renamed three standing committees made the select committee on small business standing committee and abolished the controversial house internal security committee which had been previously named the house unamerican activities committee
