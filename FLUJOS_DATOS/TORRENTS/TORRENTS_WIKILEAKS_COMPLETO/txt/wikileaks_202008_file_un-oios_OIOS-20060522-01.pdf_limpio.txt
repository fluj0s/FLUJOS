and methodology 10 the audit focussed on activities in th period january 2003 to december 2005 and involved interviewing staff and reviewing available documents iv audit findings and recommendations governance suf consultative board 11 oios was pleased to note the establishment of consultative board to advise the governing council via the executive director on suf activities and the presence of documentation setting out the membership and operation of the board oios was concerned that this documentation did not address criteria for membership and how the costs of the consultative board would be met furthermore the relationship between the consultative board with other parts of unhabitat and its role were also not clear unhabitat commented that the suf operation manual s ee annex four i the suf project submission to dfid and sida ii and the suf proposal submitted to cities alliance by dfid sida and unhabitat iii make clear reference to the criteria of membership and the role of the board in addition the suf annual implementation and budget for 20062008 approved by the donors makes explicit reference to how the costs of the consultative board will be met oios thanks unhabitat for the clarifica tion and whilst not raising any recommendation on this issue suggests that unhabitat consider consolidating all matters pertaining to the operation of the suf consultative board in one document 12 unhabitat has policy at the organisational level dealing with the establishment 3and operation of consultative boards such policy is required to assist divisions of habitat in identifying where such bodies might be useful and how they should be set up and operated recommendations to ensure that consultative boards are only created when required and to assist unhabitat divisions in establishing and operating consultative boards in uniform manner unhab itat should create policies and procedures dealing with wh consultative board is required formulating the goals and objectives

with the unhabitat and suf mandates b mission 16 unhabitat advised oios that it is not requirement to develop mission statements for projects oios is of the opinion that there may be value in developing mission statements for projects such as suf to facilitate in communicating the intentions priorities and values of the project to internal and external parties the mission statement also serves as building block in formulating the overall strategy of suf unhabitat commented that although multiple mission statements may dilute the overall mission statement of the united nations human settlements programme setting into motion process whereby every entity within unhabitat has mission statement there may be added value in developing 4policy and procedures on project mission statements to improve the communication and understanding of large scale projects recommendation to facilitate communication and better understanding of large scale projects such as the unhabitat slum upgrading facility unhabitat should consider developing policy and procedures on project mission statements rec 03 17 unhabitat commented that it accepted th recommendation and will implement it by

kingdom of great britain and northern ireland acting through the department for international development dfid and swedish international development cooperation agency sida for the design and pilot

resource to assist projects in resolving administrative and substantive queries cons equently suf staff could not demonstrate that they were fully aware of and that they could make effective use of guidance that was available oios had to seek the assi stance of psd to answer many of the issues raised in the course of the audit recommendation to strengthen existing arrangements for oversight of new projects habitat should strengthen the functi ons of programme support division psd for project oversight which might include review of the resources psd would need to advise new proj ects in
