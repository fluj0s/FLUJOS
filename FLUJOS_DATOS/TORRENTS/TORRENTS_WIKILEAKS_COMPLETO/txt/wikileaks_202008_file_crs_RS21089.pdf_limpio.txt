not public information given their sensitive contingent status this report reviews the public record concerni ng federal continuity of government arrangements it will be updated to reflect significant developments as condition of office the president swears or affirms pledge to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states which also requires members of the senate the house of representa tives and the individual state legislatures as well as all executive and judicial officers of the united st ates and the several states to support this constitution1 arguably such provisions constitute basis for these principal government officials in their separate capacities to contribute to policy and planning for the continued functioning of constitutional government unde r all circumstances during the latter half of the 20th century such preparations were conducted earnestly and elaboratively particularly with the onset of the cold war and the increasing prospect of nuclear attack upon the nation arrangements for the continued opera tion of the federal government in the event of national emergency are specified in law policy and plans some of which are not public information given their sensitive contingent status background while the constitution prescribed some rrangements concerning succession to the presidency and the replacement of elected and appointed offi cials widespread concern about the continued functioning of constit utional government under all circumstances probably did not arise prior to the assassina tion of president abraham lincoln on april 14 1865 the assassination of the president was not totally unthinkable an attempt had been made on the life of president andr ew jackson in the capitol rotunda on january 30 1835 but it was generally regarded as high ly unlikely however in the aftermathhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21089crs2 2 1 stat 239 3 24 stat 1 4 doris kearns goodwin ordinary time franklin and eanor roosevelt the home

wounding of former president theodore roosevelt in 1912 presidential prot ection by the us secret service began informally and without statutory sanction in 1894 in 1792 congress had provided in accordan ce with constitutional prescription for succession to the presidency when both the ffice of the president and the vice president were vacant by first the president pro tempore of the senate or next the speaker of the house of representatives in this constitutionally suspect arrangement these legislative branch officials were to serve in an acting capacity holding office only until new president could be chosen2 congress returned to the matter in 1886 establishing line of succession relying upon the cabinet following the order of the establishment of the departments any cabinet official coming to the presidency via this arrangement would have to possess the constitutional qualifications to hold the office and would temporarily act as president by virtue of his cabinet position which he would retain thus becoming member of his own presidential cabinet3 during the civil war secretary of state william seward and secretary of war edwin stanton created counteres pionage organizations but th were directed against spies and saboteurs rather than potential assassins of public officials similarly during world war i the departments of justice the navy the post office and

not appear to have been ma jor concern submarine warfare and aerial bombardment while effective new techniques in warfare utilized limited technologies posing major threat to the defense of the domestic territory of the united states or constitutional government the december 7 1941 attack on pearl harbor by japanese naval aircraft and the american april 18 1942 retaliatory bombing of tokyo by aircraft under the command of colonel james h doolittle demonstrated that at least carrierassisted bombers could reach the continental united states emy longrange aircraft capabilities were indeterminate during the early months of the war the week after pearl harbor the secret rvice presented the president with long report of recommended changes to improve white house security it proposed covering the skylights with sand and tin camouflaging the house painting the colonnade windows black setting up machinegun emplacements on the roof and building an air raid shelter in subbasement area of the new east wing the president rejected most of the suggestions with not little annoyance though he finally agreed to the construction of tem porary shelter in the treasury

adequacy of constitutional arrangements concerning the continuity of congress in the event that many or most of its members were lost as result of similar such terrorist action literal reading of the constitution he wrote would cast doubt on whether congress could even convene under those circumst ances however noting that since the civil war era both houses of congress had defined working quorum not as majority of the overall membership of th house and the senate but as majority of those duly chosen sworn and living ornstein thought the situation might be complicated and made more problematic if there were substantia l number of members alive but incapacitated moreover he commented even if these difficulties were overcome for congress to operate under thos circumstances for long passing sweeping antiterrorist laws emergency appropriati ons and economic recovery measures would tax itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21089crs6 17 norman ornstein what if congress were obliterated good question
