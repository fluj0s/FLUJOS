bay137w31fa4844890d8ced7113d1c2f30phxgbl comrade herring thanks for your reply i plan on joining im going to get my passport photos when i get paid and along with my 20 sign up fee and my 10 for first months dues i will send in my application i got that right dont i times have been rough for and im trying to get back on track my hours were cut back at my job as an auto mechanic because i wasnt bilingual and the owner wanted to reel in some of the latin business my car broke and i couldnt afford the parts to fix it i got second job in sandwich shop and still i couldnt make rent so before i got evicted and when it was painfully obvious i wasnt getting my hours back i cut my losses and went commercial fishing with my cousin but after month we fell out in port in fort bragg and broke he left there i made friend in the dock an old salty dog from sf who saw my frustration and rage and tought how to breathe he spoke of the brotherhood and how man is an island and sometimes we all need help and must have the courage to accept that help he fed gave water and place to stay for the night i did some work on his boat the next day and he gave money and i went on my way my only cost is to do the same for another in my position and thats the way its supposed to work i made my way to sf and got bus up to oregon where my father said he needed ranch hand my family is separated and scattered by the way he had some health and legal issues and the ranch wasnt working out enough to make profit so i got job at lumber mill pulling green chain to make ends meet it was one of the best times of my life up there the ranch was 40 acres on mountain my ford 4x4 my 45 pistol and my german shepard einstein my father and uncle but my father said that he had to leave and i didnt want to be up there alone so we sold out and all came back he got trailer and i gave him my dog because i couldnt bring him to my sisters house back in california good times thats part of my story hope you enjoy it but on another note in my last email to commander schoep i inquired about real military training in the sence of boot camp weopons and tactics and survival having an instructor who has been in battle would be more beneficial to than book im sure you understand any suggestions i realize the commander is probably very busy so i dont want to bother him while he is making preparations for the march which im sure is why he forwarded this message to you plus it seems you are in charge of staffing so what can you tell that might help and again i had enough when i was 6 years old running home from my innercity school in glen park san fransico to get to my grandmothers housewhere we lived trying to avoid beat downs i recieved quite often as being white minority in city school the teachers would turn blind eye and told my father i might be safer if we moved understand my whole family was from this neigborhood right after my greatgrandparents came across the sea from scotland and germany my grandmother met my grandfather at this school my aunts and uncles and my father went to this school my father and mother met in college as they grew up across town from one another back in the days when citys were still white dwellings and neigborhoods and community meant something funny it was also cleaner place before all this racial integration of sf schools was even looked at in serious manner wed still be there but i was headed down terrible path if we had stayed so would have my siblings so we moved to the country which was great ive never seen it before just in the summer my father had good union job electrician so he was great provider until he got hurt anyway maybe ill write it all down one day sorry about the novel i go on tangents sometimes hope to here back from you soon sincerly your fellow american and white brother john lindt ps i wanted to go to the march in dc but i just cant afford plane ticket or accomadations right now im sorry to miss this historic and truly remarkable event resilience and strenght to all who gowilliam herring nsmfargohotmailcom wrote comrade your words were true it is infinitely pleasing to hear from an awakened white man most of the white cattle who live in this fucked up country seldom take the time to take good look at the world around them and prefer instead to stuff doritos down their throats and watch reality tvyou have taken the first steps towards change we feel exactly as you do and we are working to address these issues every year we march through americas largest and most violent cities spreading the message of white unity and change in our government perhaps you have finally had enough and wish to join us united our victory is not possibility it is certainty let know sincerely nsm staff corps use video
