resolutions that funded the office at fy2002 levels the omnibus budg et act pl 108 7 provided the uspto with the budget authority to spend 11826 million for fy2003 of this amount 10152 million is to be derived from ffsetting collections and 1668 million is from fees collected in previous years the budget authority is 5 more than the previous fiscal year but is less than the 1527 million expected to be collected in patent and trademark fees in fy2003 the administrations fy2004 budget would provide the uspto with the authority to spend 1203 million from fees collect ed in that fiscal year in addition the administration is proposing legislation to change the statutory fee structure to raise an additional 201 million to be spent by the office the expected 1404 million in budget authority is 100 million less than the anticipated 1504 million fee collection for fy2004 since 1990 appropriation measures have limited the patent and trademark offices use of the full amount of fees collect ed in each fiscal year this is an area of controversy opponents argue that since agency operations are supported by payments for services the total amount of these collections should be available to provide for those services in the year th expenses are incurred proponents of the current approach maintain that the fees are necessary to balance the budget and that the level of fees appropriated

increase the hourly panel attorney rate from 90 to 113 effective april 1 2003 in its fy2003 budget submission to congress the judiciary termed the reque sted 171 million increase as an adjustment to base rate adjustment rather than program increase the judiciary explained that under the criminal justice act as revised in 1986 the judicial conference is authorized to make annual adjustments to the panel attorn ey hourly pay rate accordingly funding to increase the hourly rate to 113 the judiciary said would ensure that it would not be f urther eroded by inflation conferees for the fy2003

came on the heels of the 2001 yearend report on the federal judiciary of chief justice william h rehnquist who maintained that more than costof living adjustment was needed in the way of judicial salary increase the chief justice cited the relatively low pay that federal j udges receive compared to the amount that successful experienced practicing lawyer can ma ke this he said along with the
