decisions of the 1990s which had all gone against plaintiffs in the wake of laidlaw environmental citizen suits will be easier to bring this report will not be updated during the 1990s supreme court decisions heightened the standing hurdle for plaintiffs alleging environmental injury in federal courts these rulings called into question the viability of many citizen suits under federal environmental statutes on january 12 2000 however the court appeared to shift course in friends of the earth v laidlaw environmental services 1 liberalizing certain elements of standing doctrine this report reviews the supreme courts treatment of the standing issue prior to laidlaw describes the laidlaw litigation and speculates as to the decisions implications for environmental citizen suits by way of background standing doctrine is concerned with who is proper party to raise particular issue in the federal courts the doctrine demands plaintiff who has such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends 2 some precepts of standing are viewed as merely prudential that is developed by the courts as part of their inherent power of judicial selfmanagement our target here is those aspects of standing mandated by article iii of the constitution that is its confinement of the jurisdiction of courts created under that article to cases andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20497crs2 3 405 us 727 1972 4 section of the apa requires that those seeking review under that statute have suffered legal wrong or be adversely affected or aggrieved by the challenged agency action 5 usc 702 5 to be sure the court denied the sierra club standing because the club had failed to allege that it or its members were among the injured this deficiency was easily remedied by the clubs amending its complaint to allege recreational harm to those of its members who visited the affected area 6 412 us 669 1973 7 antonin scalia the doctrine of standing as an essential element of the separation of powers 17 suffolk l rev 881 1983controversies this restriction in the supreme courts eyes means that plaintiff in an article iii court such as federal district court must show that 1 heshe has suffered an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized not common to the entire public and actual or imminent 2 the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and 3 it is likely that the injury will be redressed by favorable decision like all suits in federal district court citizen suits must at minimum meet these constitutionally mandated prerequisites environmental standing prior to laidlaw the environmentalstanding case law prior to laidlaw divides into two historical phases in the first standing was easily obtained in sierra club v morton 3 the supreme court in 1972 made clear that injury to aesthetic and environmental wellbeing may constitute injury in fact for purposes of establishing standing to seek judicial review under the administrative procedure act apa4 moreover the fact that the injury was shared by the many did not make it less deserving5 the following year in what is generally regarded as the apogee of relaxed standing law the court in united states v scrap6 found apa standing based on an attenuated argument by group seeking to compel the icc to suspend proposed freight rate increase the group argued that the rate increase would raise the price of recyclable materials which would discourage their use which would result in increased use of nonrecyclable materials which would lead to adverse environmental impacts eg increased litter on the forests and streams in the dc area that group members used for recreation following sierra club and scrap the standing hurdle remained an easily surmounted one in environmental cases for almost two decades in 1983 however then judge antonin scalia argued in law review article that federal courts were conferring standing too liberally7 for one thing he said courts need to accord greater weight to the traditional requirement that plaintiffs alleged injury be particularized one which sets him or her apart from the public at large for another he asserted that courts should be less intrusive into executive branch affairs particularly when the plaintiff seeks to vindicate majoritarian interests the law of standing in judge scalias view should restrict courtshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20497crs3 8 also underlying justice scalias narrow view of standing is his dissent in morrison v olson 487 us 654 697 1988 there he opined that the constitution permits only the executive branch to enforce public law 9 497 us 871 1990 10 504 us 555 1992 11 523 us 83 1998 12 cwa 505a 33 usc 1365ato protecting the minority against the majority important here he seemed to place many environmental suits in the undesirable vindicationofthemajority category8 when judge scalia ascended to the supreme court in 1986 this article assumed some significance and indeed nowjustice scalia authored the majority opinions in each of the supreme courts environmental standing decisions in the 1990s not surprisingly these opinions reflect his law review article and define the second phase of the courts environmental standing jurisprudence all three decisions in this second phase found the environmental plaintiff to lack standing in lujan v natio nal wildlife federation 9 the court held 54 that where individual plaintiffs averred only that they recreated on unspecified portions of public land there was insufficient geographic specificity to say they were adversely affected under the apa by bureau of land management action affecting particular tracts similarly in lujan v defenders of wildlife 10 the court held 72 that allegations by the environmental groups members that they intended some day to visit an area where endangered species might be harmed by the challenged federal action lacked the temporal specificity needed to meet the injury in fact prong of article iii standing finally in steel co v citizens for better environm ent11 the court ruled 63 that where the defendant came into compliance during the 60day notice period before the citizen suit could be filed the plaintiffs failed the redressability component of article iii standing for example the civil penalties sought by the suit were payable to the us treasury not the plaintiffs and so could not redress any lingering injury plaintiffs may suffer from the former violation the stage was now set for laidlaw the laidlaw litigation laidlaw operated hazardous waste incinerator that discharged wastewater into the tyger river in south carolina in 1992 friends of the earth foe brought clean water act cwa citizen suit against laidlaw12 alleging that the incinerator had committed hundreds of violations of its effluent permit foe submitted the affidavits of several of its members alleging that they were injured by the violations in that they used the river downstream of laidlaws point of discharge and had curtailed their use because of concerns about the effect of the violations on human health and fishhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20497crs4 13 956 f supp 588 600601 dsc 1997 there is some overlap in the monitoring and reporting violations and significant number of them involve only technical errors in the forms used to report compliance 14 149 f3d 303 4th cir 1998 an earlier crs report addresses this fourth circuit ruling robert meltz the future of the citizen suit after steel co and laidlaw crs report rs20012 jan 5 1999 15 120 s ct at 706in 1997 the district court found that laidlaw had violated the mercury limits in its permit 489 times the monitoring requirements 420 times and the reporting requirements 503 times13 some of these violations occurred after the citizen suit was filed the district court denied injunctive relief since there was substantial compliance by the time the court issued its order but ordered laidlaw to pay 405800 in civil penalties the fourth circuit vacated14 in its view the case became moot once the defendant fully complied with its permit and foe declined to appeal the district courts denial of injunctive relief foe was only seeking higher civil penalty than the district court imposed and under steel co civil penalties do not meet redressability requirements since they are not payable to the plaintiff nor could plaintiffs recover their attorneys fees since the cwa citizen suit provision limited such recovery to instances where the plaintiff prevailed on january 12 2000 the supreme court reversed writing for 7justice majority justice ginsburg held that the fourth circuit erred in concluding that citizen suit claim for civil penalties must be dismissed as moot when the defendant after filing of the suit comes into compliance the majority opinion first resolves the article iii standing question as for injury in fact it ruled that the relevant showing is injury to the plaintiff not injury to the environment thus it was sufficient that foe members lived downstream from the point of discharge and were concerned enough by the defendants discharges that they curtailed their use of the river as for redressability the court declared that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect indeed congress had said so in the specific context of cwa enactment and this congressional determination warrants judicial attention and respect15 steel co does not dictate otherwise said the court since that decision denied standing for citizen suitors seeking civil penalties for violations that had abated by the time of suit it did not reach the issue here standing to seek penalties for violations ongoing at such time thus plaintiffs had standing turning to the mootness issue again raised by the defendants coming into compliance during the district courts deliberations the court charged the fourth circuit with confusing standing and mootness the confusion was understandable the court conceded given its past characterization of mootness as standing set in time frame in laidlaw the court backed away from that description it noted for example that the prospect of future noncompliance may be too speculative to support standing but not too speculative to overcome mootness then too the underlying purpose of the two doctrines counsels greater hesitancy in dismissing case on mootness as opposed to absence of standing grounds standing doctrine acts to ensure that the scarce resources of the federal courts are devoted to disputes in which the parties have concrete interesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20497crs5 in contrast by the time mootness is an issue the case may have been in the courts for years making abandonment without compelling reason wasteful practice that the facility in question had since been closed however gave the majority pause the closure might indeed moot the case if this event made it absolutely clear that laidlaws permit violations could not reasonably be expected to recur this factual issue not explored by the district court was found to be open for consideration on remand finally the court declined to resolve the important attorneys fees issue foe argued that it is entitled to attorneys fees on the theory that it was the prevailing party under the cwa citizen suit provision because it was the catalyst that brought about laidlaws compliance suggesting that the catalyst theory is viable in general the court nonetheless refused to address its validity in this case that determination it concluded was initially for the district court in concurrence justice stevens found an absence of precedent for the proposition that postcomplaint compliance that moots claim for injunctive relief also moots one for monetar relief justice kennedy also concurring asked whether allowing private litigants to seek public fines gibed with the article ii enforcement responsibilities committed to the executive branch dissenting justice scalia joined by justice thomas agreed with the majority that injury in fact relates to harm to the plaintiff rather than to the environme nt here however the district court had found harm to the environment in scalias view precluding finding that plaintiff had been harmed moreover the majority in his view had accepted hopelessly vague claims of injury as to redressability scalia felt that the indirect private consequences of the civil penalty being sought its alleged deterrent effect failed to satisfy article iii particularly here where they were so speculative and like justice kennedy justice scalia raised but did not answer the article ii question can we turn over to private citizens the function of enforcing the law implications for environmental citizen suits the laidlaw decision is universally seen as significant win for the plaintiff side of the environmental citizen suit likely to make such suits much easier to bring moreover it now appears that only minority of the justices are sympathetic to justice scalias view that the constitution prohibits private party from enforcing public law some specific implications of the laidlaw decision are 1 it will be easier for plaintiffs to demonstrate the injury in fact component of standing the laidlaw majority asserts that where the injury to plaintiff results from reasonable concern there is little need for plaintiff to demonstrate injury to the environment as predicate this will alter the current situation where plaintiffs attorneys were expending substantial effort lab analysis of water samples ecological testing witness depositions just to get past this threshold issue in the case laidlaw has already borne fruit one month after the decision the banc fourth circuit reversed the panel decision in friends of the earth v gaston copper recyclinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20497crs6 16 2000 westlaw 204559 4th cir feb 23 2000 banc 17 123 f3d 111 3rd cir 1997corp denying standing to bring cwa citizen suit16 the banc court noted that on the facts presented denying standing encroaches on congressional authority by erecting barriers to standing so high as to frustrate citizen enforcement of the clean water act the citizen suit provision at issue it observed uses language that cannot be reconciled with the strict standard of injury used by the decisions below to gaston coppers defense that plaintiff had not adequately proved environmental degradation to show injury in fact for article iii purposes the court held up laidlaw s focus on injury to the plaintiff plaintiffs reasonable fear and concern about the effects of gaston coppers discharge supported by objective evidence constitutes injury in fact laidlaw also calls into question the nostanding holding in public interest research group of new jersey inc v magnesium elektron inc17 yet another cwa citizen suit there the third circuit correctly noted that the mere knowledge that company has polluted is insufficient to confer standing since this is generalized grievance shared by the public at large in conflict with the future laidlaw decision however the court went on to conclude that standing requires showing of actual tangible injury to the environment this aspect of the magnesium elektron decision longer appears to be good law 2 it will be easier for plaintiffs seeking civil penalties to satisfy the redressability component of standing even though the penalties are not payable to the plaintiff the courts statement that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect is powerful one for citizen suitors there are currently several citizen suit provisions that allow claims for money penalties payable to the us treasury note also because the court seems inclined to defer to congressional findings it may be useful in the future to accompany new citizen suit provisions authorizing civil penalties with assertions of deterrent effect 3 the majority retained the traditional view that makes it hard for defendant to obtain dismissal based on mootness once plaintiff has established standing 4 on remand the resolution of the attorneys fees issue in laidlaw will be important since many citizen suit law firms are funded largely through recovery of attorneys fees from defendants the supreme courts endorsement of the catalyst theory suggests that the district court may be positively disposed to awarding fees in this case 5 two facts suggest that laidlaw s reversal of the 1990s trend toward higher standing hurdles may be more than temporary first the court did not have to decide the standing question at all in the case mootness was the principal issue presented and the petitioners briefs were focused there that justice ginsburg reached out to resolve the standing issue when it was unnecessary to do so points to desire on the part of at least some justices to move the pendulum back to some extent second it may be significant that the majority opinion commanded fully 7 votes including some justices normally on the nostanding side of the courts decisions
