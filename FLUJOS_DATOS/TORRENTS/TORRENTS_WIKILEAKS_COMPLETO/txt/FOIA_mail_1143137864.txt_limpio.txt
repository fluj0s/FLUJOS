martin manning mmanningalnoaagov subject re super urgent ipcc help needed cc ssolomonalnoaagov averytucaredu dear jonathan thanks for trying to sort this out quickly for us and for the information that the ammann et paper is not available susan and i have discussed your two options and have to say that we can not agree to option 1 in the circumstances although the jones and mann 2004 paper shows the ncar simulation the key point is that it cites it as c ammann et private communication 2003 so in effect option 1 would be bringing in material that was not peer reviewed and not even separately documented anyone wanting to discredit your chapter would highlight the fact that you appear to be depending on work done in 2003 that had still not been peerreviewed option 2 is the only way to meet the standard that we have set all along of basing the assessment very firmly on peer reviewed literature kristen averyt found that she could edit the eps files that you had sent us earlier for fig 613 and take out the curves in question labelled ajs2006 the result is attached if you can confirm that this edited figure looks correct we are now proposing to drop that into your chapter in place of the original one we would also remove the s4 row in table 62 referring to this study we would also of course use the edited version of the figure in the ts fig ts26 in current draft if you can see any other implications of this approach to resolving the problem that we need to be aware of please let know if the author team wants to provide redrawn figure that might be an improvement on the attached version we can still wait until monday morning for that best regards martin at 0425 pm 3222006 jonathan overpeck wrote hi keith and tim need fast help figure 613 and table 62 cite amman et for the csm curve since this paper doesnt yet exist in in press form i checked w bette who is coauthor we have two choices i think choice one below could be ok but want to have confirmation from keith or tim and it its not ok note tim and keith need to get new fig and table to melinda and martin at the tsu by monday option 1 we can cite jones pd and mann 2004 climate over past millennia reviews of geophysics 422 this paper already in references there is hope has the csm simulation in its fig 8 but of course its not the idea original reference describing the simulation option 2 we tim creates new fig 613 and table 62 without any reference to this simulation please note if keith and tim or martin feels we must go w option 2 tim has to send the new fig and table to tsu melinda marguis and martin by monday am at the absolute latest thanks for your quick help peck jonathan t overpeck director institute for the study of planet earth professor department of geosciences
