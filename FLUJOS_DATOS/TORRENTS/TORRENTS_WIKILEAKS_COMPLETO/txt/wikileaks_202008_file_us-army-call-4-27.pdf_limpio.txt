leading procedures 11 general convoys conducted on the modern asymmetrical battlefield are combat operations while their purpose may be to deliver people or supplies from one point to another the convoy planner must assume that his convoy will encounter enemy attempts to disrupt movement or inflict damage and casualties every unit executing convoys in iraq has learned and emphasizes the importance of maintaining combat posture from start point sp to release point rp every soldier in the convoy must be in full uniform and maintain an aggressive vigilance poorly disciplined convoys become target therefore convoy should be planned and prepared using the same troop leading procedures tlps used in any combat arms operation these tlps have been proven in combat to provide leaders with detailed and effective procedures for developing issuing and preparing for sound tactical plan using tlps will ensure that all key tasks are accomplished making maximum use of the leaders most critical resource time while tlps are standardized throughout the army this chapter will discuss how they are tailored to specifically fit convoy operations 12 convoy tlps receive the mission issue the warning order warno make tentative plan initiate movement reconnoiter complete the plan issue the convoy brief supervise 121 receive the mission the convoy commander may receive the mission in warno an operations order opord fragmentary order frago transportation movement request tmr or verbally if time is short the convoy commander should ensure he completely understands the mission and tasks involved he takes this opportunity to ask clarifying questions and seek further guidance if necessary the convoy commander should then quickly analyze his units current capability to accomplish the assigned task see yourself means making rapid assessment of any problems people supplies or maintenance that could jeopardize the mission if the issues are serious enough to require assistance from the commander he should be informed immediately 122 issue the warno warnos are issued to ensure that subordinate leaders of elements have key information they need to maximize their preparation time typically convoy operations are planned in timeconstrained environment the initial warno should include manifest and time line the manifest provides the detailed organization for combat formation personnel and equipment the time line is schedule of all preparatory tasks from receipt of the mission to sp the convoy commander may issue multiple warnos as he receives additional for official use only 1convoy leader traininginformation or changes from higher fillintheblank warno along with implementing guidance is provided in appendices b and c 123 make tentative plan simplified approach to tactical analysis and planning makes use of the following basic considerations mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support available time available and civil considerations metttc mission the convoy commander must review then plan to execute all of the tasks and guidance found in his higher operational instructions and commanders intent essential or priority tasks should be determined any restrictions or limitations detours restricted routes rules of engagement roe must be considered and applied enemy convoys are generally conducted in familiar areas continuous operations in assigned areas of operation aos this permits units to develop detailed records of historical information concerning enemy activity along frequently traveled routes pattern analysis of intelligence is necessary for understanding and reacting to the threats all leaders and personnel of units conducting convoys must be thoroughly knowledgeable and current on the threats they face units that have force xxi battle command brigade and below fbcb2 can use this system to obtain current threat common operating picture cop ºtypes of threats to convoys c42vehicle borne improvised explosive devices vbieds

contacts along frequently scheduled routes provides excellent indications where increased patrolling between convoys and increased vigilance during convoys must occur c42photographs and diagrams provide leaders and soldiers with an ability to visualize the threat ºunit intelligence responsibilities units must actively record and analyze the threats in their ao relying solely on intelligence from the battalion s2s analysis is only starting point convoys that see routes on daily basis and are debriefed regularly will provide much more detailed information tasking an operationscenter for army lessons learned 2 for official use onlynoncommissioned officer nco at the company level to provide this intelligence support to convoy commanders will ensure that detailed and current intelligence is disseminated to the individuals who must face the threats recommendations include c42developing routespecific battle books that focus on the actual threats and pattern analysis being employed along frequently traveled routes c42threat hot spots should be further identified on the strip maps issued to convoys c42conduct regular briefings for leaders and soldiers to become thoroughly familiar with the threat in the area of operation ao this cannot be accomplished solely during convoy briefings c42tactical risk management begins here based on what they know about the specific threat unit leaders should identify the hazards and implement control measures to lower the risks c42focus rehearsals on the most likely threat terrain and weather ºterrain normally leaders focus on the standard military aspects of terrain for combat operations ocoka c42observationfields of fire c42cover and concealment c42obstacles c42key terrain c42avenues of approach while this traditional approach is occasionally necessary during convoy operations the primary focus should be the route this analysis cannot be accomplished using only map combat imagery base cib products and unmanned aerial vehicle uav imagery available through battalion s2 imagery channels are additional tools but nothing replaces thorough ground reconnaissance take detailed notes pertaining to navigation trafficability congestion and the threat the primary method for providing information to convoy leaders concerning the route is the strip map these sketches are easily developed refined and produced strip maps for long haul routes should be constructed at high levels of command but maps for local short haul routes are ideally produced at battalion or lower levels appendix provides detailed example and discussion of information that should be included on strip map these maps should be issued to every vehicle in the convoy for official use only 3convoy leader trainingºweather terrain and weather analysis are inseparable the effects of weather should be factored in during the review of the terrain in this substep weather analysis evaluates the weathers direct effects on convoys operation the military aspects of weather include c42visibility c42winds c42precipitation c42cloud cover c42temperature c42humidity ºlight data the following information concerning light data should be collected and reviewed prior to each operation the effects of light could provide advantages to the threat c42beginning of morning nautical twilight bmnt and end of evening nautical twilight eent is defined as the first and last time of the day that an individual soldier can engage target at the maximum effective range of his weapon system unaided c42percentage of illumination is defined as the percentage of illumination present based on the moon an example would be ¼ moon is 25 ½ moon is 50 and full moon is 100 in order to analyze illumination there is also requirement to understand moonrise mr and moonset ms during the hours of darkness before the moon rises and after the moon sets percentage of illumination is 0 troops and support available here the convoy commander again attempts to see yourself by analyzing the positive or negative affects of the factors listed below any limitations noted result in increased risks for the convoy and should be mitigated during the

for official use onlytime available see discussion of time line in appendix c civil considerations heavy civilian presence in operational areas will be major complicating factor along any convoy route the potential interference may vary when considering the following types of potential civilian activity ºactive insurgents ºcriminals pilferagetheft ºsympathizers nonlethal harassment such as children throwing rocks ºunwilling accomplices ºinnocent bystanders ºvehicle traffic ºlegitimate armed policemilitia ºciviliangovernment property reconnaissance of routes can identify where this activity may be most prevalent or dangerous historical data on problem areas should be collected recorded and used to develop methods of avoiding civilian casualties and damage to private property concerted effort must be made to ensure that all soldiers understand applicable laws of war low and coalition forces land component command cflcc rules for use of force particularly for use of deadly force cflcc rules of engagement roe emphasizes four broad principles ºattack enemy forces and military targets ºspare civilians and civilian property if possible ºconduct yourself with dignity and honor ºcomply with the low if you see violation report it additional classes should be conducted within the unit to foster detailed understanding of the low and cflcc rules for use of force appendix h provides discussion of low the cflcc roe and series of vignettes recently used by the 1st armored division in baghdad iraq convoy planners must emphasize these requirements during every convoy briefing decision to engage is decision that must be made by individual soldiers the principles and vignettes previously indicated provide general understanding of when to shoot when faced with hostile action on the move in close proximity to innocent civilians an individual decision to shoot should be based on rapid analysis of two factors ºrisk to yourself and convoy c42high risk to yourself or convoy sniper or rpg gunner aiming or shooting weapon within 100 meters and surrounded by civilians c42low risk to yourself or convoy individual aiming rifle at distance greater than 100 meters surrounded by civilians for official use only 5convoy leader trainingºyour ability to hit an enemy threat without endangering civilians in the area c42high probability of hit you are stationary or moving slowly there is clear path to the enemy threat c42low probability of hit you are moving rapidly your enemy threat is in close proximity of innocent civilians if risk to yourself or convoy is high and your probability of hitting the enemy threat is high engage the target if the risk to yourself or convoy is low and the probability of hitting the enemy threat is low do not engage the target 124 initiate movement during the preparation period it may be necessary to move elements of the convoy for refueling rearming or to pickup loads the convoy should schedule these moves in the time line and delegate execution to subordinate leaders so that convoy planning is not disrupted 125 conduct reconnaissance there are four types of reconnaissance recon that may be conducted map ground physical aerial imagery one purpose of recon is to confirm or deny the results of the enemy and terrain analysis in relation to the actual route the ground aerial and imagery recons are the optimal methods to do this ground recons need to be planned as separate mission and must include security element imagery recons are an excellent method to obtain information regarding specific areas of interest such as known enemy hot spots or areas that may slow or restrict movement thereby increasing the threat environment for convoy 126 complete the plan all convoy briefings are verbal orders however number of planning products should be completed and used during the briefing examples of each with preparation guidance are listed below appendix b manifest appendix c time line appendix strip map appendix f convoy

the conclusion of all convoy orders 128 supervise execution every aspect of preparation for convoy should be supervised the convoy commander and assistant convoy commander cannot accomplish this without the assistance of all subordinate leaders and noncommissioned officers ncos each truck commander in convoy serial should be considered part of the convoy chain of command with limited planning and preparation time which is often the situation effective precombat checks pccprecombat inspections pci and individualcrew rehearsals will only occur when these individuals are held responsible when the time line is developed plan and schedule how and when to delegate key supervisory tasks for official use only 7convoy leader trainingchapter 2 convoy task organization 21 general convoys are planned to organize and control road movements including the tactical movement of combat forces tactical movement of logistics units and movement of personnel supplies and equipment to support forces in combat for the purpose of this discussion convoy is group of vehicles 2 to 20 vehicles organized under single commanderleader for one of the purposes stated above there is intent to cover administrative convoy procedures loads routes or activities at the destination the considerations provided in this chapter pertain to organizing for combat once the organization of the convoy has been decided that organization becomes the convoy manifest see appendix b 22 key personnelteams and functionslocations all of the personnel and team functions described here pertain to any size convoy depending on the number of vehicles involved multiple duties may be performed by single vehicle crew convoy commander cc the cc is the single leader responsible for the planning preparation and execution of convoy the cc will normally position himself about center sector of the main body formation but is free to travel or move to any location that will enhance his ability to command and control the convoy assistant convoy commander acc the acc is secondincharge and responsible for logistical support of the convoy during preparation and execution in coordination with the cc the acc will ensure that all classes of supply are planned for and issued that maintenance of vehicles communications weapons and other key equipment is checked and that medical preparations to treat and evacuate casualties are accomplished during convoy execution the acc will be in charge of the rear element monitoring rear security and overwatching the trail elements of the convoy he will assist the cc in controlling the rear gun truck if one is assigned he will direct casualty treatment and evacuation teams and will supervise recovery operations lead vehicle commander lvc the lvc is responsible for navigation speed and interval of the convoy based on the guidance in the convoy brief and the situation on the ground he should be an experienced leader with excellent global positioning system gps and land navigation skills who is familiar with the route he will be in charge of the forward element monitoring forward security he will assist the cc in controlling the lead gun truck if one is assigned gun trucks the gun truck provides security to the convoy during movement and at halts there are several versions of gun trucks however they all should be hardened to provide extra protection to both crew and gunner be highly maneuverable and have stable mounted automatic weapon system with the ability to traverse 360 degrees in high threat areas unit should attempt to provide gun truck for every five vehicles in 20vehicle convoy this would provide lead and trail gun trucks with two gun trucks to move up and down the convoy keeping civilian traffic out of the formation the gun trucks also move to for official use only 9convoy leader trainingintersectionsroundabouts to stop civilian traffic combat life savers clssmedics the clssmedics are responsible for rendering medical treatment and supervising evacuation of casualties if possible multiple clss should be assigned dispersing assets throughout the convoy and assigning them responsibility for designated vehicles in order to speed medical attention if limited cls assets should always be positioned in the rear of the formation in order to better support contacts anywhere in the convoy aid and litter team the teams of two to four soldiers each are responsible for providing buddy aid and preparing casualties for movement andor evacuation under supervision of the cls if possible multiple teams should be assigned dispersing assets throughout the convoy and assigning them responsibility for designated vehicles in order to speed medical assistance if limited teams should always be positioned in the rear of the formation in order to better support the cls cls personnel should not be assigned to an team cls personnel should focus on treatment landing zone lz team the lz team is responsible for selecting securing clearing establishing and marking the lz site if possible assign an alternate team recovery team vehicles should be designated to assist with maintenance and recovery along the route ideally it would be wheeled maintenance and recovery vehicle with maintenance trained personnel as drivertruck commander tc if that is not possible the vehicle should be capable of towing any vehicle in the convoy and be equipped with chains tow cables and tools that may be required to provide minor repairs and recovery the personnel assigned to this vehicle should have practiced hasty recovery prior to start point sp this vehicle is normally the next to last vehicle in the convoy if there is rear gun truck if it is the last vehicle it must have rear guard with an automatic weapon to provide protection to the rear of the convoy 23 convoy organizationorder of march convoys are generally organized into three elements the lead main body and trail the lead element consists of the lead gun trucks and the lvc the main body consists of the majority of the vehicles in the convoy with the cc traveling center sector in this element petroleum or ammunition vehicles should be separated throughout this element heavier and slower vehicles should be forward in the main body to assist in gaugingmaintaining convoy speeds for large convoys multiple clsal teams and additional gun trucks should be dispersed throughout this element the trail element consists of clsal team the recovery vehicle the acc and the rear gun truck how key personnel and teams might be organized in an order of

driver must continuously scan and remain alert for threats within his sector of scan 9 to 1 oclock position by observing driver side passenger side and rearview mirrors early threat identification will allow the driver to more quickly place direct fire on the threat within hisher sector of fire 9 to 1 oclock position using the following weapon engagement techniques and procedures the drivers method of engagement will be reflexive fire trained during close quarters marksmanship cqm however the weapon is pointed not aimed because the drivers primary task is controlling the vehicle the weapon is best handled like pistol the right hand is controlling weapon movement and elevation by allowing the upper receiver to pivot on the drivers left arm the weapons rate of fire will be on semiautomatic with rapid trigger squeezes this rate of fire is recommended as firing on burst will cause the weapons muzzle to rise up and become uncontrollable drill 1 this drill begins with the drivers weapon stored in its proper location in the cab unit standing operating procedures sop based on type of vehicle the type of vehicle and physical size of the driver and truck commander tc will have significant impact on this battle drill as the weapon is passed between both bottom line is to ensure that weapons are on safe that positive control is maintained for each weapon and that vocal commands are understood note m249sm203s are not recommended for use by drivers due to possible loss of control of weapon system and vehicle 1 upon making threat contact the driver will activate the left turn signal and announce contact x oclock 2 the tc will place the drivers weapon into the crook of the drivers left arm by grasping the weapon by the pistol grip with the left hand and the handguard with the right during placement of the weapon the barrel should extend over the drivers left arm with the magazine located against the crook of the elbow the tc will then announce secure weapon 3 the driver will grasp the pistol grip with his right hand and announce weapon secure 4 hearing this the tc will release the weapon and turn to scan his sector 5 during the engagement the driver will observe the threat area for two seconds firing rapidly on semiautomatic he should then direct attention back to the operation of the vehicle for two seconds this should continue until there is longer threat for official use only 13convoy leader training6 in the event the driver runs out of ammo or experiences weapon malfunction the following actions will take place the driver will announce out of ammo or malfunction and place his weapon on safe b the tc ensuring his own weapon is on safe will place his weapon between the drivers body and the drivers weapon using the same weapon handling procedures and announce weapon c the tc will then grasp the butt stock of the drivers weapon with his right hand and announce secure weapon d the driver will then remove his hand from his weapon and grasp the pistol grip of the tcs weapon and announce weapon secure the tc will then remove the drivers weapon using twohand control and return to his seat f tc is responsible for clearing misfiresreloading the drivers weapon 7 following the reduction or elimination of the threat the following actions will occur the driver will place his weapon on safe and announce secure weapon b the tc will grasp the weapon with both hands and announce weapon secure c the driver will then place his firing hand back onto the steering wheel resume scanning and turn off the turn signal 8 drivers should not fire when vehicle is moving at speeds of 40 miles per hour mph or greater b during times of limited visibility night fog heavy rain dust storm c during severe hazardous or limited road conditions bridges narrow paths damaged roads road construction d in situations where there is passenger who could cover hisher sector of fire for example in four seat high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle hmmwv in areas crowded with noncombatants 312 truck commander tc contact drill the tc must continuously scan and remain alert for threats within his sector of scan 11 to 3 oclock positioncenter for army lessons learned 14 for official use onlyearly identification will allow the tc to more quickly achieve proper body position and place effective suppressive fire on the threat within hisher sector of fire 1 to 3 oclock position using the following drill drill 2 once threat is identified the tc will announce the threat to the driver activate right turn signal while attempting to engage the threat with suppressive fire within his sector of fire 1 to 3 oclock position using proper weapon engagement techniques body positioning tc should attempt to achieve position that allows maximum stabilization inside the cab maximum stabilization depends on the type of vehicle and equipment in the area of the tc and must be practiced until the individual is comfortable ºfiring shoulder should be the same side the individual normally uses ºin order to achieve rapid effective aim the weapon is brought up to the head the head should not drop down ºthe shooter should ensure his elbow is down against his body in order to assist in locking the weapon into the crook of the shoulder ºindividual shooters should use the back of the seat for support to maximize the individuals sector of fire and assist with stabilization ºfiring to the rear beyond 3 oclock should be limited as it causes the individual to shift too far forward on the seat and prevents observation of his sector of scan b point of aim poa if the threat is stationary and the shooter is moving poa will be to the right of the threat in order to allow the momentum of the shooters rounds to drift left into the threat shooters poa in reference to elevation will always be low or short first this allows the shooter to see the impact of his rounds and quickly adjust his fire short rounds cause ricochets and flying debris that can force the threat to seek cover last it provides an effective control measure to limit the risk of civilian casualties andor property damage c rate of fire all personnel other than drivers should engage threats with 3round bursts bursts should be triggered rapidly because of dispersion caused by speed of vehicle and limited time to engage 313 exitenter vehicle crew drill it is essential to establish and practice drill to sustain suppressive fire and provide maximum protection for personnel from threat contact in halted vehicles this drill is written for vehicles with two personnel if there are other occupants the drill should be modified as needed and rehearsed the noncontact side occupant and contact side occupant could be personnel on either side of the vehicle for official use only 15convoy leader trainingdrill 3 1 exit the vehicle once determined by the convoy leadership or the crew that it is now time to exit the vehicle the following actions will occur the occupant on the contactthreat side of the vehicle identifies the threat and establishes or maintains base of fire using the burst method b the noncontact side occupant ensuring hisher weapon is on safe exits the vehicle first maintaining as low profile as possible and moves to the portion of the vehicle that offers the best degree of protection and immediately returns fire engagements while dismounted should be on semiautomatic to conserve ammunition at this time this individual should announce in position c at this time the contactside occupant ceases engaging and ensuring hisher weapon is on safe exits vehicle through the noncontactthreat side door once on the ground this individual will then move to the portion of the vehicle that offers the best degree of protection and immediately return fire at this time this individual should announce in position heshe will now engage on semiautomatic d both driver and tc will occasionally scan the area to their rear to ensure there is threat from that direction 2 enter the vehicle once determined by the convoy leadership or the crew that it is now time to enter the vehicle the following actions will occur the noncontactnonthreat side occupant will continue to engage or observe the threat location b the contactside occupant ensuring his weapon is on safe moves to the noncontact side door and while maintaining low profile and enters the vehicle once positioned in the contactthreat side seat this individual will then provide cover by fire maintain observation of the possible threat or if he is

carried per mission all additional ammunition should be located within arms reach while in vehicles c252magazine and ammunition maintenance should occur each time the weapon system is cleaned proper method to unload magazines is to push rounds from the magazine as the bolt would improper unloading spreads the lips of the magazine causing double feeds majority of all m16m4 malfunctions are magazine faults c252uniform and equipment should be closely examined as unnecessary items will interfere with body positioning and weapon engagement procedures and possibly make it difficult for soldiers to exit the vehicle minimum equipment should be body armor kevlar firstaid pouch with two field dressings entry and exit wounds two ammo pouches two canteens and specialtytasked equipment ammunition should be in ammunition pouches attached to the fragmentation vest ammunition stored any other place will disrupt shooters body position and view of sector when changing magazines magazine changes should be practiced until this task can be rapidly accomplished without looking c252drivers weapon must be stored in location that ensures the tc can get to it with minimal effort c252equipment in the interior of the vehicle must be stored in manner to leave clear lane for all personnel to dismount to either side c252additional items that must be dismounted include combat lifesaver cls bag dismount radio systems and additional ammunition all of which should be located within arms reach while in vehicles c252drivers awareness of the hazards with operating vehicle and employing weapon simultaneously should be discussed and practiced while moving in order to understand the hazards this drill can be practiced without firing in stationary and mounted rehearsals c252drivers conducting engagements will have hot expended casings being thrown against the windshield and into the seat area sleeves should be down at all times c252if threats appear on both sides the tc will direct fires on both threats c252individuals should not use the door window frames for support as this will transfer all road vibrations and affect aiming individuals should also not attempt to tie weapons to the top of door frames door gunner as this may prevent the weapon from being removed or adjusted c252there should never be more than two personnel firing from the front or the rear of vehicle at any one time one in the prone position and one kneeling at hisher side for official use only 17convoy leader trainingc252all occupants of vehicle should be seat belted until contact occurs the tc may have to release his seat belt to fire effectively or support the driver c252priority of effort should be given to suppressing the threat when casualties occur once halted all efforts should be made by other occupants of the vehicle to extract casualties to the ground prior to the arrival of the aid and litter team c252when dismounted shooters should assume good supported firing

more than two personnel firing from the front or the rear of vehicle at any one time one in the prone position and one kneeling at hisher side once cargo area personnel are dismounted they may replace tc or driver at firing positions ensuring that the most lethal weapon system is placed on the ground to obtain fire superiority and maintain suppression 3 enter the vehicle once the convoy leadership or the crew determine that it is time to enter the vehicle the following actions will occur the cargo area personnel will allow for the crew to remount first in order to prepare the vehicle for movement b the noncontactnonthreat side occupants will continue to engage or observe the threat location while the contact side occupants remount one at time in reverse order of how they dismounted and will announce in position c once in position the contact personnel will signal for the noncontact side personnel to remount d the contact side occupants will continue to engage or observe the threat location while the noncontact side occupants remount one at time in reverse order of how they dismounted for official use only 19convoy leader traininge based on unit sop the cargo area personnel signal the crew for example two slaps on the roof of the drivers compartment when everyone has remounted and are ready to proceed techniques and procedures for vehicle drills c252do not roll with tailgate open to do so risks soldiers particularly those who may be wounded while moving or who may fall out of the open tailgate c252if exiting the cargo area over the side of the vehicle the first soldier will hand hisher weapon to his battle buddy prior to exiting once on the ground he will secure hisher weapon and that of the battle buddy allowing freedom to maintain three point contact exit c252if exiting from the tailgate each soldier may maintain hisher weapon and place it on the bed while exiting c252three possible positions for personnel from the cargo area are as follows 1 positioned on the noncontact side of the vehicle between the two wheel firing positions where they can engage the enemy 2 positioned to cover 360degree threat 3 positioned to assist with providing command and control by using radios andor hand and arm signals section two convoy battle drills 321 react to contactthreat maintain movement this drill is designed to establish procedures for actions to be taken by convoy when confronted with enemy contact this threat can range from direct weapons fire rocket propelled grenade rpg fire improvised explosive devices ieds andor indirect fires the intent is to maintain movement and increasing speed in order to reduce exposure and deny the threat the ability to effectively engage the convoy figure 31center for army lessons learned 20 for official use only drill 1 1 continuously observe sectors of scan 2 place suppressive fire on the threat using individual weapon engagement techniques provided in vehicle battle drills proceed through the contact zone increasing speed and interval and do not bunch up 3 activate vehicle turn signal to indicate direction of contact or most dangerous contact when engaged from both sides 4 report contact on internal communications identifying truck number type of contact and clock direction 5 gun trucks maintain front and rear security of the convoy as the convoy continues movement through the contact zone engagement of the threat should occur without affecting the momentum of the gun truck or the convoy if gun trucks are required to reposition or stop in order to engage they will assume their original positions when the convoy passes out of the contact area 6 convoy leadership submits size activity location unit time and equipment salute report to higher 7 convoy will proceed to rally point forward 8 any vehicle with casualty will maintain momentum and activate fourway flashers if possible the uninjured occupant will notify convoy leadership using communication systems techniques and procedures c252drivers must remain focused on the vehicle to their front and rear as those vehicles may be unaware that contact has occurred maintain interval and be ready to execute sudden maneuvers if vehicles to the front are forced to stop c252activate turn signal only while the contactthreat is in each vehicles sector this action will assist personnel to quickly focus on the exact location c252reporting should be second in priority to engaging the threat when reporting within convoy call signs should be designated vehicle position first vehicle is truck 1 second is truck 2 etc this allows personnel to quickly identify the location of concern c252reports should be accurate and concise who what where and when c252convoy leadership should identify and direct target engagements of gun trucks for example gun truck 1 engage rpg team 3 oclock 200 meters c252convoy commanders should submit request for medical evacuation medevac as soon as there is an indication of serious casualty do not wait until you reach the rally point specific grid can be transmitted later for official use only 21convoy leader training322 react to contact forced to stop this drill is designed to establish procedures for actions to be taken by convoy when forced to stop because of severely damaged vehicles andor serious injury to driver this contactthreat can range from threat direct weapons fire rpg fire ieds andor indirect fires the intent of the drill is to prevent further injuriesdamage and allow the convoy to quickly exit the contact zone while this drill identifies basic procedures the location of the contact within the convoy the specific threat and friendly casualties will require convoy leaders to make timely decisions and issue rapid fragmentary orders fragos to adjust this drill figure 32 drill 2 1 personnel in vehicles forced to stop will return fire and exit the vehicle 2 all other vehicles in the convoy will stop and where possible return fireexit the vehicle once dismounted the convoy will rapidly gain fire superiority using wellaimed semiautomatic fire from both flanks of the threat 3 vehicles not in direct contact will report on internal communication if possible identifying truck number type of contact and clock direction 4 convoy leadership will reposition to better assess the situation and reposition gun trucks using available cover and concealment and standoff range to increase the volume of fire in the contact zone from multiple directionscenter for army lessons learned 22 for official use only figure 33 5 once convoy leadership determines the convoy has either gained fire superiority or defeated the enemy threat the senior convoy leader will decide to execute casualty evacuation casevacrecovery predetermined destruction criteria should be established during planning to expedite operations when recovery is not possible 6 if the convoy leadership determines the convoy cannot gain fire superiority or eliminate the threat the leadership will break contact from the kill zone techniques and procedures c252leaders outside the contact zone must establish 360degree security and be aware of second potential threat from different direction c252convoy leadership should identify and direct gun trucks target engagement for example gun truck 1 engage rpg team 3 oclock 200 meters c252conservation of ammunition is important once dismounted all personnel should be engaging with weapons in the semiautomatic mode and engage only visible threat targets c252prior to breaking contact an attempt should be made to recover all weapons and sensitive items from vehicles that are nonrecoverable andor being abandoned 323 casualty evacuation casevac and recovery drill casevac is defined as the removal of casualties from highrisk situation or area personnel will not be able to provide immediate aid until fire superiority has been established once fire superiority is achieved extraction and movement of casualties will often require field expedient procedures recovering vehicles from the contact zone should be conducted with hasty recovery procedures for official use only 23convoy leader training figure 34 drill 3 1 once the convoy leadership determines that the area in the vicinity of the casualtys andor disabled vehicles is secure or the enemy is suppressed casevac and recovery operations may begin 2 casevac the team will move forward blowing their horn continuously to warn dismounts of the vehicles approach and position their vehicle on the noncontact side of the vehicle with the casualtys the team will then extract casualties and load them immediately into the aid and litter vehicle as safely and quickly as possible b treatment of the casualtys will not occur inside the threat area except for emergency treatment to prevent loss of life and then only as the vehicle is departing the area c the convoy commander must decide what other vehicles in the convoy will accompany the vehicle with casualties on board to floating rally point as minimum there will be one additional vehicle to provide security with leader and singlechannel ground and airborne radio system sincgars capability 3 vehicle recovery procedures recovery team will position on the safe side of the disabled vehicle in the same manner as the team b tc will dismount and assess the disabled vehicle looking for any safety reason why hasty recovery chains towstraps or cables not tow bars cannot be accomplished c if it is determined the vehicle can be safely recovered tc will guide the recovery vehicle into position that best allows hasty hookup the driver of the disabled vehicle will then mount andcenter for army lessons learned 24 for official use only operate the disabled vehicle until free of the contact area if the driver is casualty the tc of the recovery vehicle will operate the vehicle being towed d upon exiting the contact area or at the rally point hookup procedures will occur using tow bar techniques and procedures c252a cls or medic should not be assigned to an team unless the unit has sufficient clss to provide first line treatment at the rally point personnel assigned this task should have basic cls knowledgetraining in order to provide basic treatment at the casualty collection point ccp c252personnel dismounted inside the contact zone will initially engage the enemy threat due to the risk of more casualties treatment or casevac is second in priority c252to permit rapid pickup and safe transportation of casualties team vehicles should be free of extraneous equipment c252to ensure quick exit from the contact area and recovery vehicle drivers will not exit their vehicles in the contact zone c252hasty hookup procedures should be established by unit leaders hasty recovery devices can be chains or cables already rigged on the recovery vehicle all other vehicles must have capability to quickly hookup this chain or cable c252al and recovery personnel will not separate themselves from their weapons during casevac or recovery operations c252once the casualties are loaded or the vehicle recovered and recovery teams should contact convoy leadership when ready to move 324 break contact the break contact drill is designed to establish basic procedures for withdrawing personnel and equipment from situation where the convoy is either unable to gain fire superiority or the mission dictates immediate withdrawal leaders must adapt to the situation as different actions may be required based on disposition of convoy assets on either side of the contact zone this drill begins with the decision to withdraw drill 4 1 convoy leadership will identify either rally point rear or forward or if necessary both rally points communication systems andor appropriate pyrotechnic signals will be used to communicatesignal the decision to break contact and the designated rally points 2 personnel on vehicles to be abandoned will remove weapons and other sensitive items and initiate destruction based on guidance established in the convoy brief 3 personnel in the contact zone will assist with evacuation of all casualties for official use only 25convoy leader trainingas required personnel not required will continue to engage the threat location in order to provide fire support for the convoys withdrawal once dismounted individuals have bounded back to safe locations leaders must ensure that all personnel are accounted for 4 leaders within the contact zone will direct personnel remaining to bound individually in the direction of egress maintaining covering fire to the extent possible figure 35 5 vehicles that are functional can displace either backwards or forwards vehicles closest to the threat move first as demonstrated in figures 35 or 36 vehicles will continue to displace in this fashion until all personnel and vehicles have cleared the contact zone as personnel and vehicles displace it is important to

consolidation and reorganization techniques and procedures c252conservation of ammunition is important all personnel once dismounted should be engaging with weapons in the semiautomatic mode c252when executing casualty evacuation casevac it may be necessary to maneuver additional personnel from teams into the contact area to assist c252personnel in the contact zone are best positioned to determine the direction they break contact c252movement from the contact zone in vehicles may not be possible if it requires turning the vehicle around while in contact personnel in these situations may be required to abandon their vehicle it is essential for dismounted individuals breaking contact to move in the shortest direction to achieve safe covered position this may cause round about route back to the remainder of the convoy c252when moving in or from the contract zone it is important to use all available cover and concealment c252predetermined destruction criteria and procedures should be established and provided if the vehiclecargo is sensitive 325 occupy floating rally points floating rally points are established using determined distance either forward or rear of contact depending on the nature of the contact and disposition of vehicles floating rally point rather than fixed or predetermined rally points is used because contact locations are unpredictable once at floating rally point unit will need to establish formation that facilitates security command and control consolidation and reorganization activities figure 37 for official use only 27convoy leader training civilian trafficdrill 5 1 unless otherwise directed floating rally point forward will be located approximately two to six miles in the direction of movement andor outside the range of enemy weapon systems being employed against you the floating rally point rear will be located approximately two to six miles andor outside the range of enemy weapon systems being employed against you whenever possible the actual rally point site selected should be in an open area with maximum observation in all directions and should not be located near built up areas 2 occupation of the rally point will occur using the box formation if possible the shoulder of the road will be used if conditions are appropriate and safe for all vehicles if unable to pull off the roadway vehicles will establish the formation to the right side of the roadway to allow civilian vehicles to move around the convoys left side occupation will begin with the first vehicle positioning hisher vehicle in manner that blocks direct entry into the front center of the formation all additional vehicles will alternate right and left in order to establish the rest of the box as pictured in figure 37 the convoy commander andor command and control vehicles will be positioned inside the centersafe area the rear of the box will be blocked in the same manner as the front 3 gun trucks while primarily responsible for maintaining support by fire positions are also part of the consolidation and reorganization gun trucks will normally occupy the 12 and 6 oclock position in the convoy box formation if the rally point is in restricted terrain gun trucks may be positioned to cover dead space or even patrol around the convoy box 4 drivers and passengers dismount towards the inside of the box and establish perimeter security leaders must ensure that 360degree security is established and maintained 5 casualty treatmentevacuation casualty treatment will begin upon occupying the rally point vehicles with casualties on board will have fourway flashers turned on the team will remove the casualty from the vehicle and immediately begin buddyaid until relieved by cls b clss will scan vehicles in search of casualties fourway flashers upon encountering casualty the cls will evaluate buddyaid and if adequate continue his search c teams secure and transport casualties to the ccp designated by convoy leadership using litters

medevac request using the approved 9line report see example in section four reports and signaling 6 landing zone lz procedures the lz should be at least 75 to 100 meters downwind from the rally point it can be marked with vs17 panel smoke reflective hazard triangles chem lites or vehicle lights b helicopters land and take off into the wind the lz selected should not require the helicopter to land or take off over the convoy c the lz is secured with gun truck or similar vehicle equipped with an automatic weapon the gun truck moves to location away from the flight path of the landing helicopter but in good fire support position to provide early warning of approaching enemy elements the lz area is cleared of anything that may be sucked into the aircraft engine or is hazardous in any way d when the aircraft notifies the convoy that it is inbound member of the lz team deploys smoke grenade if available to indicate wind direction the grenade should be dropped on the downwind side of the lz so as not to obscure it the casualty is positioned within the box formation at point which allows rapid movement to the lz and is sheltered from the rotor wash once the aircraft has setdown the helicopter crew chief will signal the team when to approach the aircraft the team approaches the aircraft from the flank staying well clear of the tail rotor once loaded the team should retrace their steps away from the aircraft and return to their normal duties 7 consolidation and reorganization begin when the rally pointlocation has been secured these procedures can be accomplished concurrently with treating and evacuating casualties 8 personnel will report their ammunition status to first line leaders ammunition report will be based on how many full magazines are available subordinate leaders will immediately redistribute ammunition at their level and report to the next leader 9 drivers will inspect vehicles and cargo for damage concurrently recovery teams will conduct proper hookup procedures and prepare damaged vehicles for safe operation subordinate leaders will conduct weapon communication and sensitive item inspections and ready personnel for onward movement 10 any personnel from the cargo areas of large vehicles may be used to fill in on perimeter security or special tasks for example lz setupsecurity support more than two personnel should occupy any firing

protect yourself from vbieds it is recommended that you pull off the road at least 100 m to create standoff from other vehicles c252distance to floating rally points should be varied constantly to prevent setting pattern that can be exploited by the enemy c252gun truck crews will not dismount at rally point unless required for casualties these vehicles must be manned and ready to reposition at all times c252in high vbied threat areas gun trucks may need to be positioned away from the box along both directions of travel if either the lead or trail gun truck repositions other vehicles must move to close the end of the box c252interval between vehicles should be enough that vehicles can pull out of the formation however the interval should be tight enough to prevent threat vehicles from having highspeed avenue into the safe area c252the box formation allows leadership and individuals to speed consolidation and reorganization activities as well as provide safe and secure area herringbone and column formations fail to provide these basic requirements c252dismounted personnel positioning should be inside the safe area using vehicles as cover locations between the rear and front of vehicles provide protectioncover and are also considered an unsafe area if vehicles are still in gear or should happen to roll forward c252personnel providing security will normally be positioned inside the box personnel should stay inside the box unless directed otherwise and must take care to avoid being run over by other vehicles entering the box all security personnel will exit the box only if required by special tasks for example cover restricted terrain or set up an lz c252all measures should be taken to prevent civilian vehicles from becoming blocked by convoys rally point formation as this will cause additional problems with crowd control issues personnel in the rear of the box should be prepared to direct people around the convoy c252drivers of command and control vehicles should remain mounted to monitor the radios c252it is possible that the initial vehicles entry into the floating rally point will be leader vehicle accompanied by the vehicle as the remainder of the convoy approaches they will establish the box around these vehicles c252rally point procedures should be completed as rapidly as possible because of the proximity of the enemy

to coalition forces in theater threat forces have turned to the employment of ieds as the preferred method of attack as this provides the threat standoff capability to initiate an attack and then quickly escape the area some of these attacks include the use of direct fire weapons immediately following or prior to the detonation of an ied training should be scheduled frequently to update all personnel on the current ied threat the intent of this drill is to safeguard the unit or element while securing the ied site unexploded ordnance uxo should be treated in the same manner as an ied all

convoy formations on the move this proved ineffective due to convoy speed and intervals the emerging technique is to target stationary convoys or groups of soldiers ttp to mitigate the threat include the following ºhang signs in arabic remain 100 meters from vehicle do not pass visible at 50 meters ºuse flashbang grenades nonlethal as warning devices for vehicles getting too close ºemploy any electronic countermeasures available ºuse cones andor barriers with signs to keep vehicles 100 m away while halted ºif suspicious vehicles ignore these warnings and close within 50 m you may shoot to kill the driver what vbieds look like ºmostly cars some light trucks ºvehicle appears heavy laden rear axle weighted down ºsingle male drivers normally in their mid20s but this is not always the case dressed in normal iraqi attire or dressed inappropriately for vehicle type may be clean shaven with short haircut as this is part of the purifying ritual that many follow prior to an attack ºaggressive or erratic driving this factor alone is insufficient to engage ºsome vehicles are stationary on the side of the road and are detonated from standoff position what vbieds do not look like ºlarge trucks and buses ºvehicles carrying multiple people family or children in vehicle ºaggressive or erratic driving this is also common driving behavior here for official use only 31convoy leader

procedures c252recommend the use of water bottle partially filled with colored water with streamer attached as an ied marking system these materials are readily available and would allow for each vehicle to carry minimum of two markers c252while approaching and moving through an overpass the gun trucks may shift lanes and should orientate their weapon systems toward the overpass scanning for signs of insurgents and ieds c252do not use road shoulders or cut corners when making turns ieds are often placed at intersections where large vehicles will run off the road to easily make turn c252gunners should stay in vehicles unexposed until contact is initiated either by small arms contact or ied seventyfive percent of all ied casualties come from gunners exposing themselves once contact is initiated gunners should move up and begin to return fire c252vehicles should travel in the middle of the lane as much as possible in order to minimize the effects of an ied blast c252most

to the convoy unit or part of an external convoy escort element assigned to protect the convoy for the purpose of this handbook gun truck is considered to be as minimum vehicle with top mounted automatic weapon capable of 360degree observation and fields of fire gun trucks may be used in variety of ways they can provide route security in designated areas andor patrol assigned sectors to attack identified enemy elements in advance of convoy gun trucks can provide stationary security at known danger areas or traffic control points tcps when assigned to accompany convoy gun trucks may be used as ground security element traveling in front of the convoy to clear danger areas such as overpasses and restricted terrain within the convoy they can provide leadrear security or for large serials be dispersed throughout the order of march the convoy escort commander controls gun trucks in coordination with and under direction of the convoy commander if at all possible gun trucks supporting convoy should be present for the convoy brief and final rehearsals to ensure complete synchronization of effort while gun truck sops may be used to react quickly to various types of enemy contact their movement maneuver and engagements must be coordinated with the convoy commander or other designated subordinate convoy leaders in the event of significant enemy contact against convoy gun trucks attempt to maneuver to the flanks of the threat position themselves behind cover and from standoff distance deliver accurate sustained fires this tactic requires constant coordination with the convoy leader closest to the threat to identify precise enemy and friendly locations as in any close encounter with the enemy success is measured by the ability to rapidly mass fires against the threat and concurrently avoid the risk of fratricide 332 gun truck maneuver against stationary threat this drill establishes procedures and actions to be taken by convoy escort elements against significant enemy threats convoy escort elements will support convoys by providing overwatch security clearing danger areas overpasses restricted terrain and ambush sites and immediately reacting by fire and maneuver to suppress or destroy enemy threats the convoy escort commander will be the convoy commander for civilian convoys drill 1 1 once security element anywhere within the convoy makes contact they will immediately shift to the contact side of the convoy halt and return fire fix the enemy they will then activate the proper turn signal to indicate contact direction send contact report to the convoy commander and begin developing the situation 2 the convoy escort commander will assess the situation and should maneuver second escort element into support by fire position flank the enemy the escort element in contact should describe the target locationcenter for army lessons learned 42 for official use onlyand mark it if possible as the maneuvering element may be out of visual range initially 3 this second security element moves rapidly into position while the first covers their movement this element should make use of all available cover and concealment in order to achieve position that allows suppression of the enemy while affording maximum standoff distance this tactic reduces the effectiveness of the enemys weapons while maximizing friendly weapon capabilities both escort elements should communicate to coordinatedeconflict their fires in the target area figure 320 4 the next available escort element will simultaneously bound to the front of the convoy and continue to lead the convoy out of the kill zone move the convoy forward the convoy escort commander must alert the convoy commander that gun trucks are maneuvering on the contact side to prevent possible fratricide the convoy must maintain momentum and positive control while moving through the contact area if necessary this escort element can split up so that one vehicle can move to the front of the convoy while another picks up security for official use only 43convoy leader training 12 3 figure 321 5 when the convoy has cleared the contact area escort elements providing fire

must continue to observe 360 degrees to detect any threat from different direction c252if at all possible the convoy security element should have separate radio frequency to avoid unnecessary radio traffic during engagements with the convoy escort commander having twonet capability allowing him to communicate with the convoy commander c252if four or more gun trucks are available they can be organized to work in teams as shown in the following diagram figure 323 333 gun truck drills and formations for high threat areas hostile forces in iraq have observed us army ttp and developed their own countermeasures current enemy tactic is to pull alongside or enter convoy formation with the intent of splitting vehicles away or engage them with rpgs most recently insurgents are using vbieds in this role to inflict maximum casualties and damage drill 2 1 the most effective technique for clearing civilian traffic from within convoy formations is to have gun trucks running up and down each flank of the convoy however caution must be used because many iraqi civilian drivers are not hostile but drive aggressively for this reason gun trucks should flash their lights and sound their horn to get the drivers attention before moving alongside the vehicle to force him out of the formation or when approaching the rear of civilian vehicle within the convoy the degree of force that can be employed to eject civilian vehicles from the formation is determined by units chain of command closing up the convoy formation is second technique to prevent civilian infiltration note that these

formation must be used with care on two lane roads with approaching traffic as indicated in figure 324 figure 324 b inverted t formation is used on three lane roads the primary purpose is to prevent civilian traffic from coming up from behind the convoy and getting intermingled with the convoy the convoy itself runs the centerline of their two lanes gun trucks are in the front and rear as well as running up and down both flanks of the formation with two military trucks flanking the rear gun truck normal convoy speeds can be maintained when traffic permits intervals should be closed as much as

convoy truckcivilianclearing gun truckc c direction of movementc diamond formation is used on three lane or larger roads again the intent is to control their section of the road and prevent civilian traffic from intermingling with the convoy due to the complexity of maintaining this formation intervals and convoy speed may need to be decreased see figure 326 figure 326 334 traffic control points tcps the intent for convoys in built up areas where choke points direction changes and negotiation of twoway traffic areas are required is to maintain movement often this will necessitate slowing down but every effort should be made to keep from halting the convoy gun trucks maneuvering forward to establish tcps is preferred method of achieving this intent convoy commanders should attempt to maintain gun trucks at the front and rear of the convoy while establishing these tcps note that these techniques can be employed with both green and white convoys drill 3 1 choke points at locations where traffic is backed up so that the convoy is going to be slowed or stopped due to terrain or obstacles it is necessary to block civilian traffic near the choke point to permit uninterrupted passage of the convoy b the designated gun trucks move forward rapidly and establish tcps on the near and far side of the choke point these tcps stop traffic to allow the convoy to flow through the

communication between all elements when frequency modulation fm communications are not available or vocal commands are ineffective due to excessive noise system of visual communication is an alternate means for transmitting orders and directives the purpose of this paragraph is to standardize the use of visual signals during the conduct of convoy operations visual signals are any means of communication that require line of sight and can be used to transmit prearranged messages over short distances however visual signals do have certain limitations they may not be effective in periods of limited visibility unless chem lights or flashlights are used additionally they may be misunderstood if not executed properly and rehearsed with everyone in the convoy there are six basic hand and arm signals that can be used as primary or alternate means of communication during convoy operations the effectiveness of hand and arm signals will increase by combining voice commands with visual signals mount extend one arm up and to the side make two or three arm movements up and down with palm facing upward figure 334 dismount extend the arms make two or three movements up and down with

for threat contact anywhere in the area of responsibility aor requires that the strictest possible force protection measures be planned and executed for any move of any distance the challenge to prepare convoy to react effectively and safely is formidable for many reasons convoys travel in file formation over predictable routes the enemy chooses the point and timing of any attack the primary threat is from vehicle borne improvised explosive devices vbiedsimprovised explosive devices ieds which are difficult to identify from moving vehicle shooting on the move is required from an unstabilized platform civilians and private property are always present command and control is difficult because the decision to react and shoot is necessarily decentralized to each vehicle these situations constitute high tactical risks that must be mitigated in combat the techniques that leaders and soldiers use to anticipate the threat and mass accurate fires are identical to those that will lower the potential for fratricide and limit civilian casualties or collateral damage therefore the measures of risk reduction that are effective in combat must be techniques learned and practiced in training these measures are found in ar 38563 policies and procedures for firing ammunition for training target practice and combat 15 october 1983 additional administrative or restrictive rules introduced into training events do not make livefire exercises safer they just make them less realistic livefire training for soldiers should be performed in crawl walk run sequence with full participation of the chainofcommand extensive dry fire practice prior to moving to the range must be performed close quarters marksmanship cqm with soldiers shooting during forward rearward and lateral movement is an essential training step before executing convoy livefire exercise during cqm soldiers effectively learn close range shooting techniques muzzle awareness and triggerselector manipulation followon convoy livefire scenarios should be designed to be as realistic as possible based on ar 38563 enemy targets should be arrayed replicating the threat within engagement areas constructed with buildings or facades stripped down vehicles and civilian personnel targets should be built of wood or plastic to minimize the risk of ricochet metal objects such as cars and lifters are carefully bermed or dug in to further reduce the hazard and to protect the target lifters and other devices all surface area danger diagrams sdads must be carefully checked and deconflicted with those of other ranges or training events within the training area these sdads can be transparent to the soldiers by careful target placement insuring that fires are directed into safe areas and negating the need for administrative right and left range markers livefire exercises developed in this manner create conditions where troop leading procedures used in combat will result in improved

marksmanship cqm training is to ensure all leaders and soldiers are familiar with and confident in the use of their individual weapon cqm has the following goals to provide individuals with the skills necessary to accurately acquire identify and engage hostiles while stationary or moving to make the individual soldier more capable and confident in hisher abilities and the abilities of hisher individual weapon system to develop soldier confidence in hisher peers and leadership to develop the warrior mentality in the individual soldier cqm training is accomplished through the following blocks of instruction 1 equipment leaders and soldiers are instructed on how their equipment should be worn specifically individual equipment should be streamlined there should be nothing on the firing side shoulder thereby permitting solid butt stocktoshoulder weld when firing only essential equipment should be carried thereby minimizing the individual load the equipment carried should be placed in such way that the soldier is able to sit in his vehicle for extended periods of time with minimal discomfort the mentality should be that if the individual must exit the vehicle while under fire all essential equipment both combat and survivalaid must exit with himher never assume return trip to the vehicle will be available 2 weapons handling all weapons are treated as loaded at all times weapons must be carried in safe manner there is up and down range in combat zone therefore the recommended carry posture is the low ready the proper procedures for loading clearing and reducing malfunctions are covered since these tasks are often improperly executed muzzle awareness is stressed since anything the muzzle crosses can be destroyed the m16m4m249 is twohanded weapon system the firing hand is placed with the trigger finger off the trigger and the thumb rests on the selector switch the nonfiring hand remains on the forearm assembly thereby enforcing muzzle awareness 3 fundamentals of marksmanship leaders and soldiers are given instruction on the following eight fundamentals of marksmanship and how they apply to cqm stance stance is the most important fundamental since it affects all other aspects of cqm the stance is achieved by placing the feet shoulder width apart the nonfiring foot slightly forward of the firing foot toes pointed at the threat while stationary or in the direction of travel while moving knees slightly bent and slight forward lean at the waist for official use only 93convoy leader traininggrip the weapon is gripped high on the pistol grip the firing finger on the outside of the trigger guard thumb on the selector lever and nonfiring hand on the hand guard applying rearward pressure the firing hand should remain as relaxed as possible to ensure smooth trigger squeeze elbows stay tight to the body to minimize the individual silhouette and to provide stable firing platform the weapon is held in the low ready position until actually ready to engage threat this position is achieved by keeping the butt stock tight into the pocket of the shoulder with the muzzle of the weapon dipped at approximately 45degree angle breathing breathing affects shot placement up and down most targets are larger up and down therefore breathing is not as critical as trigger squeeze however the individuals must control his breathing during the stresses of an engagement in order to take an accurate shot trigger squeeze trigger squeeze affects shot placement left and right most targets are smaller lefttoright therefore consistent trigger squeeze is critical the portion of the finger used to pull the trigger is not as important as maintaining consistent trigger squeeze all threats are engaged with controlled pair this technique is accomplished by taking three sight pictures one for each shot and third to emphasize firing until the threat is eliminated sight alignment sight alignment is the relationship of the rear sight aperture and the front sight post there are four methods for aiming when using iron sights see paragraph 4 below the rear sight aperture should be set to the large peep for faster target acquisition sight picture sight picture is the point of aim on the target due to the close range of cqm the point of impact will be lower than the point of aim therefore individuals must aim slightly higher in order to achieve an incapacitating shot the recommended point of aim for 25 meters and closer is the clavicle notch of the neck recovery recovery involves the techniques applied by the individual to minimize the effects of recoil and includes the stance as well as the grip of the weapon the goal of recovery is to reduce muzzle climb thereby achieving faster second shot follow through follow through begins at the end of recovery and involves the techniques applied to reacquire the threat for the second and subsequent shots at the end of recovery the individual should be looking down their sights at the threat and squeezing the trigger for the next shot 4 aiming with iron sights there are four methods of aiming with iron sights slowaimed fire slowaimed fire is used when accuracy is more important than speed and involves seeking perfect sight alignment and sight picture slowaimed fire is very accurate but too slow for thecenter for army lessons learned 94 for official use onlypurposes of cqm 300 rapidaimed fire rapidaimed fire involves imperfect sight alignment and emphasizes windage not elevation for sight picture rapidaimed fire is slightly faster and less accurate than slowaimed fire 100m aimed quickkill aimed quickkill involves placing the top of the front sight post even with the top of the rear sight aperture and emphasis is placed on windage not elevation for sight picture this method is much faster and less accurate than slowaimed fire 25m instinctive fire in the instinctive fire method the sights are not used the individual looks at the target and relies on muscle memory for shot placement this method is very fast but inaccurate 15m the current allocation of time and ammunition does not permit the development of the muscle memory required to utilize this method of aiming emphasis is placed on rapidaimed fire and aimed quickkill 5 cqm practical exercise dry fire exercise ºindividuals are shown the various firing positions while stationary and while moving ºtraining is conducted on 25meter range with firing lines designated at 4 meters 7 meters 10 meters 15 meters 20 meters and 25 meters ºas this is the beginning of the development of muscle memory multiple repetitions of each movement are used until everyone shows proficiency ºthree commands are used during this portion of training ready up and recover c42on the command ready the individuals look at and identify their target c42on the command up the individuals face their target if necessary raise their weapons from the low ready to the ready position simultaneously rotating their selector switch from safe to semi and simulate firing controlled pair c42on the command recover the individuals rotate their weapons back to safe and return to the start position lowering their weapon back to the low ready position ºthe following are the positions and movements c42target to the front c42target to the rear for official use only 95convoy leader trainingc42target to the left

of the previous blocks of instruction by accurately engaging their target with controlled pair only the available ammunition limits the number of controlled pairs for each position or movement sixty rounds three controlled pairs per position should be considered the minimum to ensure complete comprehension the following table is suggested course of fire firing position distance target front

procedures for using both their individual weapon and the crewserved weapons assigned to the unit m249 m240b m2hb 50 cal and the mk19 training is given in three blockscenter for army lessons learned 96 for official use onlythe first block covers clearing disassembly maintenance reassembly and functions check the second block includes loading firing reducing stoppage and unloading procedures as well as reacting to fire commands while ground mounted the third block covers the peculiar requirements for engaging from vehicle all blocks of instruction are followed by practical exercise dry fire and live fire the major firing tasks for the crewserved weapons will be to fire from stationary ground supported position fire from stationary vehicle and fire from moving vehicle throughout all of this instruction and firing safety will be paramount safe handling of weapons manipulation of weapons safety reacting to fire commands and muzzle awareness will be reinforced 7 setting up cqm range cqm can be set up anywhere that offers 25 meters of clear fire and either catch berm or line of fire into an impact area typical platoon lane includes seven target frames of six targets each which allows for platoon to fire on lane sandbags are used to separate frames and to delineate distances training is conducted using typee silhouettes mounted on frames of six each standard m16m4 25meter zero target is placed on the etype with the top of the paper even with the shoulders of the etype and center mass this allows confirmation of zero before cqm instruction then the silhouette on the zero target acts as the point of aim for cqm firing each shooter should dry fire practice each of the moves to develop muscle memory prior to firing although individuals will grasp the cqm concepts at different rates maximum time should be allotted for dry fire exercises sixty rounds dispersed among the ten firing positions should be considered the minimum for familiarization to cqm due to the short range the shooter should see his rounds strike near the bottom of the zero target this is rectified in the real world by aiming slightly higher to compensate however changing the point of aim during training is discouraged so that consistency can be achieved for official use only 97convoy leader trainingfigure app k1center for army lessons learned 98 for official use only4m 7m 10m 15m 20m
