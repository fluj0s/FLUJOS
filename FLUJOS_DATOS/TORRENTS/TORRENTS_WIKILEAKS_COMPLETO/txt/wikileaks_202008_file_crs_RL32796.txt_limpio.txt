africa as summit chair he focused the meeting held at gleneagles hotel in scotland july 68 on this initiative blair pushed for substantial aid increase for africa beginning in 2006 through an international finance facility iff and for 100 forgiveness of poor country debt to the international financial institutions the iff would have issued bonds to finance an additional 25 billion in annual aid to africa for three to five years followed by another 25 billion boost if african governments improved their managerial and administrative capabilities iff bonds would have been backed by promise from the g7 leading economic powers to repay them after 2015 poor country debts to the world bank and the african development bank would have been repaid by the g7 while debts to the international monetary fund imf would have been paid by revaluing or selling imf gold finally blair sought the removal of barriers to africas exports blair has long championed marshall plan for africa

further governance and freemarket economic reforms in africa on march 11 2005 highlevel commission for africa appointed by blair issued comprehensive report elaborating the initiative which won support from president chirac of france and germanys chancellor schroeder the bush administration reacted cooly to the proposed iff on grounds that it lacks means of assuring that new aid funds would be well spent officials also argued that the iff would unconstitutionally bind future congresses to appropriations iff supporters noted that the funds would be passed through existing aid agencies with their own monitoring mechanisms some also argued that the united states routinely agrees to repay debt in the future at gleneagles the iff proposal was dropped but the participants agreed on 25 billion increase in annual aid to africa by 2010 moreover the g8 ratified an agreement on debt forgiveness for 18 of the worlds poorest countries including 14 in africa the donors are to compensate the world bank and the african development bank for the lost repayments the imf will fund the loss from its own resources but not sell gold participants reiterated that they supported the removal of trade barriers but specific actions were taken many development experts welcomed the summits results as an important step forward but several nongovernmental organizations argued that the summit had done too little on trade or to mobilize new money previous g8 meetings have also focused on africa there has been much debate over whether g8 countries have fulfilled past promises and over whether

aid to africa including may 2005 promise by the european union countries to provide 7 of gdp as development aid by 2015 with an interim target of 56 by 2010 see below at least 50 of this additional aid would go to africa the communique noted that the united states has proposed to double aid to africa by 2010 as compared to 2004 through such initiatives as the millennium challenge account the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar and the fiveyear 660 million global peace operations initiative us officials are estimating 2004 bilateral and multilateral assistance to africa at 43 billion2 on june 30 2005 president bush had announced that he would seek 12 billion to fight malaria in africa over five years as well as additional aid for education and combating violence against women with respect to trade barriers that inhibit africas exports the g8 took specific action but affirmed that we are committed to substantially reducing trade distorting domestic support and substantially improving market access in addition the g8 stated that credible end date should be set for ending export subsidies and reiterated their commitment to dutyfree and quotafree access for products originating in the least developed countries according to the g8 the current round of world trade organization wto talks on reducing trade barriers should be concluded by the end of 2006 and the wto ministerial meeting in hong kong in december 2005 will be critical stepping stone toward that goal3 in addition the g8 promised africa and other developing countries additional help in building trade capacity and raising agricultural productivity the summit communique welcomed efforts by african institutions particularly the african union and the new partnership for africas development nepad see below to strengthen governance democracy and human rights the g8 promised to support to these institutions and other efforts to promote transparency in africa while pledging to

crs3 reactions britains prime minister tony blair who chaired the g8 summit did not win the endorsement he had sought for an international finance facility iff see below which would have channeled 25 billion in additional annual aid to africa beginning in 2006 nor did the g8 agree as blair had sought to specific reductions in trade barriers and or to date for ending all agricultural export subsidies nonetheless in his closing remarks blair cast the summits results in positive light arguing that in politics you do not achieve absolutely everything you want to achieve but nonetheless i believe we have made very substantial progress indeed4 blair called the summit turning point in the drive to end poverty in africa5 noting the promised additional aid for africa as well as the debt relief agreement on trade he acknowledged that some of us would have liked to have gone further but praised the g8 for renewing their commitments to reducing trade barriers and agreeing eventually to set date for ending export subsidies musician and development advocate bob geldof who had organized heavily attended worldwide live8 concerts on july 2 to pressure the g8 to do more to help africa had high praise for the summit on aid it is 10 out of 10 on debt it is 8 out of 106 geldof and his colleague bono gave credit to those who had attended the live8 concerts participated in demonstrations or otherwise sought to persuade the g8 to do more to help africa according to bono the world spoke out and the politicians listened7 jeffery sachs who heads columbia universitys earth institute as well as the united nations millennium project wrote that prime minister blair had nudged the world closer at gleneagles to the possibility of halving poverty by 2015 one of the principal millennium development goals see below8 sachs argued this was achieved despite footdragging by the united states and maintained that more than fourfifths of the aid increase promised at gleneagles would come from the european union in contrast the white house released fact sheet asserting that the united states had played lead role at the summit9 according to the fact sheet president bush with his g8 partners had launched an historic commitment to assist africa and the g8 had given its support to initiatives that advance us interests moreover the debt relief promise had been attained with leadership from president bush and prime minister blair while us leadership had also been key in g8 initiatives in other areas including increased assistance fighting malaria and promoting trade and investment 4 transcript of the prime ministers closing remarks july 8 2005 5 statement to parliament on the g8 summit july 11 2005 6 activists divided over g8 plans monitor uganda july 11 2005 7 g8

necessary to free people trapped in the prison of poverty important steps were taken steps that will bring hope to millions but more action is urgently needed10 christian aid an agency of churches in britain and ireland said that the promised additional aid to africa was not new money but recycled old announcements11 spokesman for actionaid another developmentadvocacy group said that what africa needed from the g8 was giant leap forward all it got was tiny steps12 many in the ngo community argued that the debt relief approved at the summit did not go far enough and that much larger group of countries should have been included background prime minister tony blair and his chancellor of the exchequer treasury gordon brown prior to the gleneagles summit launched major diplomatic effort aimed at marshaling the resources they see as needed to eradicate extreme poverty in subsaharan africa their objective is the realization in africa of the millennium development goals mdgs the goals were set at the 2000 millennium summit and consist of number of development targets to be attained by 2015 including universal primary education halving the proportion of people living on less than 1 per day and halving the proportion of people who suffer from hunger prime minister blair assumed the rotating presidency of the g8 group of nations in january 2005 and sought to use the july summit which he chaired to push his africa development initiative13 specifically blair and brown sought substantial aid increase for africa through the iff 100 forgiveness of african debt and the removal of barriers to african exports the blairbrown proposals may also be discussed in september when the general assembly holds plenary session attended by heads of state and government to consider progress

crs5 overview prime minister blair has championed marshall plan for subsaharan africa for several years in october 2001 addressing the challenges of post 911 world blair said that the state of africa is scar on the conscience of the world and called for new partnership with the region on our side provide more aid untied to trade write off debt help with good governance and infrastructure training to the soldiers with blessing in conflict resolution encouraging investment and access to our markets so that we practice the free trade we are so fond of preaching but its deal on the african side true democracy more excuses for dictatorship abuses of human rights tolerance of bad governance from the endemic corruption of some states to the activities of mr mugabes henchmen in zimbabwe proper commercial legal and financial systems14 in february 2004 blair appointed 17member commission for africa and asked it to undertake comprehensive assessment of africas development problems members included bob geldof prime minister meles zenawi of ethiopia president benjamin mkapa of tanzania former us senator nancy kassebaum baker and the british chancellor of the exchequer treasury gordon brown on march 11 2005 the commission issued 450page report15 that helped set the gleneagles agenda the report analyzes the reasons for africas poverty endorses the main elements of the blair initiative and makes recommendations on governance conflict prevention and peacekeeping education health and other issues blair and brown mounted public relations campaign aimed at winning support for their initiative at the january 2005 world economic forum in davos switzerland blair called for quantum leap in aid and trade to spur african development german chancellor gerhard schroeder and french president jacques chirac endorsed his efforts to help africa and chirac proposed small international tax on financial transactions or air travel to fund the initiative former president bill clinton bill gates and bono added their voices at davos in support of new efforts to end poverty in africa italy had earlier endorsed blairs plans some argued that the bush administration should endorse blairs initiative as well not only to help africa but also to reciprocate the strong support blair has given the administration in its policy toward iraq and in the war on terrorism16 others argued that the united states has competing priorities and compelling reason to sign on to the prime ministers initiative the administration distanced itself from 14 speech to the labour party meeting at brighton england october 2 2001 15 our common interest report of the commission for africa available at http21322514043englishreportintroductionhtml hereafter cited as our common interest 16 repaying tony blair new york times editorial february 13 2005 see also thousands died in africa yesterday new york times editorial february 27 2005 crs6 blairs proposal for the iff africa and put forward different approach to achieving further debt relief both the bush administration and the european union eu were already on record in favor of sharp reduction in trade barriers as blair urges but this proposal faces strong domestic opposition both in europe and the united states british proposals us responses chancellor brown is sometimes portrayed as political rival of blairs but he played key role in formulating blairs g8 initiative in january 2005 brown made several speeches on african development and undertook highprofile trip through the subsaharan region to highlight the principal british proposals international finance facility blair and brown initially proposed the creation of an international finance facility iff for africa funded at 50 billion annually for ten years this proposal was modified by the commission for africas report which called for twostage approach in view of africas limited ability to absorb new aid the report recommended 25 billion in additional annual aid over the next three to five years followed by review and move to 50 billion if there has been sufficient progress in improving the managerial and administrative capabilities of african governments17 the iff would not be new development bank or aid agency but mechanism for raising new resources for development the iff would sell bonds and disburse the proceeds to existing bilateral and multilateral aid agencies from 2006 through 2015 donors would commit themselves to repaying the bonds in the years after 2015 the commissions report describes this big push of predictable aid as moral duty for the g7 developed countries and as step that would serve their economic selfinterest by promoting an economic expansion in africa the report repeatedly stresses that africa must continue economic and governance reforms if the new aid is to be used effectively one source estimated the nearterm cost of us participation in the iff based on the commissions 25 billion initial target at 6 billion or per year18 over the long term however blair regards funding for the iff as dependent on progress by the g7 in reaching the goal of giving 7 of gdp in development aid for the united states to reach an interim level of 5 from the 2004 level of 16 would require about 40 billion in added aid annually brown and blair see their iff proposal as way of helping the g7 members frontload aid as they gradually move toward the 7 goal an objective first envisaged in 1970 general assembly resolution and endorsed at 2002 unconvened summit on financing for development at monterrey mexico after nearing or attaining the 7 goal the g7 would be in position to pay off the iff bonds after 2015 some see anything approaching the 7 goal for the united states as highly improbable at time when 17 our common interest p 53 18 mr bush and africa washington post june 7 2005 but see sebastian mallaby easy ways to aid africa washington post march 31 2005 crs7 the country faces budget deficit as well as major commitments in iraq and elsewhere others emphasize that blair envisaged the united states and others moving only incrementally toward 7 while deferring repayment of the iff bonds for decade on may 24 2005 european union foreign and development ministers pledged that their governments would reach the 7 aid level in 10 years with an interim target of 56 by 2010 when the europeans would be providing 25 billion in added annual aid some cautioned however that these pledges could be affected by budgetary constraints in some european countries us officials reacted cooly to the iff proposal and secretary of state condoleezza rice has stated flatly that we dont support the international financing facility because we dont think its costeffective way to deliver what is trying to be delivered here19 rice went on to suggest that the iff would lack mechanism to assure that the money was well spent supporters of the iff argued that since it would disburse funds through existing aid agencies such as the world bank and bilateral g7 aid organizations with their own mechanisms for oversight and evaluation accountability should not be problem the bank and the bilateral agencies have focused for many years on efforts to enhance the effectiveness of development aid by channeling it to good performers countries that are improving governance and implementing free market reforms such agencies would be highly attuned iff advocates maintained to assuring that the new funds were spent effectively rice and other officials cite the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar and the millennium challenge account mca as evidence that the united states is already increasing aid although by smaller amounts than blair and brown envisage pepfar aims at disbursing 15 billion for aids treatment prevention and care from fy2004 through fy2008 congress appropriated 292 billion for this program in fy2005 and 316 billion has been requested for fy2006 the mca was initially intended by president bush to add 5 billion annually to us foreign aid by fy2006 for countries that are wellgoverned investing in people and fostering free market economies however congress has appropriated less than requested for this program and the president has asked for 3 billion in fy2006 rather than the 5 billion initially expected many are dissatisfied with the mca because its governing body the millennium challenge corporation mcc has been slow to disburse funds20 its first compact for 110 million program in madagascar to promote domestic investment was announced on march 14 2005 the mcc has found that eight subsaharan countries including madagascar meet the criteria for receiving mca grants another increase in us foreign aid was agreed to in late february 2005 when the united states gave its support to three 19 testimony on the fiscal year 2006 foreign operations budget before the house committee on international relations february 17 2005 20 crs report rl32427 millennium challenge account implementation of new us foreign aid initiative by larry nowels crs8 year 25 boost in the resources of the world banks international development association ida which assists poor countries21 john taylor the us treasury under secretary for international affairs told february 2005 meeting of g7 finance ministers that the united states could not participate in the iff because guaranteeing bonds to be paid after 2015 as brown proposed would unconstitutionally bind future congresses to making appropriations22 some wonder however if means could be found to overcome this difficulty the united states regularly assumes debt to be paid in the future in the form of bonds moreover the united states regularly agrees to multiyear replenishments of the multilateral development banks congress makes annual appropriations for these replenishments and may not appropriate the full amount scheduled for given year nonetheless us support helps give the bank the creditworthiness it needs to borrow in the financial markets moreover the united states has assumed callable capital obligations to the hard loan windows of the world bank and other international financial institutions this capital can be called if the institutions find themselves in financial difficulties and some argue that if this should occur future congress would be obliged by past us promises to appropriate the funds president bush reiterated on june 1 2005 following meeting with south africas president thabo mbeki that the iff proposal does not fit our budgetary process and he maintained this stance in meetings with prime minister blair at the white house the following week at june 7 press conference with blair however the president announced an additional 6744 million in aid to africa in fy2005 to be drawn from food and disaster assistance funds as well as refugee aid already appropriated by congress 100 debt relief blairs commission for africa recommended full forgiveness of public debt owed by poor african countries noting that considerable progress has already been made in forgiving bilateral debt the report called for focus on multilateral debt owed principally to the world banks international development association ida and the african development banks african development fund ida and the fund make socalled soft loans to poor countries on highly concessional terms with extended repayment periods in addition blairs initiative sought forgiveness of africas debt to the international monetary fund imf africas debts to the multilateral development banks mdbs were estimated at 52 billion in 2002 while debt to the imf was 7 billion23 the developed countries should implement the proposed debt relief according to the blair commission by taking over the debt payments of the african countries which it calculates at about 2 billion per year 21 world bank donors agree to substantial increase in new money for poorest countriespress release february 22 2005 22

through the iff britain had already agreed to pay 10 which it regards as its fair share of the multilateral debt owed by 22 poor countries blair and brown meanwhile urged that debt to the imf be repaid either by revaluing or selling gold held by the imf the imf reports that it has 1034 million ounces of gold officially valued at 9 billion but worth 45 billion at current world prices24 us officials initially endorsed the concept of 100 debt forgiveness and pointed out that the united states has already forgiven poor country bilateral debts and supported the world bankimf enhanced heavily indebted poor countries hipc initiative for multilateral debt relief however officials maintained that the issue of revaluing imf gold needed further consideration25 and reportedly opposed the idea outright at the spring 2005 meetings of the imf and world bank held in washington in april26 some experts in the gold market had been concerned that any major imf gold sale could sharply lower the price of gold with potentially destabilizing consequences for the gold reserves held by many countries others argued that any sales could be small and made over long period of time to minimize this risk with respect to debt owed by poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank us officials favored simple cancellation not funded by any repayments made by the g7 or any new contributions by the g7 to the mdbs27 after the writeoff in the us view the banks would make grants rather than loans to poor countries so that they do not accumulate new debt28 many were concerned that the us approach would deplete the banks capital and reduce their capacity for alleviating poverty since they would longer be owed debts by poor countries or receiving repayments from them supporters of the us approach argued that it need not threaten the banks since the g7 could provide new replenishments as required usbritish differences on debt relief were resolved by an agreement reached at june 1011 2005 meeting in london of g8 finance ministers which was ratified at the july summit under this agreement 40 billion in debt owed by 18 countries that have reached the completion point in the hipc process will be written off and the donors will contribute additional funds to the world bank and the african development bank to make up for the loss the imf will absorb the loss from its own resources and will not sell gold fourteen of the 18 countries are in subsaharan africa29 as result of reaching the hipc completion point they had already had 24 gold in the imf factsheet

in return for economic reforms and the adoption of an approved strategy for reducing poverty nine more african countries are in the hipc process and may soon reach the completion point the june 2005 agreement covered an estimated 40 billion in debt but its overall cost was estimated at 167 billion the amount expected to be paid to the mdbs and the imf through 2015 the united states reportedly agreed to pay between 128 billion and 175 billion per year as its share of donor compensation to the world bank and the imf the agreement drew wide praise as step forward in easing africas debt burden particularly because the g8 promised that the compensation paid to the mdbs would be in addition to the assistance they were already planning to provide africa however some were concerned that this commitment would be difficult to monitor and some also argued that an agreement on the iff at the london meeting would have been of far greater benefit to africa the agreement did not cover nigerias vast debt of 30 billion or more which is primarily owed to bilateral lenders rather than the mdbs30 nigeria is not ranked among the worlds poorest countries due to its oil wealth but the g8 finance ministers agreed that nigeria is key to the prosperity of the whole continent of africa and promised to find fair and sustainable solution to nigerias debt problems in 200531 as noted above an agreement on debt relief for nigeria was reached on june 30 2005 removing trade barriers chancellor brown advocates ending the hypocrisy of developed country protectionism by removing tradedistorting subsidies and other barriers to trade32 critics of the g7 are adamant that they have done far too little to open their markets to african exports of cotton sugar and other commodities and they blame the g7 for the failure of the 2003 cancun world trade organization wto summit to agree on the removal of us and european agricultural subsidies the blair commission recommends an immediate end to tradedistorting support programs for cotton and sugar an end to all tradedistorting agricultural support by 2010 and the progressive reduction of all tariffs to zero by 2015 in july 2004 both the united states and the european countries agreed with other wto members on framework for discussions on reducing subsidies and other barriers33 the framework opened the way to negotiations now ongoing

back farm subsidies in his fiscal 2006 budget proposal in exchange for reduced subsidies us negotiators are seeking greater access for us manufactured goods and services in developing countries whether these developments will lead to the reduction in trade barriers that blair and brown are seeking remains to be seen but as noted above the gleneagles summit did not take action on specific reductions some developing countries may not be willing to make the concessions on market access sought by the united states leading to breakdown in the wto negotiations moreover reductions in subsidies and other barriers will encounter political opposition in both the united states and europe where many see them as an important guarantor of jobs and protection against price and supply fluctuations some credit the united states with moving further than britain and other countries on removing trade barriers to date through the us african growth and opportunity act agoa program begun in 2000 agoa gives dutyfree access to the united states for wide range of products from 37 subsaharan countries including 24 permitted to export textiles and apparel items35 moreover the bush administration is negotiating free trade agreement with the five countries of the southern african customs union and has expressed an interest in other african free trade agreements as well at the same time 78 developing countries in africa the caribbean and the pacific acp enjoy preferential access to european markets through the european unionacp partnership while south africa has its own trade agreement with the eu some analysts are concerned that across the board reductions in developed country trade barriers will strengthen africas competitors in china and elsewhere reducing the value of such special arrangements as agoa and the acp partnership is marshall plan merited prime minister blairs initiatives on africa reflect widespread concerns over africas failure to develop despite rich endowment of resources36 these include extensive deposits of petroleum diamonds and metals wide areas of rich agricultural lands and the potential for tourism lying in africas beaches game reserves and ancient cultures yet average gdp per capita in the subsaharan region stood at 585 in 2003 according to the world bank barely above the 1963 figure of 509 measured in constant dollars

goals without massive infusion of aid 48 billion in 2006 rising to 74 billion in new aid by 201538 vast scholarly literature exists on the reasons for africas failure to develop many blame factors over which african and africans have little control such as tropical environment that imposes heavy disease burden and leads to rapid depletion of soils africas population has tended to concentrate inland where higher altitudes make for healthier climate but this means many countries lack large concentrations of people in port cities where exportbased industry could readily locate the long era of the slave trade ending only in 1870 took away millions in their most productive years just as the aids epidemic does today while the colonial era left legacy of authoritarian government and region divided into 48 countries many of them small andor landlocked other scholars tend to blame african governments for the difficulties the continent faces corruption poor quality of governance and economic policies that discourage free markets have come in for particular criticism wide range of countries have freed up markets in varying degrees and undertaken governance reforms since the late 1980s under pressure from the world bank the imf and bilateral donors but corruption remains problem kenya for example had been the source of much optimism for africas future after free and fair elections were held in december 2002 but recently both the us and british ambassadors have criticized the government of president mwai kibaki for failing to tackle corruption the united states has suspended an anticorruption assistance program in kenya in response to the problem39 some also feel that african leaders have done too little on regional basis to deal with the continents problems in 2001 african leaders launched the new partnership for africas development nepad intended to improve governance strengthen institutional capacity and reduce corruption40 nepad includes an african peer

official observers from south africa and the southern african development community in short number of observers feel that too many african governments are failing to live up to their end of the deal proposed by prime minister blair in october 2001 they point out that africa has received substantial amounts of assistance over the years with official development assistance reaching nearly 24 billion in 2003 see below from their perspective the principal responsibility for africas development now lies with africas leaders who must assure that their countries enter the ranks of the good performers millennium project head jeffrey sachs takes somewhat different view though strong supporter of sound economic policies in africa he believes the continent is caught in poverty trap so poor that few want to invest even in countries where real attempts at reform are being made the millennium project report which he directed argues that many countries in africa are well governed considering the extent of their poverty and would benefit from big push in foreign assistance to strengthen education health care infrastructure and other sectors this rapid scaleup in his view would create viable economies attractive to investors and help africa escape the poverty trap proponents of third view acknowledge that committing large new amounts of aid to africa is risky given the continents many difficulties but maintain that the risk is worth taking since in their view the amounts of aid being proposed by blair brown and sachs could readily be afforded by the g7 countries working together in return some argue the g7 might gain new markets assure access to africas oil and other resources over the long term and create an environment in which violence and terrorism are less likely to emerge africa at previous g8 meetings g8 meetings in the 1990s often dealt with many of the same themes expected to be raised at gleneagles the g8 first emphasized in those years that subsaharan africa faces special development challenges and summit communiques acknowledged that substantial development assistance was needed to help sub saharan africa grow41 debt relief for the poorest countries was another major theme the 1994 naples summit encouraged wider cancellation of bilateral debt and the 1996 summit at lyons helped launch the heavily indebted poor countries initiative hipc to reduce poor country debt owed to the world bank and imf at cologne in 1999 the g8 agreed on an expanded hipc program that would offer deeper broader and faster debt relief toward the end of the 1990s g8 meetings also began to reflect the view that the least developed countries needed expanded access to developed country markets beginning with the 1997 denver summit the g8 repeatedly called for expanded efforts to combat hivaids and other infectious diseases afflicting africa as well as other impoverished regions also at denver the g8 expressed their support for longterm efforts to promote rapidly deployable 41 communiques of the 1997 denver summit june 22 1997 and of the 1998 birmingham uk summit may 17 1998 crs14 african peacekeeping capacities while pledging support for africa in these areas the g8 have consistently emphasized the other half of the blair deal for example at lyons in 1996 the g8 stated that the developing countries have fundamental responsibility for promoting their own development this means conducting sound and consistent economic and social policies promoting political and legal environment conducive to the development of the private sector and encouraging domestic and foreign investment42 the genoa and kananaskis canada meetings in 2001 and 2002 saw an intensification of the focus on africa three subsaharan presidents were invited to genoa to report on new african efforts to promote development and african leaders have attended each subsequent g8 meeting presidents thabo mbeki of south africa olusegun obasanjo of nigeria and abdoulaye wade wahd of senegal were present at kananaskis as the g8 issued its africa action plan promising new africa partnership under the plan support was offered in several priority areas promoting peace and security strengthening institutions and governance fostering trade investment growth and sustainable development implementing debt relief improving health and confronting hivaids increasing agricultural productivity and improving water resource management this support was to be closely linked to progress in africa in implementing nepad objectives with respect to improving governance strengthening institutional capacity and reducing corruption mbeki obasanjo and wade are regarded as the principal authors of nepad prior to the gleneagles meeting kananaskis represented the high water mark of g8 attention to africa however at the 2003 summit in evian france the g8 affirmed their commitment to the hipc initiative and announced g8 action plan against famine especially in africa in june 2004 the ushosted summit at sea island georgia issued number of statements related to africas needs including commitments to stopping polio forever and combating corruption in nigeria as well as action plans on science and technology for sustainable development and on ending the cycle of famine in the horn of africa another action plan reaffirmed at gleneagles called for training and where appropriate equipping 75000 peace support troops worldwide by 2010 with sustained focus on africa prime minister blair reportedly advanced proposal at sea island for 100 debt forgiveness for the worlds poorest countries but agreement was reached whether g8 summits have responded adequately to africas needs has been the subject of lively debate many feel that the g8 have not done nearly enough after the 2003 evian meeting for example omar kabbaj president of the african development bank wrote that there had been some good initiatives with respect to aid but subsaharan africa required 50 billion per year to achieve sustainable broadbased growth43 jeffrey sachs has argued repeatedly for vastly expanded developed country aid program for africa most recently in the millennium project report noted above after the sea island summit the jubilee usa network and the 42 economic communique june 28 1996 43 viewpoint africa needs level playing field the banker july 1 2003 crs15 50 years is enough network leading advocates of debt relief expressed their outrage that the g8 had not acted on 100 debt cancellation for the poorest countries44 many have questioned the g8 commitment to peace and security criticizing as inadequate for example the response of the developed countries to the conflict and human rights crisis in sudans darfur region in may 2004 on the eve of the sea island summit the new yorkbased council on foreign relations issued report that took something of middle ground on g8 performance the report pointed out that the g8 donors had indeed launched or expanded initiatives in key priority areas of the kananaskis africa action plan45 with respect to strengthening institutions and governance the report noted that united states has undertaken an africa anticorruption initiative to combat both public and private corruption while canada is using part of its fund for africa to promote publicservice reform and decentralization the council singled out the us agoa program as an important effort by g8 member to boost african trade and investment moreover the report noted that developed country aid to africa is increasing according to data released subsequently by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd official development assistance oda to subsaharan africa is indeed growing reaching 237 billion in 2003 up from 184 billion in 2002 and 138 billion in 2001 us assistance to the region would reach 39 billion under the fy2006 budget request not including indirect assistance channeled through the world bank and agencies or disaster assistance likely to be provided as emergencies arise aid in fy2002 was 25 billion46 the council on foreign relations praised the hipc initiative and noted that peace and security are being promoted through us british canadian and other efforts to support peacekeeping and train peacekeepers in keeping with the sea island decisions the bush administrations fy2006 budget request seeks funds to begin new global peace operations initiative to train foreign peacekeeping troops with an emphasis on africa47 at the same time the councils report
