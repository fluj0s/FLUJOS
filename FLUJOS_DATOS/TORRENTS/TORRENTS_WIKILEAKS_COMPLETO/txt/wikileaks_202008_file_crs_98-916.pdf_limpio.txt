cold war many have proposed significant changes in the size composition and purpose of the program seve ral of which have been adopted the focus of us foreign aid policy has also been transformed since the terrorist attacks of sept 11 2001 this report provides an ove rview of the us foreign aid program by addressing number of the more frequen tly asked questions regarding the subject there are five major categories of foreign assistance bilateral development aid economic assistance supporting us political and security goals humanitarian aid multilateral ec onomic contributions and military aid due largely to the implementation two new foreign aid initiatives the millennium challenge corporation and the global aids initiative bilateral development assistance has become the largest category of us aid in 2005 the united states is providing so form of foreign assistance to about 150 countries israel and egypt continue as they have since the late 1970s as the largest recipients although iraq receiving over 20 billion for r econstruction activities since mid2003 was the biggest recipient in fy2004 the importance of latin america counternarcotics efforts is so evident with bolivia peru and more recently colombia among the top us aid recipients the impact of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and the subseque nt use of foreign aid to support the war on terrorism is clearly seen in th estimated countryaid levels for fy2005 afghanistan pakistan turkey jordan and indonesia are key partners in the war on terrorism some countries that are the focus of the fiveyear 15 billion hivaids initiative are also among the leading recipients by nearly all measures the amount of foreign aid provided by the united states declined for several decades but has grown in the past few years after hitting an all time low in the mid1990s total foreign assist ance but excluding iraq reconstruction for fy20032005 in real terms has been larg er than any threeyear period since the early 1990s the 016 of us gross nati onal product represente d by foreign aid obligations for fy2005 however is among the smallest amounts in the last halfcentury the united states is the largest international economic aid donor in dollar terms but is the smallest contri butor among the major donor governments when calculated as percent of gross national income the us agency for international velopment usaid manages the bulk of bilateral economic assistance the treasury department handles most multilateral aid and the department of defense dod nd the state department administer military and other securityrelated programs the millennium challenge corporation is new foreign aid agency created in 2004 the house international relations and senate foreign relations committees have primary congress ional responsibility for authorizing foreign aid programs while th house and senate ppropriations foreign operations subcommittees manage bills ppropriating most foreign assistance

trade policy american defense capabilities even if not employed stand as potential stick that can be wiel ded to obtain specific objectives the state department diplomatic corps are the eyes ears and often the negotiating voice of us foreign policymakers public diplomacy pr ograms such as exchanges like the fulbright program and radio free europe project an imag of the united states that may influence foreign views positively us trade policy through free trade agreements and export import bank credits for example are viewed as carrots by participating nations that affect the presence of us business in those countri foreign aid is probably the most flexible tool it can act as both carrot and stick and is means of influencing events solving specific problems and projecting us valuesforeign aid an introductory overview of us programs and policy us foreign aid is fundamental com ponent of the intern ational affairs budget and is viewed by many as an essen tial instrument of us foreign policy1 each year it is the subject of extensive congressional debate and legislative initiatives since the end of the cold war many have pr oposed significant changes in the size composition and purpose of the program seve ral of which have been adopted the focus of us foreign aid policy has also been transformed since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 this report generally using question andanswer format addresses number of the more frequently asked queries rega rding the us foreign aid program its objectives costs organization the role of congress and how it compares to those of other aid donors in particular the discussion attempts to not only present current snapshot of american foreign assistance but also to illustrate the extent to which this instrument of us foreign policy has changed from past practices especially since the end of the cold wa r and during the period following september 11 2001 data presented in the report are the most current reliable figures available usually covering the period through fy2004 or where possible estimates for fy2005 dollar amounts are drawn from vari ety of sources including the office of management and budget omb us agency for international development usaid and from annual foreign operations and other appropriations acts as new data become obtainable or additional issues and questions arise the report will be modified and revisedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98916crs2 foreign aid goals and programs what are the goals and ob jectives of us foreign assistance foreign assistance supports great many objectives especially since the september 11 terrorist attacks in the unite d states foreign aid has taken on more strategic sense of importance cast frequently in terms of contributing to the global war on terrorism in september 2002 presid ent bush released his administrations national security strategy that established global development for the first time as the third pillar of us national security along with defense and diplomacy also in 2002 executive branch foreign assist ance budget justifications began to underscore the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority highlighting amounts of us assistance to about 30 frontline stat in the terrorism war the substantial reconstruction programs in afghanistan and iraq wh ich totaled more in fy2004 than the combined budgets of all other aid programs are also part of the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism at roughly the same time that fighting terrorism became the leading concern of american foreign aid the bush admin istration announced other significant initiatives that have defined and strengthened two additional key foreign assistance goals promoting economic growth and re ducing poverty and combating the global hivaids pandemic the millennium challenge corporation mcc is new aid delivery concept established in early 2004 that is intended to concentrate significantly higher amounts of us res ources in few low and lowmiddle income countries that have dem onstrated strong commitment to political economic and social reforms if fully funded 5 b illion will be available by fy2006 to support these best development performers in order to accelerate economic growth and lower the number of people living in absolute poverty addressing global health pr oblems has further become core us aid objective in recent years congress created sepa rate appropriation account for child survival and health activities in the mid1990s nd increased funding for international hivaids and other infecti ous disease programs president bushs announcement at his 2003 state of the union message of fiveyear 15 billion effort to combat aids malaria and tuberculos is has added greater emphasis to this primary foreign assistance objective beyond these recently emerging foreign aid goals other prominent objectives that have continued since the early 1990s have included supporting peace in the middle east through assistance to israel egypt jordan and the palestinians fostering democratization and stability for c ountries in crisis such as bosnia haiti rwanda kosovo and liberi facilitating democra tization and free market economies in central europe nd the former soviet union suppressing international narcotics production and trafficking thr ough assistance to colombia and other andean drugproducin g countries nd alleviating famine and mitigating refugee situations in places throughout the world including tsunami victims in asia and east africahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98916crs3 2 us agency for international development us foreign aid meeting the challenges of the twentyfirst century january 2004arguably from the end of world war ii until the early 1990s the underlying rationale for providing foreign aid was the sa as that for all us foreign policy the defeat of communism us aid prog rams were designed to promote economic development and policy reforms in large part to create stability and reduce the attraction to communist ideology and to block soviet diplomatic links and military advances the programs also supported ot her us policy goals such as reducing high rates of population growth prom oting wider access to health care and expanding the availability of basic education in the developing world advancing us trade interests and protectin g the environment if thes secondary goals were also achieved us aid programs could be prom oted as delivering more bang for the buck with the end of the cold war consensus emerged over what should be the new overarching rationale for us aid programs consequen tly many of these secondary objectives of foreign assistance are more vulnerable to challenge some may ultimately be discarded while others are being incorporated into new initiatives representing some of the emerging foreign aid priorities noted above the clinton administration emphasized the promotion of sustainable development as the new postcold war main strategy of those parts of the foreign aid program under the aegis of the us agency for international development usaid economic assistance supported six interrelated goal s achievement of broadbased economic growth development of democratic systems stabilization of world population and protection of human health sustainable management of the environment building human capacity throug h education and trai ning and meeting humanitarian needs early in the bush administration thes goals were modified around three strategic pillarsof 1 economic growth ag riculture and trade 2 global health and 3 democracy conflict prevention and human itarian assistance more recently usaid white paper on american foreign ai d identified five core operational goals of us foreign assistance promoting transformational development especially in the areas of governance institutional capacity and economic restructuring strengthening fragile states providing humanitarian assistance supporting us geostrategic interest s particularly in countries such as iraq afghanistan pakistan jordan egypt and israel and mitigating global and international ills including hivaids2 generally speaking differe nt types of foreign aid support different objectives focusing on any single element of the ai d program would produce different sense of the priority of any particular us objec tive but there is also considerable overlap between categories of aid multilateral aid serves many of the same objectives as bilateral development assistance although through diffe rent channels international financial institutions have become the predominant players in central europe and the former soviet union serving us economic and security objectives in those regionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98916crs4 both military assistance and economic security assistance serve us objectives in the middle east and south asia drug interdiction activities backed in some cases with military assistance and alternative development programs are integrated elements of american counternarcotics efforts in the andean region and elsewhere iraq reconstruction funding the us assistance program to iraq the largest aid initiative since the 19481951 marshall plan supports the longterm re construction requirements of the country following the march 2003 us invasion and ov erthrow of the regime of saddam hussein funds have been mostly directed at improv ing the security capabilitie s of the iraqi police and armed forces at making rapid improvemen ts in infrastructure including electricity oil water and sewage and telecommunications and promoting democratization efforts to date two emergency supplemental appr opriations have provided funds for these purposes pl 10811 for fy2003 and pl 108106 for fy2004 the bulk of iraq assistance nearly 21 billion of the 237 billion that is expected to support the program is held in an iraq relief and reconstruction fund controlled by the office of the president and delegated to other executive branch agencies because of the size of the iraq reconstr uction effort including funding figures in fy2003 and fy2004 totals tends to overshadow and obscure key trends in changing foreign aid budget and policy priorities theref ore unless otherwise noted in the text and figures funding amounts noted in this report exclude figures for iraq reconstruction in many instances however notation is made stating what particular amount would equal if iraq assistance was included what are the different types of foreign aid although there are many ways to group fo reign aid by types of assistance this report organizes programs into five major categories illustrated in figure 1 below bilateral development assistance development assistance programs are designed chiefly to foster sustainabl broadbased economic progress and social stability in developing countries for fy2005 congress ppropriated 735 billion in such assistance an am ount accounting for nearly 35 of total foreign aid appropriations most of these funds are managed by the us agency for international development usaid and are used for longterm projects in the areas of economic reform and private sector development democracy promotion environmental protection population and human healt h development activities gaining more prominence in recent years have been debt relief for the poorest nations mostly in africa and support for tr eatment of hivaids and other diseases see question on sectoral priorities below other bilateral development assistance goes to distinct institutions such as the peace corps the interamerican development f oundati on the african development foundation the trade and development agency and the new millenni um challenge corpor ation the latter is expected to provide significant levels of assistance to countries that meet specific standards of good governance nd free market economic reform httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98916crs5 figure 1 aid program composition fy2005 economic aid supporting us political and security objectives in fy2005 congress appropria ted 462 billion 22 of total assistance for five major programs whose primary purpose is to meet special us economic political or security interests the bulk of th funds 25 billion are provided through the economic support fund

the middle east peace process since 911 much esf has targeted countries of importance in the war on terrorism esf funds can be used for development projects about 57 of the total in fy2004 or in other ways such as cash transfer s to help countries stabilize their economies and service foreign debt about 43 in fy2004 with the demise of the soviet empire th united states established two new aid programs which met pa rticular strategic political inte rests the seed support for east european democracy act of 1989 and the freedom support act freedom for russia and emerging eurasian demo cracies

fy2005 seed countries are allocated 393 million while the nis receives 556 million in appropriated funds several other global issues that are considered threats to us security and wellbeing terrorism narco tics crime and weapons pro liferation have received special attention from the foreign assistance program especially since the war onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98916crs6 3 because of the unanticipated nature of ma ny disasters humanitarian aid budget allocations often increase throughout the year as demands arise figures listed here are those appropriated as of january 19 2005 the admi nistration is discussing with congress possible disaster relief supplemental for tsunami victims 4 because of the demands placed on emer gency food aid resources in early fy 2005 the

export focus it is longer considered foreign aid title i is administered by the agriculture departmentterror began each of these programs provide range of law enforcement activities training and

268 billion 126 of assistance for prog rams of humanitarian aid3 unlike development assistance programs which are often viewed as longterm efforts that may have the effect of preventing future crises from deve loping three programs are devoted largely to the immediate alleviation of humanitarian emergencies the bulk of humanitarian assistance goes to the refugee program administered by the state department it supports with about 819 million in fy2005 number of refugee relief organizations including the high commission for refugees and the international committee of the red cross the offices of foreign disaster assistance ofda and transition initiatives oti in usaid provide relief rehabilitation and rec onstruction assistance to vic tims of manmade and natural disasters activities to

banks mdbs such as the world bank on average us contributions represent about 20 of total donor transfers to the mdbs military assistance the united states provides military assistance to us friends and allies to help them acquire us military equipment and training congress appropriated 5 b illion for military assistance in fy2005 236 of total us foreign aid there are three main programs foreign military financing fmf 475 billion in fy2005 is grant program that enables governments to receive equipment from the us government or to access equipment directly through us commercial channels like esf most fmf grants support the security needs of israel and egypt the international military education and training program imet 89 million offers military training on grant basis to foreign military officers and personnel peacekeeping funds 178 million in fy2004 are used to support voluntary nonun operations and tr aining for an afri can crisis response force as figure 2 indicates there have been some gradual shifts in program emphasis during the past 15 years military assistance as share of total aid obligations continued declining through fy2005 trend that began after military aid peaked in fy1984 at 42 in fy199697 it rebounded fro m 248 to about 30 share not because military assistance grew in absolute terms but because other categories of foreign aid fell significantly while military grants especially for israel and egypt remained constant the proportion of aid represented by military programs declined further in fy1999 to roughly 23 mainly due to the graduation of greece and turkey as military aid recipients military assistance rose again in fy2000 to 30 largely because of onetime middle east peace supplemental for israel and jordan after falling back to about onefourth of total us foreign aid military assistance jumped to over 28 in fy2003 as the unite d states provided additional security support to many of the frontline states in the war on terrorism and other countries that might faces new external threats due to the pending conflict in iraq for fy2004 and fy2005 its share fell to an average of 234 the lowest proportion of the period largely due to the rise in promin ence of the developmen t assistance category economic strategic and political aid has remained fairly stable over the past 15 years spiking in fy1993 with the growth of programs in the former soviet union funding for middle east peace supplem ental the andean counternarcotics initiative and economic support for countries assisting us efforts in the war on terrorism pushed strategicoriented economic aid above 30 share between fy2000 and fy2003 the proportion of foreig n aid appropriated for this grouping dropped to 26 and 22 in fy2004 and fy 2005 respectively reflecting somewhat the impact of continuing tenyear plan to reduce economic aid to israel and egypt and except in the case of afghanistan less robust aid for frontline states in the war on terrorism perhaps the most striking trend in this period has been the growth in developmentrelated assist ance including humanitaria n food aid and contributions to multilateral institutions developmentrelated aid rose steadily from 38 sharehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98916crs8 figure 2 shifts in program emphasis 19902005in fy1990 to nearly 49 by fy1994 the growth of more politicallydriven economic programs in central europe and the former sovi et union plus sizable cuts to development aid in fy19961997 and incr eased emphasis on security assistance following the september 11 terrorist attack s drove the share of its allocation down to an average of 42 during the late 1990s through fy2003 with the approval of significant amounts of funding for two new presidential ai d priorities the millennium challenge corporation and the global aids initiative development assistance grew to represent over half of total foreign aid in fy2004 and fy2005 the highest levels during the past 15 years what are the funding priorities of bilateral economic assistance the largest component of us fore ign aid finances bilateral economic assistance programs managed directly by usaid or in some cases jointly by usaid and the state department this cluster of assistance roughly matches the combined two categories of bilateral development aid and economic politicalsecurity programs illustrated in figure 1 above that are managed by usaid nd the department ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98916crs9 6 this grouping excludes however counternarcotics antiterrorism the millennium challenge corporation other nonusaidnon state department programs and agency administrative costs included in th totals for the two categories in figure 1 in sense the category of aid discussed in this section repr esents what might be called core bilateral economic assistance programs managed by the major us foreign aid agencies 7 it is important to note that the amount of resources allocated to any single development sector is not necessarily good measure of the priority assigned to that sector different types of development activities require varying amounts of funding to have impact and achieve the desired goals democracy and governance programs for example are generally lowcost interventions that include extensive tr aining sessions for government officials the media and other elements of civil society economic growth programs on the other hand might include infrastructure development government budget support or commodity import financing activities that require significantly higher resources what may be better indicator of changing sector priorities is to compare funding allocations over time to the same sector trends that are illustrated in table 1 8 sector allocations for fy2005 appropr iations remain under discussion with announcements due most likely in february 2005 the total us government commitment to international hivaids programs is somewhat larger when the budgets for domestic nonforeign aid agencies are included fo r example the amount for fy2005 is estimated to be 29 billion when the budgets of the departments of health and human services and labor are included rather than 23 billion dr awn exclusively from state department and usaid fundingstate6 congress appropriates funds for these activities in seven accounts included in annual foreign operati ons appropriation measures development assistance da child survival and health csh the global aids initiative gai the economic support fund esf assistance for eastern europe and the baltic states assistance for the independent states of the former s oviet union and alternative development programs implemented through the andean counternarcotics initiative aci collectively these programs total 81 billion or r oughly 38 of total fy2005 foreign aid appropriations as noted above usaid organizes bila teral economic assistance around three functional strategic pillars allocating resources to each of 14 more specific program sectors within the three pillars changes in the amount of funds distributed to each of these sectors is one means of measuring the relative priority placed by the executive branch on any of th specific bilateral aid ac tivities because congress closely examines the executives sector distribution of bilateral economic resources and in number of cases modifies the presidents proposed budget plan sector funding trends also charact erize congressional aid prio rities and areas of special concern7 global health one of the most striking changes in the distribution of economic aid resources in recent years has been the sharp growth in funding for global health especially in the area of hivaids programs the budget for global health in fy2005 will likely be more than double the amount in fy2001 while hivaids resources will have in creased by about sevenfold8 in fy2004 the bush administration launched fiveyear 15 b illion global aids initiative with the goals of 7 million new infec tions treating 2 million hivinfected individuals and caring for 10 million infected people and aids orphanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98916crs10 funding for two other health sectors ar rising but far more modestly than hivaids programs child survival and maternal health projects aim to reduce infant mortality by among other interventions decreasing the incidence of acute respiratory infections diarrheal disease measles and other illnesses that occur in the first 28 days of life and combating malnut rition and to improve the quality of child delivery facilities and ra ise nutritional levels of mother s funding for these activities has grown by 27 in the past four years congress has placed special attention on other infectious disease activities mainly those addressing

compositionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98916crs11 of these special concerns may change from yeartoyear but do not necessarily fit into any of the categories under the pillar of economic growth agriculture and trade includes funds for usaid programs the state departments global aids initiative office and the us contribution to the global fund to fight hivaids tuberculosis and malaria does not include funds provided by the centers for disease control the national institutes for health and other non foreign aid agencies this rapid rise in global health genera lly driven largely by hivaids funding increases however overshadows to some extent reductions for other sectors spending on family planning and reproductive health prog rams has been relatively flat during the past five years with the fy2005 level of 441 million slightly below that of fy2001 vulnerable children progra ms meaning those that focus on children affected by war street children and childre n with disabilities ve also

israel for pr ocurement within that country food assistance commodities are purchased wholly in the united states and most expenditures for shipping those commod ities to recipient countries go entirely to us freight companies under current legislation threef ourths of all food aid must be shipped by us carriers on this basis rough estimate suggests that more than 90 at least 1 billion in fy2004 of food aid expenditures were spent in the united states because us contributions to multilateral institutions are mixed with funds from other nations and the bulk of the pr ogram is financed with borrowed funds rather than direct government contributi ons the us share of procurement financed by mdbs may exceed the amount of the u s contribution for example the 188 billion in world bank
