termination insurance program for defined benefit pension plans defined benefit plans are those where participants are promised specified future benefit which traditionally is an annuity beginning at retirement various types of pension plans are not covered by the insurance program including defined contribution plans indi vidual account plans government plans and church plans1 the insurance program distinguishes between singleemployer plans and multiemployer plans ie collectively bargained plans to which more than one company makes contributions this report discusses only the termination of singleemployer plans the insurance program is administered by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc the pbgc has two primary responsibilities first it oversees plan terminations which is the focus of this report second the pbgc pays the gu aranteed benefits of terminated plans subject to statutory limitations for more information on the pbgc and its payment of benefits see crs report

benefit liabilities2 the plan administrator initiates the termination by giving written notice to each affected party3 of the intent to terminate the plan between 60 and 90 days in advance of the proposed termination date4 he or she must then report information about the plan to the pbgc including certification by an enrolled actuary that the plans assets are sufficient to meet all benefit liabilities5 the plan administrator is also responsible for informing the plan participants and beneficiaries of the benefits due them including the data and underlying actuarial assumptions used to compute the benefits6 the pbgcs involvement in standard termination is minimal and its role is basically to confirm that the above requirements have been met upon receiving the plan information the pbgc generally has 60 days to review it and either approve the termination or send out notice of noncompliance 7 if the pbgc determines the requirements have been met the termination proceeds the plan administrator then distributes the plans assets to participants and beneficiaries 1 erisa 4021b 29 usc 1321b 2 erisa 4041b 29 usc 1341b 3 affected parties include plan participants beneficiaries of

the plan administrators final action is to certify to the pbgc that the assets have been distributed10 and the plan is terminated

cover all the benefits owed to plan participants and beneficiaries11 the plan may be terminated only if its contributing sponsor or member of the sponsors controlled group12 has 1 filed petition for liquidation or reorganization in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or 2 demonstrated that termination is required to enable payment of debts while staying in business or to avoid unreasonably burdensome pension costs caused by declining workforce the plan administrator initiates distress termination by giving written notice to each affected party between 60 and 90 days in advance of the proposed termination date 13 he or she then must file distress termination notice with the pbgc14 the notice includes information required by the pbgc to determine whether the plan meets the criteria for distress termination and certification by an enrolled actuary detailing the value of the plan assets and benefit liabilities based on this information the pbgc determines wh ether the distress termination criteria are met and must notify the plan administrator as soon as practicable regarding its determination 15 if the distress criteria have not been met the plan continues to operate if the criteria are met the next step is for the pbgc to determine whether the plans assets are sufficient to pay the benefits guaranteed by the pbgc andor meet all benefit liabilities these amounts may be different because as mentioned the benefits guaranteed by the pbgc under the plan insurance termination program are subject to statutory limitations therefore the benefit liabilities owed under the plan may exceed the benefits guaranteed by the pbgc if the plans assets are not sufficient to pay the guaranteed benefits the pbgc must commence involuntary termination proceedings discussed below 16 otherwise the distress termination generally continues with the plan administrator distributing the plans assets to participants and beneficiaries by purchasing annuities from commercial insurer or by other permissible means 17 if the plan administrator discovers during the distribution that the plans assets are not sufficient to cover benefits he or she must notify the 8 erisa 4041b3 29 usc 1341b3

terminated19 the pbgc must initiate termination proceedings once it determines plan does not have assets available to pay benefits currently due the pbgc may seek to terminate plan if the plan has not met the minimum funding requirements or the plan has been notified by the treasury secretary that notice of deficiency concerning the initial tax on funding deficiency has been mailed the plan will not be able to pay benefits when due lumpsum payment of at least 10000 has been made to participant who is substantial owner of the sponsoring company and immediately after the distribution the plan has unfunded nonforfeitable benefits or the longrun loss to the pbgc may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated trustee who may be the pbgc may be appointed to administer the plan until it is ordered to be terminated 20 the trustee may be appointed by us district court upon petition by the pbgc or plan administrator or the pbgc and plan admi nistrator may agree to the appointment without court involvement once appointed the trustee is responsible for the plans administration including management of the plans assets 21 after the pbgc has given notice to the plan admini strator the plan may be terminated in one of two ways first the pbgc may file petition with the us district court for ruling that the plan must be terminated to protect the participants interests to avoid an unreasonable deterioration of the plans financial condition or to avoid an unreasonable increase in the pbgcs liability22 if trustee has been appointed he or she may intervene in the proceeding the pbgc may file the petition regardless of whether there is pending proceeding 1 involving bankruptcy mortgage foreclosure or equity receivership 2 to reorganize conserve or liquidate the plan or its property or 3 to enforce lien against the plans property23 furthermore the court may stay any pending proceedings that involve plan property24 if the court agrees with the pbgc that the plan should be terminated the court will then appoint trustee or authorize the existing trustee to terminate the plan 18 erisa 4050 29 usc 1350 19 erisa 4042 29 usc 1342 20 erisa 4042b

be able to re capture any assets remaining after participants have received their share which is known as reversion reversion may be subject to an excise tax at 20 rate which is increased to 50 if the plan sponsor does not take certain actions such as establishing qualified replacement plan 27 g6g146g156g157g155g142g156g156g561g22g142g155g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g561 in distress termination the plan sponsor and members of its controlled group are jointly and severally liable to the pbgc for the amount that the benefit liabilities exceed plan assets with interest at termination28 the pbgc will have claim to recover at least some of these amounts if successful the pbgc will pay some of the reco very to plan participants as additional benefits and will keep the remaining amount to help cover its losses the employers payment for the liability is due on the plans termination date the pbgc is authorized to make arrangements with the liable parties for the payments29 and any amount in excess of 30 of the collective net worth of the sponsor and controlled group will be paid under commercially reasonable terms30 in addition the pbgc may claim lien for up to 30 of the collective net worth of the sponsor and controlled group31 the pbgc may bring civil action in us district court to enforce the lien which generally must be filed within six years of the plans termination date the lien has the same priority as federal tax lien in section 6323 of the internal revenue code and is treated as federal tax lien in bankruptcy proceedings 32

employer39 the pbgc may be particularly interested in any subsequent plan that appears to be followon plan followon pl an is designed so that when its benefits are added to the benefits being paid by the pbgc under the termination insurance program for the first plan the total benefits are roughly the same as the first plans benefits thus the employees receive approximately what they expected to
