on the margins of the nato summit classified by charge daffaires mark pekala for reasons 14 b and d 1 snf key points your visit comes at historic time nicolas sarkozy is the most proamerican french president since world war ii and is at the moment arguably the most influential leader in europe sarkozys goodwill and your prestige give us an unprecedented opportunity to cement the positive changes he has already made and to strengthen the relationship for years to come sarkozy is unquestionably the driving force in all of french foreign and domestic policy pragmatist and an activist he can be brilliant impatient undiplomatic hard to predict charming innovative and summitprone he strongly believes that it takes political leaders to slice through the gordian knots8 that bureaucracies can often be unable to resolve he has qualms about jettisoning policies that from his perspective have outlived their usefulness your personal rapport with sarkozy will be factor in the overall relationship and he is eager for genuine friendship in addition to working relationship he was disappointed not to have been the first eu leader invited to washington expect sarkozy to pitch big ideas on everything from the financial crisis to the middle east peace process in turn he will respond well to your bold inventive proposals sarkozy should get clear sense of your priorities and as appropriate red lines sarkozy wants to get off on the right foot with you and will respect your goals end key points early foreign policy goals return to european leadership and the alliance with the us 2 cnf since the beginning of his presidency in 2007 sarkozy has targeted his foreign policy efforts on reestablishing frances image as leader in europe and the world following the debacle of frances vote on the eu constitution in 2005 through personal intervention often at the cost of ruffling the feathers of his german and british rivals he sought to make the eu more dynamic and active world player his personal intervention and leadership during the georgia crisis the economic crisis and the gaza fighting won grudging acceptance and even approval from european leaders who even though offended by his brash dominance of the limelight recognized that he was making the eu an effective player he pursued similar campaign to return to the heart of nato and the atlantic alliance he focused french and european attention on strengthening the european security and defense policy esdp taking advantage of crises in africa and off the somali coast to cobble together effective responses with european imprimatur at the same time he stagemanaged yearlong review of frances security posture for the 21st century which will reallocate resources across the french military and use money saved to modernize its equipment these efforts culminated in forced political march toward domestic debate and successful parliamentary vote not only on frances full reintegration into nato but on the totality of sarkozys foreign policy moving forward in afghanistan 3 cnf with frances full return to nato assured sarkozy will want to want to show that france and europe have more effective voice in decisions particularly on afghanistan where french leadership can galvanize other allies to do more sarkozy is strong supporter of the allied action in afghanistan but there is little popular support for the policy or public understanding of the threat sarkozys recent appointment of pierre lellouche to mirror the role of srap holbrooke is positive signal that france will be engaged and active at sarkozys behest lellouche is seeking to organize gendarme training unit in afghanistan in advance of the nato summit but france is constrained by issues of operational tempo and the financial crisis as well as by concerns about the strategy goals and timeline for success in afghanistan 4 snf sarkozy who plans to visit afghanistan and pakistan in may will likely delay any announcement of increased commitment civilian or military until after that trip ironically announcement of increased us force participation has lifted some of the urgency from our allies including france your discussion will be important to help sarkozy demonstrate to his public that the us is consulting with him before acting and that there is new strategy that will be better coordinated and more effective addressing the summer afghan election plans and pledging better coordination among allies in theater while pressing for stronger civilian commitment will be key to securing increased french participation french officials view pakistan as intrinsically linked with the challenges and issues in afghanistan however france is relative newcomer to pakistan and relies heavily on the us and united kingdom for information and analysis france has proposed regular trilateral consultations with france the uk and the us to better coordinate our policies in the region seeking greater role in the middle east 5 snf sarkozy shares most of our strategic objectives in the middle east from achieving israelipalestinian peace to preserving lebanons independence and sovereignty to dissuading iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability when he differs with us on tactics he is not as was sometimes the case with previous french leaders being difficult simply for the sake of appearing distinct from the us to the contrary sarkozys approach is fueled by pragmatism to get results he has abandoned policies that from his perspective have outlived their usefulness and launched others eg engaging syria that have sometimes put him out in front of washington he views our own effort at talking to damascus with certain sense of vindication and would respond well if you were to ask his assessment of syrian president bashar alasad be prepared to hear that the glass is halffull although sarkozy feels stung by asads failure to send an ambassador to beirut as promised he and his advisors have opted to downplay this failure and remain convinced that engaging syria has paid dividends as for lebanon sarkozy hosted lebanese president sleiman in paris march 1618 for state visit timed to bolster sleiman in advance of lebanons parliamentary election whatever the election outcome france wants to see another unity government in beirut not out of love for hizballah and its allies but to avoid subjecting lebanon to additional fighting that hizballah would almost certainly win and which could also spark more serious regional crisis 6 snf by the same token sarkozy sees credible alternative to palestinian reconciliation he agrees with the ideals expressed in the quartet principles but assesses that the status quo hurts fatah and the palestinian authority more than hamas he would welcome any initiative to repackage the quartet principles indeed he allowed fm kouchner to propose that the eu take less dogmatic approach on engaging hamas in way that allows the international community to work with the next palestinian government sarkozy respects special enjoy mitchell but may tell you as he told secretary clinton that mitchell is too wise8 sarkozy favors bold steps and has not abandoned his idea of convening middle east peace summit though he understands that the timing is not optimal you can expect him to press for action he is also keen to take up president asads offer that the us and france cosponsor resumption of syrianisraeli negotiations on iran sarkozy is the toughest of the eu leaders yet he harbors illusions about the likelihood of further unsc movement at the moment he will likely suggest that you postpone engaging tehran until after irans upcoming presidential election russia dialogue not isolation 7 c sarkozy came to power determined to do away with the personal diplomacy of previous french presidents and to take hard look at french interests in the relationship with russia however during the georgia crisis that erupted at the start of the french eu presidency he fell back again on his penchant for personal engagement and testing the word of his counterparts while wary of russian intentions in georgia sarkozy has made clear his belief that georgia and other areas of disagreement with russia are best handled through diplomatic engagement and not through isolation he has thus pushed for talks on partnership accord between russia and the eu to proceed they are currently on very slow track as an inducement for better russian behavior sarkozy has also sought to engage and cultivate russian president medvedev over prime minister putin in the apparent hope of strengthening relative moderates in moscow 8 cnf like other french officials sarkozy is looking for some indication of where we want to take usrussian relations and how we concretely intend to reset the relationship while sarkozy surprised aides and allies by responding positively to medvedevs initiative to renegotiate europes security architecture his gambit that this should take place inside the osce where the focus will be on russian behavior and not the structure of the western alliances seems to have won some traction sarkozy may warn of the political consequences including in foreign policy terms of steady deterioration of socioeconomic conditions in russia caused by the financial crisis he might also couple any advocacy of sustained engagement with moscow with criticism of the feckless and divided leaderships as he sees them in georgia and ukraine and beyond 9 cnf sarkozy is trying to activate french policy and influence elsewhere but with less success in latin america he sees brazils lula as key partner with shared interest in helping transform cuba his asia policy is shambles the chinese are still seething that sarkozy vacillated about attending the olympics last august and met with the dalai lama in gdansk in december the japanese have told us they feel neglected particularly compared with the attention lavished by sarkozys predecessor and sarkozys determination to turn around french africa policy is still work in progress but one where we and france can continue to cooperate closely sarkozy will also be interested in your onward travel to turkey where bilateral relations have long been soured by frances and sarkozys opposition to full eu membership economic issues 10 cnf president sarkozy sees the current crisis as vindication of the french model of state interventionism in the economy although domestically he has set in motion reforms designed to open the economy to more marketfriendly forces his gaullist instincts never dormant have been on prominent display during the crisis in the runup to the g20 london summit he and his government have used the united states as public foil to rally support for tighter global regulation of the economy he boasted repeatedly of having imposed the initial g20 meeting in november on washington and generally has downplayed ussupported work on crisisrelated issues in the financial stability forum and elsewhere 11 cnf with eu partners he has had mixed success in pushing for more robust state role in defending industry case he often makes by invoking vague arguments that the americans do it so we should too he gets more traction in europe from his governments support for regulating trade based on societal8 preferences against us agriculture for example or priniciple of european preference you will have had the chance to discuss economic issues in london but reminder to president sarkozy that our economic relationship is central to our broader partnership would be timely domestically 12 c sarkozy dominates the french political landscape as in foreign policy he is the driving force he charged into office in 2007 pledging to reform everything from labor laws to the university system but the sharp economic downturn has slowed many of these ambitious initiatives and sarkozys approval ratings languish between 40 and 45 percent never having recovered from an early wave of bad publicity about his personal foibles his energetic occasionally impulsive leadership style has been lightning rod for criticism as has his propensity to rely on relatively small group of advisors nonetheless sarkozy remains fully in command of the politics policy and direction of france he will continue to do so at least until the 2012 presidential election 13 u mr president everyone at embassy paris and indeed all of france looks forward with great excitement and profound pride to welcoming you to strasbourg next month pekala
