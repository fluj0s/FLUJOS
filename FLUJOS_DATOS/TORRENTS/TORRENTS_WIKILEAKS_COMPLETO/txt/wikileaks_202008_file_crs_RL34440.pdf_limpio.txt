summary drought in the southeast has brought congressional attention to an ongoing interstate water conflict among alabama florida and georgia over water allocation and management of the apalachicolacha ttahoocheeflint acf basin reservoir drawdown and predictions for conti nued drought have georgias upper basin municipal and industrial customers concer ned about depleting their principal in some cases their only water supply lake lanier in northern georgia alabama florida and georgias lower basin interests are concerned about sustaining river flows to meet their municipal agricultural electrical recreational and ecosystem needs in addition four federally protect ed species once widely distributed but now confined to the lower basin ar caught in the controversy the issue for the us army corps of gineers corps is how to manage acf federal reservoirs now at r ecord low levels to meet needs in the upper and lower basin equitably the challenge includes complying with federal law eg the endangered species act minimizing harm to the acf basin and apalachicola bay species ecosy stems recreation fishing and oyster industry and providing flows for hydropower and thermoel ectric cooling while also meeting water needs of the atlanta region othe r communities and industries to varying degrees the acf drought has lasted for several years depleting water supplies with lake lanier being th largest source for downstream needs the corps has released water at various times from lake lanier to meet minimum flow requirements in the lower basin to the c onsternation of upper basin users as an emergency drought response in 2007 the corps began to reduce flows in the apalachicola river thereby slowing the drawdown of lake lanier though heavy rains in early 2008 in the lower basin mporarily halted extra releases from lake lanier the corps revised interim operating plan riop calls for three operational seasons contingencies for dr ought operations nd additional water storage before and after drought phase it differs from previous plans in allowing water flows to fall to specified leve l during drought without additional consultation in addition previous agr eement to limit the rate of reduction in flow to allow species to move to deeper wate r will end under certain conditions judging that the corps actions would not jeopardiz the continued existence of listed species or adversely modify their critical habitat the fish and wildlife service issued biological opinion on june 1 2008 that approved the riop four species protected under the endang ered species act three mussels and sturgeon depend on apalachicola river flows the impacts of the riop on these species continue to be the subject of study and debate yet the four are not the focus of debate rather the law itself acts as hammer forcing parties to reach decisions that may produce winners and sers as climate change and population growth continue to affect ecosystems controversies may be at the center of still more stormy debates re sponses of the various parties in the acf and species protection controversy may presage re sponses to future river management controversies in other

2 1994 pp 135151the riop to the fish and wildlife service fws9 the corps proposal was to store 50 of basin inflow instead of 30 this was to be accomplished by eliminating minimum flow of 6500 cfs during wetter periods making fish spawn releases dependent on the storage leve l and switching from twoseason to threeseason operation regime the intent was to avoid storage reaching levels that would trigger the lowering of the apalachicola river minimum flows from 5000 cfs to 4500 cfs since the revised operating plan riop could alter flows in the apalachicola river and its tributaries dow nstream of woodruff dam and alter freshwater inflow to apalachicola bay many species could be affected by these changes as many species interactions are incompletely known the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission the apalachicola national estuarine research reserve florida department of nvironmental protection and the northwest florida water management district are cooperatively working to analyze the relationship of freshwater inflow to the benthic communities of apalachicola bay and changes in fish and shellfish abundance variations in freshwater runoff can cause changes in habitat features of the receiving estuaries including 1 salinities 2 turbidity 3 nutrient availability 4 pathogen exposure and 5 sedimentation while mobile species are able to move to avoid suboptimal habitat c onditions sedentary species ar less able to move and are more likely to experience detrimental effects from changing habitat features although some mobile species may beco less abundant in apalachicola bay if they are able to move to avoid newly uns uitable habitat features other species that find the modified habitat to be more acceptable may move into the bay and increase in abundance this species movement is generally expected response to changing habitat features but may present problems of crowding or competition in some areas oysters and fisheries more than 95 of all species

habitat for forage and nursery use in particular higher salinity levels in apalachicola bay could prevent juvenile and adult gulf sturgeon from entering the bay in the fall and wi nter blocking access to productive feeding habitat12 because of the importance of the bay to commercial and recreational fisheries the town of apalachicola became the first fl orida city to sue the corps to block any further reductions in flows to the bay in its argument it said that lower flows and therefore higher salinity had already harmed the bay13 oysters apalachicola bay oysters constitute an important part of northwestern floridas economy more th an 1000 people are employed by the oyster industry in floridas franklin county which harvests appr oximately 10 million in oysters annually historically this count harvests more than 90 of floridas oysters and 10 of the national supply w ithin franklin county oysters account for almost onethird of the value of all commercial marine landings14 in apalachicola bay oyster distributi on is controlled by both salinity and seafloor geology oyster beds generally occur in areas where the salinity is 5 to 25 parts per thousand on three types of sha llow bars formed by different geologic processes15 in normal circumstances the varying salinities over time prevent the building up of the species of parasites and predators that can survive only in fairly constant salinity eg oyster drills which are adapted only to salt water any decrease in freshwater inflow into the bay from the apalachicola river may result in increased salinity in the bay the poten tial effects of such increased salinity on oysters in the bay would depend upon seve ral factors including how fresh and saltwater mix within the bay how rapidly and to what extent salinity increases and the amount of oyster habitat in the bay th at might be exposed to salinities exceeding oyster tolerance as well as the amount of time these oysters were exposed to excessive salinities

threatened chipola slabshell mussel elliptio chipolaensis and the threatened purple bankclimber mussel elliptoideus sloatianus water flow rates temperature dissolved oxygen and other aspects of water

of the federal agencies are obliged to consult with fws when their actions may affect listed species th most recent formal consultations by the corps on acf management took place in 2006 and 2007 fws issued biological opinions and incidental take st atements regarding the actions consultation in 20062007 in march 2006 the corps requested fo rmal consultation with fws on the interim operating procedure iop of th corps jim woodruff dam on the georgia florida border the corps submitted biological assessment ba on the iop for brief description of earlier c onsultations see crs report rl34326

process it has occurred before eg spotted owls and the northwest forest plan on the other nd tradeoffs in general are very common in the consultation process examples would include direct habitat protection less in one area more acquired in another greater intrusion before or after nesting season and less intrusion during it more public access if access is more carefully controlled etc at issue with the listed acf species is not tradeoff pe r but the degree to which the current likely harm is balanced by potential future benefitsvery slowly moving mussels some chance to relocate to more suitable habitat before given location dried out consultation in 2007 as the drought continued on november 1 2007 the corps proposed exceptional drought operations edo am ending the iop for the jim woodruff dam it requested new expedited form consultation with fws concerning the edos effects on listed species and submitted new ba to fws in it the corps proposed to reduce flows from the jim woodruff dam still further minimum flow 4150 cfs down from 5000 cfs and from the 6500 cfs considered desirable in the previous iop maintenance of the 025 ftday maximum fall rate until 4200 cfs is achieved according to the corps ba adverse impacts to listed species especially the listed mussel species are reasonably certain to occur as flows on the apalachicola river drop below 5000 cfs22 as noted previously any flow below that rate would be less than any previous record for the apalachic ola river among the issues mentioned in the rationale for adopting edo and its lower minimum flows was reducing the demand of storage in order to provide great er assurance of future ability to sustain flows for listed species during severe multiyear drought as currently being experienced in the acf basin23 the result of the proposal was that the listed species would face reduced water flow this year to reduce risks in later years if the drought continues24 the corps requested biop from fws on an expedited basis and both agencies agreed to goal of november 15 2007 for biop and the associated incidental take statement from fws commonly when another agency eg forest service environmental protection agency requests formal consu ltation with fws the other agencys ba may provide considerable in formation not only about its own project but also about the range food known distribution

changeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34440crs8 25 corps ba p 21 26 ibid p 22 27 however the corps would not have been pr evented from volunteering such an option if it had found partners willing to cooperate in the effort in the platte river recovery plan for example the bureau of reclamation cons ulted with fws about project its partners colorado wyoming and nebraska pledged to fund with cash or payments in kind program of habitat improvement including purchase of land from willing sellers improved water flow and adaptive management the program provides 317 million over 13 years with the bureau responsible for half fws could not have required the states to participate but took their efforts into account in issuing finding of jeopardy personal communication between lynne corn and mark butler fws denver regional office november 6 2007since implementation of the iop in fall 2006 the ba did provide data concerning the effects of its operations to date on water quality among other things the corps ba stated that under the iop as it stood then impairments due to point and nonpoi nt source pollution identified include turbidity coliforms total suspended solid s dissolved oxygen do biology and unionized ammonia we lack sufficient information to determine if implementation of the iop has altered the baseline water quality of the action area however we recognize that th extraordinary drought conditions have resulted in salinity changes in apalachic ola bay and increased temperatures and associated localized dissolved oxygen changes due to extended periods of low flow approximately 5000 cfs25 and after acknowledging that the corps doe s not have data on water temperature or dissolved oxygen levels the corps ba further noted however observations made by usfws field personnel this summer indicate that mussels found in isolated pools or sh allow slack water habitats are showing signs of stress or mortality likely due to high temperatures and low do dissolved oxygen significant reducti ons in river flow below 5000 cfs would likely exacerbate the temperature and do conditions observed this year as well as substantially increase the risk of stranding aquatic organisms26 the fws decision concerning jeopardy appeared to turn on whether to trade rather likely immediate harm below thencurrent levels to the four species and especially the mussels to avoid risk of still greater future harm while agencies are required under 7a 16 usc 1536a to utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of fws cannot require an action to save listed species that is outside of that agencys authorities thus while some might argue that reasonable and prudent alternatives rpas see appendix in the acf basin could or should include wate r conservation measures eg improving irrigation practices restricting outdoor wate ring changing commerc ial or residential building codes to improve water conservation increas ing water rates to fund municipal water conservation projects etc fws did not require that the corps undertake these tasks because the corps has authority to implement them27 only those choices legally open to the corps were considered

20managementacfdrought_consulta tion2007ba_amendmentletter11_7_2007pdf 29 however fws does not state that harm would come to these four species rather it concludes that the corps action would not be sufficient to jeopardize the continued existence of the four species provided that certain reasonable and prudent alternatives are carried out any future consultation on acf management would occur in light of pre existing harm that if not appreciable wa s still measurable according to the biop 30 on the same day that the biop was released fws published the final rule for critical habitat designation for the three mussels but the biop generally refers to their critical habitat as proposed rather than designated see 72 federal register 64286 november 15 2007 31 biop p 5658fws had the option of concluding that there was way to carry out the change without jeopardizing the species or adve rsely modifying critical habitat such decisions are extremely rare and often referred to as the nuclear option and would have left the corps with three choices facing citizen suit if it proceeded b choosing not to carry out the modificati on or c considering asking for formal exemption under 7 16 usc 1536ep see appendix fws did not select this option on november 7 2007 the corps amended its ba to take into account new data it had received from fws indicating that greater level of harm to the fat threeridge mussel could result from reduction to 4150 cfs than was previously thought28 it therefore proposed to reduce flows in incr ements first to 4750 cfs then 4500 cfs and finally the target of 4150 cfs the corp s letter also stated that it would consult with fws on the triggers and conditions that would allow it to make the incremental reductions it stated the corps understa nding based on review of the new mussel and modeling data and consultation with your fws office that this amendment will result in less adverse impacts to the liste d species and their designated or proposed critical habitat biological opinion and species analysis in the biop issued november 15 2007 regarding the corps action fws analyzed the effects of the proposed action on each of the four listed species its conclusions are described in detail below but overall fws conc luded that the edo would not appreciably affect the survival and recovery of the gulf stur geon and would not appreciably affect the ability of its designated critical habitat to provide its intended conservation role for gulf sturgeon in the wild29 in addition fws concluded that for the fat threeridge chipola slabshell and purple bankclimber mussels the corps edo would have measurable but not appreciable impact on survival and recovery while critical habitat primary constituent elements30 for these mussel species may be adversely affected by reducing minimum releases to 4500 cfs fws did not anticipate that this adverse affect would alter or affect the critical habitat in the action area to the extent that it would appreciably diminish the habitats capability to provide the intended conservation role for these mussels in the wild31 triggers for incremental reduction would have to be supplied to fws in order to make dditional reductionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34440crs10 32 56 federal register 49655 september 30 1991 33 us department of the interi or geological survey usgs gulf sturgeon

of mexico in the springtime to spawn near the headwater of rivers in areas with coarse substrates rocks sand or gravel rather than mud the fish then spend the summer in the mid to lower river before migrating back into the gulf of mexico adult gulf sturgeon seldom feed while in rivers instead using stored nutrients to supply energy needed for spawning33 adults feed once they return to estuaries or the gulf of mexico once the eggs hatch young fish remain in the river probably for few months they are ve ry longlived species females mature at about 812 years and males at 710 years adult length can exceed 6 feet in addition to the fish flesh itself the fish were prized for caviar major limiting factors for the population include barriers dams to historical spawning habitats loss of habitat

bottoms of streams and rive rs larvae of these mussels are parasites on the gills and fins of freshwater fishes eg darters minnows and bass using these host fish for dispersal and causing them little or harm all three mussels require good water quality stable stream channels and flowing water major limiting factors include manmade structures eg dams and channel alterations that destroy freeflowing water hab itats and restrict the three species and their hosts from dispersing resulting in small isolated populations the three species are also threatened by point and nonpoint sour ce pollution such as runoff containing fertilizers herbicides and pesticides from various landuse practices36 the mussels usually move very little but muscular foot helps them burrow and allows slow and limited movement if they are disturbed by floods or droughts all three species were listed on march 16 1998 critical bitat was designated for them on november 15 2007 the designati on took effect on december 17 200737 for all three mussels the biop reported that mortality increases with low water levels and decreases with higher levels and cooler temperatur mussels commonly move downslope within the river channe l as waters recede but may encounter problems during their slow progress for example if they arrive at an area that has had too high flow rate in the past they may find river bottom that is scoured and has substrate too coarse to be suitable for mussels if they reach an area with very low flow rate they may become smothered with silt or overheated as result their preferred habitats in river can be very patchy with high populations in favorable areas and low populations in the intervenin g areas in addition mussels may become stranded in isolated pools as water levels fall oxygen in the isolated pools may drop to fatal levels once stranded they are unable to escape and may die unless waters rise in time effects on the individual species are discussed below fat threeridge mussel this species was found historically in the apalachicola flint nd chipola rivers see figure 2 for historic and current distribution of fat threeridge mussel the species has never been found in the chattahoochee river it is longer found in the flint river and occurs only in the lowest portion of the chipola river s iltation above dams may have contributed to their loss in higher parts of the river basi n while the fat threeridge mussel is found over large portion of the apalachicola river over half the population is found between river miles 40 and 50 even though th at stretch is much less than half the species range population densities in th is portion of the river range from 5 to 77 times the densities in any other part of the river38 because the river margins in this concentrated area are relatively flat small drop in water level exposes large amounts of habitat the edo would cause suitable habitat to drop from 74 to 55 acres in this critical stretch the musse ls may respond by moving downslope buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34440crs13 39 studies were found to monstrate whether the projected decline has occurred or not 40 biop p 42deeper unoccupied habitat is subject to higher water velocities which result in scouring and coarser substrate rather than the silt and clay substrate the species seems to prefer higher spring flows could wash away mussels perhaps killing them outright or depositing them in unsuitable habitat by analogy with studies on closely related and better studied species fws c oncluded in the november 2007 biop that the species could decline as much as 30 between 2006 and 200839 purple bankclimber the purple bankclimber is large mussel once found widely in the acf basin plus the ochlocknee river fl and ga see figure 3 for historic and current distribution of purple bankclimber it has nearly disappeared in the chattahoochee and chipola rivers and is now rare in the flint river the purple bankclimber is found prima rily at two sites in the apalachicola river though few animals are found elsewhere one s ite at river mile 105 is limestone shoal and the species is found among jagged rocks at this site movement down this surface as water recedes would be problema tic at the second site bankclimbers are found at various depths in sandy substr ate fws found that decreasing the water levels further will harm some fraction of the bankclimber at the limestone site but we can not determine the size of that fraction from the information we have40 chipola slabshell the chipola slabshell was historically found only in the chipola river its headwater streams and one creek that joins the lower apalachicola it is now gone from that creek and appears to be gone from dead lake on the mainstem of the chipola si x subpopulations remain all in the chipola river see figure 4 for historic and current distri bution of the chipola slabshell the biop expects the edo to affect only small fraction of the population primarily because the affected portion of the chipola river where the mussel lives represents only the lower end of the species distributi on the higher parts of its range would not be affected by the lowered flows longterm analysis provided or expected s n t d i n t h s individual species analyses fws commented that lack of data prohibited drawing longterm conclusions about effects of the edo to that end it limited its opinion to period of only few months more over it did not determine minimum flow that would avoid jeopardy indefi nitely into the future it would be surprising if it had not only does fws lack sufficient data to predict confidently the effects of such change in flow over the long term it also lacks sufficient information to determine what other factors might change in the species habitat for instance if water flows remained low but all communities and industr ies in the basin were to improve their pollution levels markedly might the species tolerate an even lower flow in light of this improvement what would happen if pollution were to increase or if all farms planted shade trees along all tributaries thereby lowering water temperatures would that favor mussel populations what if ex isting trees were re moved or if paved surfaces increased and together raised wa ter temperatures ch complexities make long term analyses very difficult see what does species

terms and conditions were attached to the its to ensure that the its provisions are implemented these terms and conditions included reporting requi rements monitoring and assuming responsibility for certain studies among other things these studies include measurements of take of the listed species resulting from lower flows changes in mussel distribution and life history studies to provide better information to inform future decisions the its also warned that failure to carry out the terms and conditions could invalidate the its42 in addition to mandatory terms and conditions the it s also made discretionary recommendations to the corps among other things the its recommended that the corps work with states and other stakeholde rs to reduce water depletions to the acf basin particularly in the flint river its examples included incentives to reduce agricultural demands it also recommended th at the corps with other stakeholders evaluate ways to ensure that listed mussel mortality due to low flows does not become chronic or annual source of mortality43 consultation in 2008 on april 15 2008 the corps submitted its revised interim operating plan riop to fws for consultation t hus eliminating the temporary edo by incorporating elements of the edo and other changes into the riop44 it is generally more complicated than previous plans but on the whole allows for more water retention in the upper basin the riop proposal includes provisions to store additional water during the winter and dur ing drought periods and to release more during spawning periods the intent is to avoid storage reaching levels that would trigger the lowering of the apalachicola river minimum flows from 5000 cfs to 4500 cfs the corps proposal is to store 50 of basin inflow instead of 30 this would be accomplished by eliminating minimum flow of 6500 cfs during wetter periods making fish spawn releases depe ndent on the storage level and switching from twoseason to threeseason operation regime key changes resulting from the riop includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34440crs18 45 inflow is the unimpaired runoff into the basin minus the consumptive uses that might occur above reservoir the use of inflow into reservoirs rather than unimpaired runoff into the basin to guide operations is contenti ous because of the exclusion of consumptive uses such as irrigation in the flin t river

times of low inflow45 that is still above 5000 cfs amounts above 5000 cfs would be released below woodruff dam if basin inflow is below 5000 cfs then 5000 cfs would be released anyway however if storage of water dipped to drought levels then water release could fall to 4500 cfs suspension of requirements for maximum fall rate 025 ftday if water storage drops to specified level and the corps is operating under drought plan conclusions of the biop fws issued its most recent biop on june 1 200846 fws concludes that the riop would not jeopardize the four listed species nor would it adversely modify their cr itical habitat it stated p 174 generally it appears that the corps would store water more often under the riop about 9 more often than has ccurred historically which means that the river would have less water about 9 of the time the riop uses this stored water to maintain minimum flow of 5000 cfs but the frequency of flows less than 10000 cfs is increased by about 5 as is the case in other consultations fws compared the effects of the proposed action to the effects that would occur on th listed species if the proposed action were not taken thus conclusi on of added harm for the four species cannot be interpreted as harm to the species in general fws concluded that with certain reasonable and prudent measures mandatory under the terms of the new its neither jeopardy nor destruction or dverse modification of design ated critical habitat would occur in its conclusions fws focused pr imarily on those periods when flows below woodruff dam would be at or below 5000 cf s because the riop would apply until new water control plan is adopted in two to five years the biop would apply until june 1 2013 or until the riop is amended or superseded by new proposed action the effects of the riop on each of the four species is discussed below followed by discussion of effects on other species in the apalachicola river and bay for the gulf sturgeon fws concluded th at the riop may have moderate beneficial effect by decreasing the maximum number of consecutive daysyear less than 16000 cfs however future deple tions to basin inflow from nonproject related water uses might further change sturgeon estuarine habitats by increasing the duration of flows less than 16000 cfs dur ing drought years 2008 biop p 175 for the fat threeridge mussel fws commented on the effects of more frequent periods of low inflow below 5000 cfs level which had not been reported beforehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34440crs19 47 2008 biop p 185the creation of lake lanier into the ba would be about 73 of the time under current estimated water demands throug hout the basin and 83 of the time if municipal and industrial demands increase by 27 under the riop while additional releases upstream would be triggered to maintain 5000 cfs downstream at woodruff dam if inflow not unimp aired runoff see above fell below 5000 then the riops minimum inflow provision woul d be triggered which would lower the releases below woodruff dam to 4500 cfs 2008biop p 176 we anticipate take of not more than 21000 fat threeridge 9 of the population if the 4500 cfs minimum release is triggere d 2008 bio p p 176 continuing fws concluded that the riop would have measurable but not appreciable impact on this species if flows fall to 4500 cfs it expected that drop to occur once in the next five years the purple bankclimber tends to occur more commonly in deeper water than the fat threeridge fws concluded that while there is evidence that the species is declining throughout its range they anticip ated take of about 200 animals if flows fell to 4500 cfs because of the species preference for deeper water and given models suggesting that the lower flow w ould occur only about once in the next five years fws concluded that critical hab itat would not be dversely modified the chipola slabshell is found in the ch ipola river tributary of the lower apalachicola river figure 4 and fws reported discoveries of 12 new subpopulations with many individuals it concluded that the species is now improving rangewide fws further concl uded that the changes in the mainstem of the apalachicola and reduction to 4500 cfs in the main river might lead to take of about 2 of the population it found that this level of add itional take would not jeopardize the species or destroy or advers ely modify its designated critical habitat reasonable and prudent measures to imp lement the its were also given by fws these mandatory measures include d additional monitoring and evaluation of other strategies for reducin g fall rates especially during sturgeon spawning season from march to may in addition and afte r consulting appropriate water resource and management agencies the corps was to provide the service by june 1 2009 an ev aluation of methods to estimate total surface water flow of the basin to woodruff dam by accounting for depletions to basin inflow the goal of this eval uation is to outline the steps whereby the corps may integrate uptodate estimates of water depletions into its monthly operational decisions47 fws made recommendations to the corps as well these recommendations

local rainfall runoff regulates the bays salinity and likely influences the amount of habitat available48 the june 1 2008 biop notes that extended dur ation of high salinity in the estuarine environment is ecologically significant because aquatic organisms widely differ in their salinity tolerance more variable salinity favors those with the widest tolerance and less variable salinity favors those with narrower tolerance49 the eastern oyster crassostrea virginica is the commercial species of primary concern in considering effects of the riop because it is sedentary is affected by changes in salinity and has considerable economic value oysters grow and reproduce optimally at intermediate salinities prolonged exposure to freshwater inhibits oyster growth while higher salin ity waters harbor ma rine predators and correlate with an increased susceptibility of oysters to the potentially lethal parasite perkinsus marinus commonly referred to as dermo50 within apalachicola bay highest oyster densities and overall growth occur in the vicinity of the confluence of high salinity water moving westward from st george sound and riverdominated lower salinity water moving south and eastward from east bay high salinity proximity of an oyster bar to entry point s of saline gulf water into the bay and relatively lowvelocity currents are important factors contributing to increased oyster mortality river flow reduction whether th rough drought or increased upstream use could have serious dverse consequences for oyster populations51 benthic survey of apalachicola bay conducted by the flor ida department of environmental protection found that pol ychaetes bivalves gastropods and amphipods dominated the total abundance of this community52 how this fauna might respond to changes in freshwater in flow is not well known as noted above the more sedentary species would likely be more detrimentally affected while some of the more mobile species might move to more acceptable

with prev ious court decisions the 2008 biop does not appear to contradict court decisions pertaining to the acf the only court to have addressed the corps acf programs in the c ontext of biop is the northern district of alabama in that case the state of florida sought to enjoin the corps plan to release only 5000 cfs of water arguing that the reduced water flow harmed species listed under the the court held that even assuming the loss of any mussels qualifies as take florida has not established the nece ssary causal link between the actions of the corps and the harm to the mu ssels indicating that the drought not the corps was causing the water shortage55 that decision did not address future actions by the corps or the fws and this biop does not appear inconsistent with that ruling56 the underlying agency action reviewed in the 2008 biop does not appear to be at odds with the recent decision from the d c circuit court of appeals the dc circuit court held that pursu ant to the water

become effective and therefore ve not affected ope rations to date the disputed contracts called for reallocation of storage space not the delivery of specific quantity of water from othe r uses to municipal and industrial water supply it is unclear from available information whether reallocation of space tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34440crs22 water supply would change the quantity st ored for instance differences in the timing of releases from lake lanier for in stream hydropower uses and releases for offstream consumptive municipal uses pot entially could affect the stored volume as well as instream flows at particular time the ba and its biop describe an operational regime that eval uates both the volume of stor ed water and basin inflow to determine releases at woodruff dam however the flow amounts from the jim woodruff dam which are the agency acti on underlying the biop are not influenced by the storage capacity in the lake lanier reservoir but are based on basin inflow quantities what does species need the question of what species needs is often asked by many parties in any debate to the frustration of both the stioners and the biologists trying to respond how many big trees does spotte d owl need how pure does the water need to be to restore run of chinook salmon and how much water flow do mussels in the acf system need the answers to such questions depend on some factors that are obvious though the details may differ from case to case is the minimum in question feature that affects species at critical portion of its life cycle eg calving is the species also threatened by incidental take in the course of otherhuman activities eg fishery bycatch are invasive species competing with the species are diseases particularly newly introduced diseases weakening the species ability to withstand stress these and similar questions are common feature of biops or any other analysis of species and threats to their welfare whether for examining issues listing consultation habitat conservation plans et c or for state or local conservation matters these sorts of questions are the most obvious reason why fws biologists are reluctant to pick out si ngle feature such as cubic feet of water per second in river and state that this particular hard number is what the species needs for all time but more subtle issue also arises and it is often less clearly stated than the previous questions to what end is the species being managed in terms how far down the road to recovery does r ecovered species have to travel to be considered recovered the probability of population surviving over particular period is usually chosen as the standard of recovery 10 chance of becoming extinct in the next 50 years 15 in the next 100 ears 1 chance in the 100 years etc the stronger the probability and the greater the desired time span the more caution is required in species management however these probabilities analyses of the viability of population are difficult to calculate and hard to defend fws and nmfs have set generally agreed standard of recovery to be applied across the board to all species while it may seem esoteric this choice of recovery standard has major consequences over long span of time ec ologist daniel goodman of montana state university offered an interesting analysis of this problemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34440crs23 59

that time global policy had been adopted of managing the environment to standard of 15 probability of extinction within 100 years for all mammalian species how many mammal species would be left on earth now the starting number of species would have been about 4400 compounding the 15 probability per 100 years over the 5000 years gives probability of about 00003 003 or 3 chances in 10000 per species of surviving to the present if the extinction dynamics of all the respective species were independent the probability of mammals remaining would be 27 the probability of more than three species remaining would be about 4 this doesnt s ound very good our preferred vision of managing the environment for posterity obviously entails very low probabilities of extinction over large time spans59 in the acf context there is river flow that would guarantee that any of the listed species would last another 5000 year s if only because the species could go extinct for other reasons more practically though if guarantee is impossible how much of risk is acceptable is prol onged flow of 5000 cfs sufficient for one of the mussels to have at most 1 chance of extinction in the next decade century millennium if the flow is lowered still further how much greater does the risk to the species become and is that level of risk acceptable if higher risk is tolerated lower flow could be acceptable if only low risk of extinction is acceptable then higher flows would be desirable in the acf context instead of setting itself the difficult or impossible task of determining the minimum flow necessary for the various species fws instead accepted the far more specific task of determining whether any one plan offers sufficient flows to avoid jeopardy to the species it is noteworthy that in the acf case fws limited its opinion to specific period of months not years and further requested additional studies and data from the corps only then does fws presumably with more data in hand plan to address the risks from any further cutbacks in flowshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34440crs24 60 the discussion below omits those species under the jurisdiction of the department of commerce

definition of harm in addition under 7a2 16 usc 1536a2 federal agencies must insure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat to that end they must consult with fws the consultation process is described below in simplified form60 federal agencies must consult with fws on any action authorized funded or carried out by such agency if that action may harm listed species or its critical habitat 16 usc 1536a2 if fws advises the action agency that listed species or one proposed for listing may be present in the affected area then the action agency must conduct biological assessment ba describing its proposed action according to fws regulations the purpose of the ba is to evaluate the potential effects of the action on listed and proposed species and designated and proposed critical habitat and termine whether any such sp ecies or habitat are likely to be adversely affected by the action 50 cfr 40212a if with the help of information in the ba formal cons ultation between the agency and fws is determined to be necessary either because of potential taking of the species or effects on critical habitat the action agency submits formal request for consultation the action agency must provide the best scientific data available regarding its action and potential effects of the action on the species or its critical habitat once request for formal consultation is submitted certain deadlines apply but these may be extended when additional information is needed 50 cfr 40214 the responsibilities of fws during consu ltation are various but notably in the acf context include an evaluation of the effects of the action itself as well as cumulative effects of the action the evaluation is called biological opinion biop or sometimes jeopardy opinion among other things fws must evaluate whether the proposed action taken together with cumulative effects is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat 50 cfr 40214g in forming the biop fws first consults with the agency on the availability of reasonable and prudent alternatives if je opardy opinion is to be issued that the agency can take to avoid violation of section 7a2 50 cfr 40214g

critical habitat 50 cfr 40202 note that even if an alternative exists that might better fulfill the purpose of the agency action and reduce risks to the species or to critical habitat fws may not specify that alternative if it is not within the authority of the action agency in some instances this limitation will mean that other solutions perhaps more desirable from an economical biological so cial or other point of view may not be considered simply because the action agency has authority to implement those options the biop must include summary of the information on which the decision is based and detailed discussi on of the effects of the action on the listed species or critical habitat 50 cfr 40214 it mu st also include the opinion on whether the agencys action is not likely to

reduce the potential loss of human life and 2 to involve an emergency situation which does not allow the ordinary procedures of this section to be followed this provision could be used for quick re

statement eis is required unde r the national envir onmental policy act nepa 42 usc 4321 et seq nepa re quires federal agencies to comply with its requirements to the fullest extent possible65 however nepa does not require any particular results such as choosing th least harmful project the us supreme court has said nepa merely prohibits uninformed rather than unwise agency action66 accordingly where courts have found that agencies took hard look at the relevant areas of envir onmental impact and satisfied the other demands of 43322c the courts have upheld the nepa process to comply with nepa the agency must show that the environmental review informed the decisionmaking process nepa regulations promulgated by the council on environmental quality ceq ddress the timing of an environmental review the regulations all require the environmental review before the agency decision indeed as early as practical section discu ssing timing of environmental reviews says an agency shall commence preparation of an environmental impact statement as close as possible to the time the agency is developing or is presented with proposal sec 150823 so that preparation can be completed in time for the final statement to be included in any reco mmendation or report on the proposal the statement shall be prepared early enough so that it can serve practically as an important contribution to the decisionma king process and will not be used to rationalize or justify decisions already made67 early in nepa practice the courts blished that nepa review should occur before an agency action was decided upon that the filing of an eis should precede rather than follow federal agency action has been consistently recognized by the courts68 the fifth circuit described th harm in reversing the order whenever an agency decision to act pr ecedes issuance of its impact statement the danger arises that consideration of environmental factors will be pro forma and that the statement will represent post hoc rationalization of that decisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34440crs29 69 sierra club v lynn 502 f2d 43 5960 5th cir 1974 70 methow valley citizens council v regional forester 833

onmental factors and variables into the decisional calculus at each stage of the process69 the courts agree that nepa review is intended to inform the decisionmaking process the ninth circuit addressed the timing of the environmental review in relationship to the agency decision it sa id the purpose of the review is to provide decisionmakers with an environmental disclosure sufficiently detailed to aid in the substantive decision whether to proceed with the project in light of the environmental consequences70 reviewing court is likely to find that an agency failed to take hard look at the environmen tal consequences of its action when the decision on what action to take predates the consider ation of the environmental effects the contents of nepa document may also influence court as to whether an agency took hard look at the environmen tal effects of the proposed action the regulations provide gene ral description of the c ontents environmental assessments eas are intended to be concise but are also required to consider the need for the project the environmental impacts of the project and its alternatives alternatives required by 1022e and list of the agencies and persons consulted71 the nepa process should synchroni ze with the consultation even though they are independent of each other section 7c1 of states that the biological assessment prepared by the acti on agency may be undertaken as part of the nepa review as the ba considers whether there are any endangered or threatened species likely to be affected by the agency action that evaluation ties neatly with the review under nepa to c onsider whether the action would have any significant adverse environmental effects since both the nepa review and the 7 consultation must be completed before the agency makes its decision there is timing issue in gathering the data for both purposes emergency exception it has been suggested that because the governor of georgia declared state of emergency related to the drought nepa c ould be waived however the statute provides for such unilate ral waiver nepa emergency provisions are found within ceq regulations 40 cfr 150611 the provision in its entirety states where emergency circumstances make it necessary to take an action with significant environmental impact without observing the provisions of these regulations the federal agency taking the action should consult with the council about alternative arrangements agencies and the council will limit such arrangements to actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency other actions remain subject to nepa review an agency must consult with the ceq if it is taking action without following nepa without ceqs approval the agency would be acting in violation of the lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34440crs30 72 crosby v young 512 fsupp 1363 1386 dc mich 1981 73 andrus v sierra club 442 us 347 358 1979 74 crosby v young 512 fsupp 1363 dc mich 1981 75 valley citizens

regulations and also to interpret the provisions of nepa to accommodate emergency circumstances72 if the corps requested waiver from strict compliance with nepa and the ceq agreed that decision would be given substantial deference73 the ceq could authorize alternative arrangements under the emergency provision which would not waive nepa but pr ovide another means of compliance research did not reveal many exam ples of 150611 being invoked by agencies in which court reviewed the decision n one of the actions found was similar to the facts at hand the cases involved waiv ing nepa for an industrial project74 night time use of an air force base during the desert storm military operation75 and navy sonar training76 in the case of the navy sonar tr aining the court found that there was emergency and rejected the use of 150611 in both cases where ceq authorized the emergency provision alterna tive environmental procedures were used shortly after hurricane katrina ceq issu ed memorandum in which it emphasized that nepa should continue to be fo llowed to demonstrate our continuing commitment to environmental stewardship77 it provided guidance on complying with 150611 as an appendix the right to sue under nepa nepa suits are brought under the ad ministrative procedure act apa therefore courts review whether an agen cys action was arbitrary or capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law78 parties have to show standing that limits plaintiffs to those who could show they we re adversely affected or aggrieved by the agency action and that nepa intended to protect against that actual or threatened injury79 for example economic injury by itself is not the type of harm nepa protects against and could not be the basis for lawsuit however the reduced use of the river by recreational kayaker could be the basis for standing plaintiffs could include individuals and groups provided they were able to show they suffered an injury in fact that was different from the injury suffered by the community at large80
