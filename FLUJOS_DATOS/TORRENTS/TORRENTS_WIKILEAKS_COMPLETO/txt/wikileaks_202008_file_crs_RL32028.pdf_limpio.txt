selected issues introduction grape cultivation for wine production is nearly as old as civilization vitis vinifera the grape species most commonly used in wine making has been adapted to wide range of soils but generally re quires long dry warmtohot summers and cool winters for best development1 grapes have been successfully cultivated in europe and asia minor for thousands of years and were eventually brought to california today wine production occu rs throughout the world and wine is increasingly entering international markets the value of international wine trade has risen from under 1 billion in 1977 to over 3 billion by 1989 and to over 7 billion in 2001 in the united states wine like mo st alcohol and liquor products was traditionally viewed as luxury item in the consumers budget as result the average us wine consumer was fairly sensitive to price changes and most expenditures on wine were made by highe rincome households with larger shares of discretionary income however wine c onsumption in the united states increased dramatically through the 1990s in part because of news about the potential health benefits of modera consumption and in part because strong us economy supported increased spending on wi ne at home and in restaurants2 in europe wine has been traditional staple in the household diet for many families as result wine percapitac onsumption rates and household expenditures on wine have been substantially higher in most european countries than in the united states or the rest of the world in recent years european wine per capita consumption has averaged about 30 liters pe r year compared with 74 liters per year in the united states3 defining wine there is some disagreem ent among countries over what constitutes wine for example the eu defines wine as only those beverages made by fermenting grapes in the united states wine is defined more broadly to include beverages produced by fermentation of an fruit grapes peaches pears etc

accounting for over 85 of the eus wine production the eus internal wine policy has evolved significantly over the past three decades during the early years of th european union wine production had curbs on plantings and very few market regulations11 this freedom on plantings was eventually coupled with program that virtually guaranteed sales but which generated serious structural surplus th at was partially addr essed through export refunds subsidies since 1978 eu policy to wards the wine sector has become very interventionist in addition to purchas ing excess production and providing export refunds the eu implemented ban on plantin gs and the obligation to distill surplus production12 by the late 1980s aid for acreag reduction was reinforced in 1996 eu wine program outla ys

the average allowed world trade organization wto tariff on wine is 7620 in addition to tariffs and cellaneous import charges other key issues that affect wine trade and are currently being discussed in various trade negotiations include labeling and geographical indications and the issue of mutual recognition of oenological winemaking practices several of the major noneu wine exporting countries have joined tr ade agreement to address many of these trade issues also the united states and the eu have been negotiating bilateral wine agreement to resolve differences related to wine trade tariffs and other border measures wine tariff schedules vary widely across countries also tariff rates often vary by alcohol content and whether the wine is bottled or bulk licensing certification requirements and rigid labeling rules are not uncommon in many importing countries for example in the eu wine imports require an import license and must be accompanied by certificate signed by the competent authority in the exporting country to show that they meet eu regulations as well as by an analysis report by an official laboratory recognized in the exporting country21 in japan all commercial wine imports are subject to the food sanitation law and import notification is required with the possibility of followup inspection22 all of these procedures add to the cost of importing wine and detract from the imported wines price competitiveness in domestic markets several importing countries that ve or only small domestic wine production often give preference in their tariff schedule to the importation of bulk wine and grape must to provide incentiv for domestic wine production and bottling japan is prime example of this in japa n the label produced in japan means the product was bottled in japan many of japans domestic brands are made from imported bulk wine imported grape must fermented in japan or imported grape juice often these imported ingredients are mixed with wine produced from locally grown grapes approximately 90 of japa nese brands are ma from imported bulk wine and grape must while only about 10 are produced exclusively from grapes grown in japan23 compared to japans tariff for bottled wine imports 15 or 125 yen per liter whichever is less the lower import tariff for bulk wine and grape musthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32028crs7 24this
