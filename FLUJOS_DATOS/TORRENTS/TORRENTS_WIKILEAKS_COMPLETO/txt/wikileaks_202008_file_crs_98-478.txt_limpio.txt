rescissions for fy1998 included within pl 105174 is 1756 million in supplemental spending for agricultural programs within the us department of agriculture usda1 most of this 1 appropriations for all usda programs except for the forest service are provided through the agriculture subcommittee of the house and senate appropriations committees the totals in this continued congressional research service the library of congress crs2 new spending 1598 million provides disaster relief to farmers affected by nino driven storms and other weatherrelated disasters severe agricultural disasters that occurred this fiscal year included an ice storm in new england flooding on the west coast and tornadoes in the southeast the balance of 158 million in nonemergency supplemental appropriations provides funding to other usda programs including farm loans and the departments civil rights activities fy1998 spending reductions were made in several usda agencies to fully compensate for the 158 million in nonemergency spending emergency provisions the watershed and flood prevention operations program administered by usdas natural resources conservation service receives 80 million or nearly one half of the 1598 million in emergency funding provided by pl 105174 to agricultural programs the amount provided to the watershed program is twice the 40 million requested by the administration mainly because the full extent of disaster damages was not known when the administration request was submitted earlier this year also subsequent disasters occurred requiring additional funding these funds are expected to be used to repair damage to waterways and watersheds resulting from floods and other natural disasters and supplements the 101 million provided in regular fy1998 appropriations the supplemental funds will remain available until expended the emergency conservation program ecp administered by the farm service agency provides costsharing assistance to producers affected by floods and receives 34 million in pl 105174 compared with the earlier administration request for 20 million funds in this program are used to restore disasterdamaged farmland by reshaping the land and for removing debris the maximum costshare payment under the program is 200000 per person per disaster funds were previously made available in the regular fy1998 agricultural appropriations act of the 34 million provided in pl 105174 4 million is exclusively reserved for costsharing assistance to northeast maple producers to replace taps and tubing that were damaged by severe ice storm last winter all fy1998 supplemental ecp funds will be available until expended the fy1998 supplemental appropriations act provides 4 million to usdas commodity credit corporation ccc to fund livestock indemnity program this will pay disasteraffected livestock growers on somewhat similar basis to what crop producers receive under catastrophic coverage within the federal crop insurance program under the livestock indemnity program an eligible producer can receive payment equal to 30 percent of the market price on all livestock losses in excess of normal mortality for producer to be eligible the disaster must have occurred between november 27 1997 and may 1 1998 and the producers county had to have been declared disaster area by either the president or the secretary of agriculture pl 105174 specifically includes ratites ostriches emus rheas etc as eligible livestock the program is administered by the farm service agency fsa officials anticipate that the 4 million appropriation 1 continued report do not reflect the 605 million provided by pl 105174 for forest service emergency spending or the 15 million in rescissions to forest service programs which are funded by the interior subcommittee crs3 might not be sufficient to make full payment to all eligible producers under the payment formula in that event program payments would be adjusted downward on proportionate basis among all eligible recipients an appropriation of 68 million is provided to the ccc for new dairy production disaster assistance program which will pay dairy farmers 4 per hundredweight of milk for any milk that was produced but rendered unmarketable due to disaster occurring between november 27 1997 and may 1 1998 payments can also be made for any diminished milk production caused by the disaster including diminished future production caused by mastitis an udder infection that requires milk from infected cows to be withheld from the market during treatment with antibiotics pl 105174 requires usda to compare producers milk production during the disaster period six months from the date of the disaster to production in the same period year earlier and pay 4 per cwt for any shortfall in production on per head basis the 4 per cwt payment represents approximately onefourth to onethird of the market price of farm milk like the livestock indemnity program the dairy disaster payment program will be administered by the farm service agency which will proportionately reduce the disaster payments should the 68 million appropriation not be adequate the tree assistance program tap receives 14 million in emergency funds primarily to help small orchardists replant trees and vineyards that were damaged or destroyed by natural disasters tap is costsharing program that pays orchardists 65 percent of the cost of replanting or rehabilitating disasterstricken trees on losses in excess of 35 percent pl 105174 specifically excludes growers of trees used for pulp and timber from receiving tap funds pl 105174 also provides an appropriation of 21 million to support an estimated 874 million in farm service agency fsa emergency disaster em loans 2 this will supplement the existing authority for 635 million in fy1998 em loans which has been virtually exhausted these lowinterest loans are designed to help disasterstricken familysized farmers who are unable to obtain credit from commercial lender to recover from production and physical losses caused by natural disaster county must be declared disaster area by either the president or the secretary of agriculture in order for farmers in that county to be eligible for an em loan eligible farmers must experience 30 percent crop loss and can receive loan to cover up to 80 percent of actual losses not to exceed 500000 the term of the loan is from 1 to 7 seven years to be repaid by the borrower at federally subsidized interest rate currently set at 375 percent nonemergency provisions of the 15829 million in nonemergency usda spending provided by pl 105 174 just over 115 million is to bolster what was already available within the various 2 under current budget law federal agencies that administer loan programs must estimate the cost of making or guaranteeing these loans based on any interest rate subsidy given to borrowers and the expected default rate on the loans the loan subsidy is the amount that is actually appropriated which supports total loan level that is based on the riskiness of the loan and the interest rate subsidy ie the higher the rate of nonrepayment and the interest rate subsidy the lower the authorized loan level will be crs4 direct and guaranteed farm loan programs within usdas farm service agency3 the 115 million subsidy can support an additional 167 million in total direct and guaranteed farm loans within the farm ownership loan program which provides credit to familysized farmers to purchase farm real estate the nearly 34 million provided can support an additional 183 million in direct loans and 25 million in guaranteed loans the annual agricultural appropriation act provided 455 million and 400 million respectively for fy1998 for the farm operating loan program which provides short and intermediateterm loans for the purchases of farm inputs and for other expenses the act provides an 80 million loan subsidy to support 70 million in direct loans and 35 million in guaranteed subsidized loans to supplement the 490 million and 230 million already available an additional 222000 are made available by pl 105174 to support an additional 188 million in fsa boll weevil eradication loans all of these credit programs either had exhausted or were about to exhaust their regular fy1998 appropriation pl 105174 also provides total appropriation of 2235 million to support usdas civil rights activities compared with the administration request for 5035 million usda has been under close scrutiny in recent years for its civil rights practices for both its personnel actions and in the administration of its lending and other programs as result usda established civil rights action team which recently identified ways to improve the departments civil rights record of the 2235 million provided by the act 20 million is for usda departmental administration compared with request for 48 million within this account usda had requested 29 million for conflict resolution outreach programs and to create civil rights advisory committee and 19 million to compensate for reductions made in noncivil rights activities during the year to fund civil rights activities as requested by the administration pl 105174 appropriates 235000 to usdas office of the general counsel to expedite its processing and adjudication of civil rights complaints other nonemergency supplemental appropriations for usda include 15 million to the grain inspection and packers and stockyard administration for the agencys grain inspection operations and 543000 to the office of the secretary to compensate wheat producers for economic losses associated with karnal bunt fungus that can reduce crop yields and affect the flavor of wheat general provision in the act allows permanent fy1998 employees of farm service agency county committees who are nonfederal employees to be considered the same as federal county committee employees when being considered for vacancies within usda following reduction in force fsa is in the midst of downsizing as county offices are being consolidated as part of an ongoing usda reorganization prior to this provision federal county committee employees were given priority over the nonfederal employees for rehiring the act also allows competitivelyawarded grant funds for usdas cooperative state research education and extension service to be used to pay for peer panel and review costs associated with that program 3 direct fsa loans are made and serviced by fsa guaranteed fsa loans are made by commercial lenders but carry federal guarantee of the timely repayment of principal and interest on up to 95 percent of the loan amount crs5 the conference report language accompanying the supplemental appropriations act contains several provisions that could affect usda programs one such provision directs the secretary of agriculture to reduce or waive collateral requirements on fy1998 fsa emergency disaster loans for applicants who have experienced disasters over the last several years andor have majority of crops grown on leased land report language also directs usda to report to congress by july 1 1998 on whether current law unduly affects the distribution of funds under the noninsured assistance program nap which makes direct disaster payments to farmers who are ineligible for crop insurance under current law the area in which the producer farms must experience 30 percent crop loss before any farmer can become eligible for nap payment separately the senate version of the supplemental bill would have eliminated provision in current law that prohibits farmer from receiving new fsa farm loan if the farmer has received any debt forgiveness the senate language was struck in conference but conference report language states the expectation that the administration and congress should address this issue offsets and rescissions all of the 15829 million in nonemergency agricultural spending in pl 105174 is offset by comparable reduction in usda spending spread over broad spectrum of usda programs and agencies to compensate for nearly threefourths of the supplemental funding for the various farm loan programs 8273 million in loan subsidy approximately 700 million in loan authority was rescinded from the fsa guaranteed unsubsidized farm operating loan program at the time of enactment of pl 105174 this guaranteed loan program had unobligated loan authority in excess of 1 billion and in recent years has used only portion of its authority each year 4 million offset was made to the conservation farm option program which is mandatory program that does not require an annual appropriation and is authorized at 15 million for fy1998 pl 105174 limits cfo spending to 11 million thus providing the 4 million offset the cfo provides 10year contracts to farmers who receive market transition program payment and also participate in the conservation reserve program participating farmers must implement conservation farm plan that addresses the management of natural resources and in return can receive one consolidated usda program payment instead of separate payments from specified farm and conservation programs just over 35 million in total rescissions were made by pl 105174 to the salaries and expenses of numerous usda agencies as requested by the administration to compensate for the supplemental request for civil rights activities although pl 105174 did not fully fund the administrations civil rights request it did concur in full with the requested rescissions

packers and stockyard administration 38000 and agricultural marketing service 25000 requested rescissions were based on combination of an agencys share of the total usda budget and the extent of civil
