haltzel and neela ranade domestic social policy division indexing social security benefits the effects of price and wage indexes summary under current law social security benefits increase from one generation to the next at the rate that the national average wage rises in other words initial social security benefits are wageindexed once enrolled in the program beneficiaries social security checks increase each year at the same rate as the consumer price index cpi that is they are priceindexed due to increases in worker productivity wages tend to rise faster than prices when measured over long periods of time consequently if initial benefits were based on the rate at which prices rise rather than the rate at which wages rise initial benefits for each succeeding generation of workers would grow more slowly than under current law the growth of social security benefits over time can be measured against either the rate of growth of prices or wages if benefits grow faster than the rate at which prices rise the benefits increase in purchasing power and future retirees will enjoy higher standards of living than todays retirees if benefits grow at the same rate as prices purchasing power is unchanged and future retirees will be able to maintain standard of living similar to that of todays retirees benefit levels that grow more slowly than the rate at which prices rise will decline in purchasing power resulting in falling standards of living for future retirees because social security benefits are wageindexed the purchasing power of benefits rises from one generation of workers to the next and the replacement rate initial benefits as percentage of workers careeraverage earnings remains constant for each successive generation of workers if benefits were priceindexed the purchasing power of benefits would remain constant for each generation of workers and replacement rates would fall priceindexing would make small annual reductions in initial benefits but the cumulative reduction would be substantial when compounded over many years this could have serious implications for the retirement income of lowwage workers priceindexing benefits also would make deeper cuts in benefits if wages grow faster than projected even as social securitys financial situation would be improving likewise if wages grow more slowly than projected priceindexing would make smaller cuts in benefits leading to larger financing deficit one way to preserve benefits for lowwage workers would be to progressively priceindex initial benefits initial benefits of lowwage workers would continue to be fully wageindexed the benefits of averagewage workers would be based on mix of wageindexing and priceindexing and the benefits of highwage workers would be fully priceindexed president bush has suggested that congress consider progressive priceindexing of social security benefits the social security administration ssa has analyzed method of progressive priceindexing that would continue to wageindex social security benefits for workers with career average earnings in the lowest 30 of the earnings distribution ssa has estimated that this proposal would eliminate about threefourths of the programs 75year unfunded liability one consequence of this method of progressive priceindexing would be that eventually all workers with earnings in the top

securitys financial situation according to the 2005 report of the social security board of trustees outgo for social security benefits will begin to exceed income from social security payroll taxes in 20171 by 2027 the programs spending will exceed its combined income from payroll taxes income taxes on social security benefits and interest on the treasury bonds held by the social security trust fund in 2041 according to the trustees social security will redeem the last of its treasury bonds and the assets of the trust fund will be exhausted absent changes in federal law that either increase social security revenues or reduce social security benefits when the trust funds are fully depleted in 2041 annual income from tax revenue will be sufficient to pay only 74 of scheduled benefits by 2079 tax revenue will equal just 68 of benefits promised under current law there are many combinations of benefit reductions or tax increases that could restore social security to financial solvency over the legally mandated 75year valuation period or longer however neither cuts in promised benefits nor increases in taxes are popular options among most members of congress or the public and the debate about how to more closely match social security revenues with social security outlays is often contentious one way to reduce future benefits would be to link the calculation of workers initial benefits to price index rather than to wage index as under current law2 whether initial social security benefits are based on wages or prices could have substantial effect on the rate of growth of benefits under current law initial social security benefits increase from one generation to the next at the rate that the national average wage index rises for each generation of social security beneficiaries their average social security benefit exceeds that of the preceding generation by the difference in their average wage in other words initial social security benefits are wageindexed once enrolled in the program beneficiaries social security checks increase each year at the same rate as the consumer price index cpi so that they do not decline in value as prices rise over time that is they are priceindexed due to increases in worker productivity wages tend to rise faster than prices when measured over long periods of time consequently if initial benefits were based on the rate

social security benefits would continue to be fully wageindexed for these workers initial benefits for highwage workers would be based on the rate of growth of the cpi social security benefits would be fully priceindexed for these workers benefits for averagewage workers would be based partly on the rate of growth of the national awi and partly on the rate of growth of the cpi initial social security benefits would be partly wageindexed and partly priceindexed for these workers president bush has suggested that congress consider progressive priceindexing of initial social security benefits as possible reform to help restore the program to financial solvency measuring the value of initial social security benefits over time the growth of social security benefits over time can be measured against either the rate of growth of prices or wages if benefits grow faster than the rate at which prices rise the benefits increase in purchasing power and future retirees will enjoy higher standards of living than todays retirees if benefits grow at the same rate as prices purchasing power is unchanged and future retirees will be able to maintain standard of living similar to that of todays retirees benefit levels that grow more slowly than the rate at which prices rise will decline in purchasing power resulting in falling standards of living for future retirees under current law benefits for each generation of workers grow at the same rate as their wages grow consequently 1 the purchasing power of benefits rises from one generation of workers to the next and 2 the replacement rate initial benefits as percentage of workers career average earnings remains constant for each successive generation of workers if initial benefits were to rise at the same rate as prices increase 1 the purchasing power of benefits would remain constant for each successive generation of workers and 2 replacement rates would fall social security retirement benefits under current law workers who have completed at least 40 quarters of employment covered by social security can begin receiving reduced social security retirement benefits as early as age 62 or full benefits at the full retirement age 65 and 6 months in 20053 the monthly benefit amount payable to worker upon retirement at the full retirement age is called the primary insurance amount pia the pia is based on the workers annual earnings up to the maximum taxable amount averaged over period of 35 years in 2005 earnings up to 90000 are taxable this amount also called the taxable wage base increases each year at the rate of growth of the national average wage index the pia is computed in three steps step 1 indexing earnings the workers annual earnings in each year after 1950 are indexed to the second calendar year before the year in which he or she was first eligible for retirement benefits that is before age 62 this is called the 3 the full retirement age is 65 for those born before 1938 67 for those born in 1960 or later and between 65 and 67 for people born between 1938 and 1960 crs3 indexing year earnings at age 60 or later are not indexed but instead are counted at their nominal value4 for workers who are applying for social security retirement benefits earnings in all years up to age 60 are indexed to growth in the national average wage specifically earnings in each past year are indexed by multiplying them by the ratio of the national average wage for the indexing year to the national average wage in the year the income was earned step 2 determining aime since 1979 social security benefits have been based on average indexed monthly earnings aime the workers average indexed monthly earnings are the average of his or her highest 35 years of indexed earnings earnings at age 60 or later are not indexed but they are included in the aime calculation if they are among the workers highest 35 years of earnings step 3 computing the pia to calculate the workers pia his or her careeraverage earnings are divided into three brackets and multiplied by pia factors 90 32 and 15 that are set in law for each bracket the factors decline as the earnings brackets rise so that social security replaces higher proportion of career average earnings for workers with relatively low earnings than it does for highwage workers the dollar amounts that define the boundaries of the brackets called bend points increase each year by the rate of growth of the national average wage index5 this keeps the proportion of average earnings multiplied by each factor the same from year to year for workers who reach age 62 in 2005 the pia is 90 of the first 627 of average indexed monthly earnings plus 32 of the next 3152 of average indexed monthly earnings plus 15 of average indexed monthly earnings over 3779 earnings are wageindexed only up to age 60 but the pia is adjusted to reflect changes in price levels after age 62 if the individual claims retirement benefits between age 62 and the full retirement age the pia is increased by the percentage change in the cpi between age 62 and the full retirement age6 the national average wage index the social security administration determines the national average wage each year based on the earnings reports it receives from employers the annual values of the average wage index are used to calculate the factors for indexing earnings up to age 60 the annual percentage change in the average wage index is used to determine the percentage increase in the bend points in the pia formula 4 earnings are indexed only up to age 60 because it can take up to two years for the national earnings data on which the wage indexing series is based to become available 5 the amounts at which the pia factors change are called bend points because when the pia factors are graphed against the aime the graph appears as three lines joined at these points 6 social security disability insurance di benefits are based on the same pia formula as retirement benefits the pia formula applied is based on the year the worker is first entitled to di benefits crs4 calculating aime and the pia table 1 shows how average indexed monthly earnings would be calculated for an individual born on january 1 1940 who retires on july 1 2005 at the full retirement age of 65 and 6 months the individuals earnings history between 1965 and 2004 is shown in the column labeled nominal earnings table 1 shows how the individuals nominal annual earnings would be converted to indexed earnings by applying the indexing factors and how the indexed earnings would be averaged to determine his or her average indexed monthly earnings or aime the individual in this example attained age 62 the first year of eligibility for retirement benefits on january 1 2002 therefore the bend points for the year 2002 are applied to the workers average indexed monthly earnings to calculate this individuals primary insurance amount or pia the bend points for the year 2002 are 592 and 3567 the formula applied to the aime of 3727 is 90 x 592 32 x 3567 592 15 x 3727 3567 150880 the initial pia of 150880 is then increased by the annual percentage change in the cpi for each year between the first year of eligibility and the year the worker reached the full retirement age the percentage changes in the cpi were 14 21 and 27 for 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively the resulting pia is 160410 which is rounded down to 1604 because the individual applied for retirement benefits at the full retirement age his or her retirement benefit is the same as the pia there is reduction for early retirement and delayed retirement credit is applied crs5 table 1 illustration of average indexed monthly earnings nominal average index indexed year earnings us earnings number earnings 1965

history of indexing social security benefits the social security amendments of 1972 prior to the 1970s social security benefits rose only when congress voted to raise them the workers primary insurance amount pia the benefit payable at the full retirement age was computed by comparing his or her average monthly earnings to benefit table established by congress average monthly earnings ame were calculated as simple arithmetic average of the individuals nominal earnings in each year of employment after 1950 average monthly earnings were divided into several brackets and earnings in each bracket were multiplied by the factors prescribed in law prior to the social security amendments of 1972 pl 92336 both the income brackets and the associated factors changed only when congress voted to raise social security benefits as matter of practice when congress voted to increase the benefits of individuals already enrolled in the program they also increased the benefits awarded to new beneficiaries by the same percentage this was done by increasing the pia factors in the formula by which initial benefits were calculated the historical practice of increasing social security benefits only through legislation was changed by the social security amendments of 1972 these amendments increased benefits for persons already receiving social security by 20 and provided for automatic future benefits increases that were to be based on the annual percentage change in the consumer price index the law also directed that the pia factors by which each bracket of careeraverage earnings was multiplied were to increase annually by the same percentage as the benefits of current recipients were increased the amendments also added another earnings bracket to the benefit table each time that the amount of earnings subject to social security taxes the taxable wage base was increased careeraverage earnings continued to be based on nominal careeraverage earnings that is they were not indexed the tables used to calculate the pia for persons who applied for benefits in the years 1975 through 1978 are shown in table 2 table 2 pia computation tables for 1975 to 1978 1975 1976 1977 1978 12948

under the 1972 amendments the first automatic increases to social security benefits were scheduled to occur in 19757 under the benefit formula adopted in 1972 whenever there was costofliving adjustment cola in the benefit paid to people already receiving social security the pia factors in the formula for calculating initial benefits for new recipients were increased by the same percentage these increases were based on the rate of inflation as measured by the cpi in the 1970s there were several years in which the rate of increase in prices exceeded the rate of increase in wages8 because the 1972 amendments increased the pia factors by the rate of price growth whenever prices grew faster than wages benefits grew faster than the wage base from which these benefits would be financed social security costofliving adjustments and the consumer price index after an individual begins to receive social security benefits these payments are indexed to annual increases in the consumer price index which measures changes in the price of market basket of consumer goods and services in 1972 congress provided for annual costofliving adjustments for social security to prevent these benefits from losing purchasing power through the effects of price inflation colas are to ensure that social security beneficiarys monthly check will purchase the same amount of goods and services from year to year that it could purchase at the time the individual first began to receive social security colas do not reflect increases in the labor productivity of people who are still in the work force and thus they do not increase the real purchasing power of social security income colas do not make beneficiaries better off financially they are merely to protect them from becoming financially worseoff over time as prices rise the 1975 social security advisory council the 1975 social security advisory council suggested method for determining initial benefits that would not be affected by costofliving adjustments for current social security recipients this procedure was generally referred to as decoupling the initial benefit computation from the colas applied to current beneficiaries the council recommended that when calculating workers careeraverage earnings their past earnings should be indexed to more current values based on national average wage index this would have the effect of restating all past earnings in terms of what they would be worth in the current labor market thereby eliminating an inequity of unindexed earnings which gave more recent earnings greater weight in determining social security benefits the council further recommended that the bend points in the pia formula should be indexed to increases in the national average wage this would keep replacement rates initial social security benefits as percentage of workers career average earnings stable at 42 of average indexed monthly earnings for career averagewage earner each year the earnings brackets would expand by the percentage increase in the national average wage and each pia factor which would be fixed in law rather than rising each year at the rate of cpi increase would be 7 robert m ball social security amendments of 1972 summary and legislative history social security bulletin march 1973 8 prices grew faster than the national average wage in 1970 1974 1975 1977 and 1979 crs8 applied to the same fraction of average earnings for each successive cohort of retirees the council recommended that annual colas for current beneficiaries should continue to be based on the rate of increase of the cpi thus maintaining the purchasing power of benefits throughout the remainder of each beneficiarys life the social security amendments of 1977 the social security amendments of 1977 pl 95216 largely followed the recommendations of the 1975 advisory council these amendments created the current benefit formula which is based on the workers average indexed monthly earnings aime this law also indexed the bend points that separate the earnings brackets in the benefit formula to the rate of increase in the average wage index the 1977 amendments set the three pia factors that are applied to earnings within each bracket at 90 of aime up to the first bend point 180 in 1979 627 in 2005 32 of aime between the first and second bend points 1085 in 1979 3779 in 2005 and 15 of aime above the second bend point the two elements of the social security benefit formula adopted in 1977 that keep replacement rates constant for each successive generation of retirees are that 1 the pia factors applied to each earnings bracket remain unchanged from year to year and 2 the bend points in the formula for determining the pia are indexed to increases in the national average wage as discussed below indexing past earnings which is part of the computation of aime has little effect on replacement rates over time indexing past earnings to current values mainly affects the distribution of benefits within each cohort of workers rather than the relative size of benefits among successive cohorts of workers9 how wage indexing earnings histories affects benefits until the 1977 amendments were enacted social security benefits were based on workers nominal careeraverage earnings using nominal earnings histories had the effect of treating workers differently based on which years they had worked and when their highest earnings had occurred indexing workers earnings histories to more current values reduces the difference in social security benefits among workers whose ages and real earnings are similar but whose years of employment differed for example consider two workers of the same age claiming benefits in the same year both of whom worked for total of 35 years doing the same job worker worked 35 years from age 30 to 65 while worker b worked 35 years from age 20 to 55 calculating average career earnings without indexing would be advantageous to worker whose earnings occurred more recently and would be higher in nominal terms than worker bs earnings there is however reason why worker as 35 years of earnings should be valued more highly than workers bs 35 years of earnings when calculating their social security benefits unless they also are higher in real terms by expressing the past earnings of workers who retire in the same year in amounts that are more directly comparable to each other indexing past wages to current values eliminates disadvantage that otherwise would undervalue the earnings of workers who either worked more or earned more early in their careers 9 cohort is group of people with common demographic trait such as their year of birth crs9 basing benefits on nominal earnings also had the effect of depressing the benefits of retiredworker beneficiaries relative to disabled workers and survivors of workers who had died while still young because benefits for disabled workers and the survivors of younger workers are based on relatively short earnings histories they are based on more current earnings than those of retired workers the relative disadvantage to retired workers of including many years of earnings from the more distant past is mitigated by indexing those earnings so that they are expressed in terms of their current value in the labor market how wage indexing the bend points affects benefits the percentage of careeraverage earnings replaced by social security is called the replacement rate10 under the current benefit formula in which initial benefits for each generation of workers grow at the same rate as the national average wage replacement rates remain constant from one generation of workers to the next the social security administration has estimated the replacement rate under current law to be 55 of average wages for careerlong lowwage earner 41 for careerlong average wage earner and 27 for worker who always earned the annual maximum taxable wage replacement rates remain stable under current law because 1 the bend points are indexed to wage growth and 2 the pia factors remain fixed from year to year iii how price indexing would affect social security benefits because of increases in worker productivity wages grow faster than prices in the long run consequently one way to slow the growth of benefits would be to convert social security from wageindexed benefits to priceindexed benefits price indexing initial benefits would slow the growth of social security expenditures while maintaining the purchasing power of benefits however because social security benefits would then grow more slowly than workers wages the replacement rate social security benefits as percentage of careeraverage earnings would fall for each successive generation of workers how price indexing earnings histories would affect benefits if past earnings were indexed to the present based on the growth of price index such as the cpi instead of the growth in the average wage index awi workers average indexed monthly earnings would be lower as would the amount of their social security benefits this would permanently reduce the amount of future social security benefits but it would not permanently reduce the rate of growth of future benefits indexing past earnings to current values based on the rate of growth of the cpi would reduce the rate of growth of benefits only during the period of transition 10 replacement rates can be measured against final earnings or careeraverage earnings replacement rates measured against final earnings will almost always be lower than when measured against careeraverage earnings replacement rates measured against indexed careeraverage earnings will almost always be lower than when measured against nominal careeraverage earnings crs10 from wageindexing to priceindexing11 the amount of benefits paid would be lower in every future year but after approximately 40 years at which point all workers entire earnings histories would be fully priceindexed the average indexed monthly earnings of each successive cohort of workers would be higher than the average indexed earnings of the previous cohort by the difference in their nominal average wage just as it is under current law the examples shown in table 3 illustrate how priceindexing past earnings would affect both the amount of benefits and the rate of growth of benefits table 3 average indexed monthly earnings for career averagewage earner with wageindexed earnings and priceindexed earnings wageindexed earnings priceindexed earnings priceindexed earnings vs year average average average average wageindexed monthly annual monthly annual earnings earnings growth earnings growth 2005 2979 523 2476 523 169 2010 3607 390 2967 369 177 2025 6403 390 5305 395 171 2050 16663

trustees based on the ssas historical wageindexing series the average indexed monthly earnings in 2005 of worker who had always earned the national average wage would be approximately 2979 if past earnings were indexed to 2005 using the consumer price index rather than the average wage index the careeraverage earnings of this worker would be 2476 or about 17 lower this difference reflects the fact that wages have grown faster than prices over the 35year indexing period an immediate switch from wageindexing past earnings to priceindexing past earnings would result in reducing the initial social security benefit of career long averagewage earner by approximately 17 thus price indexing of past earnings would result in permanently reducing the level of social security benefits from the benefit levels scheduled to be paid under current law note however that 11 during the transition period from the 1970s to the 1990s when the period over which workers earnings histories were averaged was lengthened from 21 years to 35 years indexing workers earnings histories also contributed to maintaining stable replacement rates otherwise with each year added to the averaging period significantly lower because unindexed year of earnings would have been added to the benefit computation thereby tending to make the workers aime and pia lower relative to his or her final earnings indexing past earnings converts these lower values into an amount comparable to what they would be worth if they had been earned more recently crs11 the rate of growth of benefits would eventually be exactly the same under price indexing of past earnings as it would be under wageindexing of past earnings provided that prices grow more slowly than wages priceindexed earnings will always be lower than wageindexed earnings but regardless of the method used to index past wages to the present the average indexed career earnings of each successive cohort of workers would exceed the average indexed career earnings of the preceding cohort by the difference in their nominal average wage12 how price indexing the bend points would affect benefits if the bend points in the pia formula were indexed to prices which in the long run grow more slowly than wages replacement rates would decline because as wages grow over time more of workers earnings would be included in the upper two brackets of the benefit formula to which lower pia factors are applied eventually workers would find most of their careeraverage earnings in the top bracket and the replacement rate would be nearly the same for all workers regardless of their average earnings the benefit formula would be less progressive than under current law the examples shown in table 4 illustrate how price indexing the bend points of the pia formula would affect both the amount of benefits and the rate of growth of benefits panel illustrates the increases in the bend points under current law the bend points are adjusted upward annually by the rate of growth of the national average wage because the bend points grow at the same rate as wages the percentage of wages that falls in each earnings bracket remains the same from one generation to the next in this example about 21 of the careeraverage earnings of an average wageearner would be in the lowest earnings bracket multiplied by the 90 replacement factor in 2080 which is the same percentage of earnings in the lowest bracket in 2005 likewise with the bend points wageindexed about 79 of the careeraverage earnings of an average wageearner would be in the second earnings bracket multiplied by the 32 replacement factor in 2080 which is also the percentage of earnings in the second bracket in 2005 if the bend points were to be priceindexed rather than wageindexed they would grow more slowly than workers earnings and over time more of those earnings would fall into the higher earnings brackets and be multiplied by lower pia factors this is illustrated in panel b of table 4 with the bend points priceindexed only about 10 of the careeraverage earnings of an average wageearner would be in the lowest earnings bracket multiplied by the 90 replacement factor in 2080 which is less than half of the percentage of earnings in the lowest bracket if the bend points are wageindexed only about 48 of the careeraverage earnings of an average wageearner would be in the second earnings bracket multiplied by the 32 replacement factor in 2080 which is 31 percentage points lower than the percentage of earnings in the second bracket under wageindexing finally with the bend points priceindexed about third of the careeraverage earnings of an averagewage earner 12 table 3 shows the effect on average benefits of an immediate switch from wageindexing to priceindexing of past earnings in practice this would create large downward notch in benefits if price indexing of past earnings were phased in one year at time the notch would be avoided but benefit reductions and the annual reduction in outlays would be smaller for each year until all workers career earnings were fully priceindexed crs12 would be in the top earnings bracket multiplied by the 15 replacement factor in 2080 under wage indexing none of the earnings of careerlong averagewage earner would be subject to the 15 replacement factor in 2080 while price indexing the bend points would reduce the rate of growth of benefits it also would substantially erode the progressivity of the benefit formula eventually workers at all levels of careeraverage earnings would find large percentage of their earnings

indexing the pia factors would affect benefits another way to priceindex initial benefits rather than indexing past earnings or the bend points to price increases would be to reduce the pia factors each year by the ratio of the cpi to the awi if the pia factors were reduced each year by the ratio of the consumer price index to the average wage index then 1 the progressivity of the benefit formula would be maintained 2 the purchasing power of benefits would be maintained because benefits would grow at the same rate as prices 3 replacement rates would fall for each succeeding generation of workers preceding the adoption of the 1977 amendments congress considered proposal under which the pia factors would have been reduced by onehalf of the increase in real wages each year from 1988 through 2030 replacement rates would crs13 have declined during this period and then risen in years after 2030 the timing of the decline in replacement rates was intended to coincide approximately with the period during which the ratio of workers to retirees would be falling this method of indexing initial benefits was not included in the 1977 social security amendments recommendations of the 2001 presidents commission in 2001 president bush appointed commission to recommend policy options for restoring social security to longterm fiscal solvency the president provided the commission with several guiding principles including the requirement that the reformed system must include individual accounts the commission developed three alternative models for reform all of which incorporated individual accounts according to the commissions final report model 2 is the one most likely to result in permanent solvency for social security in part because it would index future benefits to the growth rate of prices rather than wages the commission argued that given the age distribution of the us population the current wageindexed benefit formula is fiscally unsustainable13 it concluded that if the benefit formula were indexed to grow with prices rather than wages the system would be put on path to permanent solvency the commissions final report recommended the following method of price indexing benefits modify the primary insurance amount pia formula factors 90 32 and 15 starting in 2009 reducing them successively by the measured real wage growth in the second prior year modified pia factors would be applicable for oasdi beneficiaries becoming eligible for benefits in 2009 and later this provision would result in increasing benefit levels for individuals with equivalent lifetime earnings across generations relative to the average wage level at the rate of price growth increase in the cpi rather than at the rate of growth in the average wage level as in current law calculation of the average indexed monthly earnings aime used in computing the pia would be unaffected by this provision14 the method of price indexing initial social security benefits recommended by the presidents commission would multiply the pia factors each year by the ratio of the cpi to the awi for the second prior year workers past earnings and the bend points in the benefit formula would continue to be indexed to the rate of growth of the national average wage index if for example prices in particular year grew by 28 and wages grew by 39 each of the pia factors would be multiplied by 10281039 989 because increases in worker productivity cause wages to rise faster than prices the pia factors would fall and social security replacement rates would decline 13 the problem is not that wageindexed system of benefits is inherently unsustainable but rather that the future decline in the ratio of workers to retirees in the united states will cause the benefits payable under current law to exceed the income to social security from payroll taxes and interest 14 memo from stephen goss ssa chief actuary to the commission january 31 2002 crs14 the social security administration has estimated the longterm rates of growth of prices and wages will be 28 per year and 39 per year respectively15 under this assumption after 75 years of multiplying the pia factors by the ratio of price growth to wage growth the 90 pia factor would fall to 405 the 32 factor would fall to144 and the 15 factor would fall to 67 all three factors would continue to fall into the indefinite future the replacement rate for career average wage earner retiring at the full retirement age in 2080 would fall from 39 under current law to 16 under full priceindexing16 this method of priceindexing would maintain the progressivity of the social security benefit formula in any year the percentage reduction in benefits would be the same for workers at all levels of careeraverage earnings for example table 5 shows that lowwage averagewage and highwage earners retiring in 2030 would receive the same percent reduction to their social security benefits table 5 reduction in social security benefits under price indexing for workers retiring at the full retirement age in 2030 social security benefit career earnings current model 2 percent law price indexing change lowwage earner 1615 1333 174 averagewage earner 2769 2286 174 highwage earner 4673 3859 174 source estimates prepared by the congressional research service based on data in the 2005 report of the social security trustees according to the ssa fully priceindexing initial benefits would more than restore solvency to social security full price indexing would cut benefits by 207 of taxable payroll which is more than is needed to offset the projected revenue shortfall of 192 of taxable payroll the size of the benefit reduction relative to that required to achieve solvency can be seen for averagewage workers born in different years in figure 1 figure 1 shows the size of the social security benefit reductions over time assuming that priceindexed benefit formula is implemented in 201217 the difference in benefit levels increases for each successive each birth 15 in the march 2005 trustees report the longrun rate of inflation is estimated to be 28 and the longrun rate of nominal wage growth is estimated to be 39 these growth rates would yield longterm annual growth rate of real wages of 10391028 107 16 due to the increase in the full retirement age to 67 scheduled under current law the replacement rate for an averagewage earner who claims benefits at the full retirement will fall from 42 in 2005 to 39 age in 2080 17 the year 2012 was selected for this analysis because the president has indicated that those workers currently age 55 and over would not be affected by social security reform proposals the pia formula is based upon the year of eligibility age 62 for retirement continued crs15 cohort for worker born in 2010 the reduction due to price indexing would be 25 larger than the reduction that would take place under current law after the trust funds are exhausted figure 1 social security benefits for scaled averagewage worker under currentlaw compared to priceindexing constant 2005 dollars 3000 social security benefit in constant 2005 dollars 2500 2000 1500 1000 current law promised benefits current law payable benefits 500 price indexed benefits 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 year of birth source congressional research service estimates note assumes priceindexed benefits are implemented in 2012 and all other currentlaw provisions remain unchanged the promised benefit is that which is scheduled to be paid under current law the payable benefit is that which could be paid using only social security tax revenues after the social security trust funds are depleted figure 1 also shows that the purchasing power of social security benefits would be maintained under price indexing under current law social security benefits increase in real value for each generation of workers because benefits are indexed to wages which rise faster than prices in the long run under price indexing the real value of social security benefits would remain flat each year because they would be indexed to prices thus the purchasing power of social security benefits would remain the same for future generations 17 continued benefits thus in order for those currently age 55 and over to be held harmless the price indexing could not begin until these workers are age 62 in 2012 crs16 progressive price indexing of initial benefits as discussed above even small annual reduction in the pia factors would result in substantial reductions in benefits when compounded over many years this could have especially serious implications for the retirement income of lowwage workers who are less likely to have employersponsored pensions retirement savings or other sources of retirement income one way to preserve benefits for lowwage workers would be through progressive priceindexing of initial benefits under progressive price indexing the initial benefits of lowwage workers would continue to be fully wageindexed the benefits of averagewage workers would be based on mix of wageindexing and priceindexing and the benefits of highwage workers would be fully priceindexed implementing progressive priceindexing of initial benefits would require workers to be segregated into three categories based on their careeraverage earnings congress would have to define the earnings thresholds for lowwage workers who would continue to have their initial benefits fully wageindexed and for highwage workers whose initial benefits would be fully priceindexed workers whose careeraverage earnings fall between these two amounts would have their initial benefits determined through mix of wageindexing and priceindexing under progressive price indexing the reduction in total social security outlays would be smaller than if all workers benefits were fully priceindexed the difference in total outlays would depend in part on the proportion of workers whose initial benefits would continue to be fully wageindexed the total reduction in outlays also would depend on whether benefits for highwage earners would be reduced by the same percentage as they would have been cut if full price indexing had been applied to all workers or if larger reductions would be made in the benefits of highwage earners if benefits for highwage workers were cut by greater percentage than they would have been cut under full priceindexing for all workers then the difference in total savings achieved by full priceindexing and progressive priceindexing would be smaller the precise benefit reduction for workers at each earnings level would depend on the policy goals that congress wishes to achieve through priceindexing benefits how progressive price indexing would work the social security administration has described method of progressive priceindexing for individuals who become eligible for retiredworker benefits in 2012 and later18 this would be done in three steps first ssa would compute the percentage benefit reduction that would apply for career highwage earner if all three of the pia factors 90 32 and 15 were fully priceindexed19 for example if the benefit for career high wage earner retiring at the full retirement age in future year were determined to be say 2800 per month and the percentage changes in prices and wages since the base year were 28 and 39 respectively the benefit for highwage earner would be recalculated with each of the three pia factors multiplied by the ratio 10281039 or 18 memorandum from stephen goss chief actuary of the social security administration to robert pozen february 10 2005 see httpwwwssagovoactsolvencyrpozen_20050210pdf 19 this would be done as described in model 2 of the presidents 2001commission to strengthen social security see httpwwwcsssgovreportsfinal_reportpdf crs17 989 thus in this example the benefit of highwage earner under full price indexing would be reduced by 11 in the first year that price indexing was in effect after ten years assuming that prices and wages continued to grow annually by 28 and 39 the pia factors would be multiplied by 102810103910 899 representing benefit reduction of 101 the benefits of lowwage workers would be preserved by establishing new bend point in the pia formula below which initial benefits would continue to be fully wageindexed in the proposal studied by ssa this new bend point would be established at the 30th percentile of earnings workers with careeraverage earnings in the lowest 30 of the earnings distribution would continue to have their initial benefits fully wageindexed ssa has historically defined lowwage worker as one with earnings less than or equal to 45 of the average wage congress could of course define lowwage workers in any of number of ways depending on the relative importance it assigns to reducing program costs compared to maintaining the benefits of lowwage workers the higher the earnings level defined as lowwage the deeper the benefit cuts for higherwage workers would have to be in order to achieve the same total reduction in outlays the new bend point would increase each year by the rate of growth of the national average wage just as the two current bend points are wageindexed ssa has estimated that bend point at the 30th percentile of average monthly earnings would be located 286 of the way up from the current first bend point to the current second bend point this would put the new bend point at about 2000 in 2012 the first year of progressive price indexing in the proposal analyzed by ssa all retired workers with careeraverage earnings below this new bend point would continue to have their initial benefits fully wageindexed the 90 pia factor would apply to average monthly earnings up to the first bend point and the 32 pia factor would apply to average monthly earnings between the first bend point and the new second bend point the third step of the process would be to calculate the percentage reduction to the pia factors above the new bend point 32 and 15 that would result in the same benefit reduction for careerlong maximumwage earners those always at or above the annual maximum taxable wage as would have applied to these earners if price indexing had been applied to all workers this would reduce benefits for careerlong maximumwage earners by the same percentage as they would have been reduced if the benefit formula were fully priceindexed for workers at all earnings levels benefits would be reduced by smaller percentage for workers with career long average wages and not at all for workers with average wages that fall in the lowest 30 of the earnings distribution ssa has estimated that this method of price indexing would reduce the longrun social security deficit by 14 of taxable payroll or about 74 of the estimated 75year deficit of 19 of taxable payroll estimated effect on benefits of progressive price indexing table 6 illustrates the effects in 2030 of full price indexing and of progressive price indexing on hypothetical workers with maximum average and low careeraverage crs18 earnings20 if full priceindexing of initial benefits were to be implemented in 2012 and if prices and wages were to grow at 28 per year and 39 respectively for each year thereafter by 2030 the three pia factors in the benefit formula would be multiplied by factor of 826 representing the ratio of price increases to wage increases over the period from 2012 to 2030 this would reduce each pia factor by 174 under full priceindexing the initial benefits of all new beneficiaries would be reduced by this percentage under the method of progressive priceindexing described by ssa benefits would continue to be wageindexed for all workers whose careeraverage earnings fall in the lowest 30 of the earnings distribution to achieve this objective new bend point would be established about 286 of the way between the current first and second bend points below this new bend point which would fall in the earnings bracket to which the 32 pia factor now applies the 90 and 32 pia factors would continue to be applied each year above this new bend point both the 32 and 15 pia factors would be reduced by greater percentage than they would have been reduced under full priceindexing so that the percentage reduction that would apply to maximumwage earners would be the same as under full price indexing for all workers table 6 shows that with prices and wages growing at 28 and 39 per year in order to achieve the same percentage reduction in benefits in 2030 for maximum wage earners under progressive price indexing as under full price indexing the 32 factor above the new bend point and the 15 factor would have to be reduced by 26621 reducing the top two pia factors by 266 would reduce the pia of maximumwage earners by the same amount as would 174 reduction applied to all three original pia factors progressive price indexing would reduce the pia of averagewage workers by smaller percentage than would full indexing in this example benefits for averagewage worker would be reduced by 121 in 2030 workers with careeraverage earnings in the lowest 30 of the earnings distribution would not experience any cut in benefits table 7 and table 8 show the estimated effects on initial benefits of full priceindexing and progressive priceindexing in 2055 and in 2080 20 these examples illustrate how price indexing would be applied to the pia factors they show the approximate effects of price indexing on the primary insurance amount of hypothetical workers with high medium and low career earnings 21 it would be necessary to apply this greater reduction to the pia of the highwage earner because some of the earnings of these individuals would fall in the two lowest earnings brackets to which the 90 and 32 pia factors would continue to be applied crs19 table 6 estimated primary insurance amounts at full retirement age in 2030 under full price indexing

priceindexing initial benefits the reduction in future social security benefits under either full priceindexing or progressive priceindexing would depend on the difference between wage growth and the rate of inflation this is called real wage growth for example if prices rise by 3 and wages grow by 4 then real wage growth would be 1 and the pia factors would be multiplied by 103104 or 99 however if wages grow by 45 and prices rise by 3 real wage growth would be 15 and the pia factors would be multiplied by 1031045 or 985 faster growth of real wages would lead to deeper cuts in benefits if wages were to rise faster than currently forecast for number of years the reduction in future benefits would be substantially deeper than originally estimated for example the social security trustees intermediate or best guesseconomic assumptions project that in the long run prices will grow by 28 per year and wages will grow by 39 per year this would result in longrun rate of real wage growth of 11 if all three pia factors were reduced annually by 107 after 75 years the 90 pia factor would be reduced to 405 the 32 factor would be reduced to 144 and the 15 factor would be reduced to 67 however if instead real wages were to grow by 15 then after 75 years the 90 would be reduced to 304 the 32 factor would be reduced to 108 and the 15 factor would be reduced to 51 faster real wage growth would reduce the need for future benefit cuts to restore social security to fiscal solvency because it would produce higher payroll taxes to the trust fund many years in advance of the higher benefit payments that those higher wages also would produce the social security administration office of the actuary for example has estimated that annual real wage growth of 16 would reduce the 75year unfunded liability of social security from 192 of payroll to 139 of payroll reduction of 2822 thus somewhat paradoxically if real wages rise faster than projected price indexing would result in deeper benefit cuts even as social securitys unfunded 75year liability would be shrinking similarly if real wage growth falls short of the 11 annual rate projected by the social security administration the benefit reductions that price indexing would generate would be smaller than estimated and the programs unfunded liability would grow larger the method of priceindexing social security benefits recommended in model 2 of the presidents commission would reduce the pia factors each year by the ratio of the consumer price index to the average wage index this process would reduce the pia factors into the indefinite future however the ratio of workers to retirees will not continue to fall indefinitely therefore it may not be necessary for replacement rates to continue to fall indefinitely if congress were to choose this method of price indexing benefits it could leave it up to future congresses to decide if the pia factors should continue to be reduced or legislation that implements price indexing could specify the conditions under which the pia factors would longer be priceindexed and replacement rates would be stabilized23 22 2005 annual report of the board of trustees table vid4 p 153 23 congress also would have to decide whether the same procedures would be applied in years when prices grow faster than wages this occurred 18 times between 1940 and 2004 crs23 progressive price indexing would lead to the same benefit for most workers the current social security benefit formula is progressive in that the replacement rate is higher for lowwage workers than for highwage workers nevertheless the current benefit formula also is designed to recognize the greater amount of payroll taxes paid by highwage workers it does this by paying higher benefits to highwage workers than to lowwage workers under the method of progressive price indexing analyzed by ssa and described in this report most workers eventually would be paid the same monthly benefit this would occur because the pia factors applied to the two higher earnings brackets would be reduced each year while the pia factors applied to the two lower earnings brackets would remain unchanged eventually the pia factors applied to the upper two earnings brackets would be reduced to zero at that point initial benefits would be the same for all workers with earnings in the top 70 of the earnings distribution the congressional research service estimates that this would occur approximately 90 years following the implementation of progressive price indexing as described by ssa assuming longrun real wage growth of 11 per year as noted earlier however congress could identify in any legislation that implemented price indexing the conditions such as elimination of social securitys longterm deficit under which the reduction of benefits through price indexing would longer continue iv other elements of social security that might be affected by priceindexing benefits because price indexing would alter the pia formula it is important to consider the potential consequences of such change on other social security provisions that are either based upon the pia formula or based upon the concept of wage indexing windfall elimination provision wep under current law the windfall elimination provision wep reduces the social security benefits of workers who also have pension benefits from employment not covered by social security eg employment under the federal civil service retirement system or some state and local governments its purpose is to remove an advantage these workers would otherwise receive because social securitys benefit formula favors workers with smaller amounts of social securitycovered career earnings under the wep the 90 factor in the first band of the regular pia formula is replaced by factor of 40 lesser reductions apply to workers with 21 through 30 years of substantial covered employment as follows years of social security coverage 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 first factor in 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 formula the effect of replacing the 90 formula factor with lower factor is to lower the proportion of their earnings in the first bracket that are converted to benefits24 24 for additional information on the wep please refer to crs report 9835 social continued crs24 because the wep pia formula is based upon the currentlaw pia formula for all but the first pia factor priceindexing would automatically change the 32 and 15 factors for both the regular pia and the wep pia formula however the first wep pia factor 40 or whatever based on years of coverage is written into law and would not automatically change with the reduction in the regular pia formula thus if priceindexing were to be implemented and action were not taken to alter the wep provision eventually the reduction to the 90 formula factor would be large enough to bring this factor down to and in some cases below the level of the currentlaw wep formula factor for example under the currentlaw wep worker with 25 years of coverage would have the 90 pia factor replaced with 65 factor under full priceindexing the 90 factor is gradually reduced and would reach 65 by 2041 thus worker who spent their entire career contributing to social security and becomes eligible to retire in 2041 would have pia formula identical to worker who contributed for only 25 years for those regular social securitycontributing workers becoming eligible in future years the first formula factor would continue to fall while the wep beneficiary is held harmless from this reduction in order to maintain the intent of the wep provision and avoid penalizing workers who contribute to the social security system for their entire careers the wep provision would need to specify that the same price indexing reduction would apply to whatever first pia formula factor would have applied to the worker under current law benefits paid to family members based on the workers earnings record in addition to the workers retirement benefits social security provides benefits auxiliary benefits to other family members eg the workers spouse divorced spouse young children and dependent parents who are eligible to receive benefits based on the workers social security earnings record as of december 2004 approximately 31 million children and spouses received benefits based on retired workers benefits approximately 67 million children and spouses received benefits based on deceased workers benefits and approximately 18 million children and spouses received benefits based on disabled workers benefits25 in each case the workers pia is the basis for calculating these benefit amounts for example while the worker is still alive spouse retiring at the full retirement age is eligible to receive social security benefit equal to 50 of the workers pia child under age 18 or under age 19 if he or she is full time student in elementary or high school is eligible to receive benefit equal to 50 of the workers pia thus any reduction in the workers pia automatically translates into reduction in benefits for every individual who would be eligible to receive benefits on this workers earnings record for example as shown previously in table 6 under full price indexing the pia of scaled average wage worker retiring in 2030 at the full retirement age would be reduced by about 17 if the workers pia were 2769 under current law under price indexing it would be reduced to 2286 thus assuming the worker is still alive the spousal benefit would be reduced from about 1385 to 1143 13 reduction any children eligible for benefits would also see 24 continued security the windfall elimination provision wep by laura haltzel 25 social security administration 2005 social securityssi factsheet available at httpwwwssagovlegislation2005_factsheetdoc crs25 their benefits reduced by 13 if this result is undesirable congress could specify that these beneficiaries be held harmless from price indexing however this exemption would also reduce the savings generated by this provision in some cases there may be multiple individuals who are eligible to receive social security benefits based on one workers earnings history the combination of benefits paid to these family members is subject to dollar limit the maximum family benefit mfb which is based on the workers pia when the total monthly social security benefits paid to eligible family members exceeds the mfb each benefit that is based on the workers earnings history other than the workers own benefit and benefits paid to former spouse is reduced proportionately until the total benefits paid fall below the mfb the maximum family benefit is based upon the pia of the insured worker thus any reduction in the pia reduces the maximum combined benefit that can be paid to eligible family members continuing the example above where the workers pia would be reduced to 2286 the spousal benefit and childrens benefits would be reduced from about 1385 to 1143 because the maximum family benefits are directly linked to the pia the mfb would also be reduced from 5176 under current law to 3862 potentially leading to additional benefit reductions for these family members table 9 example of how the maximum family benefit would work under current law vs priceindexing of the pia scaled averagewage worker with spouse and three eligible children price current indexing law of pia individual benefit amount each family member is eligible to receive 1385 1143 total family benefit prior to mfb 5540 4572 maximum family benefit after workers pia has been subtracted 2407 1576 reduction in total family benefit required under mfb 3133 2996 resulting individual social security benefit for each family member 602 394 percent reduction due to maximum family benefit 57 66 source estimates prepared by the congressional research service as seen in table 9 if the scaled averagewage worker above had spouse and three children under the age of 18 this family would have were it not for the mfb qualified for spousal benefit of 1385 and three childrens benefits of 1385 each for total of 5540 under current law this 5540 total would exceed the 2407 maximum family benefit by 3133 thus each of the family members benefits would be reduced in equal proportion to 602 each reduction of 57 under price crs26 indexing of the pia because of the workers lower pia this family would have qualified for spousal benefit of 1143 and three childrens benefits of 1143 each for total of 4572 because price indexing automatically reduces the mfb as well as individual family member benefits this 4572 total exceeds the price indexed mfb of 1576 by 2996 thus each of the family benefits would be reduced in equal proportion to 394 each reduction of 66 social security components indexed to average wages in addition to social security benefits there are many other social security components that are currently indexed with the increase in the national average wage the social security contribution and benefit base ie maximum taxable earnings the old law contribution and benefit base exempt amounts under the retirement earnings test the formula for computing maximum family benefits mfb the amount of earnings needed to earn quarter of coverage under social security coverage thresholds for domestic and election workers substantial gainful activity amounts for di beneficiaries the amount of earning affecting trial work period for di beneficiaries social security contribution and benefit base social security taxes are levied on earnings up to maximum level set each year in 2005 this maximum or what is referred to as the taxable earnings base is 90000 the taxable earnings base serves as both cap on contributions and cap on benefits as contribution base it establishes the maximum amount of earnings for each worker that is subject to the payroll tax as benefit base it establishes the maximum amount of earnings used to calculate benefits under current law the social security contribution and benefit base increases with the growth in the national average wage if this amount continued to increase in line with wages while benefits increased in line with prices over time the portion of preretirement earnings that would be replaced by social security benefits upon retirement would decline if the contribution and benefit base were price indexed rather than wage indexed benefit amounts and replacement rates for average and lowwage workers would be unchanged benefits would be reduced only for high wage and maximum wage workers who would pay less in taxes as the base fell relative to their earnings high wage and maximum wage workers would also have lower benefits than if just the pia were price indexed as the amount of earnings that are counted towards benefits would also decrease therefore price indexing the contribution and benefit base would reduce the replacement rate for higher wage workers more sharply than would price indexing the pia in addition to these effects on benefits and replacement rates of higher earners social security revenues would fall lowering the growth rate of the taxable maximum would also lower the growth rate of revenues into the social security system which reduces the solvency savings from price indexing the pia oldlaw contribution and benefit base the oldlaw contribution and benefit base is the base that would have been effective without enactment of the 1977 amendments to the social security act under current law this base is indexed to crs27 increases in the national average wage in 2005 the oldlaw base is 66900 substantially smaller than the currentlaw contribution and benefit base of 90000 the oldlaw base is used by the social security administration to determine year of coverage in computing the special minimum benefit and to calculate year of coverage in computing benefits for those subject to the wep this base is also used by the railroad retirement program to determine tax liabilities and tier ii benefits payable under railroad retirement to supplement the tier 1 benefits which correspond to basic social security benefits the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc uses the oldlaw base to determine the maximum amount of pension guaranteed under the employee retirement income security act erisa thus priceindexing the oldlaw base would increase financial protections for some social security beneficiaries by reducing the earnings required to obtain year of coverage under certain social security provisions but the same step would also reduce protection provided to pensioners under the railroad retirement system and by the pbgc exempt amounts under the retirement earnings test the retirement earnings test ret reduces social security benefits for those below the full retirement age who have income from work that exceeds certain dollar thresholds in 2005 social security withholds 1 in benefits for every 2 of earnings in excess of 12000 if 2005 is not the year the worker reaches the full retirement age if 2005 is the year the worker reaches the full retirement age higher exempt amount applies to earnings made in months prior to the month of attaining the full retirement age for those months social security withholds 1 in benefits for every 3 of earnings over 31800 the dollar thresholds are indexed annually with the increase in the national average wage as result when wages increase from year to year approximately the same proportion of workers earnings is subject to the ret price indexing social security benefits alone would not alter this structure although the 1 benefit reduction would be larger percentage of the smaller price indexed benefit however if both social security benefits and the exempt amounts subject to the ret were price indexed the growth rate in the real wages being earned by workers would exceed the growth rate of the exempt amounts this change would push more and more wages over the exempt amount making the same level of benefits subject to larger reduction under the ret formula for computing maximum family benefits mfb under current law the formula for the maximum family benefit is structured similarly to that of the currentlaw pia formula for the family of worker who becomes age 62 or dies in 2005 before attaining age 62 the total amount of benefits payable may not exceed26 150 of the first 801 of the workers pia plus 272 of the workers pia over 801 through 1156 plus 134 of the workers pia over 1156 through 1508 plus 175 of the workers pia over 1508 26 special formula is used for computing the maximum benefits payable to the family of disabled worker crs28 as with the currentlaw pia formula the dollar amount bend points connected to each replacement factor are indexed to increases in the national average wage logical question to ask if the regular pia bend points are price indexed is whether the mfb formula factors should also be indexed as discussed above even without making any changes to the mfb formula factors the family benefit based on an insured workers earnings record will be reduced relative to current law this reduction is due to the link between the workers pia family members benefits and the mfb continuing the example from table 9 above if the mfb formula factors were also priceindexed in line with the pia factors the new mfb would be 904 this new mfb is 3668 smaller than what the family members would qualify for based on the spouses pia thus each family members benefit would be reduced to 226 reduction of 80 due to the mfb this large reduction occurs because each beneficiary is affected twice by price indexing 1 through the reduction of the mfb that occurs automatically when the workers pia is decreased and 2 through the reduction of the mfb factors by priceindexing coverage for social security benefits in order to be insured for social security retirement benefits traditional workers must have earned 40 quarters of coverage by working in social security covered positions27 the amount of earnings required for quarter of coverage in 2005 is 920 and this dollar amount increases automatically each year with increases in the national average wage index workers can earn more than 4 quarters of coverage in year domestic employees and election workers are subject to special coverage thresholds to qualify for social security benefits in 2005 domestic worker must earn at least 1400 in single private home to obtain coverage and this amount is indexed annually with the increase in the national average wage election workers must earn 1200 in 2005 to qualify for social security coverage this amount is also indexed annually to the increase in the national average wage price indexing social security benefits would not affect the quarters of coverage or coverage thresholds needed to qualify for social security benefits however it would create disconnect between the cost of the coverage earned and the benefits ultimately received if the earnings required to obtain quarter of coverage were also priceindexed lower paid workers would find it easier to meet the coverage requirement because the growth in wages would exceed the growth in the coverage thresholds thus priceindexing the quarters of coverage or coverage thresholds could lead more workers to ultimately qualify for social security benefits which is beneficial from coverage standpoint but potentially costly from the standpoint of solvency substantial gainful activity amounts for disabled workers to be eligible for social security disability benefits person must be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity sga person who earns more than certain monthly amount net of impairmentrelated work expenses is typically considered 27 fewer quarters of coverage are required to be eligible for disability benefits or for survivor benefits that are based on workers earnings record crs29 to be engaging in sga and would not be eligible for di benefits the amount of monthly earnings considered as sga depends on the type of disability the social security act specifies higher sga amount for statutorily blind individuals while federal regulations specify lower sga amount for nonblind individuals in 2005 the sga for statutorily blind individuals is 1380 for nonblind individuals the 2005 sga is 830 both sga levels increase annually with increases in the national average wage although price indexing the pia would automatically reduce the disability benefits of those eligible for di benefits this form of price indexing would not affect disabled individuals ability to qualify for these benefits however if the sga levels were also subject to price indexing the growth in earnings would outpace the growth in the sga ultimately leading fewer individuals with disabilities to qualify for di benefits not because of increased ability or work effort but just due to the difference between price growth and wage growth trial work period for disabled workers after an individual becomes eligible for disability benefits the person may attempt to return to the work force to encourage di beneficiaries to test their ability to work social security provides trial work period in which the beneficiary may have earnings and still collect di benefits social security does not consider disability to have ended until disabled worker is able to perform certain level of services for at least nine months not necessarily consecutive out of rolling 60month period in 2005 any month in which the disabled workers earnings exceed 590 is considered to be month of services this dollar threshold is indexed to the annual increase in the national average wage price indexing social security benefits would not directly affect the level of earnings considered to qualify as month of services for the disability trial work period however if the trial work period dollar threshold were also price indexed the growth in earnings would outpace the growth in the trial work period threshold ultimately causing more individuals with disabilities to lose their di benefits not because of increased ability or work effort but just due to the difference between price growth and wage growth this reduction in the trial work period threshold may therefore create disincentive for those currently receiving di benefits to attempt returning to work v conclusion social security faces longterm deficit in the income dedicated to the program compared to the benefits promised under current law one way to restore the program to longterm financial solvency would be to slow the growth of benefits under current law social security benefits are indexed to growth in the national average wage they increase from one generation to the next at the rate that the national average wage rises basing initial benefits on the rate at which prices rise rather than the rate at which wages rise would slow the growth rate of benefits because in the long run prices grow more slowly than wages price indexing initial benefits for all beneficiaries would result in small annual reductions in initial benefits but the cumulative reductions would be substantial when compounded over many years this could have serious implications for low wage workers who depend heavily on social security as source of retirement income price indexing initial benefits also would make deeper cuts in benefits if wages grow faster than projected even as social securitys financial situation would crs30 be improving likewise if wages grow more slowly than projected price indexing would make smaller cuts in benefits leading to larger longterm financing deficit one way to preserve benefits for lowwage workers would be through progressive priceindexing of initial benefits under progressive priceindexing the initial benefits of lowwage workers would continue to be fully wageindexed the benefits of averagewage workers would be based on mix of wageindexing and price indexing and the benefits of highwage workers would be fully priceindexed president bush has suggested that congress consider progressive priceindexing of social security as means of restoring social security to financial solvency the social security administration has analyzed method of progressive priceindexing that would continue to wageindex social security benefits for workers with career average earnings in the lowest 30 of the earnings distribution ssa has estimated that this proposal would eliminate about threefourths of the programs 75year unfunded liability one consequence of this method of progressive priceindexing would be that eventually all workers with earnings in the top 70 of the earnings distribution would receive the same benefit for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32900
