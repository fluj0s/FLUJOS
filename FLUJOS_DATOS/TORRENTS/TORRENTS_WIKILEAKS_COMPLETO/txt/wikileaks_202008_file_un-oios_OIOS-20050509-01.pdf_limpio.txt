gender and age the increasing use of baseline data and the ad option of more analytical approach as the number of reports required by unhcr had been reduce d by late 2005 quality was expected to improve c goal irelanddeveloping together 15 in 2005 goal ireland has handed over the i mplementation of this project to local ngo developing together dt dt has budgeted amount of 169605 us 212000

agreements with partner s standards and indicators were not properly defined without proper performance and impact indi cators the success of projects cannot be effectively measured oios noted that although the number of beneficiaries and percentage increase indicators were included in the document actual numbers or percentages were given to allow planned outputs against the actual r esults to be measured oios reviewed the changes introduced in 2005 with ocm and implementin g partners and suggested that when exact figures cannot be projected maximum and mini mum figures be stated ocm stated that during 20052006 it had made an enormous effort to review and adjust project documents with the view to enhancing their overall quality when p ossible actual numbers percentages and benchmarks had been incorporated 17 oios assessed that project financial monit oring could be more effective with more in depth reviews conducted and more detailed monitorin g procedures established for example in 2003 and 2004 financial monitoring visits to implem enting partners were performed only once year in oios opinion they were not sufficientl indepth and resulted in only insignificant errors being highlighted there was lack of excha nge of information between field offices and ocm which should have taken place before the f inancial monitoring visit ocm has started to refocus and strengthen its monitoring f operational activities unhcr finalized and attached to all 2006 subproject agreements joint unhcrimplementing partner 2006 workplan for enhanced financial monitoring an d control ocm would reinforce the staff involved in financial monitoring onsite revi ews by including personnel from administration and logistics c supply management 18 procurement of the ocm totalled 11 milli on us 14 million in 20032004 oios found that there were clear division of responsi bilities between the supply function and administration procurement plans were not prepared and items such as stationery were purchased on casebycase basis rather than enter ing into frame agreement while oios appreciates the staffing constraints as unv in t he supply section left the office in 2005 increasing the workload of the supply officer and national logistics assistant efforts are required to initiate proper systems and procedures to ensure costeffective purchasing ocm has completely centralized procurement activities w ithin the supply unit with only administration and programme units now only respons ible for the requisition process also in february 2006 ocm signed frame agreement for the supply of stationery 6 19 in kosovo ocm procured fuel for its requi rements however implementing partners had entered into separate contracts the budgeted f igure for these separate arrangements which included vat amounted to 84300 us 104300 in 2005 in oios opinion by combining the two procurements economies of scale could be chieved as it would enable partners to obtain fuel net of vat which is 15 per cent of the purchase price oios estimated potential savings of 25000 us 31000 over twoyear per iod ocm stated that the possibility of centralizing fuel procurement is being reviewed in order to identify the best solution upon finalization of this phase ocm would consider the actual implementation in line with similar practices currently in place in serbia and monteneg ro issuing fuel vouchers to all implementing partners for fuel supply at the centra l unhcrcontracted fuelling stations oios is again pleased at the positive action taken and will monitor this recommendation for which ocm has set the target date for implementatio n is 1 july 2006 recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission pristina should centralize fuel purchases of the ocm and implementi ng partners and determine feasible and costeffectiv solution with current or potential suppliers in order to ach ieve cost savings amounting to some us 31000 over twoyea r period rec04 20 oios review of warehousing and stock mana gement procedures found that systems were in place and operating effectively during the period under review oios noted however that there were number of slow moving items for example there were over 35000 blankets valued at us 108000 procured between 1999 and 2 001 still in stock as well as nearly 200000 sanitary napkins valued at us 35000 pro cured in 1999 action was required to review the stock in the warehouse for possible obso lescence and excessive levels moreover with these types of goods there is risk that they could deteriorate in storage according to ocm contingency planning arrangements in case of c risis should cover 10000 persons on the basis of oios recommendation ocm immediately disp atched 9900 blankets with an estimated value of us 30000 to unhcr serbia and m ontenegro to strengthen its contingency preparedness following discussions wit h headquarters as well as the offices in the region with particular consideration to contin gency planning it has been concluded that the number of blankets available in stock in kosovo can not be decreased any further at this stage significant amount of various other nonfo od items such as coats garbage bags sanitary napkins and other items have already been distributed to unhcr field offices for onward distribution to persons of concern oios appreciates the efforts made to redeploy an d distribute excess stock oios would caution ocm aga inst the continued storage of blankets already between five to seven years old continue d storage of these items in the medium to long term should not be an option as there is ris k that they will slowly deteriorate an action plan should be developed on how they could be used effectively recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission pristina should in consultation with the supply management service proceed with the implementation of the plan of action to re duce stocks definite decision should be made on the c ontingency planning numbers rec 05 7 21 oios appreciates that physical inventory of assets in the custody of implementing partners was done in 2005 but in the years prior to this limited work had been carried out with physical inventories performed in 2003 and 2004 the lack of systematic procedures to account for assets resulted in discrepancies betwee n rightofuse rou agreements and the actual situation for example 23 buses which were sold to unmik in 2004 were still listed as in the custody of unhcrs partner drc as of septemb er 2005 on the other hand 72 items had to be added to the 195 items which were in the custody of drc in accordance with the rou agreement the forms assigning personal respons ibility for attractive items were not up todate ocm indicated that discrepancies identified during the 2005 inventory would be investigated and cleared following the 2005 spmr ve rification exercise and closure of the sub projects oios is pleased to note the action taken and will m onitor this recommendation for which ocm has set the target date for implementatio n is 30 june 2006 recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission pristina should finalize the physical inventory of assets and follo wup and investigate where appropriate any differences betwe the physical count and the asset management records wit h the records subsequently updated rec 06 22

as 2003 the prog ramme section could not confirm whether there had been yearend deduction from two partne rs arc and mci for stolen vehicles amounting to us 11142 several delays were also n oted in obtaining hamb decisions for example because of the delay experienced from sept ember 2003 to april 2004 undp which agreed to procure some equipment could afford only part of it and paid only us 25001 out of the previously agreed amount of us 64945 ocm was aware of the outstanding reimbursements by implementing partners the supply chain unit had already contacted the hamb secretary for updates on
