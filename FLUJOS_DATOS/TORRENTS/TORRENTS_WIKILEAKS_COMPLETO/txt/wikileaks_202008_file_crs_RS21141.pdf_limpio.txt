foreign affairs defense and trade division summary suppressing enemy air defens sead has been centr element of projecting military air power for over 50 years however several developments suggest that this mission is of growing importance to the depa rtment of defense dod some say that the emergence of new technologies and air defenses will increasingly challenge us sead efforts making budgetary judgment s on sead programs nd processes requires the assessment of complex factor s this report will be updated introduction suppression of enemy air defens sead is defined by the department of defense dod as that activity that neutralizes destroys or tem porarily degrades surfacebased enemy air defenses by destruc tive andor disruptive means1 by this definition many military platforms munitions and processes contribute to sead including reconnaissance and surveilla nce standoff jamming employment of airtosurface munitions and electronic and in frared ir countermeasures2 variety of weapons platforms and muniti ons can and have been used to attack enemy air defenses including long range bombers helicopters surfacetosurface missiles precision guided munitions pgms rockets and dumb bombs however some combat aircraft have been designed or modified to increase their effectiveness against enemy air defenses and are typically thought of as sead assets these include the f16 ea6b fa18 f15e and recently f22a these aircraft carry number of munitions useful against surfacetoair missiles sams some carry the agm88 high speed anti radiation missile harm which is designed to lockon to and destroy the groundbased radars used by some sams nd antiaircraft artillery aaa also the harm targeting system hts and the tac tical electronic rec onnaissance processinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21141crs2 3 historically the percentage of us combat sses due to aerial combat has steadily declined and the percentage of losses due to enemy air defenses has steadily risen in world war ii us air combat losses were split almost evenly between aerial combat 46 and air defenses 54 by the korean and vietnam wars however combat losses due to enemy air defenses had risen to approximately 90 and aerial combat losse s had dropped to approximately 10 percent 4 world missiles briefing teal group inc feb 2005 india iran syria and vietnam are known to have negotiated with russia for these syst ems but acquisition has not been confirmedand evaluation system terpes improve the ability of the f16cj and marine corps ea6b prowlers to target enemy air defense radars suppressing enemy air defens has always been an im portant means of protecting us aircraft and enabling effective air ope rations however sead may be of growing importance to dod and congress for at least three reasons while combat aircraft have played an important role in most us conflicts since world war i the st several conflicts bosnia in 1995 kosovo in 1999 iraq 1996present and afghanistan in 2001 have emphasized the use of airpower there appear to be very few countri capable of seriously challenging us air forces in airtoair combat since operation desert storm 100 percent of all us combat aircraft losses have been due to enemy air defenses us aircraft has been lost to an enemy aircraft since 1991 most countries will challenge us ai rpower primarily with surfacebased air defenses3 dod finds some air defens difficult to suppress or destroy many analysts say that emerging air defe nse technologies nd tactics will prove more threatening and more difficult to counter than current systems issues of concern the pentagon frequently expresses concern over several interrela ted developments in enemy air defenses the emergence and pr oliferation of new generation of russian sams and the application of new technologies either in conjunction with these or with other air defense elements s houlderfired missiles continue to pose problem for todays sead forces observers are also concerned about the effect of strict rules of engagement on sead effectiveness russian sa10 and sa12 sams have been operational since the 1980s but currently are in the inventory or possession of only handful of countries eg russia china cyprus the czech republic and germany4 these double digit sams are concern for military planners due to their mobility long range high altitude advanced missile guidance and sensitive radars the russian sa20 still under development has been likened to the us patriot pac2 missile but with an ev longer range and radar capable of detecting stealthy ai rcraft military planners are concerned that country with only handful of these sams could effectively challenge us military air operations by threatening aircraft and disruptin g operations from great distanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21141crs3 5 steven zaloga the evolving sam threat kosovo and beyond journal of electronic defense may 2000 6 michael puttre facing the

liners from terrorist missiles 9 ibid p 20a variety of new technologies and military systems could exacerbate the double digit sam challenge firs t commercial information nd communications technologies are enabling adversaries to better network the elements of their air defense systems this allows them to disperse ra dars sam launchers and other associated platforms throughout the battlespace and to share targeting inform ation between launchers this in turn suggests that radars may be used less frequently and for shorter periods of time complicating us sead efforts second ter minal defenses are being marketed by number of international defense companies these radarguided gatling guns are designed to protect double digit sams or other high value air defense assets by shooting 3000 to 4500 rounds per minute into the sky these systems could prove quite effective in shooting down harm or other ssiles aimed at enemy air defenses third russia and other countries have developed and are selling gps jammers over varying distances these lowwatt jammers degrade or totally disrupt the gps guidance signals used by many us pgms to augment inertial guidance systems reducing their accuracy us military planners must also grapple with todays pernicious air defense threats such as shoulderfired missiles unlike double digit sams manpads eg the us stinger russian sa7 and french mistral are widely proliferated and found in the inventories of scores of countries these missiles are difficult to suppress due to their small size high mobility and ir guidance unlike radar guidance ir guidance which manpads tend to use does not emit energy that us selfdefense systems can detect thus the launch of an irguide d missile often comes as surprise to the targeted aircraft reducing the time for evasive maneuvers or deployment of self protection countermeasures this increas manpads effectiveness ir guided sams were the primary source of air combat sses in operati on desert storm5 and since 1973 nearly half of all air losses in combat have been attributed to irguided sams many of them launched from manpads others estimate that manpads caused 90 of worldwide combat aircraft losses from 198420016 shoulderfired missiles also pose terrorist threat to civilian aircraft rand estimates that at least 20 and as many as 40 civilian airliners were shot down by terrorists using manpads between 1975 and 19927 crs estimates six of these aircraft were actually airliners the others were smaller than most commercial aircraft8 the threat to civilian airliners posed by terrorists with s houlderfired missiles appears to be an issue of increasing congressional cern at least three bills introduced during the fy2005 budget cycle addressed methods for mitigatin g the threat of shoulderfired missiles to commercial aviation9 rules of engagement roe are designed by military planners to reduce the likelihood of fratricide shootin g down friendly

for kosovo rand 2001 p 142coalition partners some have asserted that roe in r ecent conflicts have been draconian and tied the hands of sead pilots reducing their effectiveness10 dod may seek congressional support for more lenient roe in future wars assessing future sead needs there are many factors that can be weighed when attempting to measure the success of dod sead efforts and determining what fu ture needs eg new aircraft upgrades to selfprotection capabilities better mun itions may be dod has had considerable experience suppressing enemy ai r defenses over the last 50 years survey of this experience provides some insight into ad success and challeng and helps provide context in which congressional oversight deci sions can be made the following section describes three measures of effectivene s s m s t h t c n b u s d t f c u s congressional inquiry into future sead needs moe 1 combat attrition the first area that merits examination is combat attrition how many us combat aircraft ve been shot down in recent conflicts how many have been shot down by groundbased air defenses because sead missions are designed ultimately to protect us aircraft combat attrition provides some insight into the effectiveness of sead efforts as indicated in table 1 below from world war ii to the present the loss of us combat aircraft has steadily declined both in absolute terms and relative to the number of combat sor ties flown while these numbers do not prove that sead is solely responsible for this ve ry favorable trend it is clear that sead is an important

considered when assessing us sead capabilities is the amount of effort th at is expended to protect us aircraft how onerous mission is sead as table 2 be low suggests twentytothirty percent of all combat sorties in recent conflicts were voted to sead while historically this ratio is much lower while this increase in sead sorties could be attributable to number of factors it appears that sead is

the enduring effect th at destruction has on military capabilities as table 3 suggests us ai r forces have had mixed results in recent conflicts destroying enemy air defenses in so cases such as in iraq us destructive sead efforts have been somewhat successful in other cases such as kosovo where the serbs employed variety of challenging tactics efforts were less successful table 3 destructive

york times on the web aug 30 2001 another measure of efficiency pertains to tactics one sead tactic to fire numerous harm missiles preemptively that is in the direction of sam that is suspected to exist but which hasnt turned on its radar thirty three of 56 harms used in operation deliberate force were fired preemptively11 over 1000 harms in operation allied force were fired at only handful of sams suggesting many preemptive shots12 while using harms in this way may effectively deter adversaries from shooting at us aircraft it also poses two problem areas first pr eemptive harm use can be expensive since harms cost approximately 250000 per ssile second preemptively fired harms present fratricide risk if there are enemy radar emissions for the harm to guide on the missile could lockon to friendly emissions and destroy the wrong target at least six harms shot during kosovo ended up by accident in bulgaria13 while launching harms preemptively may be effective and necessary it not efficient the navys advanced antiradiation guided missile aargm program may reduce the need for or the potentially negative effects of preem ptive missile launche s 75m requested in fy2006 the aargm program is pursuin g number of improvements to harm including adding radar that can detect enemy radars after they have turned off and hardware and software improvements that limit the areas in which the missile can fly when searching for target
