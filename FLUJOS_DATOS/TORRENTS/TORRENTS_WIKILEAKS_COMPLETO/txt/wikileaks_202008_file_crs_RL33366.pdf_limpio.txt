policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33366schip original allotments description and analysis summary the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 created the state childrens health insurance program schip in bba 97 congress authorized and appropriated funds totaling nearly 40 billion for fy1998fy2007 with each state receiving access to portion of the annua l amount each states portion the original allotment is calculated based on formula that has been altered only one time since the programs inception schip currently has appr opriations past fy2007 as new appropriations are considered the focus regarding schip original allotments will be on 1 setting the national annual appropriations for schip and 2 deciding how those funds will be allotted to individual states some of the issues are technical for example whether better data source exists for estimating the number of lowincome children other issues raise more fundament questions about the program since fy2002 states total spending of federal schip funds has exceeded the annual appropriations for or iginal allotments however between fy2002 and fy2005 shortfalls of federal schip funds were largely voided because of leftover prioryear balances and the targeted redi stribution of other states unspent funds however the funds available for redistri bution have been shrinking over the past several years because such amounts were projected to be inadequate to prevent shortfalls in fy2006 congress appropriated an additional 283 million in the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 for projected shor tfall states shortfalls in 14 states in fy2007 are projected to total nearly 750 million with less money available through redistributions and prio ryear balances the amounts states receive in their own original allotments become increasingly important increasing the national schip appropr iations to match states projected spending would not necessarily prevent s hortfalls this is because the current formula for allotting those funds among st ates does not take into account states schip spending or their likelihood of facing shortfalls as congress considers the level of future schip appr opriations it may also examine whether the formula for distributing those funds to states should be revised if the current allotment level and formula continue into the future then in few years most states will face chronic shortfa lls of federal schip funds however such shortfalls are an inherent characteristic of cappedgrant program such as schip the federal governments re sponsibility to prevent or ssen these shortfalls will be among the issues congress grapples with in determining the national appropriation level and state distribution of future original allotments this report describes how schip orig inal allotments ve operated and discusses issues and options congre ss might consider for the futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33366contents d s c r i p t i n f r i g i n l l l

formula is to distribute funds based on need defined as the potential cost of the program based on the size of the target population nd the cost of providing services9 the target population and the cost of providing servi ces were included in the original schip allotment formula using data available at the time as two factors the number of children and state cost factor 10 once calculated these two factors are multiplied by each other for each state with the results added for national total each states percentage of the total subject to floors and ceilings is then multiplied by the total allotment funds available to states in th at year the result is the amount allotted to each state for that fiscal year number of children the number of children is composed of two estimates for each state the number of lowincome children without health insurance and the number of all lowincome children lowincome child is an individual under the age of 19 whose family income is at or below 200 of the poverty line11 the weight attached to each of the two factors varies by fiscal year for fy1998 and fy1999 the number of children in each state relied solely on the number of uninsured lowincome children as shown in table 2 as schip began to cover more lowincome children the formula was designed to rely less on the number of uninsured lowincome children and more on the number of all lowincome children fy2000 was th transition year in which the number of children used 75 of the number of uninsured lowincome children and 25 of the number of all lowincome children as illustrated in table 2 12 for fy2001 onward the number of children is weighted evenly between the number of uninsured lowincome children and the number of all lowincome children in each statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33366crs5

over the three year period 20022004 state cost factor the other major factor used in calculating states portion of the total annual schip ppropriation is state cost factor based on wages of employees in the health services industry the factor is intended to adjust for geographic variations in health care costs the national average is scaled to equal 100 states with aboveaverage wages in the health services industry will have value greater than 100 which will increase the amount of their allotment and vice versa as shown in table 2 15 of the state cost factor does not vary in essence that portion is held at 100 the national average the remaining 85 reflects how each states average wage compares to the national average the law specifies that the wage data are to be obtained from the bureau of labor statistics bls of the department of labor using threeyear averages for the same years used to calculate the number of children the law also defines the health services industry as employers with standard indus trial classification sic code of 800016 however in 2002 bls replaced sic with the north american industry classification system naics although the mapping between the two systems for the health services industr was not identical the naics wage data codes represent appr oximately 98 percent of the wage data that would have been provided under the re lated sic code

care and social assistance the only naics code from this category not used for the state cost factor is 624 social assistance18 the source of data bls uses for calculating the average wages is from

allotments although title xxi requires that fy 1999 be the basis for the historical comparisons in calculating the floors and ceiling the schip law could also have set fy1998 as the base year nd the impact of the floors and ceiling would be different this is because pl 105277 required that states share of the fy1999 schip appropriation be the same as their share for fy1998 according to one source the reason behind this intervention into the formula allocation process was that preliminary calculation based on the av erage number of lowincome uninsured children as measured in the 1995 1996 and 1997 cps march supplements showed substantial variation from the estimates based on the 1994 1995 and 1996 march s upplements what is notable is that 23 of the 51 states would have had doubledigit

continuedprevent the loss of health insurance coverage and 2 to limit and control federal spending for that coverage one contention is that inadequate original allotments are one reason for states shortfalls of federa l schip funds for example iowas schip director said the schip funding formula is flawed in that it allocates funds to states based on inaccurate data penalizes states for insuring more children and inadequately distributed funding over the 10 years during which the program was authorized23 the sections below discuss some speci fic options for altering the current allotment formula including changes related to the iowa schip directors comments however it must be noted that to eliminate states shortfalls by altering original allotments both the total amount of original allotments and how they are distributed to states would likely have to be altered allotment formula the allotment formula for determining each states share of the national schip appropriation was set in bba 97 in the ab sence of established schip programs on which to base states allotments c ongress used the previously discussed number of children and the state cost factor in essence congress decided that schip allotments should be based on the number of lowincome below 200 of poverty children in each state with variation in the extent to which the number includes all lowincome children or just those who we re uninsured having established the number of children as the basis for states share of the total appropriation the state cost factor provided an adjustment designed to reflect the cost of health care in each state the remainder of this section of the report discusses possible changes to the existing components of the formula as well as additional options based on new information not available decade ago number of children what is the target population of schip and does the current schip allotment formula accurate ly target funds to that population according to title xxi the target popula tion is uninsured lowincome children24 in the first two years of schip the number of children was defined in the formula as the number of uninsured lowincome children based on the cps estimates theoretically perhaps only uninsured lowincome children eligible for schip should have been included for exam ple excluding uninsured lowincome children who were eligible fo r medicaid however the potential magnitude of the error that would accompany statespecific estimates of this group makes it difficult to argue that such estimates should have been used

httpfinancesenategovhearingstestimony2005test072506cptestpdfif the number of children had tinued with its fy19981999 structure then if state had enrolled all its uninsured lowincome children in schip the formula would have caused the state to ultimately receive more schip funds thus the formula came to rely equally on the number of uninsured lowincome children and the total number of lowincome children however by including the total number of lowincome children states are allotted schip funds for other lowincome children who are not part of the target population for example those with privat health insurance again although it may be desirable to use more detailed estimates such step comes at the risk of increasing sampling error and bias with the cps data some researchers suggested more obvious solution of adding the ch ildren enrolled in schip to the estimated number of uninsured lowincome children26 this would focus the formula on states current child enrollees as well as potentially eligible uninsured lowincome children however their more obvious solution would include all child enrollees in the formula even though some states cover children in their schip programs well above 200 of poverty moreover as the researchers state introducing administrative estimates into the allocation formula w ould place reliance on the fund recipients the states to estimate co mponent of need which then affected the size of their allocations27 more generally some states have suggested that the portion of the formula that includes the number of uninsured lowinco children be droppe d altogether one argument is that this portion of the formula creates perverse incentive as one state official said efforts to reduce the num ber of uninsured children by increasing enrollment in one of states governme ntsponsored programs would appear to potentially have negative impact on the schip allocation state may receive in given fiscal year28 by dropping the uninsured estimates

schip enrollees versus the potential enrollees uninsured low income children specified in the statute outside of the question of the overall stru cture of this portion of the formula is the issue of whether the current formula uses the best available data for example there are welldocumented concerns with the cpss estimates of the uninsured which have been acknowledged by the census bureau30 some states have reported that their own estimates of the uninsured do not correspond with the cps estimates31 during bba 97 the cps was the only sour ce of data that could provide state level estimates of the number of lowincome children and of those who were uninsured in all the states even so the high sampling error in many states requires the use of threeyear averages of th cps estimates congress appropriated an additional 10 million annually to expand the cps sample size by about 34500 households beginning with 2002 survey data even so concerns remain regarding the substantial variation and unpredictability in states allo tments partly driven by the relatively large standard errors associated with the cps estimates32 table 6 and table 7 illustrate some of this vari ation table 6 shows states share of the total appropr iation available in fy1998 and fy2007 the table also shows how much more or less states w ould have received in their fy2007 original allotments had the percentage been ba sed on the fy1998 percentages rather than those from fy2007 if the fy2007 origin allotments had been based on the fy1998 percentages approx imately 500 million allotted to 33 states in fy2007 would have gone to the other 18 states in stead the differences shown in table 6 include not only changes in the cpsderived number of children but also in the state cost factor the table does not ascertain how much of the changes are due to actual changes in statelevel circumstances rather than sampling error or other potential measurement issues33 since bba 97 the census bureau has veloped new source of data that can provide statelevel estimates of lowincome children the american community survey acs the acs is mailed to 3 million addresses annually compared to the cpss sample of approximately 100000 house holds as result use of the acs would lead to less yeartoyear variation in states allotments due to the smaller cps sample34 however the acs does not currently obtain estimates of the uninsuredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33366crs15 34 continued subcommittee chris l peterson congressi onal research service crs july 25 2006 at httpfinancesenategovhearingstestimony

the number of uninsured lowincome children that is currently part of the schip allotment formula the census bureau recently completed testing number of health insu rance questions for possible

befo re the data would be available table 7 shows comparison of the estimates and margins of error of estimates of lowincome children based on the cps and the acs even using threeyear average on the cps estimates its margins of error are higher than the singleyear acs estimates this is function of the acss much larger sample of people although the cps pr ovides estimates of uninsured lowincome children which the acs currently does not the cps margins of error by state are quite high exceeding 50 in some states as shown in table 7 such margins of error may raise additional questions as to whether it is an appropriate basis for distributing billions of federal schip dollars some states have expressed concern that the cps estimates even for the total number of lowincome children are wer than states medicaid and schip enrollment counts of lowincome childre n and that the acs estimates are not much better35 however for program eligibility purposes states often count income differently than surveys in determining eligibility for medicaid and schip states have the flexibility to disregard certain amounts and types of in come estimates from the cps and acs do not reflect such disreg ards in the cps and the acs income is counted identically across states for sta tistical purposes as result states using income disregards would be expected to have more enrollees below certain income amounts than if the surveys gross income were used the income disregards differ by state thus even in states reporting the same upperincome eligibility level person who is ineligible in one state might be eligible in another because of different income disregards indeed even within particular state person with particul ar amount of gross in come may be eligible for schip while another person with th same amount of gross income may be ineligible because of the type of income they have and how the disregards apply thus although the surveys have acknowle dged limitations in the estimates they provide there would also be potential drawbacks to using states enrollment data the policy question is which of these along with other possible factors would best allot the schip appropriations c

current population survey cps data available at httpwwwcensusgovhheswwwhlthinslowinckidhtml and of american community survey acs data provided upon request by the us census bureau margins of error calculated using 95 confidence intervals state cost factor technical adjustments to this factor could be considered for example the state cost factor is calculated based in part on wages paid in the states nursing and residential care facilities however if the factor is to adjust for the health care costs of children in the state wages in nursing and residential care facilities may not be critical they could be dropped from the calculation or weighted in way that is more reflective of childrens utilization bls has other employer surveys that could also provide similar information however the currently used source of data is virtual census of employers which may be preferable to survey because it is census threeyear average may nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33366crs19 be necessary as with the cps estimates for the number of children using single year would also mean that the most recently available data could be the basis of the factor rather than also inco rporating two previous years floors and ceilings the key questions for floors and ceilings in formula grant programs is whether they are need ed and if based on prioryear information what years should be the base the fl oors and ceilings in schip were added to ensure in part that states share of the appropriation went below or above certain historical levels to provide some stability and predictability in their federal schip financing table 6 shows that 19 states have d their allotments raised and 15 states have had their allotme nts lowered because of the statutory floors and ceilings the historical floors and the ceiling ar tied to states fy1999 and the identical fy1998 share of the national schip ppropriation while this ensures some predictability in states share of the national schip appropriations those years were also when the cps sample size was smaller than it has been since predating the sample expansion the changes in the timates since fy 1999 may be because of improvements in the cps however the floors and ceiling limit states allotments to the share of the appropriation in those early years six of the 15 states that have ever had their allotments lowered because of the ceiling are projected to experience shortf all in fy2007 these states might argue that their federal schip financial status would be better if the ceiling were not in place thus future consideration of floor s and ceilings might consider whether they are useful and if so whether different base years should be incorporated conclusion schip has been lauded for the health in surance it provides to children and for the flexibility states have in designing their schip programs with schips final appropriation slated to occur in this fis cal year fy2007 the possibility of enacting new appropriations might also be used by congress to examine some of the issues surrounding both the national schip appropriation levels and the allotment formula states projected shortfalls of federal sc hip funds is one issue that has received recent legislative attention fy2006 was the first year in which several states faced the prospect of shortfalls projected in itially at 283 million in response congress appropriated an additi onal 283 million for schip in fy2006 to eliminate shortfalls in fy2007 and be yond additional funds will be needed beyond the annual 5 billion in appropriations assumed in the current baseline original allotments both their national level and their distri bution among the states have become increasingly critical to states in operating their schip programs determining not only how much federal money states receive but for given level of states projected spending what size shortfall states are projected to face as result future original allotments could be set and distributed using info rmation not known or available when the program was created decade ago
