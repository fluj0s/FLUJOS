minority participation goals may be found in executive orders which since the early 1960s have imposed affirmative minority hiring and employment requirements on federally financed construction projects and in connection with other large federal contracts executive order 11246 as currently administered by the office of federal contract compliance programs requires that all employers with 50

contractor must commit its good faith efforts smaller contractors are bound by the nondiscrimination requirements of the executive order but are not required to maintain formal written programs 7 judicial decisions early on had upheld the executive order program as constitutionally valid governmental response to racial segregation in the construction trades and affected industries by the mid1980s the supreme court had approved the temporary remedial use of race or genderconscious selection criteria by private employers under title vii these measures were deemed proper remedy for manifest racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories if voluntarily adopted by the employer 8 or for entrenched patterns of egregious and longstanding discrimination by the em ployer if imposed by judicial decree9 in either circumstance however the court required proof of remedial justification rooted in the employers own past discrimination and its persistent workplace effects thus firm basis in evidence as revealed by manifest imbalanceor historic persistent and egregious underrepresentationof minorities or women in affected job categories was deemed an essential predicate to preferential affirmative action of equal importance all racial preferences in employment were to be judged in terms of their adverse impact on identifiable nonminority group members but the consideration of race or gender as plus factor in employment decisions when it did not unduly hinder or trammel the legitimate expectations of non minority employees won ready judicial acceptance 10 affirmative action preferences however had to be sufficiently flexible temporary in duration and narrowly tailored to avoid becoming rigid quotas perennial aspect of the legal debate over affirmative action has centered on the proper role of the remedy in employment discrimination litigation one legal theory emphasizes compensation for actual victims of discrimination while another focuses more upon the elimination of barriers to equal opportunity for all members of previously excluded class of individuals in series of cases during the 1980s the justice department argued largely without success that victim compensation was the only proper remedial objective and that classbased affirmative action remedies which benefit women and minorities who are not themselves actual victims of an employers past discrimination are illegal the employment cases to date have yet to fully embrace this position although it appears to have gained some footing in the minority contracting arena 11 7

developed along two concurrent but not necessarily coterminous lines one line of authority delineates the permissible scope of affirmative action imposed by judicial decree to remedy proven violations of title vii or the constitution the other involves the validity of voluntary affirmative action plans by public and private employers several basic principles emerge from the case law first fundamental prerequisite to the adoption of minority goals or preferences is remedial justification rooted in the employers own past di scrimination and its persistent workplace effects stricter probative standards mandated by the constitution may bind public employers in this regard than apply to private employers under title vii basically firm basis in evidenceas revealed by manifest imbalance or persistent and egregious disparities in the employment of minorities or women in affected job categorieshas been viewed by the courts as an essential predicate for affirmative action preferences secondly beyond record of past discrimination by the employer all affirmative action plans are judged in terms of the burden they place on identifiable nonminorities thus remedies that immediately result in the displacement of more senior white male employeeslike promotion preferences or minority group protections against layoffare most suspect and least likely to pass legal or constitutional muster at the other end of the spectrum hiring or recruitment goals or preferences that do not unnecessarily trammel the legitimate expectations for advancement of nonminority candidates are more likely to win judicial acceptance finally all raceconscious affirmative action remedies must be sufficiently flexible temporary in duration and narrowly tailored so as to avoid becoming rigid quotas g12g158g141g146g140g146g138g149g561g3g143g143g146g155g150g138g157g146g159g142g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561g20g142g150g142g141g146g142g156g561 even before the supreme court had spoken every federal circuit court of appeals in cases dating back to the very inception of the 1964 civil rights act had approved use of race or gender preferences to remedy historic egregious or longstanding discrimination this line of judicial authority was ratified by the courts rulings in local 28 sheetmetal workers v eeoc and united states v paradise 12 the former involved contempt proceedings against union with an established history of racial and ethnic discrimination for its willful violation of judicially imposed 29 minority membership goal to remedy years of union evasion amounting to contempt of court the second circuit had approved an order reinstating the minority membership goal and requiring that job referrals be made on the basis of one apprentice for every four journeyman the supreme court affirmed five to four justice brennan wrote for plurality of four justices that title vii does not preclude race conscious affirmative action as last resort for cases of persistent or egregious discrimination or to dissipate the lingering effe cts of pervasive discrimination but that in most cases only make whole reliefin the form of back pay or specific hiring ordersfor individual victims is required the plurality also felt that by twice adjusting the unions deadline and because of the district courts otherwise fl exible application of the membership goal the remedy had been enforced as benchmark of the unions compliance rather than as strict racial quota rounding out the fivejustice majority was justice powell who emphasized the history of contemptuous racial discrimination revealed by the record and the temporary and 12 478 us 421 1986 480 us 149 1987

and oconnor found the referral quota excessive because economic conditions in the construction industry made compliance impracticable while chief justice burger and rehnquist read title vii to bar all judiciallyordered raceconscious relief for the benefit of nonvictims parallel situation was presented by paradise in 1972 to remedy nearly four decades of systematic exclusion of blacks from the ranks of the alabama state troopers the district court ordered hiring quota and enjoined the state from discriminating in regard to promotions seven years later series of consent decrees calling for new nondiscriminatory promotion procedures was approve to rectify the total dearth of back troopers in the upper ranks in the interim however the court ordered onetoone racial quota for the rank of corporal and above provided sufficient qualified blacks were available until 25 of each rank was black only one round of promotions for corporal was made before the quota for that and the sergeant rank was suspended the supreme court granted review of the order under the equal protection clause justice brennan whose plurality opinion was again joined by justices marshall blackmun and powell considered several factors in determinin g whether the plan violated the equal protection rights of white troopers the necessity of the relief and the efficacy of alternative remedies the plans flexibility and duration the relationship between the plans numerical goals and the relevant labor market and the plans impact on the rights of third parties significant was the fact that the order did not require the promotion of anyone and could be waived in the absence of qualified minority candidates as it already had been with respect to lieutenant and captain positions it was also tied to the percentage of minorities in the area workforce 25 finally because it did not bar white advancement but merely postponed it the plan did not impose unacceptable burdens on innocent third parties justice brennan therefore concluded that the promotion quota was narrowly tailored and justified by the governments compelling interest in eradicating the states pervasive systematic and obstinate exclusion of blacks and its history of resistance to the courts orders justice stevens who provided the fifth vote for th courts judgment stated in separate opinion that the district court did not exceed the bounds of reasonableness in devising remedy justice oconnor joined in dissent by justice scalia and the chief justice found the plan cannot survive judicial scrutiny because the onetoone promotion quota is not sufficiently tied to the percentage of blacks eligible for promotion finally justice white in two sentence dissent stated simply that the district court exceeded its equitable powers g24g152g149g158g151g157g138g155g162g561g3g143g143g146g155g150g138g157g146g159g142g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561 the remedial justification for voluntary affirmative action in employment was explored by the court in wygant v jackson board of education 13 collective bargaining agreement between the school board and the teachers union in that case provided hiring preference for minority teachers coupled with layoff protection until the minority composition of the faculty mirrored that of the student body district wide seniority was to govern layoff except that in event were overall minority faculty percentages to be reduced in the face of constitutional challenge by ten laidoff white teachers the court voided the minority layoff provision but particular rationale commanded majority support 13 476 us 267 1986

voluntary affirmative action may be constitutionally justifiable on the part of governmental entity itself guilty of past discrimination however neither the asserted interest in the presence of minority teachers as critical role models or to ameliorate societal discrimination provided compelling justification for the layoff plan absent convincing evidence of the boards own past discrimination moreover while innocent nonminor ities could be made to share some of the burden the remedy could not intrude too severely upon their rights because the minority layoff protection in wygant imposed the entire burden of achieving racial equality on particular individuals justice powell concluded that innocent third parties were impacted too heavily in this respect the layoff provision was distinguishable from preferential hiring decisions which diffuse the burden more generally reserving judgment on the hiring issue justice white concurred that the layoff remedy went too far because it displaced more senior white employees in favor of minorities who were not actual discrimination victims in separate concurrence justice oconnor aligned herself with the powell view that societal discrimination will not justify voluntary affirmative action remedies and that the layoff plan was infirm because overbroad and not narrowly tailored to the boards past discrimination significantly wygant was constitutional case decided on fourteenth amendment equal protection principles corollary issues concerning voluntary affirmative action plans adopted by private employers under title vii reached the high court in united steelworkers v weber 14 the weber case upheld voluntary affirmative action plan by private employer including minority quota for craft training program to rectify manifest racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories the court required specific finding of past discrimination by the employer deciding the case instead on the basis of the historically well established record of nationwide bias in trade union membership in 1974 the employer and union in weber negotiated an affirmative action plan to increase the percentage of blacks in skilled craft positions from 2 to the level of their overall participation in the area workforce or 39 by reserving half of the companys craft training program slots for minorities several white employees were passed over in favor of less senior blacks there was evidence that the underrepresentation of minorities in craft jobs was attributable to past discrimination by the employer nonetheless relying on general judicial and research findings relative to nationwide patterns of minority exclusion from trade union membership the supreme court ruled five to two that racial preferences in the program were lawful means to combat manifest racial imbalance in craft positions resulting from old patterns of racial segregation and hierarchy conceding that title vii could literally be read to bar all raceconscious employment practices the court decided that the purpose of the act rather than its literal meaning controlled the legislative history and context from which the act arose justice brennan wrote compelled the conclusion that the primary purpose of title vii was to open employment opportunities for negroes in occupations which have traditionally be closed to them accordingly it would be ironic indeed to read the statute to preclude all voluntary private raceconscious efforts to abolish workplace segregation moreover the specific plan in question mandating one to one racial ratio until specific minority participation rate is achieved was permissible affirmative action because it did not unnecessarily trammel the interest of white employees 15 weber thus

one factor for promotion to positions within traditionally segregated job classifications in which women had been underrepresented women were significantly underrepresented in the countys labor force as whole and in five of seven job categories including skilled crafts where all 238 employees were men the plans long range goal was proportional representation however because of the small number of positions and low turnover actual implementation was based on short term goals which were adjusted annually and took account of qualified minority and female availability specific numerical goals or quotas were used the petitioner in johnson was male employee who had applied for promotion to the position of road dispatcher only to be rejected in favor of female competitor both the petitioner and the woman who won the promotion were deemed well qualified for the position although the petitioner had scored slightly higher in the first round interview the appointing official for the agency indicated that in reaching the decision to promote the female candidate he had considered the candidates qualifications backgrounds test scores and expertise as well as gender considerations the supreme court upheld the countys action six to three justice brennan decided for the majority that title vii was not coextensive with the constitution and that therefore weber not wygant was controlling the noted disparities in female workforce participation satisfied the weber requirement for manifest imbalance since to require any additional showing could expose the employer to discrimination lawsuits and operate as disincentive to voluntary compliance with the statute the court likened the county plan to the treatment of race as plus factor in the harvard planfor higher educati onal admissions approved by justice powell in the bakke case 17 because sex was but one factor in the decisionmaking process applicant was excluded from participation on account of sex in caveat however the court warned that if plan failed to take distinction in qualification into account in providing for actual employment decision it would dictate mere blind hiring by the numbers and would be invalid because it would hold supervisors to achievement of part icular percentage of minority employment or membership regardless of circumstances such as economic conditions or the number of available qualified minority applicants 18 continued with new black hires nor does the plan create an absolute bar to advancement of white employees half of those trained in the program will be

of title vii as would justices scalia and the chief justice joining in separate dissent the dissenters criticized the majority for using title vii to overcome the effect not of the employers own discrimination but of societal attitudes that have limited entry of certain races or of particular sex into certain jobs noting the district court finding of past discrimination by the county agency they argued in light of sheetmetal workers that there is sensible basis for construing title vii to permit employers to engage in race or sexcons cious employment practices that courts would be forbidden from ordering them to engage in following judicial finding of discrimination to date therefore the supreme court has permitted raceconscious hiring criteria by private employers under title vii either as remedy for past discrimination or to redress conspicuous racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories but refused to find that states interest in faculty diversity to provide teacher role models was sufficiently compelling to warrant raceconscious layoff policy lower co urts are similarly divided though few have applied an operational need analysis to uphold police force diversity policies recognizing that law enforcement bodys need to carry out its ssion effectively with workforce that appears unbiased is able to communicate with the public and is respected by the community it serves may constitute compelling state interest 19 threejudge panel of the seventh circuit has pressed the legal debate one step further by relying on the student diversity rulings in the michigan cases20 to uphold chicago police departments affirmative action hiring program the decision in petit v city of chicago21 found that large urban police departments have an even more compelling need for diversity than universities and affirmed the chicago police program under the grutter standards strong basis for affirmative action was provided by expert testimony that the citys minority residents deeply distrusted police and that creating diverse force at the sergeant rank would set proper tone in the department to earn the trust of the commun ity outside of law enforcement however courts generally allow for consideration of race in hiring and promotion decisions only in response to demonstrable evidence of past discrimination by th employer or within the affected industry continued beneficiaries of the affirmative action equal protection standards not title vii should govern public employee cases and she was critical of the majority for providing inadequate guidance as to the statistical imbalance standard but because there were women in skilled craft positions and gender was only plus factor either standard was satisfied here 19 patrolmens benevolent

initially met with greater judicial approval than public contracting preferences for minorities in the wake of the supreme courts decision in city of richmond v ja croson and co22 this may be due in part to the fact that employment preferences are frequently though not always linked to settlements of individual or class action lawsuits depending on the stage of proceedings formal record of past discrimination may already have developed when agreement is reached at the very least there is usually some allegation of misconduct by the public employer in addition there may be underlying judicial findings of discrimination or district court involvement in fashioning or approving the consent decree both of which are factors traditionally prompting deference by appellate courts when reviewing affirmative action efforts 23 between 1972 and 1983 the department of justice sued 106 public employers of those 93 were settled by consent decree these courtapproved agreements typically set goals and timetables for increasing minority and female underrepresentation in the workforce of the cases that the justice department still monitors many stem from litigation dating back to the 1970s mainly against police and fire departments 24 under croson and subsequently adarand constructors inc v pena25 however these orders and consent decrees have come under strict scrutiny for example major ruling by the eleventh circuit in 1994 invalidated consent decree involving the birmingham ala fire department for being an entirely arbitrary fixed quota that unduly restricted opportunities for whites26

decrees and ended federal monitoring of their minority hiring practices in 1999 the supreme court declined to review fifth circuit decision striking down the dallas fire departments affirmative action plan in city of dallas v dallas fire fighters association28 the appellate panel held that there was insufficient evidence of past discrimination in the dallas fire department to justify the departments poli cy of promoting some women and minorities over white males who had achieved scores within the same band on civil service examination evidence of discrimination in the record consisted of 1976 consent decree between the city and the justice department finding impermissible raci discrimination by the city under title vii and statistical underrepresentation of minorities in the ranks to which the challenged promotions were made the court recognized that outofrank promotions do not impose as great burden on nonminorities as would layoff or discharge but it found that interference by the city with legitimate expectations of promotion based on exam performance was unjustified where alternative remedies were not yet exhausted and there was proof of history of egregious and pervasive discrimination or resistance to affirmative action that has warranted more serious measures in other cases 29 even less evidence of past sex discrimination was found by the court to justify the citys genderbased discrimination in ensley branch naacp v seibels30 the eleventh circuit rejected both long term and annual goals imposed by consent decree for the hiring of firefighters and police officers by the city of birmingham alabama the main fault with the citys affirmative action plan was that it had become permanent alternative to the development of nondiscriminatory tests and other valid selection procedures rather than ending discri mination the longterm goals in the plan were designed to create parity between the racial composition of the labor pool and the race of the employees in each job position annual hiring goals had been arbitrarily set at twentyfive to fifty percent for minorities and had been mechanically applied as rigid quotas in the courts view without regard to relative qualifications of the candidates on remand the district court was ordered to rewrite the decrees to relate the annual goals to the proportion of blacks in the relevant objectively qualified labor pool and to make clear that the annual goals cannot last indefinitely 31 likewise an affirmative action promotional plan for the maryland state police agreed to by the parties with consent of federal district court was subjected to strict scrutiny review and found wanting by the fourth circuit in maryland troopers assn v evans32 specifically goals linked to minority representation in the general population instead of the qualified labor pool were found deficient under croson analysis as was the failure to first exhaust all raceneutral alternative means of increasing minority opportunity the latter factor has frequently been determinative of 28 150 f3d 438 5th cir 1998 cert denied 526 us 1046 1999 29 id at 440 30 31 f3d 1548 11th cir 1994 31 id at 1577

has yet to precisely define racial classification for equal protection purposes but plurality of justices have described the concept in terms of burdens or benefits placed on individuals because of race or subjecting individuals to unequal treatment race conscious action by government or private employ ers that neither confers benefit nor imposes burden on individuals may not be subject to strict scrutiny or heightened judicial review thus courts have not found data collection activities concerning the racial or gender makeup of workforce to violate the constitution statistical information as such is rather neutral entity which only becomes meaningful when it is interpreted 39 similarly strict scrutiny has generally not been applied by the courts to minority outreach or recruitment efforts that do not amount to an actual preference in employment decisionmaking public university for example may be racially aware or conscious by amassing statistics on the racial and

subject to strict scrutiny this distinction between inclusive forms of affirmative actionsuch as recruitment advertising in minority media and other outreach to minority communitiesand exclusive affirmative actionsuch as quotas setasides or layoff preferenceshas featured prominently in many decisions 40 one of the first post adarand decisions shuford v state board of education 41 upheld provisions similar to eo 11246 in the face of constitutional challenge consent decree between the state board of education and separate classes of white and black women had addressed issues of hiring and promotion within the alabama system in addition to standard nondiscrimination clause the decree required yearly reports tracking the number of new women hires procedures for expanding the pool of female applicants numerical hiring goals and parity for women in the personnel selection process specifically prohibited by the decree however were setasides quotas and the selection of less qualified candidates based on race or gender because expanding the pool of qualified minority or female candidates by inclusive recruitment and outreach only added to the competition faced by nonclass membersin this case white malesand did not result in lost job opportunities and promotions the court avoided the traditional title vii and equal protection analysis applied to exclusive affirmative action techniques it upheld the annual statistical report requirement of the decree since the attempt to ascertain whether there is problem and whether progress is being made should be encouraged 42 affirmative recruitment of qualified female candidates was similarly acceptable so long as the recruitment did not exclude male applicants thus if the postsecondary system began recruiting at black and womens colleges and stopped recruiting at auburn this would be an instance of exclusion 43 since hiring goals could be applied either inclus ively or exclusively whether the decree mandated appropriate diagnostic goals that measure the efficacy of pool expansion techniques such as affirmative recruitment was treated as question of underlying intent the shuford goals did not require preferences for women the court found and would not permit jobs to be setaside for specific groups because the goals played role in the selection process they served only to measure the effectiveness of the recruitment programs and to red flag those positions where women were underrepresented as such the goals were found to be inclusive and lawful shuford has been cited with approval by several

strict scrutiny to this sort of race consciousness44 other courts have disagreed however and applied strict scrutiny analysis to facially inclusive affirmative action programs in monterey mechanical co v wilson 45 the ninth circuit considered california affirmative action statute that required bidders on state contracts either to subcontract percentage of their work to female and minorityowned businesses or to document good faith effort to do so the acknowledged low bidder in the case had been denied contract with state university for failure to achieve the mandated goal or to document its outreach efforts the appeals court found that the statute treated classes unequally because minority prime contractor could avoid the necessity of subcontracting or demonstrating good faith efforts simply by doing percentage of the work itself an option not available to other bidders in addition the statute was found to encourage quotas even if it did not necessarily require them meanwhile messer v meno challenged an affirmative action program involving goals statistics and reporting requirements within the texas education agency 46 in vacating summary judgment for tea the fifth circuit rejected any distinction between inclusive and exclusive affirmative action holding that strict scrutiny applies to all governmental racial classifications in dicta the court noted that the evidence strongly suggests recruitment was not the sole activity affected by the affirmative action program and that once an applicant met the minimum requirements for position tea employees considered race or gender in employment decisions 47 although not disputing the applicability of strict scrutiny judge garza warned in concurring opinion that the tone of the majoritys decision will send the message out that affirmative action is for all intents and purposes dead in the fifth circuit48 similarly in schurr v resort intl hotel 49 the third circuit disapproved casinos goaloriented affirmative action plan which had been applied to deny employment to white lightandsound technician in favor of an equally qualified black applicant because it had been implemented in the absence of any reference to or showing of past or present discrimination in the casino industry the employer argued that the af firmative action plan and the casino control commission regulations on which it was based did not create racial preferences but simply articulated goals aimed at recruiting members of minority groups and women the court however concluded that the regulations have the practical effect of encouraging if not outright compelling discriminatory hiring particularly because resorts international supervisors who made hiring decisions testified to belief that they had to take race into account when filling position if particular job category had lower percentage of minority employees than the stated percentage goal for that category there was meaningful distinction the court found

nonminority contractor on unequal footing in competing for business from pacific bell which was subject to minority hiring goals formulated by the california public utility commission pursuant to state law another federal appellate court has applied strict judicial scrutiny as per adarand to defeat equal employment opportunity regulations of the federal communications commission fcc imposing affirmative minority outreach and recruitment obligations on applicants for radio broadcast licenses in lutheran churchmissouri synod v fcc 51 the dc circuit ruling stemmed from challenge by the naacp to the hiring practices of lutheran church organization which holds fcc licences for two radio stations broadcasting from seminary in clayton missouri because of the stations religious mission the church has lutheran hiring preference requiring job applicants to possess knowledge of lutheran doctrine the fcc imposes two basic requirements on radio stations they must refrain from discriminating in employment for racial ethnic or genderbased reasons and they must adopt an affirmative action program of targeted efforts to recruit hire and promote women and minorities acting on the naacp complaint the fcc ruled that the churchs lutheran hiring preference was too broad and that while the stations had not discriminated they violated agency regulation because of insufficient minority recruitment the church was ordered to pay 25000 penalty and to submit reports every six months listing all job applicants and hires along with the sex and race of each as well as statement of their efforts to recruit minorities three judge appellate panel rejected fcc and justice department arguments that more lenient standard of review than strict scrutiny should apply since the fcc regulations stopped short of establishing preferences quotas setasides and did not mandate raceconscious hiring decisions adarand required all governmental action based on raceeven when the governments motivation to aid minorities can be thought benignto be narrowly tailored to meet compelling governmental interest according to judge silberman by requiring formal analysis by the employer of minority underrepresentation and availability statistics the fcc regulations extend beyond outreach efforts and certainly influence ultimate hiring decisions because they pressure stations to maintain work force that mirrors the racial breakdown of the metropolitan statistical area for this reason it mattered not to the court whether government hiring program imposes hard quotas soft quotas or goals since any such race conscious technique induces an employer to hire with an eye toward meeting numerical target rather than remedy for past discrimination the justification advanced by the government for the fcc program was to foster diverse programming content an interest deemed important but not compelling by the appellate panel indeed the diversityofprogramming rationale makes sense said the judge in the intrastation context where the fccs purported goal of making single station all things to all people contradicts the reality of the radio market where each station targets particular segment one pop one country one news radio and so on nor could the fcc regulations be considered narrowly tailored because they affected the hiring of even lowlevel employees whose impact on programming was negligible in conclusion judge silberman observed 50 59 f3d 869 9th cir 1995 cert denied 516 us 1984 1996 51 141 f3d 344 dccir 1998

term diversity has been asked to bear in the latter part of the 20th century in the united states it appears to have been coined both as permanent justification for policies seeking racial proportionality in all walks of life affirmative action had only temporary remedial connotation and as synonym for proportional representation itself it has in our view been used by the commission in both ways we therefore conclude that its eeo regulations are unconstitutional and cannot serve as basis for its decision and order in this case 52 in sequel broadcasters association v fcc 53 the appeals court voided new fcc rules designed to achieve broad outreach in recruiting women and minorities for broadcasting careers broadcasters were given choice between programs specified by the fcc and stationinitiated outreach programs if the station designed its own program it had to report the race and sex of each applicant or person employed but the regulations specified that companys record in hiring women and minorities would not be fa ctor in the license renewal decision the alternative approach was struck down again because the recordkeeping and reporting of employment statistics were deemed coercive and powerful threat almost certain to pressure companies to seek proportional representation of women and minorities moreover the entire rule succumbed to the courts analysisthe offending portion deemed nonseverable from the wholeperhaps limiting prospects for recasting fcc affirmative action efforts g15g146g149g146g157g138g155g162g561g5g138g156g142g156g561 the us military has traditionally enjoyed considerable deference from federal courts in decisions affecting military staffing and manpower needs nonetheless recent challenges to army and air force equal opportunity policies have triggered strict scrutiny of embedded racial classifications in berkley v united states 54 for example discharged white male officers from the air force brought fifth amendment equal protection class action challenging the basis for selecting officers for reduction in force the litigation centered on the written instruction from the air force secretary concerning the evaluation of women and minority officers for that purpose the memorandum noted that such individuals may have been disadvantaged in their careers by past societal attitudes and underutilization by the service the trial court found racial classification drawn by the memorandum and was satisfied that it met minimal rational basis constitutional standards however the federal circuit reversed and remanded 55 it found that strict scrutiny was triggered because the evaluation instruction provided for different standard based on race and gender the case was ultimately settled56 in christian v united states 57 the us court of claims reviewed us army policy establishing retention goals for minority and female officers twice considered but passed over for promotion who would otherwise have been subject to mandatory early retirement the percentage of minorities and women to be retired was set by special army memorandum which 52 id at 356 53 236 f3d 13 dccir 2001 54 48 fed cl 361 fed cl 2000 55 berkley v

women than officers in general ostensibly due to possible past personal or institutional discrimination the claims court found that whether the army program was viewed as goal quota or otherwise the special procedures pressured review board members into making racially tainted decisions thus amounting to racial classification subject to strict scrutiny it also found that the purposes put forward by the government in defense of the policy fell short of compelling for several reasons first the armys desire to project perception of equal opportunity and to address the problem of possible past discrimination in previous training and assignments was not equivalent to finding that particular minority officer was in fact discriminated against further undermining any remedial justification for the policy was its focus on issues of past personal discriminationin promotions assignments and military school attendanceaffecting minority members of the army in general rather than previous biased acts of the retirement board the entity responsible for implementing the minority retention program in this respect the court likened the policy to remedies for societal discrimination which croson and adarand rejected as compelling governmental interest the armys plan was found to address mere statistical disparities in minority retention rates whatever the cause rather than proven present effects of past discrimination the only constitutional justification for racial affirmative action 58 the army procedure failed the additional constitutional requirement that affirmative action measures be narrowly tailored the minority retention goal was not the least intrusive means to remedy discrimination by the army in prom otions promotion or recruitment goals would accomplish the same purpose by more exact connection to identified institutional discrimination with less burden on affected nonminority officers moreover the policy was of indefinite duration with builtin time limitation and raceneutral alternatives were attempted by the government before implementing its affirmative action plan one alternative suggested by the court was to increase educational and training opportunities for all officers from underprivileged backgrounds whatever their race this it was contended would expand the pool of minorities eligible for promotion and address the armys concern for societal discrimination without employing suspect classification the government successfully appealed the remedy portion of the court of claims decree which required reinstatement and backpay of involuntarily retired white male officers 59 but the lower courts threshold determination that the minority retention program violated equal protection was neither appealed to nor addressed by the federal circuit similarly in legal action by white officer who was twice denied promotion to full colonel in 1996 and 1997 saunders v white 60 federal district court ruled the armys equal opportunity promotion process in use at the time unconstitutional the armys written instruction to promotion boards required that the possibility of personal or institutional discrimination be taken into account when evaluating the promotion files of women and minority officersboth in initial evaluation and any review or revoteand urged that the percentages promoted from these groups match their proportion in the applicant pool because army promotion selection statistics for more than two decades demonstrated that minorities and women were promoted at virtually the same rate as whitesif not slightly higherthe judge found that there was demonstrable 58 see also sirmans v brownlee 346 fsupp2d 56 ddc 2004 59 christian v united states 337 f3d 1338 fed cir 2003 60 191 fsupp2d 95 ddc 2002

race or gender in its promotion policy the fatal defect in the army policy was summed up by the district court nowhere in the memorandum are selection board officers obliged to consider the possibility of past discrimination for nonnurse corps males whites or any other group for which there is not an equal opportunity selection goal thus the memorandum instructs selection board members to for example account for an hispanic applicants past personal or institutional discrimination but not to account for white applicants past discrimination this undeniably establishes preference in favor of one race or gender over another and therefore is unconstitutional 61 g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 jody feder
