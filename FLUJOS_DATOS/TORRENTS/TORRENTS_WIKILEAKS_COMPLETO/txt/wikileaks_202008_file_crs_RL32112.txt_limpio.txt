introduction issues such as overlapping committee jurisdictions scheduling practices or imbalanced workloads have prompted periodic efforts to reorganize the senate1 since the second world war 10 different reform efforts have been launched the most recent in 1995 most major changes in rules and procedures have resulted from landmark legislation including the 1946 and 1970 legislative reorganization acts and one significant senate reorganization in 1977 more incremental changes have been the consequence of formal reorganization committees or study commissions such as the temporary select committee to study the senate committee system commonly called the stevenson committee or the commission on the operation of the senate commonly called the culver commission other attempts at self examination such as the study group on senate practices and procedures pearson ribicoff study group have generated recommendations on procedural issues only for the senate to disregard them the principal goal behind most of these reform efforts in the senate has been either to revise institutional rules and processes in order to increase efficiency or to broaden the scope of participation in the decisionmaking process or to do both legislative reorganization act of 1946 79th congress 19451947 creation congress established the joint committee on the organization of congress with passage of

committee veterans affairs formed by the merger of the pensions invalid pensions and world war veterans legislation committees ways and means formed from the existing ways and means committee the claims panel and the war claims panel were to be abolished4 recommendations on jurisdiction and oversight the joint committee recommended that for the first time the jurisdictions of each standing committee be written into the rules of the senate and the house during opening debate on the senate legislation that incorporated the joint committees proposal joint committee chair follette described how jurisdictions had been determined under senate practices prior to the 1946 act under the practice of the senate the jurisdiction of committees has grown up in part as result of their names and in part because of the general field of legislation which they normally would cover committees have also acquired jurisdiction simply because they have had the power to initiate particular piece of legislation especially in new field as result of this practice the jurisdictional lines between our committees are confused not only because they overlap but also because of the practice of having jurisdiction attach to particular committee if by chance it may have considered original legislation in some new field through the years as the activities of the federal government have grown in scope and complexity the result has been naturally to complicate an already complicated situation insofar as jurisdictional conflicts between the present committees are concerned it is in the hope of simplifying that situation and insofar as possible of anticipating and avoiding future conflicts of jurisdiction that we have attempted in this measure to spell out the jurisdiction of the standing committees which we propose5 the jurisdictional definitions according to the joint committee should enumerate the activities covered and describe their scope in terms of subject matter of legislation as well as the administrative organization of the federal government so that disputes over jurisdiction will be minimized or eliminated6 4 title iv of the legislative reorganization act of 1940 pl 601 79th cong transferred adjudication of claims against the government to the court of claims which is now the us court of federal claims 5 robert m follette organization of congress remarks in senate congressional record vol 92 june 5 1946 pp 63446345 6 us congress joint committee on the organization of congress organization of the continued crs5 the joint committee also recommended that committees exercise regular oversight of those portions of the executive branch within their jurisdictions as part of that oversight the panel recommended that each committee be given authority to issue subpoenas and to begin investigations of the executive branch on its own without advance permission of the full house or senate because of these recommendations which would empower standing committees the joint committee also called for ban on the creation of new special committees particularly those charged with conducting investigations recommendations on other matters the committee also recommended series of wideranging changes that were designed to modernize congress the joint committee recommended limit house members to one major committee assignment authorize each standing committee to hire four highly skilled professional staff the staff were to be paid between 6000 and 8000 year and were to work on committee business only the panel also suggested that committees be authorized to employ up to six clerical staff increase pay for members by 50 to 15000 from 10000 and allow members to participate in the federal retirement system increase staff pay as well create party policy committees in both chambers that would be authorized to hire staff and meet regularly with representatives of the executive branch7 establish the position of personnel director selected by the leaders of the two chambers who would set up system for finding and evaluating staff for the legislative branch require lobbyists to register with the government and disclose the sources of their funding create budget process for congress that would require the appropriations and revenue committees in both chambers to draft budget each year prohibit appropriating more than estimated receipts for given year unless congress also passed an increase in the national debt authorize the president to reduce appropriations by uniform percentage in all programs if expenditures exceeded receipts prohibit the introduction of bills to build specific bridges and certain other bills involving claims against the united states set an annual adjournment date of june 30 with members to

rehabilitation for veterans veterans hospitals and readjustment to civilian life and veterans issues that had been handled by the pensions committee which would be abolished senate veterans affairs

adopting several amendments it deleted provisions authorizing top administrative aide for member offices and creating party policy committees and stenographic pool for members the house also struck

for each member the senate adopted the revised bill by voice vote the next day clearing the measure for the president president harry s truman signed it into law on august 2 1946 pl 601 79th cong legislative reorganization act of 1970 91st congress 19691971 creation the 1970 legislative reorganization act was the product of more than five years of effort from 1965 through 1970 it began with the creation of joint committee on the organization of the congress in 1965 and concluded with legislation reported out by the house rules committee in 1970 which was based in large measure on the recommendations of the joint committee as in 1946 the joint committee was charged with studying the organization and operation of congress with an eye to making recommendations for improvement the 1965 joint committee on the organization of the congress was created by s res 2 which was agreed to by both chambers on march 11 1965 the resolution stated that the joint committee was to make full and complete study of the organization and operation of the congress of the united states and shall recommend improvements in such organization and operation with view toward crs7 strengthening the congress simplifying its operations improving its relationship with other branches of the united states government and enabling it better to meet its responsibilities under the constitution in the five years the reorganization effort took to make its way to enactment institutional tensions between the legislative branch and the executive branch escalated the vietnam war raised questions about the role each branch played in war powers congress moved to assert its role with passage over the presidents veto of the 1973 war powers resolution pl 93148 president richard m nixon also disagreed with congress over spending appropriated funds the budget fights contributed to passage of the 1974 congressional budget and impoundment control act pl 93344 which created house and senate budget committees and the congressional budget office and outlined budget process for congress to follow separate from the executive branch the 1970 act occurred at the beginning of this broad effort by congress to assert its authority over the executive branch and to increase its access to information the joint committee on the organization of the congress held 40 days of hearings between may 10 and september 23 1965 it heard from 199 witnesses including members of congress political scientists and government officials the committee issued its final report s rept 1414 on july 28 1966 it contained some 120 recommended changes to the operation of congress ranging from those affecting the committee system to the imposition of fiscal controls to increases in staffing legislation was introduced in both chambers that year but saw action it was reintroduced in the senate in 1967 as s 355 the senate passed the bill by vote of 759 on march 7 1967 but the measure saw action in the house on april 22 1969 representative william m colmer dms chair of the house rules committee appointed special fivemember subcommittee to review congressional reorganization proposals and make recommendations the special subcommittee on legislative reorganization was chaired by bf sisk dca other members were ray j madden din richard bolling dmo h allen smith rca and delbert l latta roh mr madden resigned from the subcommittee on may 6 and was replaced by representative john young dtx in 1969 the house rules committees special subcommittee on legislative reorganization held meetings over several months after compiling draft of bill the special subcommittee instructed its staff to hold series of briefings for members to explain the measure to them those briefings were held on october 16 17 20 and 21 and were attended by some 80 house members and staff through october november and december the special subcommittee held series of hearings on its draft bill at which 44 people testified and 44 more submitted their views for the record the hearings were published in 453page volume early in 1970 the special subcommittee revised its draft and reported measure to the full house rules committee early in 1970 that panel reported the measure with amendments on may 12 hr 17654 hrept 911215 the house began debate on the bill on july 13 and passed it amended on september 17 by vote of 32619 the

the measure to the white house president nixon signed the bill into law on october 26 1970 pl 91510 membership the original 1965 joint committee consisted of six senators and six representatives equally divided by party senators on the committee were as mike monroney dok john j sparkman dal lee metcalf dmt karl mundt rsd clifford p case rnj and j caleb boggs rde house members were ray j madden din jack brooks dtx ken hechler dwv thomas b curtis rmo robert p griffin rmi and durward g hall rmo senator monroney and representative madden cochaired the panel when representative griffin resigned from the house in 1966 to accept appointment to the senate he was replaced by representative james c cleveland rnh recommendations relating to committees unlike the 1946 act the 1970 act focused more on rules governing committees than on the committee structure itself one of the complaints heard most frequently from members at the time was that committee chairs wielded too much power many of the changes in the process were designed to give greater voice to minority members on committees and to make sure that chair could not always override the wishes of majority of the committee the 1970 legislative reorganization act was the product of combination of processes first the 1965 joint committee issued set of recommendations in 1966 for both the senate and the house the senate passed its version of those recommendations on march 7 1967 the house took action until creation of the house rules special subcommittee in 1969 that october the panel issued its version of recommendations based on the work of the 1965 joint committee and the legislation passed by the senate while the house special subcommittees recommendations dealt with both the house and the senate the subcommittee did not materially change the provisions of the reorganization act that the senate had passed the 1970 law was the direct result of the special subcommittees work for both the house and the senate the joint committee recommended that each committee establish set of rules to govern its actions make it easier for majority of committee to call meeting without the approval of the chair and allow committee members three days in which to file additional or minority views with committee reports senate recommendations each standing committee would be required to establish regular meeting day not less than once month under the proposal the senate recommendations called for changing senate rules to empower majority of committees members to call meeting over the objections of the committees chair committee reports would be required to be filed within seven days of committee action and all business meetings except those of the appropriations committee would be open unless majority of the committee voted to close them all hearings again except for appropriations would be open unless closed for national security reasons crs9 to help protect the rights of the minority senate committee meetings would have to be announced at least one week in advance during at least one day of hearing the minority would have the right to call witnesses and if committee member announced during business meeting that he or she wanted to have dissenting or supplemental views included in the report on the matter or measure at hand the senator would have three days in which to do so under the proposal floor consideration of measure or matter would be prohibited unless the accompanying report on it had been available for at least three calendar days though the majority and minority leaders could agree to waive this rule any senate report would have to contain the breakdown on the vote on the motion to report if there had been rollcall vote the senate proposal also called for broadcasting committee meetings subject to rules that would be determined by each committee the special subcommittee recommended that the senate agree to ban general proxy voting but permit specific proxies and to require that each committee file single annual expense report most senate standing committees were to be reduced in size and for future assignments senators were to be restricted to service on two major committees and one minor one the proposal also restricted senators to service on only one of the following committees at time appropriations armed services finance and foreign relations in the future senators could not hold more than one chairmanship or more than one subcommittee chairmanship on any major committee the senate was to rename its banking and currency committee the committee on banking housing and urban affairs and give it jurisdiction over urban affairs generally during floor debate on the proposal the senate created committee on veterans affairs with jurisdiction transferred from three other standing committees house recommendations each committee would adopt written rules which could not be inconsistent with house rules and select regular meeting day to conduct its business although additional meetings could be scheduled at the discretion of the chair like the senate recommendations those of the house would allow majority of committee to call special meeting without the assent of the committee chair and majority of the minority party could call witnesses during at least one day of hearings hearings would be announced at least one week in advance unless the committee determined it could not meet this deadline in which case the hearing date was to be noticed as soon as possible in the daily digest of the congressional record the house rules committee was exempted the special subcommittee said that committee reports should be filed within seven days of request to do so by majority of the committee this recommendation was matched by new policy to allow the speaker to recognize member of committee to call up bill on the floor if the rules committee had made it in order even if the member was not the chair of the committee the special subcommittee recommended that the minority should be given three days in which to file their opinions for committee report if they noticed their intent at the time of the committee markup reports would have to be available at least three calendar days before house consideration of bill and for appropriations bills printed committee hearings were also to be available at least crs10 three days in advance of the floor action the house rules committee was exempted from many of these proposals the special subcommittee recommended that committee business meeting or hearing be open to the public unless majority of the committee voted to close it on each motion to report committee would be required to record the votes for and against the motion and include the votes in its report the special subcommittee recommended that house committees allow their hearings to be broadcast via radio television and still photography when authorized by the majority vote of committee the special subcommittee recommended that committees be allowed to meet when the house was in session unless the house was debating bill under the five minute rule even then five committees rules appropriations government operations internal security and standards of official conduct could meet and it called on committees to provide an annual report of their activities of the previous year except for appropriations rules house administration and standards of official conduct the special subcommittee recommended that in the house the reading of the journal of the house of representatives of the united states be dispensed with and that vote on the journal be nondebatable this recommendation came in response to the perceived use of the reading of the journal and votes on its approval as dilatory tactics by the minority the house parliamentarian according to the recommendations should prepare and have printed new compilations of house precedents every five years condensed and uptodate version should be printed at the beginning of each congress the special subcommittee recommended the creation of the capitol guide service to provide free organized public tours of the capitol recommendations relating to staffing and funding only if the two party floor leaders agreed would committees be allowed to sit while the senate was in session for both the house and the senate the special subcommittee recommended that conference procedures be changed to require that both chambers print conference reports that conferees of both chambers jointly prepare an explanatory statement to accompany conference report and that debate time on conference report be equally divided between the majority and minority parties the senate recommendations called for an authorization of two additional professional staff aides for each standing committee bringing the total to six of those the minority party was afforded the right to hire two senate staff salary maximums were increased to roughly match the house maximums the recommendations called for funding process for all committees in which each committee was to file single annual funding request for its work if the committee exceeded its approved spending it would have to explain to the senate why it needed additional funding crs11 the special subcommittee recommended funding process for house committees similar to the one for the senate panels each committee was to file single annual funding request if committee exceeded its approved spending it would have to explain to the house why it needed additional funding the number of professional staff authorized for each house committee would be increased to six from four and committees would be authorized to hire consultants subject to the approval of the house administration committee the special subcommittee recommended that majority of committees minority members could hire two of the six professional employees and fill one of the six clerical positions subject to approval of the majority vote of committee any staff member could be fired by majority vote of committee the committees on standards of official conduct and appropriations would be exempt from many of these proposed rules the special subcommittee recommended that each house member be authorized to hire an administrative assistant at pay not to exceed 8955 year this recommendation was designed to match the structure in the senate which already authorized top office staff member joint recommendations that apply to both chambers the special subcommittee in the house recommended that congress set up budget process as part of that proposal it recommended that the appropriations committees in both chambers hold hearing within 30 days of submission on the entire budget proposed by the president the special subcommittee called on the treasury department and the office of management and budget to come up with uniform fiscal measurements for programs and to supply committees upon request detailed program information on government agencies the special subcommittee envisioned bigger role for the comptroller general the head of the general accounting office that office would provide analysis of existing programs and provide to committees staff expertise in doing costbenefit analysis the special subcommittee also called on the president to provide five years worth of detailed information for each program the current fiscal year and four succeeding ones the special subcommittee also recommended that the legislative reference service division of the library of congress that was designed to provide research support to lawmakers be renamed the congressional research service crs and its responsibilities be expanded and redefined the new crs would be authorized to require government agencies to provide information and could hire temporary services of experts or consultants the special subcommittee recommended that the joint committee of congress on the library be renamed the joint committee on the library and congressional research to make clear that this panel was to oversee the operations of crs the special subcommittee recommended creation of joint committee on data processing to help coordinate the acquisition and use of computers and technology the committee was to consist of 12 members six from each chamber equally divided between the majority and minority parties the special subcommittee also recommended the abolition of the joint committee on immigration and nationality policy crs12 final action several of the recommendations of the house subcommittee were changed during floor consideration the house provided that the minority was to receive less than onethird of committee staff members also agreed to begin recording how each member voted during teller votes8 taken in the committee of the whole and to allow as few as 20 members to obtain rollcall vote when in committee of the whole finally the house struck from the bill the provision creating top administrative staffer for members personal offices the senate added new veterans affairs committee to its roster the final bill established joint committee on congressional operations which was made up of 10 members five from each chamber the committee was instructed to continue to study the organization and operations of congress and make recommendations about improvements the committee was also to oversee the new office of placement and office of management which were created to assist members in finding staff and provide help with office problems the house passed the legislative reorganization act hr 17654 on september 17 1970 by vote of 32619 the senate passed the bill amended on october 6 by vote of 595 the house concurred in the senate amendments on october 8 by voice vote clearing the measure for president nixon who signed it on october 26 pl 91510 party reforms 92nd 94th congresses 19711975 in 1971 senate democrats

was first put forward in the senate democratic conference by john c culver dia senator who was active in congressional reform efforts as member of the house in the 93rd congresss select committee on committees commonly known as the bolling committee 19731975 because of his central involvement in its creation the commission on the operation of the senate is commonly called the culver commission even though senator culver did not serve on the panel in arguing for passage of s res 227 senator culver explained there is hardly senator in this body who does not sense the need for assessing and improving the operations of the senate the growth in the scale of senate operations and staffs the rising tide of the workplace the unresolved issues of pay and allowances the uncertain linkages to new sources information and technological support these pertain to all of us as we seek to fulfill our legislative tasks9 majority leader mike mansfield further indicated that the commission would make an impartial independent and comprehensive study of the senates administrative structure machinery and practices the commission would make specific recommendations with view to modernizing and improving working conditions and methods and efficiency in the senate10 membership the culver commission was composed of nine persons from private life and two ex officio commissioners who were

19831985 quayle committee creation the senate passed s res 127 by voice vote on june 6 1984 to establish the temporary select committee to study the senate committee system also known as the quayle committee for its chair senator dan quayle rin the committee was charged with making thorough study of the senate committee system and reporting back options for improving it membership in addition to senator quayle members of the committee were charles mcc mathias jr rmd jake garn rut malcolm wallop rwy bob kasten rwi warren b rudman rnh wendell h ford dky russell b long dla john melcher dmt j bennett johnston dla spark m matsunaga dhi and alan j dixon dil recommendations relating to committee jurisdiction the committee called for sequential referral of legislation reported out of one committee that contained matter in the jurisdiction of another committee under existing senate rules bill referral was based on which committee had jurisdiction over the predominant subject of the bill the select committee does not believe that it is possible to draw such neat jurisdictional lines that all matters within bill will always fall within the jurisdiction of single committee subject areas inevitably overlap and the tendency for bills to become longer and more complex increases the difficulty crs26 of vesting complete jurisdiction in one committee sequential referral seems to be the appropriate procedure for dealing with these jurisdictional overlaps31 the quayle committee proposed that if committee reported out bill that contained material in the jurisdiction of another committee that second committee would get sequential referral of the bill upon request of its chair the sequential referral would last for 30 calendar days not including days when the senate was not in session the quayle panel also recommended that similar process be followed for appropriations bills if an appropriations bill were reported that contained legislative provisions the committee with jurisdiction over that subject matter would be given an opportunity for sequential referral though the time would be limited to five days not the 30 proposed for other legislation it is the opinion of the select committee that without this kind of provision the tendency for appropriations bills to become cluttered with authorizing and other legislation will continue to seriously undermine the jurisdiction of authorizing committees32 recommendations relating to committee assignments central to the select committees plan was reduction in the number of committee assignments each senator could have the committee found that senators had too many committee assignments the report said it is the belief of our committee that if senators will agree to reduce their committee assignments our committees will be better able to perform their duties and the senate as whole will be taken more seriously as reliable and informed national policymaker33 to this end the panel recommended that each senator be limited to service on two of the committees and one of the b committees with exceptions existing rules at the time allowed some 55 exceptions to this restriction the quayle committee then recommended that the number of committee assignments available to senators be decreased the total number of slots on the committee would drop to 209 from 231 for b committees the total would go from 109 slots to 97 slots the limits would be strengthened by limiting senators to nine total positions on all the full committees and subcommittees to which they belonged appropriations committee members would be limited to 11 senators would be limited to one full committee chair on one of their committees and one subcommittee of all the committees they served on for b committees the full committee chair could not chair subcommittee on that panel finally the committee recommended that the majority and minority leaders not be counted when counting for quorum during business meeting on vote to

also recommended that debate rules in the senate be changed so that there would be time limit on debate on motions to proceed and to create new device that would enable the senate with 60member vote to allow only germane amendments to be offered to legislation final action the quayle committee made its recommendations on november 29 1984 senator quayle introduced the panels recommendations on january 3 1985 s res 31 but the resolution saw action during its committee assignment process in 1985 the senate did pare down some assignments reducing the number of seats on several committees which senator quayle reportedly said was marginal success anytime you take away 17 committee assignments from 17 senators youre moving in the right direction34 report of the committee on rules and administration 100th congress 1988 1989 pursuant to its responsibility under rule xxv to study and report to the senate on the organization and operation of the senate the senate rules and administration committee in 1988 undertook study to improve senate operations and subsequently reported number of proposals for consideration the committee concluded that jurisdictional reorganization of the senate committee system was unnecessary it also determined that problems with the committee system were generally attributable to the large sizes of committees and the increasing number of assignments to each senator accordingly the committee recommended that the senate enforce the rules already in existence and resist exception and waivers to assignment rules35 joint committee on the organization of congress 102nd and 103rd congresses 19911992 and 19931995 jcoc creation the bicameral joint committee on the organization of congress jcoc was created on august 6 1992 with the passage

washington gpo 1988 crs28 at the time there was sense among members that the issues facing congress had changed considerably over period of years but the internal structures of the institution had not kept pace many members expressed increasing frustration with the workings of congress and record number of members chose to retire in the 102nd congress many citing this frustration as contributing factor36 in their decision additionally congress was beset by string of highprofile scandals that hurt public opinion beginning in 1989 with the resignation of house speaker jim wright dtx and followed in 1990 and 1991 by allegations that certain senators had improperly influenced federal regulators on behalf of campaign contributor charles keating the legislation to create the jcoc received little response when it was introduced in july 1991 but the proposal gained momentum as additional scandals relating to management problems at the house bank and the house post office received widespread media attention and led to the resignation of the house sergeant at arms and the house postmaster against this backdrop the publics already skeptical attitude about congress deteriorated and public disapproval ratings of congress hit an alltime high of 77 in the summer of 1992 senator boren focused on this national mood in remarks on the senate floor saying as an institution congress is in trouble the american people have described it as wasteful inefficient and compromised by the way it finances its campaigns during this years congressional campaigns the american people have sent an unmistakable message to congress if you refuse to set your house in order we will elect those who will do it for you the longer we delay the reform of this troubled institution we allow it to slip deeper into bureaucratic disarray37 h res 192 was approved on june 18 1992 by vote of 4124 in the house and unanimously after one amendment in the senate on july 30 1992 the senate amendment barred the joint committee from conducting business prior to november 15 1992 and was intended to keep the joint committee free from the potential pressures of electionyear politics the house concurred in the senates amendment on august 6 1992 h res 192 directed the joint committee before december 31 1993 to make full and complete study of the organization and operation of the congress and to recommend improvements which would strengthen the effectiveness of the congress simplify its operations improve its relationships with and oversight of other branches of the

the joint committee on the organization of congress conducted eight days of hearings between april 20 and may 13 1993 exclusively on the issue of committee structure at these hearings jurisdictional questions were addressed more often than any other theme number of witnesses cautioned that jurisdictional changes would engender great deal of internal resistance that could possibly bring down the entire reform package43 former senator adlai stevenson for example citing lessons learned by the stevenson committee cautioned against recommending broad jurisdictional realignments that could endanger support for the jcocs final work product the senate subcommittee of the jcoc ultimately avoided advocating wholesale committee jurisdictional realignment as senators kassebaum cohen lott and lugar wrote in additional views to the senate subcommittee report we believe that significant restructuring of committee jurisdictions to bring the two houses more nearly into line with each other and with the executive branch would do much to clarify lines of responsibility reduce wasteful overlap and duplication of effort and make the congress more effective more efficient and 43 us congress joint committee on the organization of congress organization of the congress final report pp 2324 crs31 more accountable however committee members concluded early in our work that producing an ideal report that would be dead on arrival benefitted one44 the senate subcommittee opted instead for recommending reforms to the organizational structure of committees under rule xxv as well as suggesting changes in how members were assigned to committees and limitations on committee and subcommittee service all senate and house joint committees economic library organization of congress printing and taxation would be abolished and their functions transferred to other entities the functions of the joint economic committee would be transferred to the senate budget committee the joint library and joint printing committees work would shift to the senate committee on rules and administration and the job of the joint tax committee would shift to the congressional budget office45 recommendations relating to committee assignments under their recommendations four categories of committees would be established under senate rule xxv super b and c each senator would be limited to two committee assignments either one super committee armed services appropriations finance or foreign relations and one committee agriculture banking commerce energy environment governmental affairs judiciary or labor or two committees and one b committee aging budget indian affairs rules small business veterans affairs assignments on the ethics and intelligence committees would not count against these

senators could belong to two subcommittees per committee except appropriations and one subcommittee per b committee senators could receive waiver of those assignment limits only after obtaining the permission of their party caucus and following recorded vote of the full senate the senate subcommittee also proposed that the majority and minority leaders assign senators of their respective parties to committees in keeping with rules established by the parties if restrictions on committee membership caused committee to fall below half its current size the senate would have to vote on whether the committee should be abolished that provision was known as the minimus rule the senate subcommittee also recommended changes to senate regular meeting days super committees could meet only on tuesdays committees on wednesdays and b committees on thursdays the appropriations committee budget committee and c committees were exempt from those meeting requirements and could meet at any time recommendations on other matters the senate subcommittee of the jcoc made number of other recommendations in areas outside jurisdictional reform47 they included 47 ibid pp 722 crs33 budget process moving to twoyear budget cycle under such system the budget resolution and appropriations bills would be considered during the first year multiyear authorizations and oversight activities would take place in the second year by not having to pass new budget every year the subcommittee argued committees would have more time to review how laws are working and the executive branch would enjoy more stable budget environment during the second year the budget committee would focus on longterm planning by holding hearings on problem areas identified by oversight activities the senate subcommittee also included provision that would require the congressional budget office to prepare quarterly reports comparing revenues spending and the deficit for the current fiscal year with assumptions in the budget resolution the senate went on to clarify that the socalled byrd rule which bars the inclusion of extraneous matter in any reconciliation legislation considered in the senate would be permanent and would require threefifths of all senators to waive ethics and application of laws regarding the ethics process and the application of laws to congress whereas the house subcommittee made specific recommendations for reform the senate subcommittee did not instead deferring recommendations on those issues to senate leadership task forces that were established to consider changes in these areas proxies and committee votes under the subcommittees recommendations proxies could not be used in committee if they would affect the outcome of vote the records of senate committee attendance and voting would be published semiannually in the congressional record floor procedure and scheduling the senate subcommittee recommended that motion to proceed to consider bill could longer be filibustered after cloture was invoked threefifths vote would be required to overturn ruling of the chair and quorum call time would count against the senator who suggested the absence of quorum the subcommittee suggested dispensing with the reading of conference reports available one day prior to consideration it also suggested that amendments expressing the sense of congress or the senate require the cosponsorship of at least 10 senators staffing and support agencies the senate subcommittee proposed that the senate cut its staff levels in proportion to those proposed by the executive branch in its national performance review approximately 12 over five years in addition congress would have to reimburse the executive branch and other agencies such as the general accounting office for the expenses of staff detailed to the senate unused funds from senate office or committee accounts would not be available for reprogramming the secretary of the senate would be directed to publish in the congressional record an annual list of those offices using less than the amount the offices were budgeted for personnel also the permanent authorizations for gao cbo crs gpo and ota would be repealed and replaced with authorizations of eight years in length crs34 legislativeexecutive relations the senate subcommittee recommended that during the second session of congress gao give priority to congressional requests for audits and evaluations of executive branch programs the senate subcommittee also made numerous specific suggestions relating to improving the efficiency of the printing of congressional and government documents it further recommended that all standing committees prepare oversight agendas for the programs under their jurisdictions final action house and senate members introduced separate legislation on february 3 1994 embodying the final recommendations of the jcoc these packages became known as the legislative reorganization act of 1994 hr 3801 and s 1824 respectively s 1824 was referred to the senate committee on rules and administration after series of hearings the committee conducted markups and reported out s 1824 amended and two reform resolutions one dealing with committees and one dealing with floor procedure the senate sponsors of s 1824 subsequently made an unsuccessful attempt to attach an amendment embodying the provisions of s 1824 to the district of columbia appropriations bill however this effort was stopped when point of order was raised and sustained that it violated the congressional budget act the 103rd congress 19931995 adjourned without further consideration of the senate bills hr 3801 was referred to the house committees on rules house administration and government operations the 103rd congress adjourned without considering hr 3801 however the house did act on legislation embodying the portion of hr 3801 that would apply several worker safety and employment laws to congress on august 10 1994 the house passed hr 4822 the congressional accountability act by substantial margin the senate did not act on the legislation in the final days of the congress the house enacted h res 578 legislation that amended house rules in manner similar but not identical to hr 4822 the main difference between hr 4822 and h res 578 was that the resolution did not allow for judicial review of employee complaints 1995 senate republican working group 104th congress 19951997 following the 1994 elections incoming majority leader robert dole rks named republican working group to explore reform options the group was headed by senator pete v domenici rnm who served as senate vice chair of the joint committee on the organization of congress and senator connie mack rfl many of the proposals made by the working group were based on the recommendations of the joint committee on the organization of congress included were proposals to reduce the number of subcommittees clamp down on excessive committee assignments curtail proxy voting in committee cut staff resources implement twoyear budget and appropriations process and impose twohour limit for debate on motions to bring up legislation on the senate floor the working group proposed that its recommendations be presented to the senate in three separate measures committee structure staffing administration and support agencies budget crs35 process and floor procedure the working group plan was never considered by the senate although several components were acted on other initiatives affecting the senate were implemented in 1995 although they affected republican senators only republican conference task force was created to explore how party loyalty among committee leaders might be enhanced senator connie mack headed the effort other task force members were senators rick santorum rpa trent lott rms larry craig rid fred thompson rtn john kyl raz don nickles rok and bob packwood ror the task force released an eight point reform plan that called for term limits for committee leaders requirement that indicted committee leaders relinquish their position provision that senators leaving and then returning to committee relinquish their seniority on the panel limit of one full or subcommittee leadership post per member except for appropriations provision allowing the republican leader to fill vacancies on top committees if two or more occurred simultaneously an amendment to senate rules that the party caucuses have sole authority to select and remove committee leaders the establishment of republican legislative agenda at the beginning of each congress provision that the republican leader nominate each committee leader for confirmation by the full republican conference the republican conference passed modified version of the mack proposal the terms of republican committee leaders were limited to six years as chair and six years as ranking minority member although the limits would not take effect until 1997 the
