invasive species summary in recent years many people have become increasingly aware that the globalization of trade the increased speed of travel the massive volume of cargo shipments and rising tourism have combined to increase the chance of accidental introductions of foreign species into th united states aquatic species arrive through variety of mechanisms uninten tionally when attached to vessel hulls or carried in vessel ballast water and inten tionally when imported for aquaria display as live seafood for human consumption or as transplant to increase sport fishing opportunities the arrival of zebra mussels in the great lakes and their s ubsequent damage to city water supplies and electric utilities has focused significant attention on ballast water discharge by cargo ships as high risk mechanism for sp ecies invasion new management efforts attempt to address this concern congress is considering legislative proposals to amend and reaut horize the nonindigenous aquatic

plants and animals so that more of them survive the journey and the different modes of transport for hitchhiking organisms invasive species have become global concern although there are many ways in which species may invade1 this report focuses on ballast water discharge by cargo ships as one of the more significant mechanisms for biotic invasion of coastal and estuarine habita ts as well as inland navigable waters the arrival of zebra mussels in the gr eat lakes in the late 1980s and their subsequent damage to city water supplies and electric utilities2 focused initial attention on ballast water as source of invasive species reflecting the scope of the problem the san francisco baydelta ecosystem is considered to be one of the most disrupted aquatic ecosystems in the united

ships to provide stability and maneuverability during voyage when ships are not carrying cargo are not carrying heavy enough cargo or require mo re stability due to rough seas8 ballast water may be either fresh or saline ballast water may also be carried so that ship rides low enough in the water to pass under bridge s and other structures ballast water management bwm for vessels includes all measures that aim to prevent unwanted aquatic nuisance species from being transported between ports in the ballast seaports in which ships exchange ballast wa ter daily are at severe risk of invasions organisms transported to us ports from foreign harbors with similar physiochemical characteristics eg water temperatures salinity regimes pose an especially high risk of invasion even if only tiny proportion of newly arriving non native species survive in new habitats ch as san francisco bay chesapeake bay or boston harbor the actual number of successf ul invasive species can be very large there are several different ways of mana ging ballast water currently the most widely used is ballast water exchange ballast water exchange means that ships on their way to the next port release the lowersalinity coastal water they brought aboard in their last port and replace it with highe rsalinity openocean water although this measure is not perfect it reduces the numbe r of potentially invasive species in the ballast tanks and replaces them with oceanic organisms that are less likely to survive in the lowersalinity nearshore waters of the ships next port9 however organisms with wide tolerance for differing salinities may survive ballast water exchange especially any such organisms that may reside in the unpumpabl residual water and sediment remaining in the tanks during any ballast water exchangehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32344crs3 10 detailed discussion and evaluation of va rious ballast water treatment options is presented in chapter 4 shipboard treatment options of

research and deve lopment and several technologies and methodologies have been proposed thes include mechanical methods eg filtration and sepa ration physical methods eg st erilization by ultraviolet light ozone heat electric current or ultrasound and chemical methods using biocides in addition treatment may comb ine several of these methods11 treatment may be an appropriate management option on occasions when vessels temporarily operate without ballast noballast onboard nobob situation when ship is carrying ballast water it presents unique treatment problems because large numbers of organisms can re side in the unpumpable residual water and sediment remaining in the ba llast tanks few of the sted methodologies have been applied to the control of or ganisms in nobob situations12 the treatment option favored by many ship operators because of its intrinsic simplicity and relatively low cost is biocide application whereby chemi cal agents are added to the ballast water to minimize the number of ie kill viable organisms this approach also has the potential to address the nobob condition13 concerns remain relating to establishing and enforcing standards for th appropriate disposal of biocidetreated ballast water and sediments although estimates of the co sts of ballast tr eatment may be imp recise and vary from vessel to vessel there is some general agreement on average costs14 f r example it may cost an estimate d 400000 per vessel for modification of containerbulk vessels to use onshore ballast water treatment facilities at california ports more generally the cost of retrofitting vessels to treat ballast water has been estimated at between 200000 and 310000 per ve ssel for mechanical treatment and around 300000 for chemical treatment15
