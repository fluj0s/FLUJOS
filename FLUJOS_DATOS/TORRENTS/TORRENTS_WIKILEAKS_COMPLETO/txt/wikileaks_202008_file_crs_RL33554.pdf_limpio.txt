debate over human stem cell research is how to treat human embryonic stem cell research esr which may lead to lifesaving treatments but which requires the destruction of embryos the current federal policy established by the george w bush administration in 2001 allows federal money to be used to support esr on cell lines created 1 with appropriate informed consent of the donors 2 using embryos created for reproductive purposes and 3 before the date of the policy the third element has generated the most debate and prompted some states to fund esr themselves and others to further restrict esr congress faces range of policy options each one prompting set of ethical dilemmas first congress could allow federal funding for esr regardless of the date the stem cell lines were established supporters of expanded federal funding assert that many frozen embryos created for in vitro fertilization ivf will be destroyed and could be used for research regulated by the federal government critics seek to limit embryo destruction and federal funding for it second congress could do nothing allowing the current po licy to endure supporters contend that current policy balances research interests and opposition to embryo destruction critics for and against esr call the date delineation ethically irrelevant either because it stifles research or provides monopoly to those who first destroyed embryos third congress could fund additional research that may eventually generate embryonic stem cells without destroying embryos supporters assert that this facilitates research without ethical dilemmas critics characterize it as unnecessary costly and diversion from developing treatments finally congress could discourage esr via tax measures or limit it by restricting funding or research banning certain cloning or scientific techniques or giving embryos the constitutional right to life or by some other m easure supporters claim their approaches respect human dignity critics claim they harm people already living this report which will be updated is one of several congressional research service crs reports on stem cell research it details the ethical arguments that surround esr the broadest is the balance of embryo destruction and relief of human suffering more subtle issues focus on the relative importance of the viability of embryos the purpose of embryo creation new versus existing cell lines the consent of donors the ethics of egg procurement the effectiveness of alternatives the possibility of generating embryonic stem cells without destroying

research is controversial not because of its goals but rather because of the means of obtaining some of the cells research involving most types of human stem cells such as those derived from adult tissues and umbilical cord blood has been uncontroversial except when its effectiveness as an alternative to embryonic stem cells is debated the crux of the debate centers around embryonic stem cells which enable research that may facilitate the development of medical treatments and cures but which require the destruction of an embryo to derive 1 in addition because cloning is one method of producing embryos for research the ethical issues surrounding cloning are also relevant two policies are currently in force governing human embryonic stem cell research esr since fy1996 the dickey amendment provision added to each years laborhealth and human services hhseducation appropriations legislation has prohibited the use of national institutes of health nih funds for the creation of human embryos for research purposes or research in which human embryo or embryos are destroyed di scarded or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death greater than that allowed for research on fetuses in utero under 45 cfr 46204b this policy effectively precludes the use of federal funding to derive stem cells from embryos which typically are produced via in vitro fertilization ivf however the extracted embryonic stem cells can be used to generate embryonic stem cell lines that may continue to divide for many months to years according to legal opini on issued by the hhs general council in 1999 by contrast to funding restrictions that dickey places on the derivation of stem cells from embryos federal funding for research performed with em bryonic stem cells themselves which does not itself involve embryos or the extraction of stem cells from embryos is not proscribed by the dickey amendment 2 it is funding for research with these embryonic stem cell lines that is the subject of the second policy and of much of the current legislation before congress in august 2001 president george w bush announced that federal funds could be used for research on human embryonic stem cells but only on the lines that had been established as of the date of the policy in which the embryos had been obtained with appropriate informed consent from the donors and in which the embryos had been created for reproductive purposes3 as of january 2009 21 lines were available though initially it had been projected that approximately three times as many lines would meet the criteria4 in 2008 questions were raised about whether one quarter of the lines eligible for federal funding actually met policys the informed consent requirements5 even before 2008 many supporters of esr viewed the bush policyparticularly 1 for an overview of various religious perspectives on embryonic stem cell research see leroy walters human embryonic stem cell research an intercultural perspective kennedy

states was lagging behind other countries in publishing esr studies6 in response many states funded their own initiatives7 many opponents of esr caution that spending any federal money to support research that involves or derives from the destruction of human embryos is unethical some also point to the actions of south korean scientist dr hwang woo suk whose laboratory fabricated results of stem cells extracted from cloned embryos as reflective of research community more than willing to play fast and loose with the facts in order to get their way 8 many of those in favor of esr assert that regulation is desirable in order to ensure that the benefits of the research are affordable by all that they do not endanger the wellbeing of women who provide eggs for research and that they are not used for socially and ethically unacceptable purposes such as eugenics9 g18g155g152g153g152g151g142g151g157g156g561g138g151g141g561g17g153g153g152g151g142g151g157g156g561 in the embryonic stem

meeting 9 of 17 council members voted to support cloning for medical research purposes without moratorium provided regulatory mechanism was established because one member of the council had not attended the meetings and was not voting the vote seemed to be 9 to 8 in favor of research cloning however draft versions of the council report sent to council members on june 28 2002 indicated that 2 of the group of 9 members had changed their votes in favor of moratorium both made it clear that they have ethical problem with cloning for biomedical research but felt that moratorium would provide time for additional discussion the changed vote took many council members by surprise and some on the council believe that th moratorium option as opposed to ban was thrown in at the last minute and did not receive adequate discussion in addition some on the council believe that the widely reported final vote of 10 to 7 in favor of moratorium does not accurately reflect the fact that the majority of the council has problem with the ethics of biomedical cloning transcripts of the council meetings and papers developed by staff for discussion during council meetings can be found at

ethical implications number of bills have been introduced that touch upon the subject several would have allowed federal support for research regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived one such bill came closer to enactment than any other on stem cell research s 5 in the 110 th congress in 2007 congress passed s 5 but not by enough votes to override the presidential veto that followed when the white house vetoed the bill it issued executive order expanding approved stem cell lines in ethically responsible ways eo 620 the specifics of which are discussed in the next subsection27 another set of introduced bills sought to create incentives for activities that avoided esr some of these would have required federal support or tax benefits for research or activities that avoided damaging embryos others would have created addi tional oversight for the conduct of esr still others would have created bank of nonembryonic stem cells from amniotic fluid and placentas third set of bills sought to further restrict or prohibit esr some would have accomplished this through legislation that would have placed the language of the dickey amendment in statute andor expended it by prohibiting federal funding using stem cells derived in violation of the other restrictions others would have allowed funding only in very specific circumstances such as when using techniques with nonliving embryos that were created for reproductive purposes still others would have amended other law such as that governing the right to life organ transplantation 28 cloning or the creation of animalhuman hybrids to prohibit esr or restrict some aspect its conduct

pluripotent stem cell registry and v adds to the registry new human pluripotent stem cell lines that clearly meet the standard set forth in the order finally it directs the secretary to deliver an annual report to the president on progress made under the order section two sets forth principles with which the secretarys actions are to be consistent i to direct hhs including nih to intensify peer reviewed research that may result in improved understanding of treatments for diseases and other adverse health conditions and to promote the derivation of human pluripotent stem cell lines from variety of alternative sources while clearly meeting the standard set forth in the order ii it is critical to establish moral and ethical boundaries to allow the nation to move forward vigorously with medical research while also maintaining the highest ethical standards and respecting human life and human dignity iii the destruction of nascent life for research violates the principle that life should be used as mere means for achieving the medical benefit of another iv human embryos and fetuses as living members of the human species are not raw materials to be exploited or commodities to be bought and sold and v the federal government has duty to exercise responsible stewardship of taxpayer funds both supporting important medical research and respecting ethical and moral boundaries section three provides two definitions and one provision to be used when interpreting the order i human embryo means any organism not prot ected as human subject under 45 cfr 46 as of the date of this order that is derived by fertilization parthenogenesis cloning or any other means from one or more human gametes or human diploid cells ii subjecting to harm human embryo means subjecting such an embryo to risk of injury or death greater than that allowed for research on fetuses in utero under 45 cfr 46204b and section 498b of the public health service act 42 usc 289gb as of the date of this order and iii nothing in this order shall be construed to affect any policy guideline or regulation regarding embryonic stem cell research human cloning by scnt or any other research not specifically authorized by this order or to forbid the use of existing stem cell lines deemed eligible for other federally funded research in accordance with the presidential policy decision of august 9 2001 for research specifically authorized by this order section four specifies that the order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations it also specifies that it is not intended to and does not create any right benefit or privilege substantive or procedural enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the united states its departments agencies or entities its officers employees or agents or any other person none of the sections contains measures contrary to the president bushs august 2001 policy while it has been argued that eo 620

positions on esr may be broadly categorized as for or against there is an array of finer distinctions present these finer distinctions in turn reveal the variation in ethical and moral as well as factual beliefs the following discussion breaks down the arguments ab out esr according to these finer distinctions demonstrating both the complexity of the issues and the points of resonance among the groups g7g150g139g155g162g152g561g6g142g156g157g155g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g20g142g149g146g142g143g561g152g143g561g10g158g150g138g151g561g21g158g143g143g142g155g146g151g144g561 most positions on esr rest at least in part on the relative moral weight accorded to embryos and that accorded to the prospect of saving prolonging or improving others lives for some the inquiry begins and ends with this question for instance one opponent of the research the american life league posits that human life begins at conceptionfertilization and that there is never an acceptable reason for intentionally taking an innocent human life 30 similarly the united states conference of catholic bishops states that the research is immoral because it relies on the destruction of some defenseless human beings for the possible benefit to others31 some groups explore the moral standing of human embryos and also consider the duty to relieve the pain and suffering of others32 others take the position that embryos do not have the same moral status as persons they acknowledge that embryos are genetically human but hold that they do not have the same moral relevance because they lack specific capacities including consciousness reasoning and sentience33 they also argue that viewing embryos as persons would rule out all fertility treatments that involve the creation and discarding of excess embryos and further assert that we do not have the same moral or religious response to the natural loss of embryos through miscarriage that we do to the death of infants34 some have also rooted their arguments in religious texts which inform them that an isolated fertilized egg does not enjoy the full status of personhood and its attendant protections 35 they conclude that performing research to benefit persons justifies the destruction of embryos acceptance of the notion that the destruction of embryos can be justified in some circumstances forms the basis of prostem cell research opinions and is usually modified with some combination of the distinctions and limitations that follow 30 american life league the bush stem cell decision 2001 at httpwwwallorg

viability distinction rests on the premise that it is morally preferable for embryos that will not grow or develop beyond certai n stage andor those that would otherwise be discarded to be used for the purpose of alleviating human suffering the 2001 bush policy requires among other things use of stem cells derived from only excess nonviable embryos for federally funded research one report of the presidents council explores the moral significance of viability that is based upon human choices rather than an embryos own intrinsic nature but draws conclusions36 second report broaches the subject of viability recommending that congress ban both the transfer of human embryo to womans uterus for any purpose other than to produce liveborn child and also research conducted on embryos more than 10 to 14 days after fertilization 37 the nbac report touches on the moral status of embryos in utero and those in vitro38 though nbac does not specify whether viability was key rationale for its recommendations group of representatives39 group of senators40 and camr imply but do not state distinction based on viability by expressly calling for the use of excess embryos developed for ivf and making mention of those in utero41 uojca makes similar argument in its letter by contrast the national academies and the group of nobel laureates more broadly support research on embryos making mention of viability g18g158g155g153g152g156g142g561g152g143g561g7g150g139g155g162g152g561g5g155g142g138g157g146g152g151g561 separate distinction that often leads to the same conclusions as viability is the purpose for which embryos are created this distinction draws an ethical line based upon the intent of the people creating embryos in the view of some it is permissible to create an embryo for reproductive purposes such as ivf but impermissible to create one with the intention of destroying it for research others worry that moral lines will erode quicklyfrom using only spare embryos left over in fertility clinics to creating human embryos solely for research to creating or trying to create cloned embryos solely for research 42 most groups at least note the potential ethical significance of reproductive versus research motives for creating embryos the 2001 bush policy draws motive distinction by including requirement that federally funded research be conducted only on

draws the same distinction by recommending that federal funding be used for embryos remaining after infertility treatment but not for research involving the derivation or use of stem cells from embryos made for research purposes or from cloned embryos produced by scnt43 uojca argue similarly that they believe it is entirely appropriate to utiliz for this research existing embryos such as those created for ivf purposes that would otherwise be discarded but for this research we think it another matter to create embryos ab initio for the sole purpose of conducting this form of research 44 the presidents council recommends that congress ban attempts at conception by any means other than the union of egg and sperm essentially banning cloning via scnt but does not specify whether embryos might be created in vitro specifically for research purposes45 two council members expressed dissenting opinion in medical journal article arguing that scnt resembles tissue culture and that the products of scnt should be available for research46 group of representatives group of senators and camr imply but do not state that embryos should not be created for research purposes they overtly call for the use of excess embryos developed for ivf and make mention of embryos created expressly for research47 by contrast the national academies supports the creation of embryos for research purposes including via cloning scnt to ensure that stem cellbased therapies can be broadly applied for many conditions and people by overcoming the problem of tissue rejection 48 mrs nancy reagan her supporters and the group of nobel laureates also take this position g16g142g160g561g138g151g141g561g7g161g146g156g157g146g151g144g561g5g142g149g149g561g14g146g151g142g156g561 further distinction has been drawn based upon the timing of the creation of embryonic stem cell lines here the premise is that it is unacceptable to induce the destruction of embryos for the creation of new lines however in cases in which embryos have already been destroyed and the lines already exist it is morally preferable to use those lines for research to improve the human condition this was one central distinction drawn in the 2001 bush policy which limited the use of federal funding to research on lines derived on or before the date of the policy supporters of the bush policy on both sides of the issue favor this distinction as compromise it allows research on some embryonic stem cell lines it deters the future destruction of embryos for research the presidents council writes that the bush policy mixes prudence with principle in the hope that the two might reinforce rather than undermine each other 49 the council notes that the policy is 43 national bioethics advisory commission ethical issues in

from prior bad acts referring to embryo destruction it prevents the government from complying in the commission of or encouraging the act in the future and it reaffirms the principle that the act was wrong50 the same report also contains analyses of the bush policy that characterize distinction between new and existing cell lines as arbitrary unsustainable and inconsistent51 the council itself takes position in the report on this or any other issue opponents of the bush policy on both sides of the issue view the distinction between new and existing stem cell lines with reproach one side which includes the national right to life committee and the united states conference of ca tholic bishops objects because the distinction validates destruction of embryos and rewards t hose who did so first with monopoly the other side which includes the national academies group of representatives group of senators nancy reagan and her supporters gerald ford camr and the group of nobel laureates objects because the distinction limits the number of embryonic stem cell lines available for research particularly since the number of authorized lines are dwindling 52 and are contaminated with mouse feeder cells53 likewise though nbac recognized the distinction between destroying embryos and using ones previously destroyed eg derivation of embryonic stem cells involves destroying the embryos whereas abortion precedes the donation of fetal tissue and death precedes the donation of whole organs for transplantation54 it still recommended future development of embryonic stem cell lines uojca also recognizes distinction between new and existing lines research on embryonic stem cells must be conducted under careful guidelines that relate to where the embryonic stem cells to be researched upon are taken from55 g5g152g151g156g142g151g157g561g152g143g561g6g152g151g152g155g156g561 there is consensus throughout wide array of vi ewpoints about esr that embryos should only be obtained for research with the consent of their biological donors this consent requirement necessitates that embryos be taken only with donors knowledge understanding and uncoerced agreement which may in fact be complicated by conflicting studies regarding the longterm health effects of egg donation56 the donor consent requirement is consistent with the rules governing human beings participation in research and with individuals general legal authority to make decisions regarding embryos they procreate potential drawback of the requirement is that it may restrict the number of embryos available for research purposes the 2001 bush policy contains donor consent requirement it limits approved stem cell lines to those derived with the informed consent of the donors and obtained without any financial inducements to the donors despite the policy 2008 report indicated that there may have been 50 ibid 51 the presidents council on bioethics monitoring stem cell research january 2004 pp 6367 52 bridget

those of informed consent and payment the topic of informed consent in egg procurement came to the publics attention in november 2005 with allegations that some human eggs used in south korean scientist dr hwangs laboratory had been obtained under coercive conditions informed consent can be undermined when coercive situation prevents free choice from being made or when insufficient information is provided to the person making decision the situation alleged in dr hwangs laboratory raises the issue of coercion both because subordinate women in the laboratory allegedly donated eggs and because some women were allegedly paid for their eggs 2002 study conducted by university of pennsylvania student raised the issue of insufficient information finding that number of programs seeking donor eggs for reproductive purposes downplayed the risks involved in egg retrieval 61 the wide consensus regarding the need for informed consent necessarily implies similar consensus on the need for an informationrich coercionfree method of obtaining eggs however there is some disagreement on the specifics of whether payment for eggs necessarily constitutes coercion paying women for their eggs which has been debated in the context of seeking donor eggs both for reproductive purposes for example to enable women who do not produce their own eggs to become pregnant and for research purposes is not unheard of in the united states according to 2000 study by the american society of repro ductive medicine asrm some ivf programs reportedly offered as much as 5000 for one egg

have been reported elsewhere63 dr huangs laboratory reportedly made payments of 1400 to each woman who donated eggs64 payments are not illegal in the unites states nor were they illegal in south korea at the time dr huangs laboratory allegedly made them the questions are is payment for egg donation ever acceptable and if so what amount is appropriate several arguments have been put forth in favor of payment for egg donation many focused on donation for reproductive purposes65 first some have argued that payment creates incentives to increase the number of egg donors thus facilitating research and benefitting infertile couples second some reason that payment for eggs give s women parity with sperm donors who may be compensated for donating gametes at lower rate given that they require much less involved procedure in addition some argue that participants should be offered an amount commensurate with the time inconvenience discomfort and risks of the procedure as is the general practice in biomedical research 66 third some allege that fairness dictates that women who donate eggs ought to be able to benefit from their action fourth some claim that pressures created by financial incentives may be greater than those experienced by women asked to make altruistic egg donations for relatives or friends and may thus not rise to the level of coercion these are the types of arguments that led asrm to recommend in 2000 that sums of up to 5000 may be appropriate for typical egg donation while sums of up to 10000 may possibly be justified if there are particular difficulties woman must endure to make her donation several arguments have also been put forth against payment for egg donation first some voiced fears that payment might lead to the exploitation of women particularly poor women and the commodification of reproductive tissues 67 second some have argued that payment for eggs for research purposes might undermine public confidence in endeavors such as human esr68 arguments such as these have prompted both the national academies and the presidents council to recommend that women not be paid for donating their eggs for research purposes it also led the presidents council to note that in theory there is the possibility that eggs could be procured from ovaries harvested from cadavers which might at least alleviate concerns related to coercion it is worth noting that woman may choose to undergo egg retrieval for her own reproductive purposes which would effectively take the process of egg procurement out of the research arena 62 american

embryonic stem cells can be found in amniotic fluid may do the same although the lead scientist conducting research on the amniotic cells and others have stated that amniotic cells will not make embryonic stem cells irrelevant 69 perhaps more promising scientists claim to have generated pluripotent stem cells from adult cells though technical and safety concerns regarding the cells

embryonic stem cells argue that therapies and cures can be developed without the morally undesirable destruction of embryos eo 620 affirmatively directs the pursuit of alternative methods of deriving embryonic stem cells implying both belief in the promise and necessity of such actions not all scientists agree that adult stem cells or pluripotent stem cells derived from adult tissue hold as much potential as embryonic stem cells notably during congressional subcommittee hearing when the nih director dr elias zerhouni was asked if other avenues of research should be pursued instead he stated that the presentations about adult stem cells holding as much or more potential than embryonic stem cells in my view do not hold scientific water i think they are overstated 71 concerns have been raised that pluripotent stem cells derived from adult tissue may not be as versatile as embryonic stem cells and may induce tumors72 most supporters of esr believe that it is the quickest and perhaps in some cases the only path that will yield results supporters also stress that embryonic and other stem cell research should be conducted collaboratively so that they can inform one another on related note some have pointed out that benefits from one alternative to esr umbilical cord blood banking may only be available to families who can afford to pay private companies storage fees 69 rick

mixed the presidents council notes that there is debate about the relative merits of embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells73 focus on the family cites promising nonembryonic stem cell research adult stem cells may be as flexible as embryonic ones and equally capable of converting into various cell types for healing the body74 by contrast the national academies finds that the best available scientific and medical evidence indicates that research on both embryonic and adult human stem cells will be needed 75 nbac finds in its deliberations that the claim that there are alternatives to using stem cells derived from embryos is not at the present time supported scientifically76 camr supports both embryonic and adult stem cell research and adds that many scientists believe and studies show that embryonic stem cells will likely be more effective in curing diseases because they can grow and differentiate into any of the bodys cells and tissues and thus into different organs 77 mrs nancy reagan and her supporters favor expedient approaches including esr78 several laws have supported the development of stem cells from sources other than embryos for each of fiscal years 2004 through 2006 congress allocated money in the hhs appropriations for the establishment and continuation of national cord blood stem cell bank within the health resources and services administration in 2005 congress enacted pl 109129 for the collection and maintenance of human cord blood stem cells for the treatment of patients and for research

one possible alternative to esr as it has typically been conducted the ability to generate embryonic stem cells without destroying human embryos was explored by the presidents council in its 2005 white paper79 described in the introductory section of this report the white paper discusses four potential methods of obtaining embryonic stem cells without having to destroy embryos those methods the scientific and practical merits of which remain far from settled are 1 extracting cells from organismically dead embryos 2 nonharmful biopsy of living embryos 3 bioengineering embryolike artifacts and 4 dedifferentiating somatic cells80 in the white paper the presidents council exam ined the ethical acceptability of each method the first two seek to avoid the destruction of embryos either by developing standards for declaring an embryo dead when its cells have stopped dividing or by removing cell from an 73 the presidents council on bioethics monitoring stem cell research january 2004 p

would avoid having to use an embryo altogether by attempting to obtain embryonic stem cells through the destruction of something that is not an embryo the council concluded that the use of organismically dead embryos raises number of ethical questions that have yet to be answered they include whether it is possible to be certain that an embryo is really dead whether the proposal wo uld put embryos at additional risk and whether ivf practitioners would be encouraged to create extra embryos september 2006 report that team based in serbia and england had derived stem cells from dead embryos prompted precisely these types of questions as well some regarding whether the stem cells might carry some defect that had made the embryos nonviable81 regarding the use of nonharmful biopsy the council found that it would be ethically unacceptable to test in humans because risks should not be imposed on living embryos destined to become children for the sake of getting stem cells for research this same response was prompted by an august 2006 report in the journal nature that california company had used the non harmful biopsy method to derive stem cells82 in addition the technique was criticized on one side for effectively creating twin and then killing that twin83 and on the other for being an inefficient method for deriving stem cell lines84 in november 2006 nature issued an addendum to the august article to clarify that while the companys lead scientist maintained that his method could be used to derive stem cells without destroyi ng embryos in fact he had destroyed all of the embryos during his own experiments 85 the council also concluded that bioengineering embryolike artifacts raises many serious ethical concerns including whether the artifact would really be very defective embryo the ethics of egg procurement concerns about the use of genetic engineering itself and the possibility of its use creating slippery slope finally the council found the proposal to dedifferentiate somatic cells to be ethically acceptable if and when it became scientifically practical provided that facto embryos were not created although some council members expressed their support for efforts to identify means of obtaining human embryonic stem cells for biomedical research that do not involve killing or harming human embryos not all of the members agreed some expressed concern that all four methods would use financial resources that would be better devoted to proposals that are likely to be more productive one member wrote that he did not support publishing the white paper with the implied endorsement that special efforts be made in the scientific areas described while some of the suggestions could be explored in scientific setting most are highrisk options that only have an outside chance of success and raise their own complex set of ethical questions 81 see eg rick weiss researchers report growing stem cells from dead embryos washington post september

funding is appropriate those who oppose federal funding argue that the government should not be associated with embryo destruction 86 they point out that embryo destruction violates the deeply held moral beliefs of some citizens and suggest that funding alternative research is morally preferable87 proponents of federal funding argue that it is immoral to discourage lifesaving research by withholding federal funding they point out that consensus support is not required for many federal spending policies as it does not violate democratic principles or infringe on the rights of dissent of those in the minority 88 they argue that the efforts of both federally supported and privately supported researchers are necessary to keep the united states at the forefront of what they believe is very important cutting edge area of science furthermore supporters believe that the oversight that comes with federal dollars will result in better and more ethically controlled research in the field requirements attached to federal funding are one traditional mechanism that congress has used to regulate scientific research that might otherwise be conducted without federal oversight89 groups positions on federal funding tend to mirror their positions on stem cell research generally the bush policy authorizes federal funding for some esr the presidents council does not take position on the issue but notes the pros and cons and stresses that there is difference between prohibiting embryo research and refraining from funding it90 focus on the family generally supports president bush and his policy but is disappointed by his decision to allow federal funding of research on the existing stem cell lines 91 nbac finds the arguments in favor of federal funding more persuasive than those against it92 the national academies group of representatives group of senators mrs nanc reagan and her support ers camr the nobel laureates and the uojca favor federal funding for esr93 several pieces of legislation would use federal funding to add ethical requirements to the conduct of esr while the august 2001 bush policy does contain some ethical requirements regarding the creation of stem cell lines eligible for federal funding those requirements would serve only to 86 national bioethics advisory commission ethical issues in human stem cell research vol 1 september 1999 p 57 87 ibid 88 ibid

future ones this is because researchers who created stem cell lines before the policy took effect could not have been influenced by its ethical constraints regarding the derivation of stem cells from embryos as the policy did not yet exist researchers who created stem cell lines after the policy took effect would not be motivated to follow the bush policys ethical guidelines regarding the creation of stem cell lines because the results of their work would be ineligible for federal funding regardless of their methodology by contrast eo 620 may affect th future derivation of embryonic stem cells to the extent that it encourages that such activities take place without creating embryos for research or harming endangering or destroying them
