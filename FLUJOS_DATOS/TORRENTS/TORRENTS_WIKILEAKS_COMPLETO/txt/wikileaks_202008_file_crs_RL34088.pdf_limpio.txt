summary in addition to their jobs workers have obligations civic familial and personal to fulfill that sometimes require them to be absent from the workplace eg to serve on jury retrieve sick ch ild from day care or ttend funeral the us government generally has allowed individual employ ers to decide whether to accommodate the nonwork activities of employ ees by granting them leave with or without pay rather than firing them in other countries nationa l governments or the international organizations to which they belong more often ve developed social policies that entitle individua ls to time off from the workplace oftentimes paid for variety of reasons eg maternity and vacations public policies specifically intended to reconcile the work and family lives of individuals have garnered increased atte ntion among countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in the united states which is an oecd member congressional inte rest recently has coalesced around family friendly paid leave proposals eg hr 1542s 910 s 80 and hr 5781 s 1681 and hr 5873 they would entitle work ers to time off with pay to accomplish parental and caregiving obligations to help women in particular balance work and family responsibilities because they are the typical family caregiver and majority of women in the us population are in the labor force currently there are few federal statutes that pertain directly or indirectly to employer provision of leave benefits for any purpose this report begins by reviewing those policies including the pregnancy discrimination act and the family and medical leave act temporary disability insurance tdi programs which five states have established to compensate for lost wages while workers are recovering from nonoccupational illne sses and injuries are discusse d as well so too are the california and new jersey family leave insurance programs which essentially extend the tdi programs of the two states to employees caring for family members the report then examines the incidence of different types of paid leave that us employers voluntarily provide as part of an employees total compensation wages and benefits for example vacations and holidays are the most commonly offered leave benefits more than threefourths of employees in the private sector receive paid time off for these reasons access to leave by various employee and employer characteristics also is analyzed with particular attention focused on paid sick leave which is offered to 57 of private sector employees the report closes with results from fede ral government survey of the average direct cost to businesses of different type s of leave indirect employer costs that might arise in connection with some types of leave more than others such as the greater likelihood of hiring and training temporary replacements for employees absent because of maternity versus ber eavement reasons are not included

countries with th exceptions of ireland the united kingdom and several countries with legislation mandating paid leave such as the united states8 the organization remains focused on leave and other policies thought to ameliorate workfamily conflict its continuing interest in encouraging more women to participate in the labor force is par tly motivated by concern about the impact of population aging on the future labor s upply in member nations the economic rationale underlying paid family leave is that it will increase the amount of labor supplied by women with child care and increasingly elder care obligations and thereby mitigate the slowdown in labor force growth overall in the united states the end of years of escalating labor force participation by married mothers especially mothers of infants9 is overlaid on the fear of an impending labor shortfall because of its aging population10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34088crs3 10 continued levine 11 under the flsa workers must be

holidays with pay as prescribed by the office of personnel management under t itle 5 of the us code holidays also may be designated in state and muni cipal laws or regulations private sector employers may choose to follow the public sectors holiday practices and pay thei r employees for the time not worked if businesses voluntarily close on holidays firms can pay an employee they require to wo rk the employees usual hourly wage rate because the flsa does not distinguish holidays from any other workday the flsa does require employees to be paid more than their regular hourly wage rate in another instance namely overtime work it is in connection with overtime that the act has become part of the debate over worktime flexibility to accommodate the family res ponsibilities of employees the flsa was enacted in 1938 during period of extraordinarily hi gh unemployment payment at oneand onehalf times an employees standard hourly rate for working more than 40 hours in week thus was required of companie s as penalty for extending the workweek of current employees rather than hiring unemployed persons about 50 years later congress allowed employers in one industr federal state and local government to offer employees time off in lieu of the overtime pay they had earned14 that is to say government can offer its workers the option of taking leave in the future rather than immediately compensating them for overtime worked those who want to extend comptime to the private sect or began in the 1990s to put the worktime arrangement in family friendly context by arguing that it would afford workers the opportunity to accumulate hours they could ter take off for caregiving or any other reason if the use of the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer15 federal contractor legislation in the davisbacon act of 1931 and rvice contract act of 1965 congress required that certain contractors pay at least prevailing wages and benefits to their workers employed on federal and federally assisted cons truction and service projects the wage and hour division in the us department of bor dol develops wage determinations they list the wage rates and fringe benefit rates dol determines are prevailing in given area for particular jobs pa id sick vacation and holiday leave are among the benefits that can be included in wage determination16

began its national social insurance programs of unemployment insurance and oldage insurance consequently providing prot ection against costs of sickness that are more or less recurring regardless of economic conditions did not seem to have the same urgency as providing protecti on against cyclical unemployment and old age dependency17 in 1946 however the federal unemployme nt tax act was am ended to allow states in which employees contribute to their unemployment insurance programs to use those contributions toward cash payments for persons unable to work as result of temporary nonoccupationa l illnesses or injuries18 california new jersey new york and rhode island passe d temporary disability insurance tdi laws during the 1940s two additional jurisdictions hawaii and puerto rico enacted tdi legislation in the late 1960s today employees and employers contribut to four of the jurisdictions social insurance programs rhode island and california continue to rely on only employee payroll deductions the governments usually do not make contributions19 both employed and unemployed workers may receive tdi benefits how this is accomplished varies among the jurisdic tions depending in part on whether employers are allowed to substitute private insurance plan for stateoperated plan most employees in the private sector are covered because the laws generally apply to businesses with one or more workers jurisdictions may cover their own government employees and the selfemploye d as well the value of payments and their duration also differ by jurisdiction in addition the way in which tdi benefits are coordinated with employerprovided paid sick leave and other accrued leave benefits varies20 the tdi laws do not require employers to retain individuals on their payrolls while receiving benefits21 however employers must comply with other laws that regulate treatment of employees expe riencing shortterm nonwork disabilities antidiscrimination legislation the pregnancy discrimination

has policy permitting temporarily disabled employees to take sick leave then it must allow woman unable to perform her j ob due to pregnancy or childbirth to take leave on the same terms22 thus firm must hold open job for pregnancy related absence the same length of time jobs are held open for employees on sick or disability leave23 title vii and the americans with disabilities act of 1990 do not require employers to provide leave to employees to attend to their own shortterm illnesses they also do not require employers to offer employees time off to care for sick family members but as in the case of company with sick or disability leave benefits firm that has instituted family leave policy is prohibited from administering it in discriminatory manner24 for example men and women must be afforded the same opportunity to take the same amount of time off to care for their child ren under an employers family leave plan taking action against family responsib ilities discrimination may be difficult however because congress has never prohi bited discriminati on based on caregiver status so such claims must be indirect applications of existing prohibitions against sex bias disability

stereotyping of pregnant workers and of employees who are family caregivers disparate treatment of employees caring fo r family members with disabilities and harassment that creates hostile work environment for employees providing family care26 relatedly differences across states in leave benefit laws may make multistate companies susceptible to discrimination complaints for interfering with the rights of employees for example californias family sick leave kin care law requires all employers in the state that offer paid sick leave to allow employees to use some of their time off to care

not have to retain employees receiving baauc unless they were also fmlaeligible the reasons for leave under baauc were much narrower than under the fmla as well alternatively th firmsize requirements of the fmla did not apply to baauc which was guided by the much broader employer coverage of the uc program dol included model state legislation in an appendix to the baauc regulations which went into

states before th eir enactment of baauc the department stated its expectation that states would not initiate baa uc without first examining the impact on the solvency of their uc trust funds in late 2003 the bush administration re scinded baauc as part of review of all dol regulations the review was undertaken in the context of recession having led to much reduced balances in state uc funds and challenge in federal district court to the consistency of baauc with federal uc law37 t h b u s h administration declared baauc to be misapplication of federal uc law relating to the aa requirements which state that person must be able and available for suitable work to be eligible for unemployment benefits38 i t d i s g r d w i t h t h clinton administrations explanation of th baauc rule as part of an evolving interpretation of the aa requirements that recognizes practical and economic realities eg not terminating or denying uc benefits to individuals while they are awaiting recall to the firms that temporarily laid them off39 t h b u s h administration declared that the intended recipients of baauc generally do not meet this test as they have initiated their separation from the workfo rce and it is their personal situation rather than the lack of available work that has removed them from the labor market because the baauc experiment is based on an assumption of increased future labor force attachment the payment of baauc will likely be made for periods where parents have completely suspended their labor force attachment indeed in cases where the parent is on approved leave from job baauc more closely resembles pa idleave program than uc program40 it further stated that congress intended the uc system to be subordinate to the main task of getting people back to work baauc is not consistent with this goal since it encourages parents to refuse available work41 some 24 babyui bills were introduced in 20 states in 2001 the year after the baauc regulation became effective42 but state had passed legislation before the regulation was rem oved in november 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34088crs12 43 bls employer costs for employee compensation september 2007

surveys monthly labor review march 2000 p 4in light of the inaction of states while the baauc regulation was in effect and the handful of states with tdi laws they appear reluctant to require familymedical leave benefits by taking either an approach based on unemployment or disability insurance the belief that higher taxes paid by companies located in states that adopt either approach arguably putting them at competitive disadvantage with firms in nonadopting states might contribute to this reluctance on the part of individual states the uc program is largely finan ced through state and federal payroll taxes of employers and three of the five stat with tdi programs partly finance them through payroll tax on employers the incidence and cost of leave benefits unlike the abundant data on wages and salaries less in formation is available on the benefits paid to workers at pres ent benefits account for 30 of the total compensation wages and benefits of employees in the civilian economy43 leave benefits which represent 7 of to tal compensation receive short shrift compared to the information on some other supplements to wages voluntarily provided by employers for example the governments primary survey of the labor force the current population survey cps does not ask households about time off from work while it does ask about h ealth and retirement benefits these benefits respectively account for almost 8 and over 4 of total compensation as result there is limited data on gender age and other demographic characteristics of workers by employer provision of paid leave the us bureau of labor statistics b ls more often looks to employers for information on benefits because they typically furnish more reliable information than households do on the details of em ployerprovided bene fit plans and the employers costs for providing those benefits44 the national compensation survey ncs collects information from companies on benefit incidence as well as compensation cost levels and trends fi rm size as measured by the number of employees is one of the company characteristics for which the ncs obtains data again employer rather than househol d surveys are better source of size information although the ncs lacks demographic information on employees receiving benefits it does afford data by job characteristics eg occupation industry and earnings some private firms conduct compensation surveys but the results may be proprietary very expensive to access or not representative of typical business practices eg if the survey covers primar ily large corporations for these reasons the analysis below is derived from the ncs and to provide demographic information from the national survey of americas families and the medicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34088crs13 expenditures panel survey the latter two are nationally representative surveys of noninstitutionalized households in the civilian population similar to the cps incidence by employee and employer characteristics in the private sector more than threefourths of employees at firms in the private sector are provided paid vacati ons and holidays making these the most widely available leave benefits see table 1 about seven of every ten workers have access to paid funeral leave and time off for jury duty considerably fewer employees in the private sector 57 have sick leave as part of their compensation package companies continue to pay almost onehalf of employees who are absent from work to fulfill military obligations about two in five workers can take paid leave for personal reasons employers in the private sector offer paid family leave to very small percentage of their workers 8 as shown in table 1 regardless of the type of paid leave it usually is true that relatively more private sector employees in whitecollar occupations ie management profe ssional and related sales and office than bluecollar occupations ie na tural resources construction and maintenance production transpor tation and material moving or service occupations eg food cl eaning personal health and protective service workers have access to leave with pay relatively more fulltime than part time workers receive paid leave relatively more union than nonunion employees have the opportunity to take leave with pay and relatively more higher than lower paid employees are provided leaveas part of their compensation package in terms of company rather than worker characteristics it generally is the case that regardless of the type of paid leave relatively more employees of larger than smaller establishments receive leave with pay relatively more workers in firms located in metropolitan thannonmetropolitan areas have access to paid leave benefits and relatively more employees at firm s in the new england and middle atlantic regions compared to othe r regions are provided paid leave the picture is more mixed for incidence of paid time off by sector of employment substantially larger percentages of busin esses that produce goods than produce services offer employ ees leave for vacations and holidays the opposite is true for sick leave if government is added to

significantly more fa thers 835 than mothers 762 report having any time off with pay married pa rents 815 are significantly more likely than single parents 738 to have access to paid leave receipt of paid leave increases with age of parents and age of youngest child as result it appears that workers with great need for leave pa rents with very young children are the least likely to have access to leave48 access to paid leave benefits increases in step with family income measured as pe rcentage of the fe deral poverty level two other studies similarly estimated direct relationship between family income and receipt of paid time off from work on the basis of data from the national longitudinal study of youth 76 of families in the bottom quartile of the income distribution lacked paid sick leave and 58 lacked paid vacations at some point while employed between 1990 and 1996 in contrast 40 of families in the top quartile of the income distribution lacked paid sick leave and 41 lacked paid vacations49 similarly results from the ka iser foundations 2001 womens health survey show that 64 of employed wome n with family income below 200 of the federal poverty level are not paid when they miss work to care for sick child compared to 37 of working women in higher income families50 welfare receipt at any time significantly reduces parents likelihood of having paid leave according to the analysis of ns af data but leave availability is greater among those longer receiving welfare than among current recipients with almost three in five working parents currently on welfare lacking any type of paid time off the studys author describes the low rate of access to paid leave among parents currently receiving we lfare as troubling because these parents may be trying to move off public assistance without ample work supports including jobprotected leave th ey may be unable to keep their ties to the labor market in the event of family crisis or even just sick child51 the data from the nsaf household rvey accord with that from the ncs employer survey in terms of the relati onship of benefit access to hours worked and firm size employees who work fewer hour s are less likely to be offered time off with pay and the incidence of paid leave is lower at smaller than larger employers the availability of paid leave among working parents generally increases with job tenure for poor working parents how ever access to any kind of paid leave ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34088crs18 52 the total employment on which the percentages were calculated is individuals who responded to both the paid sick leave as well as demographic income and other questions 53 bls employment and earnings january 2007 table 22 54 the meps data also show that the rate of paid sick leave receipt is lower among persons employed parttime 238 than among persons employed fulltime 718as likely for those with less than one year on the job as for those with two or more years of tenure this might be the case if poor parents tend to work parttime in service occupations eg food preparers building cleaners or for small businesses each associated with low provision of paid leave benefits see table 1 detailed look at paid sick leave the medical expenditures panel survey meps cosponsored by the agen cy for healthcare research and quality and the national center for health

are excluded little more than three in five worker s 617 reported that their employers provide paid sick leave52 the meps also asked households about access to paid vacations which are available to almost seven in ten employees 696 although the magnitudes not surprisingly vary gi ven the different em ployee populations and time periods they cover the meps and ncs data agree that relatively more workers have access to paid time off to take vacations than to car for illnesses or injuries as shown in table 2 relatively more employed women 632 than men 603 have sick leave in their compen sation package small but statistically significant difference married persons 692 also are significantly more likely than nevermarried individua ls 473 who could include single parents to have access to the leave benefit although more than 60 of employees ag 25 and older receive paid sick leave this is true for fewer than half as many younger workers the high rate of parttime employment among young workers and the w incidence of sick leave among part timers may partly account for this finding in 2006 45 of 16 to 24yearolds at work in nonfarm industries us ually were employed fewer than 35 hours

similarly hispanics are significantly less likely to receive paid sick leave than the nonhispanic groups shown in table 2 the industry employment pattern among hispanics may contribute to this outcome

were to pass either of two proposed paths to paid family medical leave mandate or tdi progra m funded in part through payroll tax on employers one would expect the compensation costs of employers to increase because employees generally are more valuable ie produc tive to businesses after imposition of benefit however th ey have economica lly sound reason to raise their workforces total compensation as result of either congressional action economists therefore theorize that firms will try to finance the added benefit cost by reducing or slowing the growth of other components of

that employers voluntarily provide is not evenly distributed across employees th is unevenness appears to exacerbate wage inequality with leave benefits more often available to higher than lower paid workers to more rather than less educated workers to whitecollar compared to blue collar or service workers to persons working full rather than parttime and to employees of larger in c ontrast to smaller firms the us government has comparatively limited role in mandating or regulating leave benefits the sole l eave entitlement congre ss passed unpaid time off under the fmla has long hotly bated history state governments have been more active in this policy area than the federal government nonetheless very few states appear interested in enacting individually familymedical leave statute that provides both cash benefits and job secu rity businesses for their part have been loosening the link between employment and be nefit provision in the last several years eg the shift from traditional pensions to 401k retirement plans and ceasing to extend employee health insurance to retirees
