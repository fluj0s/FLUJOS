in asian trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division us clothing imports from vietnam trade policies and performance summary us clothing imports from vietnam grew from virtually nothing in 2000 to 43 billion in 2007 vietnam was the third largest source of clothing imports for the united states in 2006 behind in order china and mexico much of that growth was the result of the gradual liberalization of us trade policy towards vietnam although the united states terminated its trade embargo on vietnam in 1994 trade initially remained low because vietnam did not have normal trade relations ntr status the signing of bilateral trade agreement in july 2000 allowed president clinton to grant vietnam temporary ntr status effective december 2001 leading to sharp increase in us imports from vietnam including clothing the rise in vietnamese clothing imports led to the united states to push vietnam into bilateral textile agreement in 2003 that set quantity quotas on the import of selected clothing items the bilateral textile agreement remained in effect until the united states granted vietnam permanent ntr status on december 20 2006 as part of its accession into the world trade organization wto the liberalization of us trade policy towards vietnam raised concerns about possible dumping by vietnamese clothing exporters some members of congress and us clothing and textile companies argued that surge in vietnamese imports may harm the us clothing and textile industry in part to secure senate passage of permanent ntr status for vietnam the bush administration agreed to establish monitoring program for selected clothing imports from vietnam from its inception there have been questions about the legality and effectiveness of the monitoring program on october 26 2007 the department of commerce doc announced the completion of its first sixmonth review of the monitoring data finding that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the selfinitiation of an antidumping investigation on may 6 2008 the doc announced its second sixmonth review of the monitoring data had come to the same conclusion there are range of actions that congress might take with regard to us trade policy towards vietnam congress could take action alternatively congress could revisit the question of the docs legal authority to establish the monitoring program as well as examine the issue of the compatibility of the monitoring program with existing wto agreements and commitments congress could investigate vietnams compliance with its promise to terminate all wtoprohibited subsidies congress could also enact legislation designed to counteract perceived unfair vietnamese trade practices congress could examine the design and conduct of the monitoring program to ascertain if it provides reasonable basis for determining the need for an antidumping investigation andor examine claims that the monitoring program has adversely affected trade with and

introduction in the relatively short period of time since the united states resumed normal trade relations ntr with vietnam in 2001 there have been several controversies regarding the importation of clothing from vietnam into the united states1 the controversies surrounding us clothing imports from vietnam include allegations of dumping illegal transshipments violations of the world trade organization wto agreements and controversial import monitoring program in addition us trade policy governing the import of vietnamese clothing has changed course several times leading to claims of significant market disruption and regulatory uncertainty these claims are bolstered by the volatility of us import data for vietnamese clothing over the last seven years there have been several shifts in us trade policy with vietnam since it was first granted ntr status in 2001 that have possibly affected us clothing imports from vietnam bilateral trade agreement concluded on july 13 2000 significantly lowered tariff rates on clothing imported from vietnam bilateral textile agreement that ran from may 1 2003 until january 11 2007 imposed quantity quotas on the import of certain categories of clothing imported from vietnam also as part of its accession into the wto vietnam entered into an agreement with the united states that among other provisions requires that vietnam terminate various nonwto compliant subsidy programs for its clothing and textiles industries finally on december 8 2006 congress passed legislation granting vietnam permanent ntr status as of december 29 2006 much of the recent contention about vietnamese clothing exports to the united states has focused on the us department of commerces doc implementation of an import monitoring program for selected categories of vietnamese clothing on the day vietnam joined the wto january 11 2007 the announced import monitoring program began on the same day vietnam joined the wto and is to expire with the end of the bush administration taken to be january 19 2008 by the doc2 under the program the doc will collect monthly data on the quantity and unit values of five categories of clothing imported from vietnam shirts sweaters swimwear trousers and underwear to determine if there is sufficient evidence to warrant the selfinitiation of an antidumping investigation 1 for purposes of this report clothing will include products imported under chapters 61 and 62 of the us harmonized tariff schedule hts as such it excludes textiles headgear and footwear 2 textile and apparel products from vietnam import monitoring program request for comments international trade administration us department of commerce federal register volume 71 number 232 december 4 2006 crs2 while acknowledging that the program would have an impact on broad array of parties3 the doc maintained that the monitoring of some vietnamese clothing imports is not meant to inhibit legitimate trade4 supporters of the program principally us textile manufacturers maintain that the monitoring is necessary because the vietnamese government is illegally subsidizing its clothing industry and that vietnamese exporters are dumping their products in the united states5 according to the programs backers the data being collected by the monitoring program will provide the necessary evidence to initiate an antidumping action against vietnamese clothing exports opponents of the program mixture of clothing manufacturers retailers and importers assert that the collection of the data violates various provisions of the wto agreement runs counter to past anti dumping practices and has already had negative effect on vietnams exports to the united states interest in the monitoring program was heightened by expectations of the docs first formal review of the vietnamese clothing imports being monitored according to the federal register announcement of the program the doc intends to conduct its formal evaluations of the information gathered under the monitoring program on biannual basis6 the doc has also indicated that the categories of products covered by the monitoring program shirts sweaters swimwear trousers and underwear are not static and may be changed in response to input received from interested parties changes in the trade or as the department of commerce broadens its understanding of the composition and structure of the domestic textile and apparel industry trade statistics for the first six months of 2007 provided some support to both supporters and opponents of the monitoring program see table 1 us imports of sweaters made in vietnam from january to june 2007 increased by over 85 when compared to the same period last year meanwhile the volume of shirts and trousers imported from vietnam the two largest imported categories being monitored in the doc program during the first six months of 2007 rose by 281 and 258 respectively when compared to the first half of 2006 however the amount of swimwear imported by the united states from vietnam from january to june 2007 was virtually unchanged from year ago and the amount of underwear imported declined by over 20 when compared to last year

evaluating the growth in clothing imports from vietnam using year onyear data may be potentially misleading for various reasons first under the terms of the usvietnam bilateral textile agreement the united states was permitted to set quotas on the volume of clothing imported from vietnam in the years 2003 to 2006 as result the import figures for the last four years may have been kept artificially low and the ensuing growth in 2007 artificially enhanced second the international trade in clothing is comparatively seasonal so comparisons based on data from only part of year may be biased third because there is an approximately six month lead time in the contracting of clothing the trade volumes for january to june 2007 supposedly reflect arrangements made prior to the announcement of the monitoring program and therefore will not reflect the alleged negative impact the monitoring program has had on vietnams clothing exports to the united states on october 26 2007 the doc issued press release stating that it had concluded its first review of vietnamese clothing imports and determined that there is insufficient evidence to warrant selfinitiating an antidumping investigation7 according to the press release there were imports from vietnam for 317 of the 486 clothing items being monitored and unit prices had increased for many of the items where there had been imports from vietnam comparisons of imports from vietnam to imports from other nations also failed to provide sufficient evidence to warrant selfinitiating an antidumping investigation assistant secretary for import administration david spooner said that despite the lack of evidence of dumping the department will continue to monitor apparel imports from vietnam until the end of the administration and work with all stakeholders to ensure an open and transparent monitoring process8 7 commerce completes first review of vietnam import data press release us department of commerce october 26 2007 8 ibid crs4 on may 6 2008 the doc completed its second sixmonth review of the monitoring data and once again decided that there is insufficient evidence to warrant selfinitiating an antidumping investigation9 according to the doc there were clothing imports from vietnam for 208 of the nearly 500 tendigit harmonized tariff system hts lines covered by the monitoring program10 as was done in the first review the doc compared trends in unit values and import levels to other nations supplying these products to the united states and concluded that the data did not support an antidumping investigation the doc also announced that third sixmonth review was to be done in september 2008 while there was requirement that the doc take any action following the evaluations of the trade data the programs continuation arguably will keep the monitoring program an issue of concern for the us clothing manufacturers the us textile industry major clothing importers and large retail outlets in the united states among the possible administration actions that could have been taken were the self initiation of an antidumping investigation on select clothing imports from vietnam the opening of negotiations for new bilateral textile agreement andor the termination of the monitoring program for the next six months it appears that the administration has decided to take none of these options but it is to continue to monitor clothing imports from vietnam summary of usvietnamese clothing trade the recent conduct of clothing trade between the united states and vietnam has been relatively short in duration but varied in practice after president clinton terminated us trade embargo against vietnam on february 3 1994 trade between the united states and vietnam grew rather slowly in part because of the non preferential treatment vietnam received under us trade laws vietnam was not member of the world trade organization wto so it was not eligible for normal trade relations ntr status via that mechanism11 also under us law vietnam could only be granted permanent ntr status by the passage of legislation or granted temporary ntr status by the conclusion of bilateral trade agreement and compliance with the freedom of emigration requirements of the jacksonvanik amendment12 lacking ntr status vietnams exports to the united states were subject to higher tariff rates than products from almost all other nations for clothing imports products from vietnam faced tariff rates two to nine times higher than goods 9 commerce completes second review of vietnam import data press release us department of commerce may 6 2008 10 ibid 11 under the terms of wto membership any wto member must grant ntr status to all other wto members 12 for more information on ntr status for nonmarket economies see crs report rs22398 the jacksonvanik amendment and candidate countries for wto accession issues for congress by william h cooper crs5 imported from countries with ntr status13 as result while us imports from vietnam steadily increased from virtually nothing in 1993 to just over 1 billion in 2001 us clothing imports from vietnam rose from zero to 48 million over the same period see figure 1 the usvietnam bilateral trade agreement after nearly five years of negotiations the united states and vietnam concluded bilateral trade agreement on july 13 2000 the first of two steps for vietnam to receive temporary ntr status14 president clinton exercised the authority granted to him under the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 to waive the jacksonvanik amendment enabling legislation in the us congress and vietnams national assembly were subsequently passed formally extending temporary normal trade relations ntr status to vietnam as of december 10 2001 figure 1 us imports from vietnam

on the negotiations and terms of the vietnamus bilateral trade agreement see crs report rl30416 the vietnamus bilateral trade agreement by mark manyin crs6 having secured temporary ntr status vietnams exports to the united states accelerated rising from just over 1 billion in 2001 to 46 billion in 2003 see figure 1 one of the main beneficiaries of vietnams temporary ntr status was its clothing industry which saw its exports to the united states jump from 48 million in 2001 to 876 million in 2002 and 23 billion in 2003 by 2003 clothing was 513 of vietnams total exports to the united states although the temporary ntr status stimulated imports from vietnam its impact was mitigated by its impermanent nature under us law the president had to reconfirm the waiver of the jacksonvanik amendment every year and congress had the authority to override the presidents reconfirmation via joint resolution passed by both the house and the senate from 1998 to 2002 such joint resolution failed in the house resolutions were introduced between 2003 and 2005 for the international clothing market the theoretical risk of vietnam losing temporary ntr status created two potential barriers to trade first major retailers and importers supposedly shied away from purchasing clothing manufactured in vietnam as the date for the waiver renewal neared or when joint resolution for disapproval was introduced in congress second given the longterm uncertainty of vietnams ntr status both domestic and foreign investors in vietnams clothing and textiles industry allegedly curtailed or postponed potential investment projects restricting the nations clothing and textile production capacity during the congressional debate over the bilateral trade agreement with vietnam many members of congress urged president bush to negotiate separate bilateral textile agreement with vietnam because vietnam was not wto member at the time its clothing exports were not covered by the agreement on textiles and clothing atc and therefore there were quotas on vietnams clothing exports to the united states15 several members of congress and in particular members with significant clothing and textile manufacturing in their districts or states voiced concern that surge in vietnamese clothing exports to the united states could cause damage to us clothing and textile companies and workers in their opinion it was important that the united states conclude bilateral textile agreement with vietnam that ensured fair competition andor restricted the growth of vietnamese clothing exports to the united states the vietnamus textile agreement 20032006 negotiations of separate bilateral textile agreement began soon after the bilateral trade agreement went into effect on april 25 2003 the two nations agreed to the terms of bilateral textile agreement that placed quantity quotas on 38 categories of clothing imports from vietnam starting on may 1 2003 until december 31 2004 the quotas would automatically roll over in subsequent years with the inclusion of annual quantity increases of 2 for wool products and 7 for all other products unless the two nations terminated or renegotiated the agreement by december 1 in addition both nations pledged to investigate and 15 for more information on the wtos atc see crs report rl34106 us clothing and textile trade with china and the world trends since the end of quotas by michael f martin crs7 punish circumvention of us import quotas provision added to the agreement in part due to us custom service allegation that some chinese clothing products had illegally entered the united states by being mislabeled as products of vietnam the agreement also lowered vietnams tariffs on us clothing and textiles exports to 7 for yarn 12 for fabric and 20 for clothing following the implementation of the bilateral textile agreement vietnams total exports to the united states continued their rapid climb but the growth in clothing exports slowed dramatically see figure 1 total us imports from vietnam rose from 46 billion in 2003 to 53 billion in 2004 66 billion in 2005 and 86 billion in 2006 meanwhile us clothing imports from vietnam crept up from 23 billion in 2003 to 25 billion in 2004 27 billion in 2005 and 32 billion in 2006 the share of clothing in vietnams total exports to the united states declined from 513 in 2003 to 369 in 2006 the imposition of import quotas on vietnamese clothing also altered the composition of vietnams clothing exports to the united states in 2003 781 of vietnams clothing exports to the united states were in categories subject to quotas however over the next three years the value of vietnams clothing exports subject to quotas increased by 178 while clothing exports not subject to exports grew by 1045 as result vietnamese clothing exports subject to quotas contributed 672 of the total bilateral clothing exports to the united states table 2 quota utilization rate for clothing imported from vietnam

hosiery 332 75 07 208 289 145 source office of textiles and apparel otexa international trade administration us department of commerce quota covered only selected items in category only part of the sharp decrease in the growth of vietnams clothing exports to the united states can be attributed to the actual cap on imports created by the quantity quotas table 2 reveals that the quantity quotas were potentially binding on crs9 about dozen of the 38 categories subject to import restrictions for another dozen categories vietnam used between half and threequarters of the available quota for six categories an average of less than half of the quota was used over the four years the import restrictions were in place on three occasions and only in 2003 did us imports fully use the available quota for category of vietnamese clothing imports the less than full utilization of import quotas does not necessarily mean that the import constraints had impact on trade according to industry sources16 major retailers and importers may shift where they source products in response to the implementation of quotas according to these market experts importers do not want to risk exceeding the import cap and be unable to import the products they desire and therefore turn to an alternative location to obtain the products as result the creation of an import quota on vietnamese clothing may have diverted trade to other nations even in cases where there was still available import capacity vietnams wto accession and permanent ntr status congressional interest in us clothing imports from vietnam reemerged during the negotiations over the terms of vietnams wto accession17 us textiles and clothing manufacturers sought to extend the import quotas on vietnamese clothing products as part of vietnams accession agreement or to include in the agreement safeguard measures similar to those included in chinas wto accession agreement18 however neither provision was included in vietnams wto accession agreement what was included in the agreement were requirements that vietnam terminate various nonwto compliant subsidy programs supporting its domestic clothing and textile industry and allegedly benefitting its exports of clothing the agreement includes an enforcement mechanism during the first 12 months after vietnams accession that would permit the united states or any other wto member to impose import quotas if after consultation and thirdparty arbitration it was determined that vietnam had not terminated its nonwto compliant subsidies although congress had direct role in vietnams accession to the wto congressional approval was necessary to extend to vietnam permanent ntr status as member of the wto the united states was required to extend permanent ntr status to vietnam once it became member opposition to extending permanent ntr status to vietnam focused on number of different issues including alleged human rights abuses claims of discrimination against foreignowned companies operating in vietnam and charges of inadequate 16 information from telephone interviews with industry sources who wish to remain anonymous 17 for general discussion of vietnams wto accession see crs report rl33490 vietnam pntr status and the wto accession issues and implications for the united states by mark manyin william h cooper and bernard gelb 18 for description of the chinese safeguard measures see crs report rl34106 us clothing and textile trade with china and the world trends since the end of quotas by michael f martin crs10 intellectual property rights protection in addition senator elizabeth dole and senator lindsey graham objected to the lack of safeguard measures in the wto accession agreement to protect the us clothing and textile industry from potential surge in imports from vietnam they reportedly decided to place hold on the bill before the senate to grant vietnam permanent ntr status19 in joint letter to us trade representative ustr susan schwab senators dole and graham explained their concerns regarding vietnams wto accession terms and the recently concluded usvietnam bilateral agreement20 the two senators wrote we believe that unless the government takes specific steps to ensure that the us textile industry can be defended against communist country that heavily subsidizes its textile and apparel sector this agreement is likely to cause largescale job losses in both of our states in the letter senators dole and graham specifically express concern about vietnams ability to artificially lower prices through its state sponsored system and state that it would be unreasonable to ask us workers to compete with products manufactured under staterun economy without at least providing an adequate mechanism for the industry to defend itself on september 28 2006 ustr schwab and us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez sent letter to senator dole and senator graham pledging to initiate monitoring program for vietnamese selected clothing imports immediately upon vietnams wto accession in addition ustr schwab and secretary gutierrez stated in the letter if this monitoring process indicates that dumping exists and the domestic industry fully cooperates in supplying data available to the domestic industry indicating the existence of material injury caused by such imports the department of commerce will selfinitiate antidumping investigations with respect to the relevant products21 based on this commitment media sources report senator dole and senator graham removed their hold on the permanent ntr for vietnam legislation although the pledged monitoring program removed one barrier to vietnams permanent ntr status other issues delayed final passage of pending legislation on december 8 2006 the house of representatives passed hr 6406 larger bill containing provisions granting vietnam permanent ntr status by vote of 212184 hr 6406 was then coupled with hr 6111 tax extension bill and sent to the senate where it passed by vote of 799 on december 20 2006 president bush signed the bill into law pl 109432 and as provided under the law the united states formally extended permanent ntr status to vietnam on december 29 2006 less than two weeks before vietnam officially became the 150th member of the wto 19 vietnam measure facing difficult path congress daily august 4 2006 20 letter

and vietnams membership in the wto us trade relations with vietnam entered into new phase of formally agreed free trade as part of its agreement with vietnam the united states discontinued the quantity restrictions on clothing imports from vietnam that had been in effect since may 2003 also clothing imports from vietnam were now permanently eligible for the lower ntr tariff rates ending the annual temporary ntr renewal process for its part vietnam had pledged to cease any nonwto compliant subsidies to its clothing and textile industries or face the possible reimposition of import quotas by the united states or any other wto member the only nonmarket action by the united states available to influence the import of clothing from vietnam was the promised monitoring program mentioned in the letter by ustr schwab and secretary gutierrez on december 4 2006 the import administration of the us department of commerces international trade administration ita published request for public comment in the federal register which laid out the basic outline of the proposed monitoring program according to the federal register announcement the monitoring program would begin upon vietnams accession to the wto and will expire at the end of the current administration taken by doc to be january 19 2009 the initial of list of products to be monitored trousers shirts underwear swimwear and sweaters had been identified as being of special sensitivity22 the monitoring program would collect data on the quantity value and unit price of goods imported from vietnam in the selected categories comments on the monitoring program including comments on the product coverage the creation of production templates and information on the us textile and apparel industry were to be submitted to the import administration by december 27 2006 the announcement also indicated that there would be public hearing on the program which was subsequently scheduled for april 24 2007 in washington dc however in second request for public comment published in the federal register on january 23 2007 the import administration stated that the department of commerce recognizes that these five product categories are too broad for effective monitoring23 so it indicated it would focus on those traditional three digit textile and apparel categories of greatest significance based on trade trends composition of the us industry and input from parties as appropriate24 the announcement also stated that the product coverage is not intended by the department of commerce necessarily to be static and that changes in product coverage may occur in response to changes in trade input from interested parties or as the department of commerce broadens its understanding of the composition and structure of the domestic textile and apparel industry25 the department also 22 federal register december 4 2006 page 70365 23 federal register january 23 2007 page 2861 24 ibid 25 ibid crs12 indicated that the monitoring program is not meant to inhibit legitimate trade26 the deadline for comments for this second request was january 31 2007 both announcements also stated that there would be biannual evaluations of the data collected by the monitoring program to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to initiate an antidumping investigation consistent with us law and our international obligations under the wto27 set dates were given for the biannual evaluations congressional comments on the proposed monitoring program from its inception the monitoring program has been the subject of some controversy within congress while senator dole and senator graham supported the program other members of congress questioned its legality and economic merits in may 2 2007 letter to secretary gutierrez six members of the house ways and means committee representatives earl blumenauer jim ramstad mike thompson jim mcdermott joseph crowley and ron kind stated they were deeply concerned that the disruption in trade caused by the import monitoring program is cutting away at many of the benefits of granting pntr to vietnam and that these negative impacts come at benefit to us apparel producers28 in addition the representatives wrote the department of commerce must demonstrate the specific statutory authority for this unprecedented type of program29 they also expressed concern that the program may violate number of agreements under the world trade organization having questioned the legitimacy and economic benefits of the monitoring program the representatives suggested that the scope of the monitoring program should be limited to those apparel products defined at the tendigit hts level produced in commercially viable fashion in the united states for which producers of those products have asked for monitoring and for which there is evidence of material injury to those producers being caused by imports from vietnam30 senators dianne feinstein and gordon smith also expressed their concerns about the monitoring programs in separate letters to secretary gutierrez31 in her letter of december 26 2006 senator feinstein wrote i request that the department of commerce submit any proposed program to public comment through notice of proposed rulemaking and demonstrate in such notice how the proposed program is consistent with applicable statutory requirements and international obligations of the united states in his letter of january 31 2007 senator smith 26 ibid 27 federal register december 6 2006 page 70365 28 letter to secretary gutierrez from members of the house ways

copies of the senators letters are available online under the requests for public comment at httpiaitadocgovdownloadvietnamtextilemonitoringvtmindexhtml crs13 echoed senator feinsteins comments writing it is important for the department of commerce to outline in detail the statutory authority it believes it has to implement the announced monitoring program and to selfinitiate antidumping measures under these circumstances senator smith also suggested that the proposed program should undergo the usual notice of proposed rulemaking process32 criticism from us and korean business communities opposition to the monitoring program also came from various segments of the us business community coalition of eight trade associations and 29 separate us companies sent letter to secretary gutierrez and ustr schwab on october 11 2006 expressing their extreme disappointment at the agreement the administration negotiated with senators elizabeth dole and lindsey graham33 according to the letter implementing this illconsidered and damaging agreement places at risk the ability for us and all other us companies to continue current business and generate new business in vietnam the letter also voices their displeasure at the lack of consultation with interested us companies leading members of congress and the vietnamese government during the time the bush administration was discussing the matter with senators dole and graham overall most of the responses to the import administrations requests for public comments were generally critical of the monitoring program34 in addition to the concerns raised by members of congress about the statutory authority for the monitoring program its consistency with existing international obligations and the lack of period of public commentary for proposed rulemaking35 another major criticism of the program was the apparent lack of us clothing manufacturing industry that might be materially injured by the vietnamese imports in its written comments to the import administration the us association of importers of textiles and apparel usaita urged the department of commerce drop the monitoring program because us apparel manufacturers supported it in his testimony at the public hearing about the monitoring program chairman of the international textile group wilbur l ross jr questioned whom the monitoring program was meant to protect to the best of my knowledge there are american apparel producers whose output is truly characterized as competitive to vietnams 32 for an explanation of the

relatively detailed critique of the proposed monitoring program on all three of these issues copy of their submitted comments is available at httpiaitadocgovdownloadvietnamtextilemonitoringcmts20061227vietnamtextil emonitoringindexhtml crs14 exports to this country36 the lack of competitive us clothing manufacturers was reiterated by stephanie lester vice president for international trade at the retail industry leaders association rila according to ms lester most of the products that rila members purchase from vietnam could not be supplied by domestic us production37 the monitoring program was also challenged on its potential negative effects on us companies considering sourcing clothing from vietnam in his oral testimony at the public hearing on april 24 2007 gary ross of the usaita said the monitoring program has very real consequences by targeting broad categories of products made in vietnam it forces usaita member companies to reconsider vietnam as sourcing option at the very least importers and retailers are looking at the calendar and mapping out worstcase scenarios deciding what the earliest possible point in time is when vietnamese products brought into the us market could be subject to an additional bonding requirement or dumping duty38 in its written comments on the proposed program the national retail federation nrf stated in response to the greater unpredictability and risk to their sourcing operations created as result of the commitment to implement the monitoring program number of nrf members have decided to limit their exposure to vietnam either by substantially cutting their orders in the second half of 2007 or to terminate them entirely39 the nrf goes on to state that its members have indicated that the cancelled orders will move to other asian countries not the united states or other western hemisphere countries several of the commentators pointed to the biannual review mechanism as heightening the market uncertainty created by the program in the words of the american apparel and footwear association aafa decision every six months about potential antidumping cases can be very unsettling and will doubt have chilling effect on trade40 36 testimony of wilbur l ross jr chairman international textile group at the textile and apparel products from vietnam import monitoring program public hearing april 24 2007 37 testimony of stephanie lester vice president for international trade retail industry leaders association at the textile and apparel products from vietnam import monitoring program public hearing april 24 2007 38 ross op cit 39 written comments by the national retail federation submitted to the import administration on december 27 2006 40 written comments by the american apparel and footwear association submitted to the import administration on december 27 2006 crs15 third common comment from us businesses critical of the proposed monitoring program was the potential burden it would place on us companies importing clothing from vietnam in its written comments the aafa stated we are concerned that the program could result in significant new paperwork or import entry requirements which would create an unfair burden on us apparel importers41 fourth general category of criticism focused on the seemingly vague and fluid methodology being used in the monitoring program several commentators indicated that it was unclear how the data being collected could be used to evaluate the alleged presence of dumping42 some argued that the threedigit categories of imports being monitored were too broad for use in antidumping investigations43 others pointed out that us manufacturing data was apparently not available using the same categories as the import data being monitoring making impact assessment difficult44 virtually all of these commentators maintained that the import administration needed to clarify their methodology prior to implementing the program and to make the methodology more transparent in addition to critical comments from us businesses the import administration also received joint submissions from two korean trade associations the korea international trade association kita and the korean apparel industry association kaia45 the criticism contained in the two submissions made by kita and kaia were consistent with the categories described above with one additional concern kita and kaia maintain that the monitoring program would deny benefits to other wto members by undermining the value of investments made by other wto members in vietnams clothing industry support from the us business community although most of the comments received by the import administration were critical of the proposed monitoring program there were some that supported its implementation the supportive comments generally focused on four issues 1 the potential threat of surge in vietnamese clothing imports causing harm to us clothing and textile manufacturers 2 the dominance of stateowned manufacturers in vietnams clothing industry 3 the alleged subsidies received by the vietnamese clothing industry from its government and 4 the ability to easily shift production from one 41 ibid 42 for example in its comments submitted on behalf of hanesbrands inc on january 31 2007 sandler travis and rosenberg pa wrote product categories used for collecting data the traditional threedigit textile category and the 10digit harmonized tariff system hts code are too broad to permit accurate analysis 43 for example the retail industry leaders association rila wrote in their comments of december 27 2007 while the threedigit category system may be familiar lexicon to the industry these categories are overly broad and could not be used for purposes of either an antidumping investigation or commerces proposed monitoring program 44 comments submitted by sandler travis and rosenberg pa on behalf of hanesbrands inc on january 31 2007 45 the law firm of vinson and elkins submitted comments on behalf of kita and kaia on december 27 2006 and january 31 2007 crs16 clothing category to another which makes it vital to monitor broad range of clothing products for most of the supporters of the monitoring program the perceived risk inherent in these four issues was sufficiently grave that it was vital for the monitoring program to begin as soon as possible in the words of the national council of textile organizations ncto the concerns of the us textile industry about surges of imports from vietnam are based on recent experience not mere speculations46 according to the ncto imports from vietnam rose by 220 between 2002 and 2006 the american manufacturing trade action coalition amtac47 writes in its january 31 2007 comments since vietnam was given normal trade relations access to the us textile and apparel market on december 10 2001 its exports have increased by 6849 and now total 34 billion48 the implication is that vietnams past rapid increase in clothing exports to the united states indicates an ability to rapidly increase exports in the future the supporters of the monitoring program maintain that this rapid growth in exports to the united states is in part due to the dominance of stateowned factories in the vietnamese clothing industry amtac states in its january 31 2007 comments aside from china vietnam is the only other country with large state owned textile and apparel sector vinatex fully owned by the vietnamese government is the 10th largest garment producer in the world49 the alleged dominance of stateowned factories in vietnams clothing industry becomes important when examining the third issue raised by supporters of the monitoring program the supporters claim that stateowned factories receive significant indirect and direct subsidies from the vietnamese government thereby allowing them to export clothing at prices below fair market value in the words of the ncto vietnam is one of two countries the other being china which has large stateowned statesubsidized textile and apparel sector governments in both countries have poured billions of dollars in subsidies into their respective sectors with the apparent goal being dominance of global apparel supply chains50 according to amtac the subsidies which were revealed by vietnam during its wto negotiations take the form of preferential interest rates wage controls rent holidays export subsidies preferential tax rates and direct investments by the vietnamese government51 the fourth issue raised by supporters of the monitoring program has to do with the production conditions of vietnams clothing industry according to some of the 46 comments submitted by the ncto on january 31 2007 47 according to amtacs webpage httpwwwamtacdcorg its mission is to preserve and create american manufacturing jobs through the establishment of trade policy and other measures necessary for the us manufacturing sector to stabilize and grow 48 comments submitted by amtac on january 31 2007 49 ibid 50 comments submitted by the ncto on december 27 2006 51 amtac op cit crs17 commentators vietnams clothing manufacturing is relatively laborintensive production using semiskilled workers as result these commentators maintain it is relatively easy for factories to shift production from one clothing product to another and so it is vital that the monitoring program covers wide range of apparel in the words of the ncto apparel manufacturing is in important ways simple process sewing machine operator can produce dozens of different types of garments from single machine to significant extent the operator does not become skilled in producing specific type of garment thus typical sewing plant can and does have the ability to assemble womans dress mans cotton pant childs sweatshirt and so on and so forth the reality of the production process therefore calls for monitoring on broader rather than on more specialized basis52 comments from the vietnamese government and companies the response of the vietnamese government and vietnamese clothing manufacturers to the proposed monitoring program was muted in tone but critical in content in its submitted comments and testimony vietnams ministry of trade focused on the programs possible violation of us wto obligations and the negative effect on legitimate trade the vietnam textile and apparel association vitas reiterated many of the criticisms raised by us businesses but also challenged characterizations of vietnams clothing industry as being stateowned and heavily subsidized in its december 22 2006 letter to the us department of commerce vietnams ministry of trade focused on the programs possible violation of existing us wto obligations after expressing disappointment about the commerce departments implied intent to initiate antidumping investigations against vietnamese clothing exports the letter asserted this program is violation of article 23 of the gatt 1994 as it causes nullification and serious prejudice to the interests of vietnam as wto member53 the letter continued by stating furthermore this program is also inconsistent with the bilateral agreement between vietnam and the united states on vietnams accession to the wto signed on 31 may 200654 the trade ministrys second letter to the commerce department shifts its focus to the negative impact it argues the monitoring program has had and will have on legitimate trade between vietnam and the united states although the additional information in the secondround proposal mentions the fact that this program does not aim at restraining legal trade in fact it has created negative impacts causing worries and unstable mentality for us importers placing orders in vietnam right from the very first month of 2007 and making it impossible for vietnam textile and apparel manufacturers to proactively plan 52 ncto op cit 53 letter for the ministry of trade the socialist republic of vietnam to the department of commerce of the united states december 22 2006 available online from the web page of

during its testimony at the april 24 2007 hearings on the monitoring program the spokesperson for the trade ministry said vietnams ministry of trade must continue to reaffirm our clear and consistent view to strongly protest the monitoring program on textile and apparel import from vietnam56 the representative continued it is clear that this program is discriminatory contrary to the most important principle and the pillar of the wto gatt article 1 the trade ministrys testimony also claimed that monitoring program violates article 23 of the gatt by nullifying the benefits of wto membership and article 181 which governs antidumping actions between wto members the testimony also reasserted that the monitoring program was reducing legitimate trade between the two nations and thereby having severe effect on jobs and employment in vietnam the response of vitas to the proposed monitoring program was more detailed diverse and disapproving than that of the trade ministry one important aspect of its comments was challenge to the assertions that vietnams textile and garment industry was largely stateowned and heavily subsidized by the government in its december 20 2006 letter vitas stated the vietnam textile and garment industry consists of over 2000 enterprises of these only 50 are stateowned while 1400 are private and 450 are foreign direct investment fdi enterprises57 the letter also contested claims that stateowned enterprises dominate vietnams clothing exports to the united states stating in 2005 only 25 stateowned textile and garment enterprises exported their products to the united states making up only 81 of total export turnover of textiles and garments to the united states according to vitas all of vietnams stateowned clothing and textile enterprises will be privatized equitized by sometime in 2008 on the issue of subsidization vitas wrote that it takes strong exception to the unsupported and unsupportable allegation in the comments submitted by amtac and the ncto contending that vietnam heavily subsidizes their industry58 calling amtacs reference to vietnams wto disclosure misleading vitas maintained in its letters that the vietnamese government has fulfilled its wto accession obligations to terminate prohibited subsidies to its textile and apparel industries in addition vitas pointed out that within its wto accession agreement there already exists formal mechanism to resolve claims that vietnam provides prohibited subsidies to its clothing and textile industry if the united states has evidence that vietnam is providing its clothing and textile industry with 55 letter for the ministry of trade the socialist republic of vietnam to the department of commerce of the united states january 29 2007 copy of the letter available online at

by the monitoring crs20 program59 these reviews would examine the trade data at the 10digit hts level to see if there is sufficient evidence to selfinitiate an antidumping investigation the completion of the first sixmonth review was announced on october 26 2007 the completion of the second sixmonth review was announced on may 6 2008 both reviews determined that there was insufficient evidence to selfinitiate an antidumping investigation of clothing imports from vietnam despite these findings the doc also announced that it would continue to review the import monitoring program the third and possibly final sixmonth review is scheduled to begin in september 2008 below is brief summary of findings of each of the sixmonth reviews and the response of interested parties in the united states and vietnam to the docs announcements results of the first sixmonth review on october 26 2007 the doc announced that review of the first six months of data for selected categories of clothing imported from vietnam found insufficient evidence to warrant selfinitiating an antidumping investigation60 according to assistant secretary spooner after fair and objective analysis of the data commerce found insufficient evidence of dumping from vietnam61 however assistant secretary spooner went on to say the department will continue to monitor apparel imports from vietnam until the end of the administration and work with all stakeholders to ensure an open and transparent monitoring process in response to requests from crs the doc has declined to release the details of their review but it did provide some indications of its findings according to the doc press release of the 486 10digit hts lines monitored during the first six months of the program 317 lines had imports from vietnam of the 169 lines where there were imports from vietnam many had rising unit values falling unit values are often associated with evidence of dumping the press release also reported that doc compared the unit values and import levels for vietnam to other clothing suppliers for the united states including number of asian suppliers bangladesh cambodia india indonesia macau malaysia pakistan the philippines and thailand and the drcafta nations costa rica dominican republic salvador guatemala honduras and nicaragua noticeably missing from the list of suppliers used for comparison were canada china hong kong and mexico historical major suppliers of us clothing imports however the press release did not definitively state that the comparison was limited only to the countries mentioned the

with official statement from representative of the vietnamese government63 vitas chairman quoc an was reportedly not surprised by the reviews finding but he indicated that vitas would continue to press the doc to either terminate the monitoring program or narrow the number of items being monitored64 in the united states only one of the various trade associations that testified at the december 2006 and april 2007 hearings issued statement in the week following the doc press release of october 26 2007 the national retail federation nrf expressed satisfaction with the docs decision stating that it confirms american retailers longstanding contention that there is basis to launch antidumping investigations against vietnamesemade apparel65 nrf vice president erik autor also stated that the decision vindicates the retail industrys argument that there was rationale for setting up the textile monitoring program in the first place and certainly reason for continuing it66 none of the us senators or representatives that commented on the proposed monitoring program issued statements after the announcement of the results of the docs first biannual review results of the second sixmonth review on may 6 2008 the doc announced the results of its second sixmonth review of the vietnamese import monitoring program which covered the period august 2007 to january 200867 for the second time

sharp differences of opinion regarding the current structure of vietnams clothing industry as was discussed above some of the supporters of the monitoring program maintain that vietnams clothing industry is dominated by state owned and operated enterprises that are heavily subsidized by the vietnamese government gaining unfair advantage in the global market many opponents to the monitoring

itself of some of the stateowned clothing companies in process vietnam calls equitization finally the vietnamese government has also allowed direct foreign investment in clothing companies either whollyowned or joint venture as result there are several different ownership arrangements in vietnams clothing industry according to national survey of its industries vietnam had total 68429 clothing manufacturing establishments as of june 30 1998 see table 3 the vast majority of those establishments 995 were household establishments families that were independently employed making clothes of the remaining 356 nonhousehold clothing establishments about one in four were stateowned enterprises and about half were limited companies since 1998 vietnam has implemented series of policy changes regarding the ownership of manufacturing establishments in october 2005 vietnams national assembly passed new enterprise law77 that clarifies the distinction between different types of ownership as well as specifies which types of enterprises are open to foreign equity participation in addition the vietnamese government has also begun the process of divesting itself of fullownership of clothing manufacturers the purported goal is to transform the stateowned enterprises into joint shareholding or stock companies in which the state holds controlling interest the divesting process or

not automatically mean the new joint shareholding companies will be profitmotivated responsive to market pressures and free from political influence although most of vietnams clothing establishments are household operations the value of the nations clothing production is more evenly divided between the stateowned enterprises the domestic private sector and foreigninvested companies see table 4 plus as the process of equitization continues and more overseas investors become partial owners of clothing manufacturing facilities in vietnam there has been notable shift in the structure of production away from locallyowned state enterprises and household producers towards foreigninvested companies the decline of locallyowned state enterprises is most likely due to their transformation into joint shareholding companies the decline of household producers is probably attributable to increased competition from the joint shareholding companies andor foreigninvested enterprises role of

potential markets fourth it will conduct research and improve technological applications in vietnams clothing and textile industries fifth vinatex will provide technical training for the workers and management in vietnams clothing and textile industry the equitization and restructuring of vinatex complicates the emerging structure of vietnams clothing industry from an ownership perspective growing portion of clothing production in vietnam is taking place outside of stateowned enterprises and in theory there will be stateowned clothing factories in vietnam by 2010 however the transformation of vinatex into holding company holding shares in many of vietnams largest clothing companies as well as major commercial bank raises questions about the real extent to which the vietnamese government is willing to release the clothing industry from state control level of subsidization there are number of direct and indirect ways by which vietnam or any nation could subsidize its clothing industry among the direct ways are 1 financing investments for the clothing industry 2 offering incentive payments such as tax rebates for the achievement of export or production targets and 3 guaranteeing government procurement contracts to domestic clothing manufacturers among the indirect ways are 1 offering below market loans or credit to vietnamese clothing companies 2 lowering or eliminating tariffs on imported materials or equipment used by the clothing industry 3 providing materials andor labor at below market prices and 4 erecting administrative barriers to foreign competition to vietnams clothing industry in its domestic consumer market 81 ibid 82 ministry of industry allowed to decide setting steering committee for vinatexs equitisation press release of august 24 2007 as reported and translated on vinatexs webpage httpwwwvinatexcom 83 kazmin op cit 84 information for the following paragraph extracted from vinatexs webpage httpwwwvinatexcom crs27 vietnams past practice of providing its clothing industry with variety of direct and indirect subsidies has been and continues to be of concern as previously indicated some us textile manufacturers point to vietnams subsidization of its clothing industry as evidence of unfair competitive practices and the need for safeguard measures also during the negotiation of vietnams accession to the wto the united states insisted on commitment from vietnam to cease its wto prohibited subsidies for the clothing industry85 vietnam made such commitment and asserts that it has fully complied with those commitments decision 55 people and organizations who think that the vietnamese government may still be subsidizing its clothing and textile industry often point to the events surrounding decision 55 on april 23 2001 the vietnamese government released decision 552001qdttg or decision 55 which provided for the investment between 2001 and 2005 of 35 trillion dong or approximately 22 billion in various projects designed to assist vietnams textile and clothing industry these projects included financial support for the cultivation of cotton the development of infrastructure for vietnams textile industry and credit preferences for specific projects related to vietnams clothing and textile industries decision 55 also called for the investment of 30 trillion dong approximately 19 billion between 2006 and 2010 as part of its wto accession agreement vietnam pledged to end all wto prohibited subsidies to its clothing and textile industry and on may 30 2006 decision 55 was revoked by decision 1262006qdttg according to vietnamese officials the united states might have misunderstood the spirit of decision 55 and misconstrued it to provide for direct government financing of the projects86 instead much of the funding for the projects mentioned in decision 55 were to be financed by the private sector and foreign investors87 according to vinatex chairman quoc an government assistance to vietnams clothing industry between 2002 and 2005 was limited to small loans from vietnams development assistance fund daf totaling 19 trillion dong or approximately 118 million88 following the 85 under the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures defines two categories of subsidies prohibited subsidies and actionable subsidies as the name implies the former are prohibited under the terms of the agreement because the subsidies are specifically designed to distort international trade the prohibited subsidies consist of policies such as export targets or requirements to use domestic goods actionable subsidies consist of government policies that another wto member argues are having an adverse effect on its interests in the case of actionable subsidies it is the responsibility of the complaining wto member to demonstrate the adverse effect and it is the responsibility of the subsidizing wto member to either terminate the subsidy or eliminate the adverse effect if the adverse effect has been proven to exist 86 pm repeals textile subsidy to ease us talks by dong hieu vietnamnet june 14 2006 87 ibid 88 ibid crs28 revocation of decision 55 the vietnamese government has directed vinatex to take the lead in raising funds to support the expansion of vietnams clothing industry89 in response vinatex announced that vietnamese textile and garment companies are prepared to forgo subsidies and stand on their own feet90 according to quoc an while the industry would face serious difficulties without the subsidies it would mobilize money from local and foreign investors for investments in new facilities and technology91 to that end vinatex announced on july 19 2007 that it was talking with group of investors including the vietnam international bank vietnam steel corporation and hanoi beeralcohol and beverage corporation about opening commercial jointstock bank to provide financial services to vietnams clothing and textile industries92 the proposed banks initial capital is to total 1 trillion dong or approximately 63 million in august 2007 vinatex applied for license from the state bank of vietnam to establish the industrial development bank idb93 vinatex is currently awaiting approval to open the proposed bank below market wages one indirect means of subsidization of vietnams clothing industry frequently mentioned is the payment of below market wages to clothing workers the claim is that by keeping clothing workers wages down vietnams clothing companies can either earn higher profits or lower their prices below market prices higher profits would allow the clothing companies to expand their operations and secure larger share of the global clothing market and below market clothing prices would help vietnamese companies outcompete other clothing manufacturers there is some circumstantial evidence to support the claim that vietnams clothing companies are paying their workers below market wages several studies of vietnams clothing and textile industry find that the average wage of clothing and textile workers in vietnam is less than the average wage for other vietnamese manufacturing workers94 however it is argued that lower wages in the clothing and textile industries are not unusual in other nations including the united states 89 government ends support for textile and garment industry thanh nien news june 14 2006

data for the global clothing industry in 2008 reportedly indicates general rise in labor costs in part due to the weakening of the us dollar96 according to the study vietnams hourly wage rates are below those of china and much of central america but above those of bangladesh cambodia and pakistan other sources indicate that vietnams high rate of inflation 194 yearonyear in march 2008 is driving up the cost of labor and raw materials and hurting vietnams exports97 the vietnam general labor union reported over 300 worker strikes during the first four months of 2008 generally over low wages and the effects of inflation98 the state bank of vietnam sbv is apparently unsure how to respond to the combined effects of inflation and the weakening us dollar because most export contracts are denominated in us dollars the dollars decline in value has cut into vietnamese manufacturers profit margins at the same time rising labor and raw material costs are undermining profits from the opposite direction if the sbv devalues the vietnamese dong it may help exporters but exacerbate domestic inflation if the sbv revalues the dong it might reduce inflation but might potentially drive many exporters out of business for the first six months of 2008 the dong had depreciated in value by over 3 against the us dollar global competition another important aspect of vietnams clothing industry is the nature of its participation in the competitive global clothing market according to professor gary gereffi the global clothing market is prime example of buyerdriven commodity chain in which the large retailers marketers and branded manufacturers play the pivotal roles in setting up decentralized production networks99 in the analysis of gereffi and others buyerdriven commodity chains are characterized by highly competitive decentralized manufacturing frequently involving multiple countries in addition gereffi and other scholars maintain that the retailers marketers and branded manufacturers secure control over the actual clothing manufacturers and the 95 see khalid nadvi and john thoburn challenges to vietnamese firms in the world garment and textile value chain and

names as result most of the profits in the clothing industry flows to the retailers marketers and branded manufacturers this analysis is based on commodity chain approach that examines the production flow of clothing from raw materials to retail sale see table 5 in general the major retailers control both the design and the marketing of the final clothing items the wholesalers and exporters typically contract with the major retailers to source the clothing items from network of manufacturers who in turn subcontract the textile companies to provide the materials needed to produce the clothes the textile companies similarly purchase the raw materials they need from suppliers of either natural or synthetic fibers in general this production chain is initiated by the decision of the retailers to procure clothing vietnams clothing industry is by and large restricted to the center of this commodity chain competing for contracts to produce some of the more competitive types of clothing such as womens clothing and cotton clothing this market segment is often characterized by what some analysts call triangle manufacturing100 table 5 the clothing commodity chain wholesalers raw material textile clothing and retailers suppliers companies manufacturers exporters natural cotton wool thread fibers silk hemp yarn fabric cutting labeling marketing oil polymers assembly packaging synthetic sales natural gas synthetic finishing shipping fibers fibers cloth source modified from gary gereffi 2002 see footnote 98 triangle manufacturing triangle manufacturing typically involves three key parties retailer sourcing company and manufacturer the retailer contracts the sourcing company to procure clothing according to very detailed specifications the sourcing company usually subcontracts the manufacturing of the clothing items to network of clothing manufacturers that it knows trusts and monitors the clothing manufacturers produce the clothing items and then ship the products directly to the retailers once the clothing shipments are received and pass inspection the retailer pays the sourcing company who then pays the manufacturers within the confines of triangle manufacturing there is also pattern of progression for the clothing manufacturers at first the manufacturers tend to operate under cutmaketrim cmt arrangement with the sourcing company where the manufacturer is provided all the materials for the production of the clothing item and only assembles the final product later on the manufacturer may advance into an original equipment manufacturing oem arrangement in which the sourcing company or the major retailer provides the manufacturer with the 100 see byoungho jin apparel industry in east asian new industrialized countries journal of fashion marketing and management vol 8 2 2004 pp 230244 crs31 product design and it is up to the manufacturer to purchase the necessary materials to make the clothing items in some cases clothing manufacturers have been able to expand their activities further out in the commodity chain and undertake original brandname manufacturing in which they may design the clothes to be sold either under their own brand name or under the brand name of major retailer because the sourcing company usually has significant number of manufacturers able to supply the clothing items competition for the subcontracts tends to be keen and the manufacturers are often pushed to lower their prices and speed up their production in order to win the contract in vietnam the stateowned companies and the foreigninvested companies are generally considered better able to compete for triangle manufacturing contracts than the smaller private vietnamese enterprises because they are larger in size and have easier access to operating capital to improve the overall profitability of vietnams clothing industry and reduce its dependency on the major retailers and marketers the vietnamese government is attempting to follow in the footsteps of hong kong singapore south korea and taiwan the four asian dragons were able to transform their manufacturing sectors in response to highly competitive global market conditions in various ways in the clothing industry hong kong south korea and taiwan not only diversified their manufacturing throughout asia including china but also have moved up and down the clothing commodity chain into clothing design up chain and brand name development down chain under the decision 55 the vietnamese government apparently had decided to focus its efforts on up chain development by increasing investments into its domestic textile industry and its production of raw materials used in the clothing industry however with the revocation of decision 55 the focus seems to have shifted to down chain development growth in vietnams clothing exports vietnams exports of clothing have experienced rapid growth over the last 12 years but this expansion has largely been in line with the overall increase in vietnams total exports what has changed is the mix of vietnams major markets for its clothing exports with the rapid rise in the importance of the us market over the last few years overall growth over the last decade vietnams textile and clothing exports have increased over fivefold according to its general statistics office see table 6 in 1997 vietnams exports of textiles and clothing were worth 15 billion and contributed 141 of the nations total export earnings101 in 2002 textile and clothing exports reached 273 billion and 179 of total export value since then while the value of textile and clothing exports have continued to rise their share of total exports has 101 the general statistics office of vietnam does not report textile and clothing exports

relations ntr status in december 2001 apparently led to dramatic shift in the structure of vietnams clothing exports see table 7102 in 2001 vietnams leading export markets for its clothing were japan and the 27 members of the european union or eu27103 vietnams combined clothing exports to japan and the eu27 amounted to over two thirds of its clothing exports in 2001 by contrast vietnam shipped 26 of its clothing exports to the united states in 2001 102 data for 2006 and 2007 not currently available 103 among the eu27 members the top two markets were germany and the united kingdom crs33 table 7

united states jumped to nearly 1 billion in 2002 readily surpassing exports to both japan and the eu27 which declined slightly from the previous year as result the united states became vietnams largest clothing export market in 2002 the sharp rise in clothing exports to the united states continued into 2003 when over half of vietnams clothing exports were sent to the united states while exports to japan and the eu27 continued to decline the decline in exports to japan and the eu27 ended in 2004 with slight rebound in clothing sales to japan and larger rise in exports to the eu27 meanwhile growth in clothing exports to the united states were possibly curbed in part due to the imposition of quotas by the united states however those protective measures were not sufficient to stop the advance in the us share of vietnams clothing exports in 2004 nearly 6 of out of every 10 of clothing exports from vietnam went to the united states in 2005 vietnamese clothing exports to the united states increased by just over 147 million however exports to japan and the eu27 increased by combined total of more than 247 million as consequence there was small decline in the us share of vietnams clothing exports in 2005 and corresponding slight rise for both japan and eu27 although 2006 and 2007 trade figures were not available for this report there are indications that the modest shift away from the united states and back towards japan and the eu27 continued because of its concerns about the possible continuation of protective measures by the united states as part of vietnams wto accession agreement the vietnamese government has allegedly encouraged its clothing companies to export to japan and the eu27104 in addition the continued weakening of the us dollar and the slowdown in the us economy has made japan and the eu27 more attractive market 104 based on confidential interviews with sources involved in usvietnamese clothing trade crs34 vietnams role in the us clothing market over the last five years there has been marked increase in us clothing imports from vietnam despite repeated changes in us trade policy towards vietnam including the conferral of normal trade relations the imposition of import quotas for selected clothing items and compliance with vietnams wto accession there has been steady growth in vietnams clothing exports to the united states and with it rise in vietnams overall market share in the united states however vietnam remains comparatively modest supplier of us clothing imports even in the market segments where vietnam is among the top three suppliers to the united states its portion of import supply with few exceptions remains below 10 overall market share the recent rapid growth in us clothing imports from vietnam should be considered in the context of the overall growth of us clothing imports and in comparison with other major suppliers such as china and mexico as shown in figure 2 the increase in us clothing imports from vietnam since 2001 is relatively small when compared to the overall increase in us clothing imports as well as to the rise in clothing imports from china in 2006 the united states imported 734 billion of clothing of which 199 billion were from china 54 billion were from mexico and 32 billion were from vietnam however the rise in vietnamese clothing imports over the last five years does roughly correspond to the decline in imports from mexico figure 2 us clothing imports from top suppliers 20012006 in us billions 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007

the second largest clothing supplier to the united states mexico saw its share decline from 137 to 61 between 2001 and 2007 in 2001 vietnam was not among the top 25 suppliers of clothing imports to the united states following the passage of normal trade relations vietnam was the 20th largest source of us clothing imports in 2002 in 2003 vietnam jumped to 5th in the list of leading clothing suppliers for the united states however following the imposition of import quotas vietnams ranking dropped to 7th in 2005 only to rebound to 5th in 2006 and then 3rd in 2007 behind in order china and mexico top clothing imports while vietnam may be only the 5th largest overall supplier of clothing imports for the united states with share of 43 it is possible that it may be dominant supplier of select categories of clothing however an examination of us import data at the fourdigit level of the hts code does not find evidence of submarket dominance by vietnam even in the few categories where it is among the top three sources for us imports vietnam rarely provides more than 10 of the total imports for chapter 61 of the hts code which includes articles of apparel and clothing accessories knitted or crocheted there were six subcategories at the four digit level in which vietnam was one of the top three suppliers in 2006 see table 8 for chapter 62 articles of apparel and clothing

hs 6106 significantly overlaps with the clothing categories being monitored by the docs monitoring program for most of the categories being monitored vietnam was generally not among the top 10 suppliers for the united states andor vietnams market share was below 3 two exceptions in chapter 61 were mens and boys knitted or crocheted shirts where vietnam ranked 5th and provided 62 of the imports and mens and boys knitted or crocheted sweaters where vietnam ranked 7th and provided 39 of the imports also the main competitors to vietnam in the us clothing import market are not generally the dominican republiccentral america free trade agreement drcafta nations but china and other asian nations for the 11 submarkets listed in table 8 guatemala honduras and mexico are the only american nations that appear among the top five suppliers for the united states and in only three of those submarkets105 this provides some support for the view that limiting clothing imports from vietnam would probably result in production being shifted to other asian sources rather than to manufacturers in the united states or elsewhere in the americas recent trends in us clothing production recent trends in the gross output of the us clothing industry provide an ambiguous picture of the possible effect of the recent rise in clothing imports from vietnam see figure 3 between 1997 to 2004 there was general decline in the value of us clothing production that corresponded with the period of most rapid growth in the clothing imports from vietnam in 2005 us clothing production rose slightly at the same time that the growth in clothing imports from vietnam slowed down both of these trends were generally consistent with the argument that clothing imports from vietnam were displacing clothing manufactured in the united states 105 mexico and guatemala for hs 6114 mexico and honduras for hs 6210 and honduras for hs 6216 crs37 figure 3 gross output of us clothing industry and us imports of

economic analysis us department of commerce global trade atlas however there are aspects of the recent trade trends that raise doubts about causal link between the rise in clothing imports from vietnam taken alone and the decline in us clothing production first the decline in us production predates the end of the us trade embargo on vietnam indicating that other factors may be involved second the decline in us production between 2000 and 2004 over 30 billion is nearly 13 times the size of the increase in clothing imports from vietnam during the same time period another possible indication that other factors may be responsible for the decline in us clothing production third both us clothing production and clothing imports from vietnam rose in 2005 which is contrary to the relationship expected if clothing imports from vietnam were causing decline in us production finally because its has been relatively short period of time since vietnam has been allowed to export clothing to the united states it is difficult to demonstrate any reliable trends or conduct time series analysis that will provide statistically significant results implications for congress the completion of the two reviews by the department of commerce of its monitoring program provided little resolution or clarity to number of questions raised about the authority and the necessity of establishing such monitoring program the doc press releases appear to have been carefully worded to avoid flat denial that there was evidence of dumping by vietnam while simultaneously providing possible grounds for the continuation of the monitoring of selected vietnamese clothing imports in addition there is sufficient ambiguity in the language of the press releases to allow the doc to amend or alter the categories of vietnamese clothing imports it monitors if it chooses to do so crs38 one possible response for congress is to take action given that the doc is monitoring trade flows and has so far determined that there is insufficient evidence to initiate an antidumping investigation it would appear that clothing imports from vietnam are generally in compliance with current us laws and regulations if congress were to consider taken some action on this issue there are several aspects of the current status of usvietnamese trade relations for clothing that might be examined first the department of commerce has not publicly responded to requests from some members of congress the vietnamese government and some major us clothing importers for the legal basis for establishing the monitoring program the federal register announcement of the creation of the monitoring program did not include the usual federal law citation establishing the authority to create the program congress could act to revisit the question of docs legal authority for establishing the monitoring program second there was concern by several members of congress that the current us trade policy towards vietnams clothing imports may violate both the spirit and the letter of the us commitments to other wto members as such congress might act to review the monitoring program to decide whether or not it violates existing wto agreements exposing the united states to the risk of formal complaint from vietnam third congress could investigate vietnams compliance with its promise to terminate all wtoprohibited subsidies to its clothing and textile industry as indicated by their submitted comments on the monitoring program some us textile manufacturers are concerned that vietnam is not living up to its promise and continues to use direct and indirect subsidies to support its clothing exports such an investigation might also include research into vietnams labor market to ascertain if the vietnamese government is suppressing the wages of clothing and textile workers below fair market values fourth possibly based in part of the results the investigation mentioned above congress could choose to pass legislation designed to counteract perceived unfair trade practices by vietnam in its export of clothing to the united states the proposed legislation might incorporate provisions that would make it easier to initiate antidumping or countervailing duty investigations in cases involving nonmarket economies such as vietnam fifth congress may decide to consider the claims of major clothing retailers and importers that the monitoring program has stunted trade with and investments in vietnam thereby possibly causing them economic harm the doc review was designed to examine trade data to determine whether or not there was sufficient evidence to selfinitiate an antidumping investigation against vietnam it did not analyze the trade data to determine if the program had distorted trade during its first six months of operation sixth congress could also investigate the administration and operation of the monitoring program to determine if it is correctly identifying the types of clothing in which there might be possible dumping by vietnam among the criteria typically considered as being necessary conditions for proof of possible dumping are below market prices and significant market share in its review of clothing imports from crs39 vietnam the doc reported rising unit prices and implied that prices were comparable to other clothing suppliers as for market share some experts assert that unless supplier provides more than 4 of the overall supply of product it cannot cause sufficient harm to substantiate dumping claims at present there are very few categories of clothing for which vietnam achieves the market threshold level finally congress might decide to authorize its own study of the monitoring program data to see if there is any evidence of dumping andor sufficient evidence to warrant the continuation of the program one criticism previously raised with the docs biannual review process was the problem of the seasonal nature of the global clothing market by assessing the monitoring program for full year congress could take into account the seasonal characteristics of the clothing market in evaluating the trade data for other
