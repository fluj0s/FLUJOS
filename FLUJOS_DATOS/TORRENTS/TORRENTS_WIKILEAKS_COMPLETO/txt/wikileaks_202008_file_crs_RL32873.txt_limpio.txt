national energy policy has been ongoing since the 107th congress both the 107th and 108th congresses were unable to complete action on an omnibus energy bill the 109th congress debated and passed hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005 which was signed by president bush august 8 2005 pl 10958 the enacted law contains various provisions involving environmental protection and regulation this report briefly summarizes and discusses the background and implications of key environmental provisions title xv of pl 10958 eliminates the reformulated gasoline rfg oxygen standard and in its place establishes renewable fuel mandate for gasoline because of related concerns over mtbe gasoline additive that competes with ethanol contamination the enacted law modifies existing authority for cleanup of leaking underground storage tanks and authorizes funding for mtbe cleanup title xvi establishes program to promote the development and deployment of lowcarbon technologies both domestically and in developing countries section 322 amends the safe drinking water act to exempt certain hydraulic fracturing techniques from epa regulation hydraulic fracturing involves the underground injection of fluids into coal beds to enhance recovery of oil gas section 323 gives permanent exemption from clean water act stormwater runoff rules for the construction of exploration and production facilities by oil and gas companies and roads that service those sites various sections in titles vii viii and xiii authorize rd funding for hydrogen fuel cells and alternative fuel vehicles or establish tax incentives for their use section 241 gives applicants for hydroelectric licenses increased flexibility in complying with conditions imposed by federal agencies these conditions can include water release controls to limit erosion and protection of habitat section 966 requires epa to work with state and local officials in western michigan to determine ozone pollution and transport and assess

2005 pl 10958 hr 6 introduction over the past several congresses there have been ongoing efforts to develop comprehensive energy legislation energy bills were debated in the 107th and 108th congresses but final agreement was not reached in either congress the debate over omnibus energy legislation hr 6 continued in the 109th congress on august 8 2005 president bush signed the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 the final version of hr 6 was enacted with some significant differences from the house and senatepassed bills in many cases the enacted law and the house and senate versions treat environmental issues in similar manner however there are several environmental provisions that were addressed by an earlier version of the bill but not the enacted law or that were treated differently by different versions of the bill the hr 6 environmental provisions addressed in this report are the following limits on the use of mtbe renewable fuel mandate for gasoline stricter regulation of underground storage tanks climate change clean water act and safe drinking water act exemptions for oil and gas exploration and production related to stormwater runoff and hydraulic fracturing incentives and rd funding for alternative fuels and vehicles hydroelectric relicensing ozone compliance deadlines streamlining of environmental regulations and renewable portfolio standard short discussion of each of the above provisions is included in this report it should be noted that not all environmentrelated provisions of hr 6 are discussed in this report it focuses on the major environmental issues in the debate mtbe and ethanol fuels title xv of the enacted law contains several provisions addressing the gasoline additives methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and ethanol under the clean air act amendments of 1990 reformulated gasoline rfg sold in many areas of the country with poor air quality was required to contain an oxygenate mtbe ethanol or other substances containing oxygen to improve combustion and reduce emissions of ozoneforming compounds and carbon monoxide little more than 30 of the gasoline sold in the united states is rfg and majority of rfg has contained mtbe mtbe has been implicated in numerous incidents of groundwater contamination however and 25 states have taken crs2 steps to ban or regulate its use the most significant of these bans in california new york and connecticut took effect at the end of 20031 the law repeals the clean air act requirement to use oxygenates in rfg eliminating key incentive for refiners to use mtbe2 the repeal will take effect on may 5 2006 270 days after enactment except in california where it took effect immediately upon enactment august 8 2005 both the house and senate versions of hr 6 would also have banned the use of mtbe in motor vehicle fuel nationwide with some exceptions in 2014 or 2009 respectively the enacted version does not contain ban however effectively leaving the matter to the states to decide individually in place of the oxygen requirement pl 10958 establishes new requirement that an increasing amount of gasoline contain renewable fuels such as ethanol the law requires that motor fuels contain at least 40 billion gallons of renewables in 2006 and requires an increase of 700 million gallons each year through 2011 before reaching level of 75 billion gallons in 2012 in 2004 about 34 billion gallons of ethanol were used in motor fuels the law also authorizes funds to clean up mtbe contamination in groundwater as discussed further in the next section below the enacted law also contains antibacksliding provisions to preserve the reductions in emissions of toxic substances achieved by the rfg program the baseline emissions are set as the quantity emitted in 2001 and 2002 the most controversial of the mtbe provisions was dropped in conference safe harbor that the house bill would have provided for fuels containing mtbe the safe harbor from liability would have meant that such fuels could not be deemed defective in design or manufacture by virtue of the fact that they contained mtbe the effect of this provision would have been to protect anyone in the product chain from manufacturers to retailers from liability for cleanup of mtbe or for personal injury or property damage based on the nature of the product defective product liability is legal approach that has been used in california to require refiners to shoulder liability for mtbe cleanup if liability for manufacturing and design defects had been ruled out plaintiffs would have needed to demonstrate negligence in the handling of such fuels to establish liability more difficult legal standard to meet the house version of the bill had set retroactive effective date of september 5 2003 for the safe harbor rather than the date of enactment this effective date would have protected oil and chemical industry defendants from 1 for more details see crs report rl32787 mtbe in gasoline clean air and drinking water issues by james mccarthy and mary tiemann and crs report rl32865 renewable fuels and mtbe comparison of selected provisions in the energy policy act of 2005 hr 6 by brent d yacobucci mary tiemann james mccarthy and aaron m flynn 2 however mtbe is not only used as an oxygenate mtbe is also used to extend gasoline stocks and to increase octane crs3 defective product claims in about 150 lawsuits that were filed in 15 states after that date3 in addition to the house bills safe harbor for mtbe producers both the house and senate versions of the bill contained safe harbor for producers of renewable fuels such as ethanol this provision was less controversial since there was pending litigation that would have been affected but it was also dropped from the enacted version this section prepared by james mccarthy specialist in environmental policy mtbe and leaking underground storage tanks as part of the legislative effort to address drinking water contamination by mtbe pl 10958 title xv subtitle b amends subtitle i of the solid waste disposal act swda to allow funds appropriated from the leaking underground storage tank lust trust fund to be used to enforce ust leak prevention regulations and authorizes appropriations from the fund specifically for remediating gasoline tank leaks involving mtbe and other oxygenated fuels including ethanol the subtitle adds several leak prevention provisions and new requirements for states epa and tank owners and makes other changes to the underground storage tank ust regulatory program to address nationwide groundwater contamination problem caused by leaking underground storage tanks congress created the ust leak prevention detection and cleanup program in 1984 solid waste disposal act subtitle i in 1986 congress established the lust trust fund to help epa and states pay the costs of cleaning up leaking petroleum usts where owners fail to do so and to oversee lust cleanup activities while much progress has been made in the program several issues remain major issue has concerned the discovery of mtbe at thousands of lust sites across the country this gasoline additive which has been used to reduce air pollution from auto emissions is very water soluble once released mtbe tends to spread further than conventional gasoline consequently these leaks are more likely to reach water supplies and are more costly to remediate4 another issue is that state resources have not met the demands of overseeing the ust regulatory program which is aimed at preventing leaks states have sought larger appropriations from the trust fund to support the lust program and some have sought flexibility to use lust funds to enforce the ust leak prevention regulations 3 for further discussion see crs report rs21676 the safe harbor provision for methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe by aaron flynn 4 june 2005 study by the american water works association concludes that reasonable best estimate of the cost of addressing mtbecontamination of public drinking water wells is roughly 25 billion with range of 4 billion to 85 billion source american water works association review of cost estimates of mtbe contamination of public wells june 21 2005 crs4 subtitle b which is based on the house bill adds several leak prevention provisions to the ust program it requires epa or states to conduct compliance inspections of usts every three years prohibits fuel delivery to ineligible tanks directs states to develop training requirements for persons responsible for operating and maintaining tanks and responding to spills clarifies and expands ust compliance requirements for federal facilities and requires epa with indian tribes to develop and implement strategy to address releases on tribal lands the subtitle further requires that when determining the portion of cleanup costs to recover from tank owner or operator epa or state must consider the owner or operators ability to pay for cleanup and still maintain basic business operations it also allows epa and states to use lust funds to conduct inspections and enforce ust release prevention and detection requirements to further protect groundwater the enacted law requires states to do one of the following 1 require that new tanks are secondarily contained and monitored for leaks if the tank is within 1000 feet of community water system or potable well or 2 require that ust manufacturers and installers maintain evidence of financial responsibility to pay for corrective actions and require that persons installing ust systems are certified or licensed or that their ust system installation is certified by professional engineer or inspected and approved by the state or is compliant with code of practice or other method that is less protective of human health and the environment this subtitle authorizes appropriations from the lust trust fund for each of fy2005 through fy2009 of 200 million for cleaning up leaks from petroleum tanks generally and another 200 million for responding to tank leaks involving mtbe or other oxygenated fuel additives eg ethanol it also authorizes to be appropriated from the trust fund for each of fy2005 through fy2009 155 million for epa and states to administer the lust cleanup program and to enforce the ust leak prevention requirements from general revenues it authorizes 50 million to be appropriated for each of fy2005 through fy2009 for epa and states to administer the remainder of subtitle i this section prepared by mary tiemann specialist in environmental policy5 climate change title xvi of pl 10958 establishes voluntary national program designed to accelerate demonstration and deployment of lesscarbonintensive technology to encourage voluntary reductions in greenhouse gases the sections of this title attempt to support actions focused on reducing us carbon intensity the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product the enacted law does not establish requirement to reduce emissions this title also establishes program 5 for more information on the lust program see crs report rs21201 leaking underground storage tanks program status and issues by mary tiemann for discussion of mtbe issues see crs report rl32787 mtbe in gasoline clean air and drinking water issues by james mccarthy and mary tiemann crs5 to encourage exports of carbon intensityreducing technologies to developing countries title xvi contains provisions similar to those added to the bill on the senate floor by amendments that incorporated language found in s 883 and s 887 the house bill did not expressly address climate change issues included in the senate bill but dropped in conference was sense of the senate resolution that human activities are substantial cause of greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere causing average temperatures to rise further the resolution stated that congress should enact comprehensive and effective national program of mandatory marketbased limits and incentives on emissions of greenhouse gases that slow stop and reverse the growth of such emissions at rate and in manner that 1 will not significantly harm the united states economy and 2 will encourage comparable action by other nations that are major trading partners and key contributors to global emissions this is the first sense of the senate resolution on climate change since sres 98 was passed in 1997 which voiced concern over the economic effects of emissions limits and the sense that developing countries must participate in meaningful action to control emissions the senate also debated whether to adopt samdt 826 which contained language similar to s 1151 the climate stewardship and innovation act of 2005 this amendment would have established mandatory capandtrade system to limit greenhouse gas emissions from covered entities to year 2000 levels by 2010 this amendment was rejected on 3860 vote greenhouse gas emissions and climate change have been an issue of congressional interest for over two decades in 1993 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized countries to take the lead in making voluntary efforts to reduce greenhouse gases subsequently variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states including monitoring of utility carbon dioxide emissions improved appliance efficiency and incentives for developing renewable energy sources many of these policies were enacted as part of the energy policy act of 1992 however debate over the causes and effects of climate change as well as the potential costs of any greenhouse gas reduction strategy curtailed legislative action concerning the issue in 2001 president george w bush rejected the kyoto protocol to the unfccc which called for legally binding commitments by developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions instead the bush administration has focused on voluntary actions to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the us economy this section prepared by brent yacobucci specialist in energy policy oil and gas exploration and production clean water section 323 of pl 10958 gives permanent exemption from clean water act cwa stormwater runoff rules for the construction of exploration and production facilities by oil and gas companies and the roads that service those sites currently crs6 under the cwa the operation of facilities involved in oil and gas exploration production processing transmission or treatment generally is exempt from stormwater runoff regulations so long as the runoff is uncontaminated by pollutants but the construction of these facilities is not section 323 modifies the cwa to specifically include construction activities in the types of oil and gas facilities that are covered by the laws statutory exemption from stormwater rules the issue arises from stormwater permitting rules for small construction sites and municipal separate storm sewer systems that were issued by epa in 1999 and became effective march 10 2003 those rules known as phase ii of the cwa stormwater program require most small construction sites disturbing one to five acres and municipal separate storm sewer systems serving populations of up to 100000 people to have cwa discharge permit the permits require pollution prevention plans describing practices for curbing sediment and other pollutants from being washed by stormwater runoff into local water bodies phase i of the stormwater program required construction sites larger than five acres including oil and gas facilities and larger municipal separate storm sewer systems to obtain discharge permits beginning in 1991 as the march 2003 phase ii compliance deadline approached epa authorized twoyear extension of the rules for small oil and gas construction sites to allow the agency to assess the economic impact on that industry epa had initially assumed that most oil and gas facilities would be smaller than one acre in size and thus excluded from the phase ii rules but newer data developed for the department of energy indicate that up to 30000 new sites per year would be of sizes subject to the rules6 in february 2005 report gao reported that the actual number of oil and gas construction activities that could be affected is uncertain and the financial and environmental implications including additional environmental protections are difficult to quantify7 in march 2005 epa extended the exemption until june 2006 and said it would propose specific rule for small oil and gas construction sites by september 2005 and issue final rule in june 2006 section 323 of the law makes epas regulatory delay permanent and makes it applicable to construction activities at all oil and gas development and production sites regardless of size including those covered by phase i rules industry had argued that the stormwater rule creates timeconsuming permitting requirements even though the short construction period for drilling sites carries little potential for stormwater runoff pollution supporters said the amendment was intended to clarify existing cwa language opponents argued that there is evidence that construction at oil and gas sites causes less pollution than other construction activities which are regulated under epas stormwater program the legislative provision originated in housepassed hr 6 the senate bill did not include similar 6 memorandum from advanced resources international inc to us department of energyoffice of fossil energy estimated economic impacts of proposed storm water discharge requirements on the oil and natural gas industry december 7 2004 7 us general accountability office storm water pollution information needed on the implications of permitting oil and gas construction activities gao05240 february 2005 27 p crs7 language as result of the provision in the enacted law which is intended to exempt from the cwa all uncontaminated stormwater discharges that occur while setting up drilling operations epa is expected to modify the rule that it said would be proposed in september 2005 developing new rule for discharges of contaminated stormwater from oil and gas operations this section prepared by claudia copeland specialist in resources and environmental policy hydraulic fracturing drinking water regulation section 322 of pl 10958 amends the safe drinking water act sdwa section 1421d to specify that the definition of underground injection excludes the injection of fluids or propping agents other than diesel fuels used in hydraulic fracturing operations related to oil gas or geothermal production activities this language prevents epa from regulating the underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing purposes thus removing epas existing authority to do so under sdwa as needed to protect sources of drinking water it also would effectively overturn two court rulings the provision is based on the house bill conferees added the references to diesel fuel and geothermal production activities the senate bill contained similar provision8 the sdwa requires controls on the underground injection of fluids to protect underground sources of drinking water epa had not considered hydraulic fracturing to fall within the regulatory definition of underground injection until 1997 when the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit ruled that the hydraulic fracturing of coal beds for methane production constitutes underground injection and must be regulated this decision applied only to alabama leaf v epa 118 f 3d 14679 while the practice of hydraulic fracturing has been used in the recovery of conventional oil and gas since the 1950s this practice has been applied for recovery 8 the senate version of hr 6 in the 108th congress had called for epa to prepare study of the known and potential effects of hydraulic fracturing on underground sources of drinking water and for the national academy of sciences to provide for an independent review of the study as passed in the 109th congress pl 10958 section 1811 calls for the national academy of sciences to conduct study on the effect of coalbed natural gas production on surface and ground water resources including drinking water in montana wyoming colorado new mexico north dakota and utah 9 in 2000 second suit was filed against epa for approving alabamas revised uic program when it contained several alleged deficiencies legal environmental assistance foundation inc v us epa 276 f3d 1253 11th cir 2001 the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit directed epa to require alabama to regulate hydraulic fracturing under sdwa the court determined that epa could regulate hydraulic fracturing under sdwas more flexible state oil and gas provisions in section 1425 rather than the more stringent underground injection control requirements of section 1422 crs8 of coalbed methane primarily since the mid1990s10 hydraulic fracturing involves the highpressure injection of fluids into coal beds to enhance the recovery of oil and natural gas from underground formations waterbased fluids are used commonly as fracturing fluids but the industry reports that diesel fuel often is used also methanol and various toxic chemicals are used in fracturing fluids11 the volume of fracturing and stimulation fluids injected into each well for coalbed fracturing is estimated to range from 55000 gallons to 350000 gallons12 growing concern reported by epa is that in many coalbed methane producing regions the target coalbeds occur within usdws underground sources of drinking water and the fracturing process injects stimulation fluids directly into the usdws13 epa has determined that the use of diesel fuel as fracturing fluid introduces benzene and other toxic and carcinogenic substances directly into underground sources of drinking water14 also because the process fractures rock fracturing can create new pathways for natural gas primarily methane and other contaminants to enter drinking water aquifers as the number of coalbed methane cbm wells and the use of hydraulic fracturing have increased rapidly in recent years so has concern over the potential impact on water resources particularly in the waterscarce west and very few studies have been done to evaluate these impacts in january 2003 epas national drinking water advisory council established by congress under sdwa submitted to the epa administrator report on hydraulic fracturing underground injection control and coalbed methane production and its impacts on water quality and water resources the council noted several concerns including the use of diesel fuel and toxic additives in the hydraulic fracturing process 10 demand for natural gas new technologies federal tax credits and the identification of shallow coal formations have led to dramatic growth in the coalbed methane development industry for example the us geological survey reports that the number of cbm wells in the powder river basin in wyoming and montana increased from 110 wells in may 1994 to 5446 wells in may 2001 testimony of dr gene whitney supervisory geologist us geological survey before the committee on resources subcommittee on energy and mineral resources us house of representatives hearing on the orderly development of coalbed methane resources from public lands sept 6 2001 in 2002 the bureau of land management estimated that another 51000 wells were planned for wyoming and 25000 wells were planned for montana 11 environmental protection agency evaluation of impacts to underground sources of drinking water by hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane reservoirs washington dc june 2004 pp 43 44 12 ibid p 311 13 ibid pp 16 according to epa hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas found in conventional geologic traps is well established however hydraulic fracturing of coal beds is relatively new conventional sites are usually more than 1000 feet deep and typically involve highly saline ground water that is unsuitable for drinking water in contrast geologic formations that contain coal bed methane can be near the surface where ground water may be used as source of drinking water supplies 14 ibid pp 49 410 crs9 and the potential impact of coalbed methane development on local underground water resources and on the quality of surface waters15 the advisory council recommended that epa work through regulatory or voluntary means to eliminate the use of diesel fuel and related additives in fracturing fluids that are injected into formations containing sources of drinking water in 2003 epa entered into an agreement with three companies that provide most hydraulic fracturing services bj services halliburton energy services and schlumberger technology corporation16 under this voluntary agreement the firms conditionally agree to remove diesel fuel from cbm fluids injected directly into drinking water sources if costeffective alternatives are available epa has not sought to limit other toxic components in fracturing fluids and other companies did not agree to cease injecting diesel fuel into drinking water sources the national drinking water advisory council further recommended that epa continue to study the extent and nature of public health and environmental problems that could occur as result of hydraulic fracturing for coalbed methane production and defend its authority to implement the uic program in manner that protects groundwater resources from contamination however oil and gas industry representatives argue that regulation is unneeded and would slow natural gas development in response to the 1997 court decision and citizen complaints about water contamination attributed to hydraulic fracturing epa began to study the impacts of hydraulic fracturing practices used in cbm production on drinking water sources and to determine whether further regulation was needed in 2002 epa issued draft report that identified alleged water quality and quantity problems attributed to hydraulic fracturing in alabama new mexico colorado wyoming montana virginia and west virginia17 based on the preliminary results of the study epa tentatively concluded that the potential threats to public health posed by hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane wells appeared to be small in 2004 epa issued final report based primarily on review of the available literature and concluded that the injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids into cbm wells poses little threat to underground sources of drinking water and requires further study however epa noted that very little documented research has been 15 national drinking water advisory

of injection was beyond the scope of its study19 the report has been criticized by some including epa professional staff and the epa inspector general has been asked to review whistleblowers assertions that epas findings are scientifically unfounded20 for more information see crs report rl32262 selected legal and policy issues related to coalbed methane development by aaron m flynn this

information see crs issue brief ib10128 alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles issues in congress crs11 hydroelectric power relicensing section 241 of pl 10958 will give applicants for hydroelectric licenses increased flexibility in complying with conditions imposed by federal agencies currently the federal power act 16 usc section 791 et gives certain federal agencies conditioning agencies the authority to attach conditions to federal energy regulatory commission ferc licenses for example federal agencies may require applicants to build passageways through which fish can travel around the dam schedule periodic water releases for recreation release minimum flows of water for fish migration control water release rates to reduce erosion or limit reservoir fluctuations to protect the reservoirs shoreline habitat once an agency issues such conditions ferc must include them in its license while these conditions often generate environmental or recreational benefits they may also require construction expenditures and may increase power generation costs by reducing operational flexibility the enacted law allows entities to propose alternative license conditions and will require federal agencies to consider the alternatives proposed by license applicants and other parties to the license proceeding the law also requires an agency to accept proposed alternative if it finds that the alternative 1 provides for the adequate protection and utilization of the federal reservation or is less protective of the fish resource than the fishway initially prescribed and 2 costs significantly less to implement than the original condition andor will improve operation of the project for electricity production agencies that are issuing conditions will also be required to provide ferc with written statement demonstrating that the relevant secretary gave equal consideration to the effects of the conditions on factors such as energy supply flood control navigation water supply and air quality it remains to be seen how this equal consideration clause will affect agencies resources and whether it will alter their responsibilities concerning the resources under their jurisdiction this section prepared by kyna powers analyst in energy and environmental policy small hydroelectric power alaska pl 10958 amends the conditions pursuant to which the state of alaska may regulate its small hydroelectric dams under current law 16 usc section 823c alaskas regulatory program must meet certain conditions for ferc to grant it jurisdiction for example the program must require conditions for the protection mitigation and enhancement of fish and wildlife based on recommendation received pursuant to the fish and wildlife coordination act 16 usc section 823c a3c under pl 10958 the state of alaska may decide against issuing such conditions if it finds that the recommendation will not allow it to 1 protect the public interest multiple purposes and the environment to the same extent provided through ferc licensing and regulation or 2 give equal consideration to the purposes of energy conservation fish and wildlife recreation the interests of alaska natives and other beneficial public uses ie irrigation flood control water supply and navigation crs12 pursuant to november 2000 amendment to the federal power act 16 usc 823c the state of alaska is finalizing regulations to the states small hydroelectric dams this section prepared by kyna powers analyst in energy and environmental policy air quality ozone nonattainment area deadlines section 1443 of the house version of hr 6 would have amended the clean air act to extend deadlines for areas that have not attained the ozone air quality standard if upwind areas significantly contribute to their nonattainment under the 1990 clean air act amendments ozone nonattainment areas with higher concentrations of the pollutant were given more time to reach attainment but in return for the additional time they were required to implement more stringent controls on emissions failure to reach attainment by the specified deadline was to result in reclassification of an area to higher category and the imposition of more stringent controls section 1443 would have amended this system to extend deadlines without requiring more stringent controls in areas affected by upwind sources of pollution there was comparable provision in the senate bill and the conferees did not include the house provision in the enacted law the enacted version does establish demonstration project however to address the issue of upwind pollution in section 996 the enacted law requires epa to work with state and local officials in multicounty western michigan project area to determine the extent of ozone and ozone precursor transport to assess alternatives to achieve compliance with the 8hour ozone standard apart from local controls and to determine the timeframe in which such compliance could take place western michigan is believed to be affected by pollution originating in the chicago and milwaukee metropolitan areas epa is prohibited from imposing requirements or sanctions that might otherwise apply during the demonstration project this section prepared by james mccarthy specialist in environmental policy22 streamlining environmental requirements pl 10958 includes variety of provisions applicable to several categories of energy projects that are intended to expedite the process for completing or complying with environmental requirements commonly referred to as streamlining these provisions are most often specified for complex federal actions such as oil and gas development projects that may trigger compliance with literally 22 for more information see crs report rs21611 ozone and particulate air quality should deadlines for attainment be extended crs13 dozens of federal state tribal and local environmental statutory and regulatory requirements such projects in turn may require the participation or input of possibly dozens of agencies proponents of streamlining provisions indicate that they are intended to better coordinate the interagency consultations necessary to complete applicable environmental requirements the environmental streamlining provisions in the enacted law primarily specify procedures intended to expedite the process for obtaining federal authorizations eg permits special use authorizations or approvals or to comply with the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa pl 91190 federal authorizations for given category of energy projects may be required under any of number of local state tribal or federal requirements eg permitting requirements under the clean air act or the clean water act some element of nepa compliance is required of all federal actions potentially impacting the environment nepa requires federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their proposed actions before final decisions are made for proposed federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the environment nepa requires federal agencies to provide detailed statement of environmental impacts referred to as an environmental impact statement eis projects for which it is not initially clear whether impacts will be significant require the preparation of an environmental assessment ea to determine the level of significance of the actions impacts projects that do not individually or cumulatively have significant social economic or environmental effect and have been determined from past experience to have significant impact are categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare and eis or an ea streamlining provisions regarding nepa often propose legislative or administrative procedures intended to expedite the process for completing the necessary nepa documentation methods of expediting federal authorizations or nepa compliance include designating specific agency eg the department of energy or the federal energy regulatory commission as the lead agency to coordinate applicable federal authorizations specifying procedures to coordinate interagency consultations often accomplished through the creation of memorandum of understanding between agencies specifying project milestones and deadlines andor designating specific types of projects that will be considered categorical exclusions some members of congress have argued that streamlining provisions in pl 10958 are needed to reduce delays and more efficiently facilitate delivery of needed projects others members have argued that they are unnecessary or may undercut needed environmental protection categories of projects or actions for which environmental streamlining provisions are provided include coordination of geothermal

forest system lands that will be presumed to be categorical exclusions under nepa those activities if conducted pursuant to the mineral leasing act for the exploration or development of oil or gas are individual surface disturbances of less than 5 acres as long as the total surface disturbance on the lease is not greater than 150 acres and sitespecific analysis in document prepared pursuant to nepa has been previously completed drilling an oil or gas well at location or well pad site at which drilling has occurred previously within 5 years prior to the date of spudding the well drilling an oil or gas well within developed field for which an approved land use plan or any environmental document prepared pursuant to nepa analyzed such drilling as reasonably foreseeable activity if that plan or document was approved within the previous five years placement of pipeline in an approved rightofway corridor as long as the corridor was approved within the previous five years and maintenance of minor activity other than any construction or major renovation or building or facility this section prepared by linda luther analyst in environmental policy crs15 key environmental provisions not included in pl 10958 oil exploration in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr one major element of the energy debate in the 109th congress has been whether to approve energy development in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr in northeastern alaska and if so under what conditions or whether to continue to prohibit development to protect the areas biological subsistence and recreational resources current law forbids energy leasing in the refuge as passed by the house hr 6 would have opened anwr including native lands to energy leasing specified environmental lease stipulations modified existing law to allocate 50 of revenues to the federal government rather than 10 as specified in the alaska statehood act limited judicial review and requirements under the national environmental policy act and limited certain features of federal leasing development to more than 2000 acres the senate version of hr 6 had anwr development provisions in the end the enacted law dropped the anwr development provisions although the matter is likely to recur in the debate over reconciliation for the fy2006 budget23 this section prepared by m lynne corn specialist in natural resources24 renewable portfolio standard the senate version of hr 6 contained renewable energy portfolio standard rps there was rps in the house version and the senate provision was dropped in conference description of the senate provision follows for retail electricity suppliers renewable portfolio standard rps sets minimum requirement often percentage for electricity production from renewable energy resources or for the purchase of tradable credits that represent an equivalent amount of production in the markup of hr 1640 which was incorporated into hr 6 by the house committee on energy and commerce an amendment to add an rps 23 the budget resolution hconres 95 hrept 10962 as approved by the house and senate on april 28 2005 contained reductions in mandatory spending targets of 24 billion over fy2006 to fy2010 for house resources and senate energy committees that will be difficult to achieve unless anwr development legislation is passed the inclusion of the senate target particularly sets the stage for including anwr development legislation in reconciliation bill since other approaches would face threatened filibuster in the senate see crs issue brief ib10136 arctic

wildlife refuge anwr crs16 1 in 2008 increasing by 1 annually and reaching 20 in 2027 was rejected proponents noted growing number of states with an rps and noted that eia reports show an rps could reduce electricity bills opponents raised concerns about the exclusion of existing hydropower facilities and renewable energy resource limits for the southeastern united states the senatepassed version of hr 6 had an rps in section 29125 it set an initial target of 25 in 2008 rising in steps to 10 by 2020 and remaining at 10 through 2030 multiplying 10 times the energy information administrations eias projected total generation for 2020 yields an estimate of renewable energy peak generation slightly greater than 500 billion kilowatthours kwh further eia projects that the renewable energy stimulated by 10 rps would mostly displace natural gas but also some coal with cumulative 2005 through 2025 value of saved energy projected at about 5 billion26 production from hydropower and municipal solid waste facilities would have been excluded from the base amount used to calculate the annual target existing renewable energy was defined as electricity produced from facilities already placed in service that use solar wind geothermal ocean or biomass open and closed loop resources only new renewable energy would have been eligible to satisfy the target it would have been defined as electricity produced from facilities placed in service after the rps is enacted that use solar wind geothermal ocean or biomass open and closed loop landfill gas or incremental hydropower resources further for existing facilities any incremental production above the previous threeyear average would also have qualified27 double value would have been given to production from facilities on indian land and triple value would be given to production from distributed generators that are smaller than one megawatt in capacity the retail obligation to meet the annual target could have been met through direct generation purchases of renewable energy andor purchases of tradable credits from the department of energy tradable credits would have had cost cap of 15 centskwh adjusted annually for inflation and credits for surplus generation exceeding the annual target could be carried forward for up to three years noncompliance penalty would have been imposed with value that was the greater of 15 centskwh or two times the national average market value of the tradable credits federal rps would set minimum requirement the states would have been free to set higher requirement doe collections from credit sales and penalties would have gone into an account that provided state grants to promote renewables especially in states with small share of renewable energy capacity exempt retail 25 the rps was proposed in samdt 791 which was adopted in senate floor debate over hr 6 26 us doe eia letter to senator jeff bingaman june 15 2005 p 2 27 incremental geothermal energy is
